      <P>The Saorstát-German Trade Agreement included provisions for the purchase by Germany of horses of an aggregate value to be determined by the volume of trade between the two countries but no conditions were made regarding the classes of horses to be purchased or the prices to be paid as these were regarded as matters which would be governed respectively by current German requirements and the market values obtaining in the Saorstát at the time of purchase.</P>

    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1936&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Stage of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1936. Up to the financial year beginning 1st April, 1932, relief from rates on agricultural land was allowed to occupiers in each county or district at the same rate irrespective of valuation. Whether a holding was small or large or whether it afforded employment or not made no difference, the relief was given at a flat rate and was subject to no conditions.  The new money, amounting to £250,000, which was voted in 1932 for rate relief, went to reduce the rates on the first £10 only of the poor law valuation of every holding, or on the whole valuation if it did not exceed £10.  Consequently the rate of relief on the first £10 was higher than on the remainder of the valuation by about 2/- in the £.  This difference was maintained the following year.  In the year next following, that is the year beginning 1st April, 1934, further changes were made.  The higher rate of relief was extended from the first £10 to the first £20, and provision was made at the same time for occupiers of land of more than £20 in valuation getting the higher rate of relief if they had men at work on their holdings.</P>
      <P>There was then a double differentiation, first between holders under and over £20 valuation, and then between the larger holders who gave employment to men and those who gave no such employment or employment deemed insufficient for the size of the holding.  This new system was continued last year, the only change made being that the rate of relief for larger holders who had no men or insufficient men employed was lower than in the previous year, by reason of the grant being reduced by £100,000.  The amount of the grant was £1,870,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the present Bill is first to fix the Agricultural Grant for the current year at exactly the same amount as last year, to allocate it in exactly the same proportions to the <Col N="693" /> local authorities entitled to share in it and to provide for its being applied to the relief of rates in exactly the same way.</P>
    <P>The method adopted, although it may appear complicated, is in actual practice fairly simple.  The rate of relief that was allowed in each county in the year beginning 1st April, 1933, on the first £10 valuation is taken and an allowance is given unconditionally, at that rate, on all valuations up to the £20 limit.  These allowances are called primary allowances, and absorb altogether £1,177,000 approximately, or 63 per cent. of the grant.  Then the employment allowances are granted. Early in the year each of the larger occupiers is sent a form on which he may make a claim for an employment allowance by showing the number of men, whether paid employees or relatives, whom he had at work the previous calendar year.  The allowance is calculated for each man on £12 10s. 0d. valuation at the same rate as the primary allowance.  If the occupier has not so much additional valuation as £12 10s. 0d. for each man, the allowance is calculated on the actual valuation in excess of £20.  These employment allowances cost altogether £380,000 or 20 per cent. of the grant.</P>
    <P>Deducting certain sums amounting to about £9,000 which are payable to urban authorities in respect of relief in areas that have become urbanised since 1898, there is a balance of £303,000, or about 16 per cent. of the grant, which goes to relief of rates on those valuations above £20 that do not get an employment allowance.  This third allowance is called a supplementary allowance, and is everywhere at a lower rate than the primary allowance. In most counties it approximates to one-half of the primary allowance.</P>
    <P>The working of the scheme in an area where the rates approximate to the average for the whole country can be seen if we take the South Cork area.  Last year the rate in that area for general purposes was, to the nearest penny, 10/3 in the £.  That would be the general rate to be levied off buildings and hereditaments other <Col N="694" /> than land.  Every occupier of land not exceeding £20 valuation received relief at a fraction over 6/8 in the £.  His net rate was, therefore, 3/7 approximately, and this was also the rate on the first £20 of higher valuations.  The employment allowance was, therefore, at the rate of 6/8 in the £ on £12 10s. 0d. for every man at work. When these allowances had been made, there was a balance sufficient to allow a supplementary allowance rate of 3/3 on valuations that did not rank for employment allowances, or in other words, the rate levied off such valuations was 7/- in the £, which is the difference between the gross rate of 10/3 and the supplementary rate of 3/3.  The supplementary rate is, as I have said, determined by the amount of the balance of the grant left after the prior claims on it have been met. The more employment increases the smaller it becomes.</P>
    <P>So far, then, as the present year is concerned, no change is made by this Bill.  The sum of £370,000 mentioned in Section 2 is the additional sum that must be voted over and above what will be provided under the earlier Acts in order to bring the grant up to the same amount as last year.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for allocating whatever grant may be provided next year and the year after. If there is no increase or decrease in these years the allocations will remain undisturbed.  If the grant is altered, the Executive Council will make the allocations by an Order which will be laid before the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill, it will be seen, is a measure for continuing last year's Act for another year, and leaves open the question of the amount of the grant for the two succeeding years, whilst providing for the same method of giving relief to the occupiers in those years.</P>
    <P>The new system of giving relief appears on the whole to have worked satisfactorily.  Very little in the way of complaint has reached the Department. It may be necessary to tighten up the examination of claims for employment allowances so that these allowances will go only to those for whom they are intended.  A move in that direction <Col N="695" /> has already been made this year, but next year it will be necessary to be stricter still.</P>
    <P>Finally, I may add a word as to the assessments on land.  The assessment for general charges on land in rural areas, after allowing for all Government grants, except the agricultural grant, was last year estimated at £3,618,000.  The amount of the grant, it will be seen, is more than half this sum.  The net amount leviable off land last year for general purposes was estimated at £1,750,000.  In addition to this there would be £180,000 for separate charges.  The total levy off land would therefore be under £2,000,000. The expenditure of county councils from revenue falls between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000 a year.  The greater portion of this expenditure is met out of Government grants derived from the general taxpayer and rates levied off rateable property other than land.  The levy off land now meets about one-third of the expenditure of the councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure, which is simply carrying on the legislation we have had for the past two or three years, falls far short of the promises the Government made when letting into power, far short of the derating proposals.  I should like if the Minister would tell us if he has any statistics or figures to show whether the amount allocated for employment of labour has been responsible for an increase of employment on the land. There is one other matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  His attention was drawn to it last year and the year before but, for some unknown reason, he did not think the matter was of any serious consequence.  It is the matter of the employment rate to a farmer who employs a man who has land himself valued at £5 or over.  I do not know exactly what type of mind conceived a regulation of that kind.  It is a most extraordinary thing that if A is entitled to certain reliefs for the employment of labour, he will not get that relief if he employs B, who has already got a similar relief on his own small holding of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various farmers in my <Col N="696" /> locality who constantly give employment. The people they employ are men of wide experience in farm work in looking after live stock, etc.  They are married men with families with small holdings.  If these farmers are to get the relief which the Minister thinks they ought to get they must dismiss these men and employ men who have not a holding of £5 valuation.  There is no sense in it.  If a farmer wants to get on and make his farm pay he must employ the best men.  If he has a man of experience who he knows will look after his stock and work his horses properly, must he, in order to get the relief which the Minister says he is entitled to because of giving employment, dismiss that man because he has a holding of £5 valuation?  Last year the Minister said the Executive Council did not think it would be fair that two people could get relief in respect of the same matter.  It is not the same matter at all.  They are two separate people working out their living in their own way.  There is no reason why a farmer employing a man of that type should be denied the relief to which he is otherwise entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the proposed allocation of the agricultural grant, I have to make the same remarks that I made on previous occasions. In counties like Limerick and Tipperary the distribution of this particular grant is not fair.  It does not give a fair result to different farmers. Without going into the whole principle of whether the grant should be administered according to the rates that a man pays, there are in Limerick and Tipperary peculiar circumstances, as I pointed out before to the Minister, inasmuch as there is a great employment of women labour.  It had previously been held by some Government Deputies that the employment of women labour should not be encouraged and that in many cases they were getting miserable wages. That does not apply to the dairying counties.  There are, in fact, many women employed, and in some districts a larger number of women than men, who are getting equal wages, and in many cases more wages than men.  I can point to the case of a large farmer <Col N="697" /> whose valuation is well over £150 and who owes no annuities or rates.  He employs six hands, four of whom are women.  What is his position?  He is under no obligation to the State; in fact the State is under many obligations to him.  He pays his rates and annuities punctually.  He contributes his share of the defaulting annuities of his neighbour.  He contributes a larger share in rates than most of his neighbours.  But, when the agricultural grant comes to be allocated, he gets a smaller portion of the grant than any of his neighbours.  From whatever point of view you look at it that is not equitable.</P>
      <P>I would again ask the Minister if it would not be possible on this occasion to bring in an amendment making it possible that men who employ genuine women farm workers at reasonable and satisfactory wages would be given some allowance in respect of these workers.  As I pointed out before, farmers are bound in the beginning of the year to put in a list of their workers if they are to get this relief.  If they do not put in the list, they do not get the relief.  They have, therefore, to send in a list to the county council.  It is quite possible that later on, when statisticians are looking for information about agricultural employment, the easiest way to get the information will be to apply to the different county councils who would have in each man's own handwriting particulars as to the employment he gave.  If that were done in the case of this man who had six workers four of whom were women, he would be returned as employing only two.  Apart from the injustice which he suffers owing to the way in which the grant is allocated, it might be thrown in his face in the future that in a certain year he only employed two people.  It is an important matter for dairying farmers.  I appeal to the Minister to receive my suggestion sympathetically that women workers in dairying districts should be included when making these allowances for the employment of workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett pleads for the extension of the employment grant in respect of women who <Col N="698" /> are employed at reasonable rates.  He ought to recollect the opinion that some Government officials have as to the wages that ought to be paid to women, say, in County Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Such wages never were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, it was stated from a Government Department that wages of 36/-, 35/- and 16/- were excessive to pay to men engaged in milking, as this work was usually done by women at 5/-, 6/- and 7/- per week.  Probably the official mind is that, if women can be got at these rates, there is no great necessity to assist farmers by giving them employment grants.  Deputy Bennett no doubt will be able to bring forward a case as to the wages that are paid to women.  I have no doubt that he will be able to show that the wages paid in the dairying industry in Limerick to women are higher than Government Departments seem to think women can be got for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the point I should like to raise is the effect of the employment grant.  I should like to ask the Minister whether, in dealing with the granting of relief by means of the employment grant, any examination has been made as to the effect which the granting of that has in increased employment of labour on the farms. The situation with regard to that, as disclosed by figures published some time ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is rather remarkable. It is disclosed by these figures that when we compare employment in 1935 and employment in the previous year, 1934, if we take the number of farmers' families regarded as being employed on agricultural work, the number of male persons so employed had decreased by 5,464 persons in 1935, and if we consider the number of permanent labourers employed in agriculture in 1935, the number has decreased by 1,055 persons.  So that, between the members of farmers' families alone and of permanent agricultural labourers there was a decrease in 1935 of 6,519 persons in agricultural employment as compared with 1934.  Now, if that really indicates the state of affairs that <Col N="699" /> exists we are all very much concerned. The figures that I have quoted do show a very serious state of affairs, particularly when we take into consideration the substantial increase in subsidised crops between 1934 and 1935.  The explanation suggests itself, and it is that the figures for 1934 were perhaps inflated as a result of the inducement offered of relief for employment on agricultural land.  Would the Minister say if he had any evidence to show that there was an inflation of the 1934 figures, either in respect of the members of farmers' families or of permanent agricultural labourers with a view to taking advantage of the grant, because except there is some factor like that in the situation the fall in agricultural employment, both of permanent agricultural labourers and of members of farmers' families in 1935 as compared to 1934 would otherwise be disconcerting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in last year's Act there was a stipulation whereby a person who would not be in a position to pay the first moiety of his rates would not get the benefit of the credit note, and that likewise he would be deprived of the benefit of it if he had not the second moiety paid before the end of March.  Some cases have been brought to my notice in which this regulation has caused great hardship.  Some people, because they were not able to pay the first moiety of their rates within the stipulated period, did not get the benefit of the credit notes.  Last year I was given to understand that an arrangement was come to whereby people would get the benefit of the credit notes, no matter at what date they paid their rates, provided that the rate collectors in the different districts had 75 per cent. of their collection in at the dates fixed for them.  I think it would be a very good thing if some regulation to that effect were made under this Bill.  Otherwise, ratepayers who are not able to pay their rates at the end of each specified period will be placed at a considerable disadvantage if they are deprived of the benefit of the credit notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support what Deputy Beegan has said about the credit notes.  Last year I understood from the Minister that people would be given the benefit of the credit notes even if they had not their rates paid within the specified period.  It would certainly be a great hardship on ratepayers to be deprived of the benefit of these credit notes, and, therefore, I think a little elasticity might be allowed in connection with them.  I was told last year that the local authorities had the power themselves to meet ratepayers in that respect.  I was also told by the Minister that the period within which they could claim the benefit of these credit notes could not be an indefinite one.  I agree; but at the same time I think that ratepayers should be facilitated in every possible way.  People who are prepared to pay their rates should be given reasonable facilities in the matter of meeting their obligations, and a little elasticity might be allowed as regards the availability of credit notes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Beegan and Deputy Curran, it will be within the recollection of the House that last year, and the year before, we had a very prolonged and detailed debate on the question of credit notes when dealing with the Bill similar to this one.  I remember distinctly being pressed very hard by Deputy Cosgrave and by other Deputies from both sides of the House to have the period, during which a credit note would still be available, extended.  Power was taken to enable the Minister for Local Government, on application being made to him by a county council, to extend the period to almost any date within the financial year.  The result of that has been that most county councils have decided not to use the credit note any more.  For the financial year ending on the 31st March last credit notes were extended, in some cases, up to the present month. My own view was that if the availability of the credit note was unduly extended, any good that was in the idea would go, and that has proved to be true.  This matter of credit notes is one that is entirely within the discretion <Col N="701" /> of the county councils.  They can use the credit note or not use it just as they please.  In the beginning, at any rate, the officials of some county councils and the members, too, I think, were enthusiastic about the credit note idea, but since its availability has been extended those who were most enthusiastic about it have become its strongest opponents.  The tendency of most county councils at the present time is to do away with the credit note altogether.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Mulcahy as to whether this system has increased the number of men employed as workers on land, I have not got the figures for 1935.  The figures showing the number of male workers employed on land in the calendar year 1935 are only now being supplied to the county councils.</P>

      <P>By the farmers.  I have the figures for 1933 and 1934, and they disclose something in the nature of what Deputy Mulcahy has said.  In the year 1933 the number of relatives of occupiers who were employed on land totalled 52,334, and the figure for 1934 is 52,036.  Employees, those not regarded as relatives, numbered in 1933, according to our figures, 77,219, and in 1934, 73,531.  The totals for the two years then were 129,533 in 1933 and 125,567 in 1934.  When shown those figures I asked if there was any explanation and the explanation was that in the second year there was a considerable tightening up and supervision of the checking of the returns submitted and possibly that might account for the reduction in numbers. In so far as the rate collectors and the secretaries of county councils reported, there was not much change in employment actually as far as they could discover. They thought those figures would be due to the close check.  Probably in the coming year, as the check will be still more strict, there might be a further difference disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Brennan about the giving of relief to men employed by one farmer though they themselves have holdings <Col N="702" /> valued at £5 on which they get the employment allowance and the other allowances, it appears to me that it would be reasonable to suggest that a man who had a farm of his own at that valuation could hardly be a whole-time employee on another farm and, if he is not a whole-time employee on the other farm, he could not be reckoned for a claim for the employment allowance. A farm of £5 valuation in some parts of the country would probably be one that would afford that man employment all the year round if he were to look after it properly.</P>
    <P>As regards the question raised by Deputy Bennett as to women, I suppose that would probably be a hardy annual.  I do not see any likelihood of a change under present conditions &mdash; any likelihood of a change being introduced in this Bill.  Apart from that, I think from the philosophical point of view there is a case to be made for giving preference to the employment of men and giving them decent wages. From the purely philosophical and Christian point of view, I think that would be more desirable.</P>

      <P>I say it would be better to give encouragement to the employment of men.

I think she would be, and that she would have to look after other domestic work.  How you are to make the division between what would be naturally regarded as domestic work and agricultural work would raise difficulties <Col N="703" /> that, aside from the other ones I have mentioned, it would not be easy to get over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill now before the House intends to implement the financial provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1936, by providing a further sum of £700,000 for the payment of grants to private persons and public utility societies.  The only alterations in the existing enactments proposed by this Bill are to limit to 800 square feet the maximum floor area of houses to be completed in urban areas after 31st March, 1937, and to extend to 1st April, 1938, the date for the completion of houses in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the introduction of <Col N="704" /> this Bill arises from the fact that the sum of £2,100,000 already provided has been almost fully allocated, and with the evidence at present before me of building activities it is estimated that a further £700,000 will be required to meet grants for houses which will be completed before 1st April, 1938.</P>
    <P>An examination of the position at 31st May of this year shows that 6,160 new houses have been completed by private persons and public utility societies in urban areas.  Progress in rural areas has been sustained and 7,651 houses were completed on the 31st May.  The total number of completed houses whose erection has been assisted by grants is 13,811.  The reconstruction provisions of the Acts have been availed of extensively by small farmers and agricultural labourers, and houses to the number of 5,883 have been reconstructed at this date.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated at 31st May for the erection of houses in (a) urban areas was £484,907 for the erection of 8,827 houses, (b) rural areas was £883,869 for the erection of 13,096 houses.  The amount allocated towards the reconstruction of existing houses was £638,926 for 16,616 houses, making a total of £2,007,702 for the erection and reconstruction of 38,539 houses.</P>
    <P>The House will see, therefore, that the progress made, when judged by the number of houses erected and the amount of grants allocated, has exceeded expectations.  The applications on hands at present will, it is estimated, exhaust the full sum of £2,100,000 already made available by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I find it necessary to request An Dáil to accord its approval to the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>To give Deputies a picture of the progress made by the Government I will cite the activities of local authorities since the passing of the 1932 Act.  Since then 18,034 houses have been completed, 6,863 houses are in progress, and 6,142 houses are about to be begun.  This makes a total of 31,039 houses completed, in progress, and about to be begun by local authorities. To this figure must be added <Col N="705" /> 14,558 houses included in schemes at present being prepared.  The part played by private persons and public utility societies in the solution of the housing problem should not be underestimated. These agencies off-set the housing shortage, and are very helpful in supplementing the efforts of local authorities to solve the housing problem. As the Bill which I propose for Second Reading to-day deals only with private persons and public utility societies I will not deal any further with the progress of local authorities. Suffice to say that the stage reached in the Government's housing programme by local authorities has more than justified our expectations.</P>
    <P>Under the Principal Act of 1932 houses provided by private persons and public utility societies must be completed by the 1st April, 1937.  Section 2 of the Bill now before you proposes to extend to the 1st April, 1938, the date of completion of houses by private persons and public utility societies in rural areas, the reconstruction of existing houses in rural areas and the erection of houses for letting at approved rents in urban areas.  The necessity for the extension of the date of completion arises from the fact that new applications are reaching my Department in such volume as to indicate that housing operations will continue beyond 1st April, 1937.  As I already stated in this House, the Government is prepared to sponsor legislation for the provision of money for housing until such time as the housing demand is satisfied.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (b) of the Bill proposes the insertion of a new paragraph at the end of sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Act of 1933.  The present grant available for a new house of floor area not exceeding 1,250 square feet in an urban area is £45.  The effect of the insertion of this additional paragraph is to limit the floor area of any house in an urban area commenced on or after 1st July, 1936, and completed after 31st March next, to 800 square feet.  The amount of the grant (£45) remains unaltered.  Deputies will remember that in the Second Stage of the previous amending Bill&mdash;the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1933&mdash;I stated that I was <Col N="706" /> satisfied that in urban areas assistance could be withdrawn or, at any rate, considerably modified as regards the size of houses which should qualify for subsidy.  I have given the question careful consideration, and, in view of the persisting housing demand and the volume of applications, I have thought it best to meet the situation by restricting the floor area of the houses to 800 square feet.  This new provision, it is hoped, will induce speculative builders to engage in the production of a house suitable to the needs and means of the average family. Such a house would be similar to a substantial five-roomed corporation type with bathroom, etc., such as may be seen in Dublin to-day at Marino and Croydon Park.  The existing provisions regarding the partial remission of rates for a period of seven years will remain unchanged.  In conclusion, I ask for the co-operation of all parties in giving effect to this measure to ensure the continuance of the housing programme initiated by the Government in 1932.  Truly a nation will be what its homes make it, and, until such time as the housing problem ceases to trouble our national conscience, I will not refrain from appealing to you for support in my efforts to deal with the present housing shortage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The precedent established in regard to these Housing Bills has been to permit a certain latitude in discussion, with a view to viewing the housing problem as a whole as each of these Bills came along to amend or develop the housing code.  I think it is right, when the Minister comes before the House to introduce a Bill which envisages a further expenditure of money on housing, to remind the House that we are progressing very rapidly in the matter of rural housing.  I would also remind the House that while the late Government&mdash;the Cumann na nGaedheal Government&mdash;in my opinion proceeded along lines which, if they erred at all, erred on the side of conservativeness, they did leave office without having accumulated one penny of debt on the State in respect of housing.  They paid for their housing <Col N="707" /> programme, such as it was, out of current revenue.  Personally, I think they were a little too conservative in doing that, but they did it, and they left a free field to their successors when they came into office.  While it is true that the State has built during the last four years a very considerable number of houses, it is right to remember that as a result of that building the State has now, in respect of houses built to date, a dead weight liability of approximately £3,250,000.  What alarms me about that situation is not the debt itself, because I think houses are very good value for money, but the problem that remains to be dealt with after so great a debt has been accumulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this submission, that the intense activity which is going on throughout rural Ireland, building labourers' cottages and houses of one kind or another, has reached a stage when we are pushing an open door. There is no difficulty about building houses in rural Ireland.  You simply pass an appropriation, you draft a scheme, you get it approved, the land is there, and off you go.  You can build houses in rural Ireland <i>ad infinitum</i> so long as the Government is prepared to shoulder the debt, and the thing is being largely financed by borrowed money.  A very great impression has been made upon any shortage of houses that did exist in rural Ireland.  I quite agree that the ideal has not yet been reached, but the back of the problem has been broken in rural Ireland.  Can we say that anything like that has been done in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Waterford? I live in the country and I represent rural constituents.  I depend on rural dwellers for any votes I am going to get, but I want to say perfectly clearly that at no time was the housing problem in rural Ireland comparable in gravity to the housing problem in the City of Dublin or in the City of Cork, or in the City of Limerick or in the City of Waterford.  It is true there were bad houses; there were insanitary houses; but the condition of a family living in an insanitary house in rural <Col N="708" /> Ireland is infinitely better than the condition of a family living in an insanitary tenement in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that this House is getting into a complacent state of mind.  We are making such progress, and we are talking in such magnificent sums of money, and in such great numbers of houses built in rural Ireland, that we are beginning to lose sight of the fact that the real housing problem&mdash;what we used to mean when we talked about the housing problem&mdash; is still there as much alive as ever. When we come to allot the blame for that situation we have got to bear in mind the words of a very experienced man, Deputy Tom Kelly.</P>
    <P>It is fortunate, Sir, that the Dublin Municipal Elections are now over, or else one would be charged with trying to make political capital out of the elections.  However, there is no political capital to be made out of the election, at the moment because there will not be another Corporation election for three years.  Deputy Tom Kelly pointed out previously that the conditions of the slums in Dublin were so horrible that, as he said himself, he was almost ashamed to use the appropriate language to describe these conditions as they exist in Dublin.  We, who know the city and who live here, can appreciate what it means to go home to one's house, when the weather is warm, and to find oneself in a state of misery as a result of the stuffiness of the house. As I say, one goes home and finds the house stuffy and warm, but it suddenly occurs to one that, in the same neighbourhood where you find your house stuffy, there may be a man with a wife and five or six children, all living in one room, sitting there, having to sleep there, cooking there.</P>

      <P>The Deputy expressed his intention to discuss the problem of housing in general.  The Chair has allowed him a certain latitude.  The Deputy, however, may not go into the problem of the clearance of the Dublin slums.  Were the Deputy permitted to do so, other <Col N="709" /> Deputies would follow on similar lines. This Bill proposes to provide money for private builders and utility societies.  It has no relation to the activities of corporations, county councils or boards of health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not want to wrangle with the Chair, but I think I may be permitted to submit a point of order.  All these housing schemes, I take it, are designed for the abatement of the problem of overcrowding, and we give grants to enable people to get out of rotten houses into, let us say, medium houses, and so on.  The Minister for Local Government himself, during the course of the Second Reading, referred to the activities of local authorities and pointed out that this Bill is only part of what one might call a mosaic designed to help the problem of housing generally&mdash;in other words, that we are providing houses in order to solve this general problem of slums and overcrowding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of slum clearance was debated on the Minister's Vote, and that was the appropriate occasion.  The Deputy asserts that the Minister referred to this matter.  Quite true, but only in one sentence.  The Minister stated that he would not pursue the matter as this was not an appropriate occasion.  The Deputy has been accorded considerable latitude on this point.  I suggest to the Deputy that, to submit plans for a solution of the Dublin problem, in connection with this Bill, apart from being irrelevant, would be useless, inasmuch as this Bill makes no provision for a solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission, Sir, is that a Bill of this character is likely to give rise to a certain feeling of complacency on the part of members of this House that active measures are being taken to deal with a problem, which in my submission is not being dealt with at all, and that, while the Minister plans, under this Bill, to provide a very large additional sum by way of grants to enable private builders and building speculators generally to build houses, I <Col N="710" /> want to urge him that, if he feels free to appropriate further sums of money, that money ought not to be primarily devoted for this type of housing at all.  Having made that submission.  I want to suggest, Sir, that, in fact, by marshalling our resources skilfully, we ought to be able to find enough money, not only to deal with the problem at which this Bill is aimed, but also to deal with the problem of the slums of Dublin. I should also like to say, Sir, that, while I am not prepared to give the problem, at which this Bill is aimed, precedence over the slum problem, if I must make a choice between dealing with the problem of the slums or the type of house for which this Bill is designed, then I would advise the Minister to drop this Bill and devote himself to dealing with the problem of the slums.</P>
      <P>In this connection, Sir, I want to remind the House that Deputy Tom Kelly, in dealing with this question, pointed out to the House that it is not for the want of goodwill on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the members of the Dublin Corporation, or the members of any other Party that this problem exists in the acute form in which it does exist. Deputy Tom Kelly pointed out that all Parties are anxious to deal with the problem.  He pointed out that it was not due to the lack of goodwill or competence on the part of the housing officials.  He stated that they were excellent men, who were just as anxious to overcome this problem as anybody else is, but that the difficulty was the lack of money.  He pointed out that we cannot get money.  I want to put it to the Minister that the time has come for him to say to his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that it does not meet the situation to refer persons seeking money to build houses for the poor to private individuals or private corporations for the purpose of raising money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I bow to your ruling, and, whether or not any views of mine on this subject would be a guide on the matter, I must wait for another occasion to impress on the Minister that there is an aspect of this problem which, in my opinion, is not being dealt with vigorously enough. However, in view of the fact, as the Chair has stated, that that question does not fall within the scope of the matter we are now discussing, there is one other question, of infinitesimal detail, about which I should like to have some information from the Minister.  I should like to hear from the Minister what are the functions of public utility societies.  I have consulted all the relevant authorities on this matter that I can find&mdash;the standard legal manuals and books on local government, and such other authorities as deal with this question&mdash;and the nearest approach to a true definition of a public utility society that I can arrive at is that of a body of persons who come together jointly to bear any indebtedness that may arise as a result of building a house for any individual of the society&mdash;in other words, the pooling of credit by a number of persons in order to give greater security to any individual advancing money to one member of the society; thus to facilitate persons who, on their unsupported credit, would be unable to borrow sufficient money to make the deposit necessary to qualify for the grant for the building of the house. If that is a true definition of a public <Col N="712" /> utility society, I say that 85 per cent., or probably 90 per cent., of the so-called public utility societies in this country arc not public utility societies at all.  I ask any Deputy in this House representing a rural constituency to suppose a case where there are 25 neighbours in a public utility society&mdash; say a Fianna Fáil club&mdash;and, as things are at the moment in Ireland, the terms are almost identical, because that is the way that they are managed largely in rural Ireland at the moment. As I say, the local Fianna Fáil club constitutes the public utility society, and the members of the club get a grant of so many pounds.  Does anybody for a moment suggest that if one member of the club had engaged in certain commitments of this kind and then went burst, the other members of the club would pay his debts?  Does any Deputy seriously suggest that, if a member of a Fianna Fáil club of, say, 25 members were unable to pay, the other 24 members of the Fianna Fáil club would come forward and pay his Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have not the slightest intention of doing so, and if that was explained to any of them, they would never enter into such liability at all.  My submission is that they have never entered into such a liability, and that public utility societies, in the vast majority of cases, are completely fraudulent, and have no function except the extraction of £10 extra by way of grant from the Government. Some people might argue that it is useful to have these bodies in order to have an informed person acting as secretary to fill up the forms required by the Department of Local Government, so as to qualify for a grant.  I challenge the Minister to state if the forms of public utility societies are filled up any better than the forms filled up by private individuals.  I had to approach the Department in one or two cases where public utility societies were involved, and I got every possible assistance from the Department, and every possible guidance in respect of the persons, on whose behalf I was making the representations, and I found that where a public utility society had intervened <Col N="713" /> confusion had become worse confounded. When dealing with a grant founded on the application of an individual, it was plain sailing, but where public utility societies were concerned you found that you were misled.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister that we are not dealing in fictions, and if he thinks that these persons ought to get £80 then let everyone get £80, but do not let us have a situation where a group of chisellers get together and start saint some one's public utility society, and get grants of £10 extra amongst 20 or 30 of them, whereas a simple, honest neighbour who wants to build his own house, and who does not want to have any codology or fraud decides to write to ask for a grant in the ordinary way and only gets £70. I do not see why the cute boys should get more than a neighbour.  I freely admit that you may find in certain areas real public utility societies, and where you have genuine societies, such as you may have in the City of Dublin and in other districts, where you have reliable men, there may be some real value in these bodies when you get the proper men together to pledge their credit jointly.  In that way it may be possible for these men to build houses and to raise the money. If the Minister has investigated the working of public utility societies, to find out if they are functioning properly and in accordance with their true purpose, then I think they are institutions that should be encouraged, but I object to fictitious bodies masquerading as public utility societies, and I allege now that if the Minister will get a list from his Department of public utility societies, or direct an inspector to go around and carefully inspect their records, books and the form of contracts by which their members are bound, he will discover that the vast majority have a purely fictitious organisation, and that they have no proper standing under the Friendly Societies Acts or whatever legislation they are registered under.</P>
    <P>There are detailed matters relating to rural housing which might be mentioned now.  However, my mind is directed to the question of the slums, and I do not want to introduce such observations when dealing with <Col N="714" /> rural housing and so I have nothing to add to the details mentioned.</P>

      <P>In connection with the reconstruction of houses in rural districts, emphasis has been laid on the necessity of extending the valuations from £25 to £35 for the purpose of giving grants in rural areas.  It is very hard on a man who has portion of a house built, whose valuation is £25 5s. to learn that he cannot get a grant for reconstruction purposes. Appeals were made to the Minister to raise the valuations in which grants could be given in order to help a deserving class of people in the community who are anxious to avail of these grants for the building of houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I am anxious to know what are the functions of utility societies, and what purpose they really serve.  I have before my mind the case of a man, who came to me during the week, which has been going on for two years.  He made application to a certain utility society in the district in which I live, and became a member in order to get a grant.  He says that he visited the offices once a fortnight for a long time and then once a month, but got no &ldquo;forrader.&rdquo;  Although he paid contributions to the society nothing has been done for him.  I mentioned on a previous occasion complaints that were made last year about the position of utility societies in County Roscommon. Certain traders complain that utility societies came to them and stated they required materials to build houses and that the grants would be paid to the traders.  In that way the traders felt that they were acting as agents for the Department of Local Government. I understand that is part of the function of these societies.  Here is where the crux comes in: the utility societies having guaranteed to the traders that the grants would be paid them if they supplied certain materials to applicants building their own houses, when the inspectors from the Department came down they stated that the work was not done to their satisfaction, and they would not give grants.  As a result the traders had to go without their money.  They had no redress. The utility societies do not appear to <Col N="715" /> be responsible bodies.  The traders say that it is not possible to follow up these societies as some of them had nothing, and as far as they could see the money could not be recovered.  The materials were given in good faith, on the understanding that the grants would be paid to the traders, but nobody, traders or public utility societies, had any authority to see that the work was properly done, and when the inspectors came down they very rightly condemned the work and stated it would not be paid for.  I mentioned previously a case in Roscommon, where over £1,000 was outstanding for materials for nearly three years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has at his disposal a Housing Board about which questions were asked when the Estimate for the Department of Local Government was under consideration.  I wanted to know the functions of the Housing Board but I could not get information. The Minister ought to direct the attention of that Board to this matter, to see if some kind of an inquiry could not be held into the manner in which public utility societies are operating. As Deputy Dillon pointed out, if the only object of these societies is to secure an extra £10 grant for the members there is no reason for their existence.  If these societies are not <i>bona fide</i> agents of the Department of Local Government when giving certificates, there should be some authority to see that they are made responsible for their acts.  I ask the Minister to look into the matter to see what the position is, and if certain people are neglected by these societies, as has been alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention and it also might be considered by the Housing Board, if that Board has any utility at all.  It is with regard to specifying certain materials used in housing.  Roofing tiles have been used, but I understand that there is nothing like agreement amongst the engineers as to that type of covering for houses. The Minister under other Acts is entitled to specify that only certain materials are to be used.  Is the Minister satisfied, or are any of his engineers <Col N="716" /> satisfied, that the tiles that are being used to roof houses in the country to-day are made of sand that is washed?  If not, would the Minister find out what is his engineers' opinion of tiles made of unwashed sand?  I know perfectly well what I am talking about.  I have seen tiles made of unwashed sand, and I would ask the Minister if he would direct the attention of the engineers to this matter. After all, if this House is providing certain moneys for housing purposes, we ought to see that we get value for our money.  It will be very hard lines on people who undertake the building of houses and who put their earnings into them, in addition to whatever they get by way of grant, if after a few years they find that the roof is faulty.  I am sure the members of this House who are accustomed to working concrete of any kind will realise the difference that washed sand and unwashed sand makes, particularly when it enters into the composition of an article such as a slate which is possibly only half an inch thick.  The smallest piece of clay in that article means that it will eventually leak.  I think it is up to the Minister and the officials of his Department, particularly the engineers, when they are specifying certain materials, to see that these materials are something that will last, so that when the nation provides certain moneys for housing, the people who get these grants and who themselves have to pay the greater part of the cost of the houses, will have something we can stand over.  Those are two matters to which the Minister ought to direct his attention or the attention of the Housing Board, if the Housing Board is still operative&mdash;the question of utility societies and the use of materials which may be inferior.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan expect from utility societies.  They may have some unpleasant experiences of certain societies but my experience is that these societies fulfil a very useful function.  The ordinary small farmer or labourer throughout the country, who is applying for a building grant, knows very little about <Col N="717" /> the method to be followed in making the application and where there is a society which takes an interest in these people, it fulfils a very useful function by directing them to proceed along the proper lines.  They frequently also are very useful in helping an applicant to get credit, but why should Deputy Dillon or Deputy Brennan expect that these men, promoters of the society, who get no financial benefit whatever out of the society, should turn round and take responsibility for bad debts?</P>

      <P>A person who has applied for and qualified for a grant may not fulfil the conditions under which the grant is given.  He may start his building operations in the wrong way or complete them in the wrong way and the local trader gives him credit.  Is it a sensible proposition to put forward in this assembly that the local utility society should be responsible if that man is unable to pay his debts?  Is there not only one way by which we can guard against a trader being done out of his money? That is, that there would be an actual contract signed between the man who gets credit and his creditors, and that the Department should insist on that. Do Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan make that suggestion?  Do these Deputies say that the Department should step in and guarantee that the shopkeepers will get their money and that they will act as guarantors?  I think the suggestion is nonsensical on the face of it, when, as I have stated, if a man's application for a grant is passed and if he does not carry out the terms of his contract or fulfil the conditions of the grant, he has only himself to blame.  Similarly, if a trader gives him credit and knows that he is not carrying out the conditions of his contract, he also has only himself to blame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to call the Minister's attention to the very general complaints that are being made regarding roofing tiles used in my county.  I think that the Minister, seeing that so much public money is being voted for housing purposes, should insist on that money being expended on good materials. There are a number of complaints that roofs on which tiles have been used are now leaking.  I asked the Minister some time ago if he had made inquiries as to whether these tiles were giving satisfaction and his reply was in the negative.  Recently a question was asked of the secretary of a utility society as to whether these roofing tiles were giving satisfaction and his reply was that they had made inquiries and found that they were giving satisfaction.  The impression the man received was that these inquiries were carried out under the directions of the Minister, so that really the reply deceived people who were building houses.  They found on making further inquiries that tiles are not giving satisfaction. I think that in this important matter the Minister should think it worth while to make inquiries himself, and if he finds that these tiles are not giving satisfaction, he ought to see that the materials are changed or that the manufacturers whose tiles are not giving satisfaction should endeavour to improve the quality of the materials used.  There is undoubtedly something wrong, and it is too important a matter to let go by the board.  I think the Minister would be well advised to see that, before grants are made, houses are roofed with proper materials.  The difficulty the Minister will encounter in having inspections carried out is that people who are looking for grants will in all cases say that the roofs are giving satisfaction until they get the grants. If the Minister wants to find out the truth he should make inquiries amongst people who have received the grants already and they will tell him the truth. People who want to get a grant will always give a good report on the material used.  I think the Minister should make his inquiries amongst <Col N="719" /> people who have received grants already.</P>

      <P>I personally would not have any objection whatever to any aspect of the housing question in town or country being debated here and thoroughly ventilated.  It is, Sir, entirely a matter for you to decide what is in order.  My own desire would be that the fullest possible debate should be allowed on any occasion that we are discussing housing in this House.  However, it is for you, Sir, to decide what is in order and what is not. I do not want to do anything that would even suggest disagreement with the ruling of the Chair.</P>
      <P>On the last day on which we were discussing housing, when Deputy Mulcahy emphasised the fact that a very heavy financial burden had been imposed upon the State under the Act of 1932 for which I was responsible, I said to Deputy Mulcahy, and I will say the same to Deputy Dillon now, that I am glad when he or anybody else calls attention to the fact that a heavy burden has been placed, and is being placed, upon the taxpayers of the country as a whole in connection with housing.  It is a heavy burden.  I do not think it is too heavy, if we are to find a solution for that problem, which has been with us for so long and which so urgently demands a remedy.  We have already demanded from the State, under the Act of 1932, a liability of several million pounds.  I think the liability is fully justified.  I think whatever the liability, something similar ought to have been undertaken at an earlier date, and that while good work was done by the last Government since 1923 or thereabouts, in housing, an earlier attempt ought to have been made to tackle the problem in a way that would help towards an earlier solution.  That is what we have done in town as well as in country.  I do not want to go further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I do not think I have made any suggestion of complacency in my position <Col N="720" /> on the matter of housing in urban or rural areas.  I realise that in what we have done, and have been doing, we have been helped by the local authorities to do a good deal in town and country.  I realise that much more remains to be done, and a great deal more than has been done although a considerable amount has been accomplished. It would be very foolish, on my part or on the Government's part, to allow any suggestion of satisfaction or complacency, with what has been achieved, to encourage us not to press forward with greater energy and vigour and enthusiasm with the attack upon this problem until we have brought it within measurable, distance of solution. We have not got there yet; therefore, I welcome discussion and criticism&mdash;the more talk there is about it the better, and the more we face up to the problem the better it will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a good many years of study to this question, mostly in so far as it relates to the urban areas.  I do not know, except what I learned since I became a Minister, so much about housing in rural areas.  I learned something since my contact with the Department of Local Government so far as rural housing is concerned.  But I do know something about the conditions in urban areas.  One matter in which I agree with Deputy Dillon, and with my colleague, Deputy Tom Kelly, is that there is a very great advance still to be made before the urban problem is anything like within measurable distance of being solved.  I do not agree with Deputy Dillon that there is no difficulty about building houses in rural Ireland.  I should like to hear him, after he had a talk with Deputy Hogan of Clare, on that subject.  I could enlighten him, I think, about the difficulties we have encountered in getting boards of health in other counties to use the generous grants that have been given.  I do not at all accept the statement that there is no difficulty.  Many difficulties and many obstacles are still put in our way. In some rural areas I think it would not be true to say that the back of the problem is broken, while it might be true in some others.  One word with regard to Dublin.  Deputy Dillon said <Col N="721" /> the Dublin problem is not dealt with at all.</P>

On the question of public utility societies, if they are, as Deputy Dillon described them, &ldquo;fraudulent,&rdquo; I would not stand for their getting any grant, nor would anyone else in this House.  I do not know anyone who would stand for fraudulent bodies, calling themselves by this high sounding title of public utility societies, being allowed to exist.  I am not aware that there are such bodies in existence.  I am aware there are public utility societies in the country, particularly in rural areas, that have not done anything, or anything that would justify their existence.  I do not think there are many; I know there are some such societies in rural areas that have done excellently, and I know in urban areas there are public utility societies that are a great credit to the country.</P>

If there be any that deserve the character given to them by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan, I shall not hesitate to acquaint the public with the nature of these societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a matter raised by Deputy Donovan to get more money, the same point was raised when the last Bill was introduced some months ago.  The answer I make Deputy Donovan is that until we have gone a considerable length further in dealing with the poorer people, people with £20 valuation and under, I do not think it would be fair to take any of the money made available for that class of the community to help people who, in most <Col N="722" /> cases, ought to be able to help themselves. People with £40 valuation should be in moderately good circumstances. They should be able to provide £50 or £90&mdash;£45 is the amount of the reconstruction grant&mdash;to build an additional room to their houses. The poorer people ought to be attended to first.  Until we have reduced considerably the demand, and reduced the number still clamouring&mdash; in their thousands&mdash;for these grants, I think we ought not to consider raising the limit of valuation.  I do not say it will not be done.  It probably will be done some time, but, until we have gone a great deal further on the road towards stemming the tide of demand for grants from the poorer classes, others who are better circumstanced financially, perhaps, will have to wait.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust to the Parliamentary Secretary's unfailing courtesy to relay it to the proper quarter.  A question which is almost as seasoned and as venerable as that of the Pearse-street Sorting Station is the question of the entrance to Leinster House. This question has been raised for three successive years on the Estimate <Col N="725" /> of the Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Secretary informed us on each occasion that the matter was engaging his careful attention but that architectural difficulties had obtruded themselves and made the problem extremely difficult to solve. Visitors to this House are obliged to wait in the dog kennel at the gate. The facade of Leinster House is a very handsome one.  An increasing number of tourists are coming to the country and an increasing number of persons of distinction pay us the compliment of visiting our legislative Assembly.  I think that all Parties deplore that they are received in this extremely depressing and inadequate dog kennel.  It is, obviously, a temporary structure.  It was, evidently, put there pending the provision of some more suitable place of reception. If the ingenuity of the Board's architects has failed and they are unable to surmount the problem, the time has come, I think, to call in consultant architects in order to deal with the problem.  I had hoped that such vigorous precautions as heretofore would not be necessary for the exclusion of casual visitors from the precincts of the House.  I had hoped that it would be possible to admit the average caller beyond the gates without questioning him so closely as is at present the custom.  That is, of course, a matter in which the Minister for Justice and a number of other Departments will have a say. I feel, however, that the question is one of some urgency and should be dealt with without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an occasion on which one throws bricks and bouquets impartially and I think it is right to say that one perennial complaint which Deputies have had has been partially abated.  The atmosphere of the diningroom is gradually being improved and it is not now quite so intolerable as it was.  How the Parliamentary Secretary achieved that, I do not know.  Having achieved that, I want to revive the suggestion that the diningroom should be transferred to that part of the House which abuts on Leinster Lawn and that the accommodation already provided there for certain Parties in the House should be <Col N="726" /> transferred to where the diningroom now is.  The Parliamentary Secretary has overcome the principal atmospheric difficulties in the diningroom and, with a little further improvement, these rooms should be reasonably habitable for people doing clerical work or such work as members of the House have to do in the rooms allotted to them.  It would be a very great addition to the amenities of the House if the diningroom were in the neighbourhood of Leinster Lawn.  It would make Leinster Lawn of much greater service to the House than it is at present.  I see that certain citizens are making the case that nobody seems to use Leinster Lawn and that it is a great shame to have it enclosed when nobody is using it.  I think that there is force in the argument.  Unless Deputies are going to use it for the purpose of entertaining their friends or visitors from the country or visitors from abroad, Leinster Lawn should, I think, be thrown open to the citizens.  Somebody ought to use it. I feel that Deputies are not unduly exacting as regards their amenities here and I think we might reasonably claim the right to the use of Leinster Lawn for the purpose of regaling ourselves and entertaining our friends when they come up from the country or from abroad.  If it is not going to be used for that purpose then steps should be taken to have it thrown open to the citizens. I think Deputies would avail especially during the summer months of the amenities which Leinster Lawn offers.</P>
    <P>I notice a sub-head in connection with national schools and in that connection the Department of Education may be overlapping with the functions of the Board of Works.  I was going to suggest that adequate accommodation for children in national schools could more properly be furnished if there were fewer national schools.  The present situation is that in rural areas you sometimes have a dozen insanitary pill-boxes planted all over the electoral division.  All these have to be separately built, separately maintained and separate repairs have to be carried out.  None of them has adequate sanitary facilities and none of them has adequate class-room <Col N="727" /> accommodation.  I feel that if a decent central school were built and a school bus provided to bring the children into that central school, the Parliamentary Secretary would find himself in the position of having erected an adequate building which would probably accommodate the teaching staff and make it possible to provide proper sanitary accommodation in the school and additional social services in the form of free meals and such other things as the Minister may see fit to provide.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has any information as to what the policy is in regard to volunteer halls; whether he is going to build volunteer halls or are these halls going to be built in places which already are provided with parochial halls&mdash;places where it does not seem a good proposition to erect volunteer halls in opposition to the existing parochial halls?  Does the Minister think the building of these volunteer halls is needed in places where you have parochial halls, or is the position that the Minister is going to be told by the Department of Defence that volunteer halls are required in such a place and that he is to build them there without questioning the order?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to whether these volunteer halls would be in opposition to the parochial halls is not a matter for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder would it be any part of the function of the Parliamentary Secretary, if he got from the Department of Defence a schedule of 20 volunteer halls to be built, to make a note on the schedule saying &ldquo;we desire to direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the fact that there are already adequate parochial halls in three of the 20 towns in which we have been asked to erect volunteer halls&rdquo;?  I put that to the Parliamentary Secretary because otherwise I apprehend there may be serious overlapping if the Parliamentary Secretary is going to erect those volunteer halls in places asked for by the Department of Defence.  I take it that the Ministry of Defence views the problem from the point of view of the volunteers in any <Col N="728" /> given area.  When the Commissioners of Public Works send their engineers to examine the district these engineers may find that in a particular district there is already a parochial hall, the trustees of which find themselves in a difficulty in providing for its upkeep and maintenance because of the lack of patronage.  Would it not be well if the Board of Works first approached the people who were concerned about these parochial halls?  These in many cases would be able to tell them that, if a volunteer hall is built, both would go bankrupt because of the halving of the amount of patronage given to either.</P>
      <P>If discretion is not given to the Board of Works in this matter the Parliamentary Secretary may find that harm will be done and loss suffered by the State owing to that lack of discretion.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary direct that a memorandum be sent to the Minister for Finance regularising this matter with a view to avoiding unnecessary expenditure in the providing of volunteer halls where they are not needed.  I have raised this point because I have reason to believe that already this difficulty has arisen in more towns than one.  It is possible that in this matter representations from persons concerned with parochial halls are likely to be misrepresented to the Department of Defence as representations from persons who are antagonistic to the Volunteer movement, whereas if the matter were surveyed by a body that was manifestly and completely detached from any bias the problem could be examined with more advantage to both Departments.  I was in doubt about mentioning Post Office business in connection with this Vote and especially the question of telephones. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for the installation of telephones in this House?</P>

The initiation of that matter does not lie with us. <Col N="729" /> In certain cases where representations are made to us we go a little outside our functions, but we have no function in this matter until representations are made to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister for Finance, by way of representations to the proper authority, will make a suggestion for the installation of a telephone without a bell in the room of the Níl Lobby.  I recognise that the installation of a telephone with bell there would disturb the even tenor of our ways in the House, but the installation of a telephone without a bell would make it possible to have it there without the House being disturbed.</P>
      <P>The next question that I want to put to the Parliamentary Secretary is this: What is the situation with regard to the River Suck Drainage?  The Parliamentary Secretary recently transferred that Suck Drainage Scheme to the local authority.  One of the conditions of the transfer was that certain repairs were to be carried out in order that the drainage scheme should be transferred to the local authority in proper condition. It is idle for me to waste time asking a whole lot of detailed questions. I confine myself to asking the Parliamentary Secretary to make a short statement with regard to the Suck Drainage Board versus the Roscommon County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice a recommendation in the matter of the letting of sporting rights. I understand that the Board of Works do control certain sporting estates in parts of the country.  Is the prospect that the authority in this matter of sporting rights is going to be maintained in the future sufficiently strong to justify the building of any kind of a shooting lodge in the neighbourhood of these sporting rights so as to make them more attractive to prospective tenants?  If these sporting rights are merely in the hands of the Board of Works for a couple of years nothing of that kind could be contemplated.  But, on the other hand, if they are to remain permanently in their hands, I would put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that it would be possible to attract a prospective tenant who would be prepared to pay a rent for these shooting rights if he were told there was a <Col N="730" /> reasonable sort of bungalow on the property with water accommodation and so on, a sort of building that need not be too elaborate but which would certainly enhance considerably the letting value of the sporting rights.</P>
    <P>I notice that sub-head D contains the invariable word &ldquo;etc.&rdquo;.  These include, I take it, the benches on which our citizens rest in public places in the City of Dublin.  I saw a number of benches erected in Merrion Square and as the foot of Daniel O'Connell's monument and other places of that kind.  It occurred to me that, if that is part of the work of the Board of Works, it is to be highly commended and should be widely extended.  I should like to see benches of that kind erected in the neighbourhood of every public garden in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary might not take a turn at it, too.  If he could, I commend most strongly to him that amenity, because for elderly people living in the city who do not get much chance of getting fresh air, an opportunity of strolling out and sitting for a while in the neighbourhood of a public park or garden is something which is very desirable.  I pass from the Board of Works Estimate to the Estimates covering relief works and special works.  I have said already that this is an occasion for throwing bricks and bouquets, and I want to pay a very special tribute to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department for a very unusual virtue.  The forms which Government Departments require citizens to fill up are usually drafted in such a way as to make them instruments of torture for the parties who have to fill them.  Recently the Board of Works issued a form which they asked applicants for special works or relief works to fill up in order to describe the work they wanted taken in hands.  It is the first form I have ever seen issued by a Government Department in the filling up of which there is no difficulty and which positively extracts information instead of making it virtually impossible to supply <Col N="731" /> it.  I commend the form to the attention of every other Department of State, because if others could do it on the same lines a very great deal of difficulty that arises for ordinary people in trying to fill up forms would disappear.</P>
      <P>I mentioned two years in succession a proposal which I think is an extremely good proposal for the expenditure of relief money.  I was encouraged to believe that something would be done in regard to it on divers occasions, but, of course, nothing has been done.  I take the view that a great deal of relief money is wasted.  A great deal of it is spent in scraping the sides of roads and doing perfectly useless works of the old famine type, which are as near to demoralising activities as such works could be.  While I admit that the primary purpose is to provide employment, there should be constantly kept before the mind of responsible parties the desirability of getting some value for the money expended.  If there, is one thing wanted in this country it is the drainage of small holders' farms.  Every uneconomic holding, and every holding under £20 valuation is, to a lesser or greater degree, injured by the presence of flaggers and rushes.  The presence of both flaggers and rushes is largely attributable to the water-logged condition of the land.  That condition of the land can be most effectively remedied by the construction of flagged drains. I emphasise the words &ldquo;flagged drains&rdquo; in opposition to French drains which, in my opinion, are entirely unsuitable to the drainage problem in the congested areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction of flagged drains involves no expenditure on labour and is, therefore, from the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view, ideal relief work.  In my submission, the supervision and inspection of relief work of this kind would be peculiarly easy, because all that would be necessary would be, first, for the Minister to satisfy himself that the person applying for assistance to make drains on his lands was a deserving party within whatever category would have been determined by the Minister.  I would be inclined to say that anybody up to a millionaire from a cottier with five <Col N="732" /> acres who applied for assistance to make flagged drains should get it.  It is all going to be spent on labour and it is ultimately going to improve the land of the country.  No matter in whose possession it is, the fertility of the land ultimately redounds to the advantage of the community and the better every man makes his land the more valuable it will be to the community, in the long run.</P>
    <P>Having authorised a man to undertake the construction of flagged drains, he should then be told that the drain must be a certain depth over its entire length, that it must be properly constructed, and that it must not be closed until it has been inspected and certified by an officer of the Board of Works.  Once you open a flagged drain of that kind there is no immediate urgency to close it.  You can leave it open as long as you like within reason. I have constructed hundreds of yards of such drains on my own land.  In fact, you may safely say that the necessity for closing them promptly does not exist.  You do not want to leave drains open for ever, but there will be no difficulty in leaving them open for a week or ten days or a fortnight after they have been completed.  A cursory examination will make it perfectly clear whether the work has been done properly or improperly.</P>
    <P>The work can be done by any intelligent countryman.  There is no necessity for taking elaborate levels or for any difficult constructional work.  It is work which any countryman can do himself or act as ganger over men whom he employs to do it.  It can be paid for on the basis of a contribution for every yard of flagged drain made, and it will be of incalculable value to the country as a whole.  Such a scheme would induce thousands of persons to undertake the construction of these drains who would otherwise never make them.  I believe you will get full value for every penny you spend from the point of view of the community, and you will confer an inestimable boon on a very large number of small farmers who never have sufficient money at hand to employ four or five men at the same time to get the work done expeditiously and within the season which is at their disposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Another matter which I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to consider, and which he has always assured me he would consider sympathetically, is the provision of swimming pools for rural towns.  The Parliamentary Secretary's reply to me, whenever I approached him in regard to this matter, is to say: &ldquo;Put forward any concrete scheme to me and it will be not only considered, but sympathetically considered.&rdquo;  The trouble is that you cannot get rural communities to put forward schemes unless you are in a position to say something more than that they will be sympathetically considered. I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary could say something of this kind: &ldquo;Where I am offered a piece of land and an adequate water supply and where the unemployment situation justifies me in expending money in that area, I will put up a swimming pool,&rdquo; or, he may feel bound to say: &ldquo;Where I am offered two tons of cement, an adequate water supply and a piece of land I will put up a swimming pool.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Parliamentary Secretary that if he says: &ldquo;Where I am supplied with all the cement, a piece of land and an adequate water supply I will put up a swimming pool&rdquo; he will never put up any swimming pool because no rural community will bear the entire expense.  The Parliamentary Secretary is going to expend money in order to provide employment.  That is his purpose. What I am trying to secure is that, when he has that money to expend on the employment of labour, he should spend it on something that will remain behind.  I quite see that he is reluctant to spend part of the moneys committed to him on the purchase of cement, because he feels that that is so much taken away from his labour fund.  I put it to him that we can go too far in that direction.  If we constrict ourselves rigidly to spend nothing, or practically nothing, except on labour, the end of it will be that all our labours will be written on the sands of time and will vanish completely. I would like to write something on wet concrete so that when it <Col N="734" /> hardens we shall have in ten or 20 years' time a monument to the zeal of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I think that the Parliamentary Secretary might also consider the erection of ball alleys.  I mentioned this matter on the Vote for the Gárda Síochána. The Minister for Justice was captivated with the idea and agreed with it in principle.  But his difficulty was that he had not the money.  The Parliamentary Secretary has got the money from the Minister for Finance for the employment of labour.  Would he now feel entitled to say that, if the Minister for Justice gives him the cement, he will build the ball alley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is that if one State source will provide the cement, then there is this other State source to provide the labour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister for Justice agreed in principle with the suggestion and pointed out that the only obstacle was the Minister for Finance, who was not prepared to provide out of revenue the necessary sum of money for the erection of these ball alleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Where will the Minister for Justice get the money to provide the cement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister for Justice to be in a position to go back and say that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance wants to spend money on relief works in a particular area.  Now there are two alternatives.  He is either going to scrape the side of a road from point A to point B because he must spend the money that he has, the reason being that there is an unemployment problem in that area to be dealt with.  He has the money and he has got to spend it. He has either got to spend the money that way or on some other project. The Department of Finance object to the inclusion in the Vote for the Department of Justice of a sum of money for the building of ball alleys, but would they object to a very much smaller sum for the purpose of providing cement to enable the Parliamentary <Col N="735" /> Secretary, who has money to spend in a particular area, utilising it on a project which will have a community value?  I submit that the idea is sensible.  To the departmental mind it may sound shocking, but does not the Parliamentary Secretary think that there is something in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I have not got the departmental mind, it sounds to me something more than shocking. The Deputy has been imagining conversations that would take place.  The Minister for Justice would go to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;Dear Minister for Finance, because of your narrow-minded lack of appreciation of the value of ball alleys, you have declined to provide the whole of the cost of ball alleys.  What I want you to do now is this: provide me, the Minister for Justice, with the cement and the material, and provide the Parliamentary Secretary with the labour, and you, the Minister for Finance, who would not provide the material and labour in one lump, will now find no difficulty whatever in providing it in the two.&rdquo;  I must say that it beats me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has failed to observe that the Minister for Finance has already supplied the labour.  The money is in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary, and his problem is: &ldquo;How am I going to use the labour?  I have actually donated to me a pool of labour in this area which must be used.  Those are my instructions, and my problem is to find a good scheme on which to use it.&rdquo;  The Parliamentary Secretary has repeatedly said that one of the nightmares of his existence is to find good schemes on which to use the labour that he has.  That is the problem that the Minister for Justice finds the Parliamentary Secretary confronted with.  The Minister for Justice says the fact is that the Department of Finance will not allow his Vote to be charged with the entire sum necessary for the erection of ball alleys.  Surely the Minister for Justice is entitled to say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;You have already provided all the labour <Col N="736" /> cost of this work.  You will not allow my Vote to be charged with the money for the purchase of materials to build ball alleys.  The alternative is to supply our Department with the materials, because otherwise the money which has been appropriated for labour in this area is going to be wasted.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot evolve schemes in the area on which the money you have given him can be appropriately expended otherwise. There is nothing to do now except to supply the materials, and surely it is good economy, in face of the situation which exists, to do that.  All that is required is a small additional sum to purchase materials, and it is better to do that than waste all the money that the Parliamentary Secretary has to spend on labour in that area.  In the end we will have something for the expenditure.&rdquo; All that may sound complex, but if the Parliamentary Secretary examines it closely I think he will find that there is a good deal to be said for the submission that I am making.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far the proposal for the reclamation of waste spaces, adjoining towns in rural areas, for sportsfields and parks for the people is practicable because I do not know to what extent such waste spaces exist.  There are places to my knowledge where there used to be small woods or quarries which are now unreclaimed and barren.  A good deal of work could be provided in removing the roots of trees or in closing up disused quarries or other dangerous places.  If the Board of Works had some guarantee that, having carried out work of that kind, these spaces would be permanently and inalienably consecrated to the public use, I think it would be a useful thing to undertake such work. In a great many small towns there are considerable areas of land which have never been appropriated to any purpose, and which, I think, might be made into very nice greens or parks for the use of the people if they were reclaimed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In some places the position with regard to these areas of land is made difficult in this way, that individuals are going in and enclosing them.  Because of that the responsibility would devolve on the Board of Works to establish a public right there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficult thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And particularly if the area was enclosed by one of the strongest supporters of the present Government in that particular area. This is something that, I think, a Government Department like the Board of Works might properly look into. These places ought not to be taken from the public by the person who has enclosed them.  I realise that it would be a difficult thing for an individual neighbour to go forward and assert a public right in respect to these enclosed places.  In doing so he would probably bring down on his shoulders the furious feud which would be almost certain to break out in the neighbourhood in defending that public right, whereas the Board of Works, acting impersonally, might be able to do it without bringing down on their heads an intolerable row.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing to which I wish to refer is a perennial difficulty in rural Ireland, and that is the cul-de-sac road.  The cul-de-sac roads had their origin largely in the Land Commission, which built those cul-de-sac roads in the process of land division. Since these roads were built many local authorities have built labourers' cottages upon them; individuals have built houses on these cul-de-sac roads and there is now no authority in the State competent to keep these roads in repair.  Again, I forbear to recapitulate all the facts that led up to the situation, because the Parliamentary Secretary is as familiar with them as I am.  Either of two things must be done.  There could be, for instance, amending legislation to make the local authority liable for these roads, but that may not be advocated at this stage.  An alternative scheme <Col N="738" /> would be that the Parliamentary Secretary would review all these roads and make up his mind which of them ought to be allowed to vanish and fall into desuetude and which of them could be considered useful roads.  I suggest he should give the useful roads to the local authority and say &ldquo;I am prepared to give you a capital sum, the annual income of which is to be devoted to the repair and maintenance of such a road.&rdquo;  I see no other way out of the difficulty.</P>
    <P>This is one of those problems which persons not living in the country find it difficult to understand in all its implications.  People living on these roads, however, suffer very great hardships indeed.  I have seen people who have had water flowing into their houses through the roads being cut away by streams that ran across them. I have seen other people finding great difficulty getting into and out of their houses, having literally to wade through mud to get there and having no recourse to anybody to get the road put into a proper state of repair. Local county councillors are persecuted by these people.  I would ask the Board of Works to remember that it is not easy to explain Lord Chief Baron Palles's decision in regard to roads which are not roads of public convenience to every tenant of every labourer's cottage that has been built on a cul-de-sac road.</P>
    <P>I might say that local county councillors' lives are made a misery, because their position in regard to these roads seems to the people to be wholly irrational and indefensible. Something ought to be done about it. At present the Board of Works are the only people who can do anything, because the local authorities could not act without amending legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to undertake to look after these matters, or else take such steps by way of persuasion of the Minister for Local Government as will secure a remedy for an evil that has been endured for too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as County Kerry is concerned, the relief works have been carried out by the Board of Works in a very successful manner.  In <Col N="739" /> regard to certain congested areas I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to carry on the good work and to take steps at this period of the year with the object of having certain drainage works completed.  I have mentioned that type of work over and over again, both to the officials of the Department and to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We would refer to these schemes as borderline schemes, schemes that in the ordinary course should be carried out by the Land Commission.  Instead, they are left either to the local authorities or to the Board of Works.  In many instances they are very necessary schemes.</P>
      <P>In connection with the last schemes for which allocations have been made, we had occasion to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that very small sums expended at a certain period of the year were more effective than three times the amount at a later date.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to encourage the initiation of drainage schemes that could not properly be classified as minor drainage schemes, but that would benefit large numbers of small farms and give very great employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important point in connection with the carrying out of these works is the need for a sufficient number of engineers to inspect areas and report as soon as possible, so that the work can be undertaken at an early date.  I think the Department would be justified in employing additional engineers, so as to expedite the schemes and have them started at suitable periods of the year.  I wish to refer to another important matter which concerns certain areas around the South Kerry coast.  Allocations have been made on the basis of the number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance in the different districts. It may appear strange to state that in certain of the very congested areas the number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance is not very great, and consequently, the amounts allocated to these districts are not anything like what they should be.  Take the district of Glencar, which is one of <Col N="740" /> the poorest in County Kerry.  In last year's allocation £55 was distributed over the whole parish, which comprises three large electoral divisions.  That certainly is a case in point, and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary, in so far as these areas are concerned, to depart from the usual system of allocation&mdash;that is, the more unemployment assistance recipients in an area the more money.  Where we can show that the conditions of the people require special consideration, and that the increased amount would be justified even though the number of men in receipt of unemployment assistance is not up to the set standard of allocating this money, I would make a special plea in regard to them.  After all, if the Parliamentary Secretary cannot see his way to give consideration to those areas, what other Department will intervene?  The county councils, the Land Commission or any other Department of State has not, to my mind in any case, the same facilities for coping with an area like that as the Department controlled by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would urge that he should at least go into the matter and take into consideration areas like Glencar, Sneem, and all those coastal districts where the conditions and the outlook of the people are not very hopeful.  I would ask that special consideration should be given to them. even though they cannot fit it in under the system adopted by the Office of Public Works and outlined in the communications which I have had with that Department.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is the question of the new scheme mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary in his opening statement, that is that certain schemes will be undertaken other than relief works; in other words, that waterworks schemes, extensive drainage schemes, sewerage schemes, etc., would be carried through under the new system.  I do not wish to mention any places in particular, but I would again urge the Parliamentary Secretary to try to make the new system operate in regard to the carrying through of the Kenmare scheme&mdash; the Breen Memorial Park, the Maine drainage scheme, and the Killorglin <Col N="741" /> waterworks scheme.  I submit that there is a sufficient number of people in receipt of unemployment assistance in those areas to be absorbed in the carrying through of those schemes.  I would recommend that those two schemes should be carried through, even by way of experiment, under the new system.  I would conclude by saying that the work carried through in Kerry, and particularly in those congested areas, has been a wonderful success.  If any Department of State has more than justified its schemes by giving general assistance to people, it is the Department controlled by the Parliamentary Secretary.  We only wish it could be extended further, and that the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to give consideration to the schemes I have mentioned, and which at the moment it is difficult to get the Land Commission or the local authorities to undertake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I may say that the object of putting down that amendment was to extract certain information with regard to the working of the Inter-Departmental Committee presided over by the Parliamentary Secretary; I do not want to make a second speech on the matter.  It is not my intention to refer to any of the details of Votes 10 or 11, although there is a number of them.  I want rather to get, if I can, from the Parliamentary Secretary some idea of the line he proposes to take regarding the expenditure of the money provided under this new Estimate, No. 73.  I take it that it was largely on the basis of the report supplied to the Executive Council by his Inter-Departmental Committee that this amount was set aside.  I <Col N="742" /> should like if the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us whether he is satisfied that the amount so set aside for the employment schemes is sufficient to absorb the number of unemployed we have in the country, or what number of them he hopes to absorb into employment through the working of those particular schemes during the coming year; whether, during the working of the Inter-Departmental Committee, that Committee followed the rise or fall in the numbers of unemployed in the country as it occurred, or whether their report was based upon the numbers of unemployed returned by the employment exchanges during the time that the Employment Period Orders were in operation, or whether they had reference to the numbers of unemployed at the worst period of the year, namely, in the winter time, when the numbers reached, I might say, a record figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on that, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would tell us whether the Inter-Departmental Committee, in examining the whole unemployment position, and in examining the schemes which they hoped would absorb those unemployed, took into consideration the numbers of unemployed who were emigrating to Great Britain and, if so, what allowance they made regarding those numbers; whether the Government took any steps to ascertain the number of unemployed, both men and women, who have gone to Britain within, say, the last 12 months, and whether the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to give us even an approximate figure in that regard; whether it is the policy of the Government to encourage that emigration; and whether the Government hope that, as a result of the expenditure of this £2,500,000, plus the emigration to Britain, they will be able to make an impression on the unemployment position in this country?  In regard to the question as to whether we are to take it that it is the policy of the Government to encourage the unemployed to emigrate to Great Britain, I ask it because of an article which appeared to-day in the organ which is controlled and <Col N="743" /> directed by the President of the Executive Council.  In that article the following phrases occur:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To our great surprise we have seen Mr. Frank MacDermot joining in the new form of accusation brought by the Fine Gael Party against the Government, namely, that there has been an increase in the number of young people from the Free State who are crossing to England and Scotland in the hope of obtaining work there.... What we would like to know is, what fault Mr. MacDermot has to find with this state of things and what complaint does he bring against the Government in respect of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on in the same article we are informed that the Government has endeavoured to deal with the situation&mdash;that is, the unemployment situation&mdash;but that, &ldquo;in spite of its efforts there were a number of people for whom employment was not available.&rdquo; There were.  There were something in the neighbourhood of about 145,000 people for whom employment was not available.  The article then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now as a result of the rearmament programme which is being carried out in Great Britain and on which upwards of £100,000,000 a year is being spent, there is a great shortage of certain kinds of labour there and employers are only too willing to avail of the service of Irish workmen.  To meet this demand young men are proceeding to Great Britain knowing the wages and the conditions which they might expect.  Who could blame them for doing so?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a very strange question to ask, in view of certain very recent tragic happenings in this country.  The article continues as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But that an Imperialist such as Mr. MacDermot&mdash;we hope we are doing him no wrong in thus labelling him&mdash;should raise his voice to lament that this is taking place really makes it difficult for us to follow the workings of his mind or <Col N="744" /> to understand what he is aiming at.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And I want to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention particularly to the last sentence of the article, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Would he have kept the would-be emigrants at home and were they to remain on the dole when the opportunity of finding work had presented itself to them?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, now, there have been many changes of front by the Government and the Party opposite in the last four years, but I am doubtful if that could be bettered.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us whether, in response to the appeals made by his Inter-Departmental Committee for schemes to be submitted to him, any scheme was submitted by the headquarters of the Fianna Fáil organisation?</P>
    <P>May I ask him if the Fianna Fáil organisation submitted to his Inter-Departmental Committee that famous plan they had worked out four years ago, which was to give employment to, I think, 84,601 persons; and, if it was not submitted to him voluntarily, did he, as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee and as a member of that Party, and as one of the persons who had secured election to this House on that particular plan, ask for it; and, if so, would he say if it is included in the report or series of reports made by his Committee to the Government; and will he say whether, upon examination, the plan was found to be watertight and whether he was satisfied that, having examined it, it was possible to give employment to the number of people that we were told would be given work?  My reason for asking that is that it seems now as if the plan was not watertight, because now we are faced with the situation that, not only are we not to be in a position to bring back from America those of our race, who had to emigrate, to fill the positions, as we were told, for which we would not have enough idle hands at home, but that, notwithstanding the plan, plus the two years' labour of the Parliamentary Secretary and his Committee, plus all the promises, plus all the new industries and <Col N="745" /> the tariffs and the duties, and plus all the subsidised crops, we now have the Government organ advising the young men of this country to go to Britain to get employment there, because there are good wages and good conditions there and because £100,000,000 a year are being spent on rearmament alone in that country.  I suggest that that is a hopeless and final confession of the deceit that was practised in order to put the Government of this country where they are to-day&mdash;a deceit practised particularly on the unemployed of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to carry that any further at present, but I should like to get something definite from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the expenditure of this money.  I should like to know how much of the amount set aside does he hope to expend in the current year; how many men, approximately&mdash;I know that it would not be possible for him to give a definite figure, and I only want an approximate figure&mdash;does he hope to put into employment; and can he give us any idea of the average period&mdash; again, I do not suppose that anybody could give more than an average figure&mdash;in which there will be employment? Can he tell us when the first works, to be paid for out of these moneys, will be started&mdash;whether it will be this month, next month, or in the next three months&mdash;and what steps, if any, have been taken with regard to the amount to be provided by local authorities&mdash;the £825,000&mdash; and then I should like to get some assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary regarding the wages and conditions of the employment that is to be given.  What are the hours to be worked?  How far will men have to travel to their work and from their work, and, what is much more important, what will the rate of wages be? I am not at all happy in my mind, so far as the rate of wages are concerned, that the Parliamentary Secretary should be in control of the expenditure of this money.  I doubt if any member of the Labour Party is happy in his mind that the Parliamentary Secretary should be in control of that expenditure.  I doubt if there is <Col N="746" /> a trade union in the country that is satisfied, and I doubt if any unemployed man in the country is very happy in his mind either about this, because we cannot forget that the Parliamentary Secretary is the person who told us in this House that the man who would stand between an unemployed person and a wage of 21/- a week would be torn limb from limb. We are entitled to know if that is still the mentality or the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the wages to be paid to men employed on these schemes.  We are entitled to a clear and definite statement on this matter at the beginning of the scheme, and I hope we shall get it, and I hope it will be far removed from that 21/- per week.</P>
    <P>Those are just a few of the points, Sir, that I want to make in connection with this matter, and on which I hope we shall get some information from the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying.  I know that, perhaps, it is not easy for the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with some of them, because a great number of points of detail have been raised upon what I might call his own two Estimates&mdash; the main Estimates, Nos. 10 and 11&mdash; but I do suggest to him that Vote No. 73 is perhaps for this House and the people outside, the most important Vote, and I think he would do a good deal to satisfy the minds of those who are hoping to get employment as a result of this Estimate if he would answer, so far as he can, the points which I have put to him.</P>
    <P>I have said that it was not my intention to delay the House or to indulge in any repetition or bring in any points which are, in my opinion, unnecessary, or which might cloud the question at issue.  However, there is one matter that I should like to draw attention to in connection with what Deputy John Flynn said when he was urging the claims of Kerry.  Of course, it is quite right and proper for Deputy Flynn, as a representative of Kerry, to urge the claims of his own constituency, but he told us that Kerry was in the happy position that there were comparatively few people there drawing unemployment assistance.  I am just wondering <Col N="747" /> whether that is the normal position there or whether it obtains only from the 2nd of June last when the Unemployment Period Order came into operation, and whether the Deputy can inform the House what proportion of the 41,000 who were laid off under that Order and who would be deprived of their unemployment assistance, are in Kerry?  Can Deputy Flynn or any other Deputy in the House tell us what is the proportion of that 41,000 who have been deprived of unemployment assistance and deemed to be at work? Can any Deputy tell us what proportion of these people will get no unemployment assistance?  I am afraid that, so far as the vast majority are concerned, there will be no work for these people between now and the expiration of the Unemployment Period Order in next October.  If the position is such as Deputy Flynn would lead the House to believe, that there are comparatively few people in receipt of unemployment assistance, then we can only come to the conclusion that Kerry is well off in that respect.  I hope that is so, but I am extremely doubtful.  Perhaps the explanation would be, according to what we are told, that out of Kerry have gone to Great Britain in the last 12 months more men than from any other county in the Free State.  That statement has been made fairly freely, and many Deputies have heard it.  I take it that it is quite possible, if you take the number of people deprived of unemployment assistance, that numbers who despaired of getting work in this country anticipated the Period Order by finding work in the country with which we are supposed to be at war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F. Crowley Mr. F. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the formula for allocating this relief scheme is based more or less on the number drawing unemployment assistance in the different areas.  About two years ago the basis of allocation was on the valuation per head of the population. I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that while the number drawing unemployment assistance would be a good guide it should not be a hard and fast rule.  I mention that particularly, because I am afraid the working <Col N="748" /> of the Unemployment Assistance Act is not very satisfactory in some districts. The reason for this is that the officials responsible for calculating the income derived from small farms in congested districts and mountainy districts put it at too high a figure, with the result that in many districts very few are drawing this money.  I admit that a large number are on the border line, and that if their income was a little less they would be entitled to unemployment assistance.  If you adopt the method of basing the calculation on the number drawing &ldquo;the dole&rdquo; you are presupposing that the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act is perfect.  It turns out that the Act is not working in that way, and particular areas will be penalised by not getting a share of the £2,500,000.  I strongly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to strike the happy medium by adopting the formula of valuation per head of the population plus the number drawing unemployment assistance.  If he decides on the number of registered unemployed in a district without taking cognisance of the valuation per head of the population, let the rule be elastic when considering the allocation of money to congested districts, mountainy areas and along the seaboard.  I also ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take particular note of schemes put up by county councils, because I am satisfied that county councils know the different works that could be carried out.  In order to strengthen my point I may mention that the Department of Local Government has already recognised that the income derived by farmers living in these areas was calculated on too high a basis, and that Department is now more sympathetic where people are applying for old age pensions.  If one Department does that I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary will, when allocating the Relief Fund, deal generously and sympathetically with the people living where the valuations are low.</P>

      <P>In connection with minor relief schemes, Deputies apply to have schemes carried out, and get in touch with the Board of Works in order to interest them in relief work to be done in different areas, but I consider it <Col N="749" /> rather an anomaly that when the Department in its wisdom determines what work is the most suitable, having regard to the means available in a particular year, people outside are put in possession of information before Deputies as to what work has been sanctioned or has been put on the long finger.  In due course, if a scheme is sanctioned the county surveyors are notified, but whatever the reason, the Board of Works still consider it wise, even at that juncture, to withhold the information from Deputies.  That causes serious inconvenience to Deputies, and I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that if there is not a very good reason for withholding information about schemes that have been determined on, he might reconsider his attitude.  It causes serious inconvenience to Deputies when they are unable to tell their constituents whether a particular scheme that was advocated has been sanctioned or not. I do not see why Deputies should be put in an inferior position to that of county surveyors or other people who eventually carry out the work.  I do not see what difficulty could arise if all the necessary information was made available to Deputies, as to what works were determined on and when they were going to be put into operation. I desire also to call attention to an item in connection with the Department of Industry and Commerce regarding the reconstruction of the premises of the Employment Exchange at Limerick.  Premises were taken over for the administration of the Unemployment Assistance Act and Unemployment Insurance.  The officials were transferred from the old headquarters because of the expiration of the lease or some other reason.  I notice that the amount of money voted for the completion of the premises has not been exhausted, and that the old portion is in the same state it was in when a brewery firm evacuated it. Seeing the money was available I am at a loss to understand why it was not possible to have the necessary work carried out, and to have the offices put into a habitable condition for the staff and for the public.  The offices now occupied by the staff are absolutely unsuitable for work in any <Col N="750" /> branch of the Civil Service or for the public who have recourse to them. Both internally and externally the premises badly need painting.  They were reconstructed but the staff had to go into them after the builders, and I am amazed that the money to complete them was not exhausted.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will take the necessary steps to see that the staff is put into decent offices and that they are made suitable for those who have recourse to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Morrissey correctly interpreted the remarks of Deputy John Flynn in the matter to which he referred.  At least, my interpretation of Deputy Flynn's remarks was that he was supporting to a certain extent the remarks I made on the Vote previously when I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that a too rigid application of these regulations or standing too pat to the fact that the unemployment assistance system is working 100 per cent. correctly, is bound to lead to hardships in the case of people who are not fortunate enough to secure the highest standard of unemployment assistance or the standard that would qualify them for work under the new scheme.  I agree with Deputy Flynn that various hardships are being caused by a too rigid application of that rule.  As I stated previously the line has to be drawn somewhere by the Minister, but a good deal of elasticity should be allowed for so that hardship will not be inflicted on persons who would not be qualified for work under the new scheme if it were too rigidly enforced.  I think Deputy Morrissey did not correctly interpret the remarks of Deputy Flynn in that regard.  His plea, and mine, is that there should be more elasticity in the matter of these relief works.  I think it would be advisable if the Parliamentary Secretary could see his way to fix a lower standard than 6/- so as to make it possible for men who are receiving a lesser stipend from unemployment assistance to avail of work available in their locality.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider this as a question of human beings who are unemployed rather than as a question <Col N="751" /> of how much he is going to save by enforcing these regulations.  That would be a much more humane method of dealing with the problem and would lead to much more harmonious administration of these schemes throughout the country.  I do not desire to detain the House further, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give sympathetic consideration to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate for Minor Relief Schemes, I desire to say that very sympathetic consideration has been given by the Board of Works to the proposals put up by me and by the County Council.  I am aware of the conditions governing the issue of grants for minor relief schemes.  I know that the existence of poverty is the principal factor taken into consideration in determining the amount of the grant to be given to any particular area.  Many proposals that have been submitted from County Meath have not been selected by the Board of Works for schemes.  Although they may have been pigeon-holed, perhaps a very good reason exists for so doing.  Schemes may have been started in other districts in which work was more urgently required.  I hold that there is no need at the present time for the introduction of any novel schemes in the county I represent. The schemes that have been carried out during the last couple of years have given general satisfaction.  One of these schemes was a minor drainage scheme in an area where the small farmers had their lands flooded.  In ordinary circumstances that drainage scheme would be considered uneconomic. The Parliamentary Secretary devoted some of the minor relief money to the drainage of these lands, and as a result wonderful relief has been given to the ratepayers, without any corresponding contribution from the people who benefited.  I think such schemes are 100 per cent. productive from the point of view of relief of unemployment.  The labour content is very high indeed Money was also allocated for schemes such as the repair of accommodation roads and laneways leading to ratepayers' houses.  These <Col N="752" /> roads were made passable and conferred very considerable advantage on a large section of the community.  I merely mention these facts in passing and so as to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary for a continuation of these schemes.  I believe these schemes are very desirable and extremely useful from every aspect. They are carried out at a period of the year when agricultural and other work is fairly slack, namely, in the winter time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer&mdash;the question of accommodation for motor traffic at the Hill of Tara.  Tourist traffic was mentioned last evening in the discussion on this Vote.  Tourists are now being induced to visit places of interest and national monuments in this country. It is found that many tourists coming to this country desire to visit the Hill of Tara because of its historical associations&mdash;its associations with our pagan history and the history of the early.  Christian period, and perhaps also because it contains the bones of the pikemen who were slaughtered there in 1798.  Because of its historical associations in many ways, tourists are coming there in increasing numbers. The transport companies are including a visit to Tara in their itinerary, with the result that at certain periods of the year and on Sundays and holidays there is a huge congestion of traffic there.  Oftentimes the roads are blocked with cars so that people cannot pass along these roads. I do not suggest for a moment that any of the ancient landmarks should be defaced or that any act of vandalism should be carried out in order to relieve this congestion.  I do not even suggest that any of the roads leading to Tara, which are very narrow, should be widened if they have any historic interest.  The Board of Works has erected sign-posts on the Hill of Tara pointing out the various places of interest for the convenience of tourists, but I notice they have not marked out the point where the five roads converge on the hill.  I suggest that, without in any way interfering with the ancient landmarks, some provision should be made in the vicinity of the cross-roads <Col N="753" /> at the existing village, for a general parking place for buses and other vehicles.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have an inspection carried out so that he might be furnished with a report as to the arrangement that would be most advisable.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary, in his usually generous spirit, will consider the matter.  Tara is, after all, a national monument.  I believe all Deputies would be interested in providing facilities for visitors to the Royal Hill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of this particular opportunity to obtain from the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government some statement as to their intentions regarding the serious problem of unemployment. Grants that have been made annually, up to the present, have been confined to the relief of persons in receipt of a certain amount of unemployment assistance.  Grants, in many cases, have been given on the understanding that the local authorities, by way of loan, or whatever means they can possibly devise, raise about 50 per cent. of the cost of the scheme.  We have had experience of relief schemes where the material and carters wages had to be provided out of local finances, because the grants made from central funds only reached the pockets of unemployed persons who were in receipt of not less than 9/6 per week.  Not only did that deprive able-bodied single young men, who have in many cases large numbers of dependents, of any benefit, but it also deprived many men with young families from benefit simply because they were not in receipt of more than 9/6 per week.  I think that is grossly unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some statements made by the Government Party to the effect that there should be no distinction made in the allocation of work to unemployed people.  There was great exception taken to the action of the late Government when it laid down certain preferential conditions for ex-National Army men. That has been done away with, we are glad to know.  But we would like to know why other conditions have been substituted.  Why should there be any <Col N="754" /> distinction established?  There are masses of able-bodied people only too anxious to get work but they are denied it.  Many of these, in receipt of less than 9/6 have been suspended from unemployment assistance benefit on the ground that they were not genuinely seeking work.  They are put off unemployment assistance on the ground that they are not seeking work, and when work is provided, they are not allowed to enter into employment.</P>
    <P>We have, unfortunately, reached the alarming total of six figures showing the number of people unemployed.  If all those people denied the right to register were added, the figures would alarm us still further.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will make some statement on this matter that will meet with general approval and will bring some help to the people I have referred to.  The Unemployment Period Orders have deprived many people of assistance.</P>
    <P>Many people in rural districts have no knowledge of agricultural work even if it was available for them.  I was speaking to a tradesman who cannot get work at his trade and has been denied unemployment assistance because he is living in a rural area. He knows no more about agricultural work than about watchmaking.  There are many useful branches of work, in which employment might be given, that ought to be considered by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think a lot of time is wasted in deciding whether a scheme is suitable or not. I think any work that could be found in these rural districts, so long as it will give any return and enables people to be put to work, is good.  In passing, may I express the hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will indicate his intention of increasing the rate of wages paid in the past on minor relief schemes, and will raise them, at least, to the level of the ordinary road workers.  The rate at present paid to road workers, considering the present cost of living, is inadequate.  I think people who have to come under the relief schemes should receive the same as people engaged on road work by the county council.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to some matters <Col N="755" /> in connection with my native city.  We have there the old city wall and some monuments.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not indicate that he would bring these under the care of his Department.  I ask him, on this occasion, to reconsider the matter. The Corporation of Kilkenny had out-stepped their borrowing powers in respect to schemes, prior to the present Government coming into office. Our commitments now are such that we find it impossible to touch any of these works.  The old city wall is regarded by the Antiquarian Society, and people who take an interest in these things, as a very interesting national monument, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider having some attention paid by his Department to that old monument. In conclusion, I would again refer to the question of wages paid on these relief schemes, and express the hope that people willing to work on these schemes should get their share of employment under them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put a few points very briefly.  I think it is well understood in the House that all of us are most anxious, in our capacity as business men, to do everything possible to help the unemployed people in our area.  For that reason it is rather humiliating, whether through want of time or pressure of business, that we are not able to tell the unemployed people about certain grants and other matters appertaining to their needs when they come to interview us.  I would make a suggestion&mdash;I do not know whether it would cause a lot of unnecessary work but I think it would be useful if adopted&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary should devise some scheme by which Deputies, at all events, would receive a comprehensive list of the grants for their counties, or some other information, setting out the amount of the grant and the particular type of work to which the grant is allocated. I can never myself get a grasp at all properly of these grants.  I learn something about them in one place but I cannot get any information in another.  Some of us may not have <Col N="756" /> very much time to go from Department to Department.</P>
      <P>We are anxious to do our part honestly and sincerely.  I do not know whether, in connection with this new scheme, the question of old burial grounds has been considered.  I think that a certain allowance might be made from the Unemployment Vote for this purpose.  Every one of our citizens desires that the old burial grounds should be attended to.  In every county in which one travels, one sees old and historic burial grounds in a shocking state.  To see our burial grounds in this state makes us feel ashamed of the manner in which we treat our dead. Some of these burial grounds have gone far beyond the stage at which sufficient local money could be found to bring them into a desirable state.  I suggest that, as the result of inspection or report, a contribution might be made from the Unemployment Vote for this purpose.  I dislike making any remarks on the question of unemployment lest it should be regarded as for purely selfish purposes or other rotten reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielCorkery" hpid="Mr. Corkery Mr. Corkery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corkery</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words as to the allocation of grants for relief schemes.  I believe that the allocation last year was not entirely fair to the poorer districts or the mountain areas.  While the people in these areas are supposed to have farms on which a valuation is placed, they are in reality in very poor circumstances.  The possession of land in some cases prevents them from qualifying for unemployment assistance.  That was very much against them last year as regards relief schemes.  I believe that no man in this House or in the country is more sympathetic to the people living in those areas than the Parliamentary Secretary.  Even if £50 or £100 were spent in those areas, it would be a great God-send to the people.  The spending of a little more money would be a great help to them.  They are in the position that their families, in most cases, are fairly large, and they find it hard to get work for their sons and daughters.  Unlike Deputy Morrissey, I can say that there are not so many emigrating from Cork County.  From a few areas there may be, but the people, on the whole, are trying to live <Col N="757" /> and struggle on.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to spend a little more money on these districts this year, so as to improve the conditions of the people.</P>
      <P>As regards drainage schemes, a number of these schemes could, in my opinion, be worked more economically if the work were done in the summer and autumn, or even in the spring, rather than in the winter time.  This would be more comfortable for the people working on these schemes and they could give a better return for the money expended.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see that the amount spent in the mountain districts will be increased this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It will, I think, be admitted by everybody that the task set the Parliamentary Secretary is a very difficult one.  Nobody envies him his position.  Some of the problems confronting him as regards unemployment seem to be insurmountable.  For that reason he can, I think, be assured of the co-operation of all the public bodies.  When he is replying, I hope he will give some indication of the schemes which local authorities might be expected to send up in connection with this £2,500,000 grant.  When the Committee of which the Parliamentary Secretary is Chairman was set up a couple of years ago, public bodies and individual citizens were asked to suggest schemes which had not hitherto been undertaken by local authorities.  Local authorities are wondering if that is still the policy of the Government.  Various public bodies with which I am in touch are considering certain schemes to be sent to the Government in an effort to co-operate with them in dealing with this unemployment problem.  In view of the fact that that circular was sent out some time ago, they are rather in a quandary as to what schemes would be entertained by the Government.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would also indicate the proportion of the cost of each scheme which a public body will be expected to find.  In an effort to help the Government and to help their own districts, local bodies raised in recent years a good deal of money and spent a good deal of money out of their <Col N="758" /> current finances.  This has resulted in a narrowing of the borrowing powers of these local bodies.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, for that reason, he should be as liberal as possible in connection with the schemes he has in mind.  A great many of the schemes undertaken by local authorities could have been delayed for a longer period.  I refer to the laying of water pipes and sewers.  That work could have been deferred, but, owing to the fact that local authorities wanted to co-operate with the Government and help the unemployed in their areas, these schemes were undertaken.  The result is that local authorities have now very limited borrowing powers. The Minister for Finance in his Budget statement gave us the impression from the figures he quoted that local authorities would be expected to find a maximum of one-third of the cost.  One hopes that the proportion will not go beyond one-third.</P>
      <P>As regards relief schemes in rural areas, there are great complaints as to people being asked to travel too far to certain jobs.  I have had my attention drawn within the last few days to men who are asked to travel distances of from seven to ten miles to take part in relief schemes.  I have known these men to have been hard working men in the past, men who were always anxious to work and I think it is too much to insist on a man of that kind being asked to walk seven to ten miles to his work under the threat that he would lose unemployment benefit.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to arrive at some maximum distance over which a man should not be asked to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred to people who will not come within the scope of being given any work that is being carried out through the relief grant. He referred of course to men who have been put off the benefit list of the Labour Exchange, men who are described as not genuinely seeking employment.  Whilst I am in agreement with the Ministry that the man who is not inclined to work should not be given the dole, that the man who is an idler should not be given benefit, I do suggest that an unfair advantage has been taken, perhaps <Col N="759" /> unconsciously, by some Labour Exchanges in dealing with cases of this kind.  It is virtually impossible for a good number of men to obtain work in various districts in the country at the present moment owing to various reasons.  On many occasions a decent man who had always worked hard may be brought before the Court of Referees in connection with his application for unemployment benefit. That man may become very embarrassed, so much so as perhaps to prejudice his position in the eyes of the Court of Referees.  I suggest that is the position and it is only right that a great many of these people should have their cases reviewed.  As the position stands at the moment when a grant is given to a district the first men taken off are those in receipt of the highest amount of benefit.  I understand that when that grade is exhausted if the job is a long one a start is made at the higher point of the list again, which means that in the case of people who have been put off the Exchange as designated not genuinely seeking work, their turn will never come so far as employment or a grant is concerned. I suggest that a great many of these people have been put off the Exchange.  I am not saying that the Government has done that deliberately. But I say that their cases should be reviewed.  When these people are put off the list they are prevented from signing up.  The result is that they cannot make any claim which will entitle them to benefit or to work when a grant is available. I want to refer again to the proportion of money which public bodies are expected to put up for new schemes.  I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that the public bodies have put up a greater proportion of the money, in proportion to their means, than have the Government in recent years.  I suggest that under these new schemes the public bodies should get off lighter.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question about an item which appears here, that is the provision of a new Gárda barracks at Wexford town.  For the past two or three years <Col N="760" /> I have been raising this matter here. On this occasion I notice here a sum of £4,000 which is supposed to be spent this year on this work.  The total estimate for the completion of the barracks is £8,250.  As I pointed out last year and the year before the conditions under which the Gárda are living in Wexford town are certainly appalling and not at all what one would expect a Gárda barracks to be. Certainly, the environment under which the Gárda are living in Wexford town is something not calculated to give people any confidence in the work of the Gárda.  There should be some advertence to the environment. These barracks have been repeatedly condemned by people from the Gárda headquarters and by people from the Board of Works who have agreed that they are not anything at all like what they should be.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he would tell me what is being done this year and whether he is making a serious effort to start this work.  I understand that a site has been secured.  I hope that something will be done with it immediately.</P>
    <P>Another matter which affects my constituency is the question of dredging at Courtown Harbour.  A certain amount of dredging has been done in Courtown Harbour within the last 18 months.  But there is the danger that what has been done will prove to be abortive unless help is forthcoming from the Government.  I do not mean financial help, because they have already agreed to contribute their proportion towards the work to be done. But requests have been sent from the County Council asking that a dredger should be sent there.  Complaints have been made by various local bodies in the matter, but up to the moment nothing has been done.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is very much interested in harbour works, and I ask him to see that the dredger is sent there, because, if not, much of the money spent will be wasted.  I would like to have some definite answers about the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>My contribution will not be long.  I rise to renew my application to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="761" /> for work of a useful character in Ballyrichard Road, in the Carrick-on-Suir urban area.  Deputy Dillon, on this Vote this evening, talked about <i>cul-de-sacs,</i> but the work which I am putting forward is not a <i>cul-de-sac</i> but a very important work.  I put this already before the Parliamentary Secretary and before the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. I then said that the condition of that road was a perfect disgrace, and I repeat that statement now.  If the Parliamentary Secretary looks at the files he will find that the problem of unemployment is very acute in the area about which I am speaking.  At the moment I have a letter in my pocket from a man who was taken off the unemployment assistance, but perhaps it would not be relevant to refer to it here.  I only rise to renew my application in connection with this Vote for the work to which I am referring. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give me some assurance that something will be done.  He will find, if he consults the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, that there are items on the files in connection with it.  I certainly think the Parliamentary Secretary should give this matter his immediate attention so that it would be done immediately.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the necessity for some more consideration for marine works in Galway.  During the past three or four years I have submitted a number of these works to the Parliamentary Secretary.  At the present moment I think it is the intention of the Government to give a little more care to this type of work than in the past.  At least I hope so.  I do not think it is quite satisfactory that the suitability of these proposals should be decided on the report from the Department of Fisheries.  In a number of cases these piers and harbours to which I am referring are used largely for the turf trade, especially in Connemara, and it is obvious that a report from the Department of Fisheries as to the suitability of work in reference to a matter of that kind would not be <Col N="762" /> favourable.  There are also little coves and inlets around the coast in which there are neither piers nor harbours. In these cases something is needed for the men who are engaged in the lobster fisheries.  Very often at the entrance to these coves there are submerged or semi-submerged rocks.  I do not know of any type of marine work so necessary or one that can be done so cheaply as the blasting of these rocks.  You will find problems of that kind practically every few miles along the coast.</P>
      <P>There again I think the report from the Department of Fisheries is not quite satisfactory, because I do not think it takes into account fishing operations carried out at such places. There is a very general desire for blasting work of that kind.  I have submitted several proposals of the kind, but, unfortunately, in one or two cases on the day on which the inspector paid his visit the weather happened to be very bad and he seemed to think the job was too difficult.  I would impress strongly on the Parliamentary Secretary the importance of repairing old piers and extending them and making slipways, particularly where they are used for the purpose of the turf trade.  I know one or two areas in which a considerable turf trade could be built up if these facilities were available.  I should also like to know what has become of the proposals sent in to the Inter-Departmental Committee on Public Works. Personally, I sent in a good many, but I have not heard anything more about them.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Corish, I am very anxious to know in what way this contribution from local authorities will be demanded.  Is the Board of Works going to put up schemes and ask the local authorities to make certain contributions to them, or are the local authorities to be asked to put up schemes themselves?  Will the contributions be mandatory; will there be some regulation made by the Local Government Department by which the local authorities will have to do that? Personally, I know that local authorities are very intrigued as to the <Col N="763" /> position.  Their rates are pretty high at present, and they are finding it hard to collect them.  They do not care to face a situation which would involve a very definite and huge increase in the rates if they are to make a contribution of £825,000.  I believe, of course, that the Parliamentary Secretary or somebody, when the announcement was first made, had at the back of his head some kind of scheme whereby he would either compel or induce local authorities to make a contribution to that extent.  That has not been disclosed as far as I know.  We are anxious to know what the scheme is, and what local authorities are expected to do; whether it is going to be voluntary or mandatory.  It is time that local authorities were made wise about the matter.</P>
      <P>Another matter I want to refer to comes under the heading of national monuments.  There is an old building in Roscommon, called Roscommon Abbey, which the county council, the board of health, and everybody who has any authority over the building, for quite a number of years past has been asking the Board of Works to take over as a national monument.  In the Abbey rest the remains of King Phelim O'Conor, in a famous tomb with some very fine stonework, which was, I think, portrayed in our schoolbooks. At present the place is very much neglected and is, in fact, an eyesore. I do not know whether there is any legal enactment which prevents the Board of Works taking it over.  Somebody did whisper at one time that there was something like that.  I do not know whether there is or not, but whatever it is, it could be made right, and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to sub-head E (1)&mdash;Land Improvements Acts&mdash;I see the sum provided this year is reduced from £581 to £86. I want to know if land improvement is not going ahead.  Is there no borrowing from the Board of Works for that purpose, or is it all carried out by the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  Is it a question of substitution or a question <Col N="764" /> of people not doing any work in the way of improvements?</P>
    <P>As Deputy Corish said, I do not think any Deputy envies the Parliamentary Secretary the job he has in providing for the unemployed.  I certainly do not want any words of mine to cause him any embarrassment. A suggested work, however, has been referred to the Board of Works recently from North Roscommon which would, I think, absorb an enormous amount of manual labour, and that is the taking up of rock out of the bed of the Tinacarra river.  The case which is being put up to the Parliamentary Secretary is that this is in connection with the Lough Gara drainage scheme, which I am afraid, from the reply I got to-day on the matter, is not very hopeful of early execution.  Neither will the scheme be economic as it stands, if the sinking of the Tinacarra river was done, apart from the drainage scheme, it would have the effect of absorbing quite a large amount of manual labour, because the rock is of the type which will have to be taken out by hand.  In addition, the Lough Gara drainage scheme would be, if not made economic, at least put in such a position that it would be approved of by the people.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give the matter sympathetic consideration, and I hope he will also give some information as to the position of the local authorities, and in what way they are supposed to make the contribution of £825,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Various Deputies have asked what the arrangement is by which this money will be distributed. That is a very pertinent and proper question with which we could not deal until the Vote is through.  There are a whole lot of things we could not do until then.  We cannot even make preparation in relation to a great many of these schemes until the Vote is through, and the sooner we get it through the better.  Broadly speaking, the arrangement is that the local authorities will be met through the Local Government Department as previously.  As everybody is aware, it has been in the past a matter of negotiation between the local authorities and the Local Government Department <Col N="765" /> as to how the money shall be contributed and how much.  The Local Government Department in arranging the contribution from the different local authorities will do it, I need hardly say, in full knowledge of the actual position of these authorities. There have been public health schemes in which the whole cost has been met from central sources.  There have been cases in which the contribution has only been 25 per cent.  It depends entirely on the condition of different local authorities and in some cases on the urgency of the work. That principle will still remain.  As far as public health works are concerned, they will come up in the ordinary way to the Local Government Department.</P>
      <P>As we propose to do this year, if we are fortunate, probably three times as much public health work as has been done in any year previously, there is going to be a considerable opportunity for the clearing off of arrears of public health work.  You very often come across the case&mdash;I personally come across it very often&mdash; of Deputies in different parts of the House urging a particular public health scheme.  When I go back on the lists I find that the particular county council has already 30 or 40 works ahead of it in order of preference. Now, under this scheme there will be an opportunity to clear away a good deal of that.  That will be a matter for negotiation with the Department of Local Government.  We have already received from the Department of Local Government, for the purposes of sanction under this scheme, proposals up to a very considerable amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probable that something in the neighbourhood of £400,000 is going to be spent on urban roads.  All these figures, I may say, are tentative.  I do not want anybody to think&mdash;and from my experience on this Vote I have no reason to anticipate it&mdash;that we are giving them cast-iron figures. We are not.  We are giving just the best estimate that we can.  It will depend on whether works which are desirable in the order of their desirability will fall into areas in which there is a necessity factor.  As I have <Col N="766" /> said, we intend to spend something in the neighbourhood of £400,000 on urban roads.  That is largely because the urban districts are districts in which it is very difficult indeed to find suitable works.  Where we can substitute a public health work for an urban road, we like to do it, because we can always do the urban road afterwards. In connection with these works we think that we ought to be able to get a contribution on a 50-50 basis from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We hope to spend £200,000 all over the country in clearing sites in advance for housing.  That work will all be for the benefit of the local authority.  It will mean relieving it of its ordinary obligations in relation to that class of work, and there, again, we will require a very definite contribution which will be negotiated by the Department of Local Government, having regard both to the necessities of the district for housing and to the capacity of the district to bear its share in meeting it.  Last year I think we had about £120,000 worth of minor relief schemes.  We hope to do two or three times that amount this year, if we can.  That is going to represent a very considerable difficulty in the sense that, to some extent, in certain districts we have already saturated our local authorities&mdash;that is to say, the local surveyors and so on&mdash;with work.  In all probability it will mean, if this large scheme is to be carried out, that the local authorities which will be asked to undertake it as our agents will have to strengthen their own resources for the purpose.  There is not the faintest use in anyone thinking that we can get two quarts out of a pint pot.  If this scheme is to be carried out it means that there is going to be considerably more staff required both at headquarters and in the districts in which the work is actually being carried out.</P>
    <P>The amount of expenditure which will take place under this Vote, and the efficiency of the expenditure under it, will depend very largely upon the quality and the adequacy of the staff which is made available for the purpose.  All that I can say is that we will do all it is humanly possible to do in the matter.  Mentally, <Col N="767" /> we are allocating £100,000 for a peat development scheme.  Unfortunately, peat development schemes are nearly as bad as public health schemes in this respect: that they do not always fall in the districts in which you want to do them for public relief purposes. I have heard complaints in the House to-day from Deputies representing different constituencies in relation to peat schemes which certainly would never have gone into their constituencies on a merely employment basis. There, again, as in relation to public health schemes, we have to take the middle way.  We cannot rigidly enforce the unemployment factor.  We do it as far as it is humanly possible.  I can say quite deliberately that all the efforts of the Department will be directed to see that as large a proportion as possible of this total sum is expended in the most efficient way to deal with actual distress and unemployment where they exist and at the time they exist.  While we will take into account the other factor&mdash; the desirability of public works and the rest&mdash;we do intend to try as far as possible to railroad it to the poor where they need it.</P>
    <P>Last year we spent about £26,000 under the general heading of the Department of Agriculture.  That included land reclamation, the expenditure on which was roughly £10,000 or £12,000.  That was the sum spent over the whole of the Saorstát for land reclamation.  This year we hope to spend at least that amount in the Gaeltacht districts alone, and that is not proposed to be the end of the expenditure.  To the extent to which adequate and efficient machinery can be set up to deal with it, we hope to extend the ambit of land reclamation. Deputy Dillon raised the question of farm improvements.  I remember he raised this question a couple of years ago when I told him it was already before the inter-departmental committee.  It has been dealt with in a very careful manner indeed.  The recommendations in relation to it from that committee are favourable.  It is a question for experience and practice to know how far that can be extended. At any rate it is going to be tried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  At the present moment Deputies would be wiser not to submit their schemes.  The Deputy can see the difficulty that the Central Authority will have in selecting particular schemes to be done.  He can see the practical impossibility of any individual Deputy putting forward a scheme of that kind without running up against difficulties.  I think it would be much better to allow the scheme to develop from experience until we are in a position to say that the co-operation and advice of Deputies in that matter will be asked for, as it is in other matters. As the Minister for Finance reminds me, this is the purely experimental phase.  We think that the only method of approach to this is not to lay down anything definite, but to approach it tentatively, to try to discover by experiment what are the actual difficulties that are there, and the best method for their economic solution.  The inspection of very considerable public schemes of this kind can involve a good deal of trouble. It will be necessary to evolve an administrative system which will enable that work to be done economically and efficiently.  Every possible thought is being given to that, but it is recognised, in fact, to be a difficult problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget speech a sum of about £200,000 made up of £100,000 from the Road Fund and £100,000 to be raised by way of local contributions, will be used specifically for the purpose of developing roads in the western and tourist districts There again it is a question for the Local Government Department, in co-operation with the different county councils, to work out and put up to us a, scheme for the spending of that money.  When all these different schemes of one kind or another are put forward and are co-ordinated, then we will be in a position, in so <Col N="769" /> far as one can be in this matter, to attempt to see that there is as fair a distribution as possible, having regard to the variety of factors connected with the work.</P>
    <P>One very serious matter which we are running up against every day is that where what you might call really desirable public works turn up, they seem invariably to turn up in areas in which there is no real demand, no relatively just demand, on the Central Fund for unemployment expenditure.  My experience of that has been almost tragic. I have almost begun to believe that big schemes, high labour factor schemes, seem to have an automatic abhorrence of the places where we want them.  If Deputies will look at the map which we have put up outside, which is based upon the unemployment assistance register, and if they will keep in mind a previous map which showed the valuation per head of the agricultural population in each of the electoral areas, they will find as nearly as possible the distribution that there ought to be of money if it was upon the basis of need, if the money which the Dáil has put in our hands was to be expended specifically for the purpose of efficiently reducing distress where it existed.  If they will then mentally compare that map with what they know of available public schemes of a large character, they will see how real the difficulty is.  All I can say is, and I believe I say it to a House which is entirely sympathetic, that we propose to meet those difficulties as we find them and solve them to the best of our abilities.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with some of the points which have been raised, and in many cases I need hardly say that some of the points have arisen two or three times, being put forward by different Deputies.  When I deal with the subject matter in the one instance I hope Deputies will take it to cover all the cases referred to.  Deputy Keyes, in common with a good many other people, objected to the exclusion of men from the relief schemes under a certain unemployment assistance valuation. That has occurred in the rotational experimental schemes simply and solely because under the actual provisions of the existing law, unless we <Col N="770" /> gave a man a certain number of days' work, he would be still entitled to draw both his wages and the unemployment assistance money.  For that reason in every case you have had to have a particular rate.  Take two extreme cases. In Limerick the rate in one instance was 6/-.  In the City of Dublin I think it was 11/6.  It depends entirely on the rate of wages in the district.  We know that a very considerable number of men upon a lower rate than the rate we are able to include under the existing law are anxious to work.  Efforts are being made to see to what extent that desire can be met.  Deputy Keyes suggested that we should confine works to smaller areas and give more work to each man who was employed.  There again the difficulty is, as the House has to recognise, that our job here is efficiently to distribute a definite sum of money. It is quite easy to expend the whole of it in one place, quite easy to keep in permanent employment at any rate of wages you like a certain limited number of people.  If you are going to meet distress out of a limited fund, then it means that there has to be a fair and equal distribution and that cannot be done by segregating works into small areas, giving a large amount of work to one man while you leave another man without any work at all. I think if there is one thing on which the House is in agreement it is that, to the extent to which it can be done, there should be the fairest distribution of this money that it is possible to have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes raised the question of the wages paid on the Kilfinane public health scheme.  It is curious that I have been in very close contact with that scheme and with all those concerned in it, and this is the first time I have heard any complaint upon that subject.  At present the wages paid are the wages of the ordinary county council worker, 5/- a day or 30/- a week.  I find that in the last two years there were four works done in the district, Kilmallock, Askeaton, Cahirconlish and Glin.  In two cases 35/- were paid, and in the other two 30/- were paid.  There does not seem to be any accepted or accredited public health rate.  At the moment, so far as rotational schemes of employment are concerned, <Col N="771" /> the formula has been to pay a man on whatever work he was doing the ordinary rate of wages of the district.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell raised the question of St. Andrew Street Post Office.  He wanted us to push back the building line for certain public planning purposes. That matter, I may tell him, has been actually gone into with the desire to do it.  It has been found in practice to be impracticable.  It will not be possible, so far as we can see, to push back that frontage line.  The frontage line has been already pushed back in relation to other houses which have set a new frontage line, and it is not possible for us to push back further than that.  He also raised the question of a swimming pool at the Curragh. We will keep that in mind.  In relation to the Cork swimming pool, we had the assistance and co-operation of Deputy Dockrell and his expert advice was very valuable from the point of view of the work done there.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett desired that some portion of the mineral grant should be used in Avoca.  I would be very glad to do that, but no proposal has been put forward in relation to Avoca which seems to be practicable.  Most of the mineral excavations that we know can be made there have been made. While there are certain minerals that are available at the moment, we have before us no proposition in regard to a mineral which we could extract at a price which would pay the cost of the extraction.  Deputy Everett also raised the question of direct labour.  Two or three other Deputies of his Party also advocated that in the strongest possible manner, and I am asked to come into the fight upon their side.  As far as the Board of Works is concerned, their business is so to administer public funds as to obtain for the State the highest possible return for those funds under proper conditions.  Normally and broadly, the contract system undoubtedly will be the best for the Board of Works.  The idea that the Board of Works, for instance, should go down to Mayo or Donegal, or Cork or Clare, or places of that kind and set up an organisation to do their own direct building would, in my <Col N="772" /> opinion, be absurd.  Against that, there is no prejudice, as far as our relief scheme organisation or anything of that kind is concerned, in relation to direct labour.  In regard to the Kilfinane public health scheme, I am perfectly satisfied that but for the fact that we had an opportunity to do that by direct labour, and prove that it could be done under those conditions, it would not have been done.  To that extent I certainly am prepared to say that direct labour has delivered the goods.  It may be that in relation to its application to this particular scheme of public health works, due to the uncertainty and to the contractors' natural suspicion of a new method, we may find that we are getting quotations which are higher than they ought to be.  In that particular case it may be necessary to prove, by further example of direct work under proper supervision, that those works can be done under that system as cheaply and efficiently as under any other system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Everett also asked that a good deal of money should be spent on coast erosion.  I know the particular problem he has in Wicklow&mdash;a problem which, from an engineering point of view, has been very soundly tackled. I think the coast erosion fortress which they have set up there is a highly creditable piece of pioneer engineering. I think it is a great credit to Wicklow, but it is a very costly job. There is certainly nothing in the unemployment position in Wicklow which would justify the carrying out of the mile or so of protection work which they want done, at the cost which would be involved.  I quite agree with him that the next portion of the work will be protecting private property, and I certainly think that the local council ought to be met much more generously in the matter of contribution by the owners of that private property towards the protection of their own property.  Deputy Davin raised a curious question in regard to piece-work, and then wandered along to tell us that the Land Commission had been doing it and that it had been done under the peat works scheme.  So far as I know, no piece-work has been done under this Vote in any way <Col N="773" /> except in relation to a certain small amount on stone breaking.  To the extent to which piece-work is the custom of the particular district I see no objection to it in principle, but in practice our work has been carried out, and will continue to be carried out, as day work.  Frankly, I do not in principle see any objection to piece-work if it is properly allocated and properly supervised.  The suggestion that particular gangers were in a position to decide whether or not a particular job would be done by piece-work certainly is not true in relation to any scheme we are carrying out.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have raised the question of what distance men are expected to travel for the purpose of relief work.  We do not decide that; that is decided under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  Machinery has been set up&mdash;with which we have nothing whatever to do, and with which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has nothing whatever to do &mdash;to decide in relation to every particular man and in relation to every particular circumstance whether or not the conditions are such that the man ought or ought not be expected to do the work.  Suppose a job is going to cost £200 or £300 in a certain electoral area.  We know roughly the number of men required for it, and what we do is we schedule the number of electoral areas which would provide those men.  We generally schedule areas up to about four miles. If men did not turn up for their work within a distance which seemed to be reasonable, then it is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce to decide whether or not those men will remain on the register.  If the Department of Industry and Commerce decides in one particular way, then the men themselves have a right of appeal to a court of referees and an umpire to decide whether or not in practice that is so.  Broadly speaking, our feeling is that men may reasonably be expected to come four miles.  We do know that in practice a great many men are willing to come a good deal more than four miles, but that is not for us to decide. What we would do is certify that a man did not turn up.  If necessary we <Col N="774" /> would certify the distance which to our knowledge he would have had to travel, and then it is a question for the court to decide.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin also referred to the fact that work had been shut down recently on the Goul drainage scheme; that men had been disemployed, and that a resolution had been sent up saying that this was an entirely wrong and improper proceeding without any relation whatever to justice or the facts.  The actual facts are that the men having been employed for specific work, and that work having come to an end, their employment terminated.  At the present moment there is no other work to be done in that district, except the clearing up of small drains, which cannot be done now unless we are prepared to do it all over again when we are handing over the scheme. It is further alleged that they could work on the bog bridge.  That bog bridge, for certain reasons connected with the county council, is not available for the work to be done on it now, but we hope that work will be available on it within, say, a month.</P>
    <P>I was asked how gangers were appointed, and who was the ultimate authority.  The county surveyors are our agents in carrying out relief schemes, and they are held responsible for the efficiency of the work.  They are the ultimate people who will be held responsible for the whole thing. Therefore, they must have the power to appoint their own gangers, and they do.  I was asked by, I think, Deputy Dillon to tell him the present position of the Suck scheme.  The present position is that we agreed to spend the sum of £7,000 out of the Unemployment Relief Vote for the purpose of sweetening that particular bargain.  An attempt was made to employ U.A. men on the carrying out of that job over a very considerable number of miles of river and tributaries. In practice, it proved to he impossible, although from the length of the river and tributaries which had to be dealt with, and from the area of land, it looked one of the obvious things that could be done by U.A. labour, having regard to the very large number which was supposed to be on the register.  U.A. labour was not <Col N="775" /> available within the area.  I will just put the figures on record for the information of the House.  The number of men who were notified for work was 226; the number of men who were ill, or for other reasons were not suitable for labouring work, was ten; the number who recorded themselves as having obtained other employment when they were notified, 29; the men who declined work without a valid reason, 61; the men who lived more than four miles from the place of work, who had not bicycles, or who, having bicycles, lived seven miles away, 63; the men who went off the register and who were not known to be working elsewhere, 10.  The number of men who accepted work on the scheme was 53 out of 226, and of that 53, 17 men defaulted later on.  Now, that is a picture which I want the House to co-relate with the map that is outside in the Lobby.  I want them to look up those particular districts and the colour with which those districts are marked on the map.  Broadly speaking, it amounts to this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  I think this is one of the soundest analyses of the position that have been made or could be made.  It is the soundest analysis that I know of, and one which I should like to see examined even much more carefully than we have examined it.  The inference which I draw from this particular thing is that in the areas on that map which are marked orange or yellow&mdash;and that covers a very considerable section of the map&mdash;any considerable public work, even of such an order as that of £7,000 carried on over a six months' period, will exhaust the actual register that is available.  In other words, it is bringing the problem of unemployment, as far as it is indicated by the unemployment assistance register, down to bedrock.  We are now carrying out that scheme with whatever labour we can get.  It is not possible to carry it out with the labour on the unemployment assistance register, having regard to <Col N="776" /> the fact that out of 226 notified for the job, only 53 accepted employment and 17 of these did not actually take up work.  Of course, I think it is only right to say that most of these people are engaged in their own work.  As everybody knows, it is not a district in which there is any very considerable amount of what one might call ordinarily paid employment.  What disturbs me in the matter is that I see no reason to believe that there is anything individual in relation to that district and that, if large schemes of public works are artificially to be done in the yellow and orange areas, it means that we are going to spend the money without dealing with the visible problem as marked on the unemployment register.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, since he has gone into this matter in some detail, did he inquire, in making that very careful analysis, as to what proportion of the persons on the unemployment assistance register, who did not turn up for work, had, in fact, gone to England as migratory labourers?</P>

      <P>Yes, I heard that rumour, and the people whom I sent down heard the rumour also.  They made investigations and reported that it had not affected this particular analysis. However, I am glad the Deputy raised the matter, and I should be very happy to allow the Deputy to see the inquiries which have been made into these matters, so that he might know what has gone on.</P>

      <P>But it has not affected this particular matter.  I want to put it to the House that you could spend all this money over the country and yet not affect your unemployment register unless the money is directed definitely into the area in which we know that actual distress exists.  Somebody has raised the question of minor relief procedure and how proposals should be put forward and so on.  I thought that the procedure was well known.  However, as a matter of fact, a certain form of procedure has been evolved&mdash;it is the form that has been in use&mdash;which is at the disposal of any Deputy in the House and which, if availed of, will enable any Deputy to put forward his scheme in a manner that would not alone facilitate him, but that would be immensely helpful to us.  What I mean by that is that it is better to have information on a particular point put forward in a concise way than to have to extract it from a series of personal letters in relation to all sorts of matters.  The proposal was made very strongly by two or three people that we should disregard the distress situation to a considerable extent in these, works and concentrate upon the urgency of the demand for them.  Well, frankly, I cannot see that at all.</P>

      <P>Objection was taken to work being done by instalments.  Again, I think that the House and the majority of the people outside would be of a different opinion.  What happens in this case is that you have a particular area and three or four schemes are put up.  It may happen that the best scheme is a more expensive scheme than the district would be entitled to have done in that particular area.  Are we then to choose an inferior scheme just because it is cheaper or to choose a scheme that will be of sound and permanent benefit in the future?  Our tendency, normally, is to choose the scheme that, obviously, will <Col N="778" /> be more beneficial, even though it takes two or three years to carry it out.  For instance, there were two or three schemes with which I was familiar myself and which had stopped at a certain period, and I think that any ordinary person would say that these schemes should have been carried on beyond the point at which they stopped.  I have seen examples of many of these schemes where, as a result of further work on them, they became of lasting benefit, and I have seen many cases where I was satisfied that the initial work, the planning, was sound, and where, although at the beginning it did not seem to have immediate benefit, it would be of sound and permanent benefit later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin asked to be given information with regard to the Douglas scheme.  I think he is aware of the causes which prevent us from moving more rapidly in that matter.  All I can say is that it is a year nearer completion than it was when Deputy Davin raised the question on this Vote last year.  Deputy Davin also raised the question of a place called Clonaslee, where the suggestion was that the contractors were not paying the wages they should have paid. That was really a difficult case.  It was reported to us and examined by us with the intention of getting to the bottom of it.  What happened there was that builders' labourers were receiving, apparently, the full recognised rate, but that there were other unskilled labourers paid in accordance with the local rate, and at the same time there were labourers employed by the Board of Health on local housing schemes.  These, however, were doing work of a different character&mdash;slating work and so on.  It was one of those border line cases where it was quite impossible to say with absolute decision, but I understand that it has been got over now and arrangements made to give satisfactory wages.  In all these cases we do the very best to get to the bottom of things, but sometimes there is no such thing as a recognised local rate, and a decision in relation to what is the local rate is a very controversial decision.  The intention of the Board of Works in <Col N="779" /> relation to this matter is to enforce the fair wages clause, and as long as that is the intention I think the House may safely leave the practice of it in our hands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy raised again a question about direct labour.  In common with others he suggested the desirability of doing small drainage work during the summer.  When we were working purely and simply on the unemployment register the tendency was to do all work that it was possible to do over the winter months.  Now, to some extent, that we are being influenced by the unemployment assistance register, which continues during the summer, we are desirous, as far as possible, to get such work done during the summer as can be better done in summer than in winter.  We recognise that certain small drainage works can be done then.  In districts in which a large number of people remain on the unemployment assistance register a considerable amount of work like small drainage work will be done.  It may be taken that that policy has been adopted.  Deputy Mulcahy asked about the number of volunteer halls that had been built, and the places in which they were built.  I do not think it necessary to put the list on the records, but I will send it to the Deputy.  He also asked whether there had been any change in the outlook regarding the Viceregal Lodge and the museum proposal. The actual position is that detailed estimates and plans have been prepared for a museum, and there is no change in the intention so to use it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan (Clare) recalled to me almost a holy memory of a speech in which he accused me of wiping away my crocodile tears with bank drafts. To say that I have indulged in an orgy of slap-dash schemes without imagination or organisation shows a considerable falling off in that high respect. The Deputy suggested that instead of putting down a series of works such as we do, we should set out for ourselves a particular standard in housing, in roads and in sanitation&mdash;a minimum standard&mdash;and that all the money required should be provided by the State for that purpose, and equally for the <Col N="780" /> relief of unemployment.  I would like a minimum standard in housing, a minimum standard in roads, and a minimum standard in sanitation, but then I should certainly require minimum standards of criticism of Budget provisions to meet these standards.</P>
    <P>You cannot get anything for nothing in this world.  The State is providing under the Budget £2,500,000 for the purpose of dealing with unemployment. How far that sum will go towards dealing with the problem none of us can tell until we have tried.  That is the simple issue.  The House cannot have forgotten the criticisms offered against the Budget that provides this money.  I want Deputies, and especially Deputy Hogan, to strain their imagination to see what kind of language he and his colleagues would have used if the Minister for Finance had introduced a Budget providing for all the houses, all the roads and all the sanitation required in this country this year, and of the standard that Deputy Hogan wants.  Let us be reasonable in the matter.  Everything that is done in the way of social services, in the way of relieving unemployment, will have to be paid for, and it can only be paid for by people who have money to pay for it.  No one in his senses believes that the position he envisaged could be met otherwise.  It will have to be paid for out of the resources of everybody. While I am very anxious indeed to see that everything humanly possible is done to relieve distress, I am not prepared to go to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;Here is a standard road up to which every road has to be brought; here is a standard of sanitation up to which every place has to be brought immediately&rdquo; unless the House is prepared to say that they will cheerfully and willingly meet the bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon objected to the dog-kennel outside.  Again I can tell him that we are very anxious to find a solution of the position, but it is not easy of solution.  He suggested moving the dining room to Leinster Lawn.  If he went into the matter he would find that there are architectural difficulties.  On the last occasion that the matter was discussed I suggested that the over-heated dining room should be made the headquarters of the Opposition, and <Col N="781" /> under these conditions we might be able, so to speak, to make a bargain. The Deputy's suggestion now is that the over-heated diningroom should be made the headquarters of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The diningroom is very much better now.  You have done something with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can tell the Deputy is that the question has been examined architecturally and that it is not an easy one to solve.  There are certain indefinitenesses in the arrangement which still necessitate accommodation within this building, a solution of which may eventually provide what the Deputy has in mind.  The Deputy wants us to shut up about two-thirds, three-fourths or five-sixths of all the tin-pot little schools we have and to let the children go to central schools.  In my opinion the children have far enough to walk at present. The Deputy suggested that we should provide buses for them.  I sincerely hope that when the Minister for Finance makes any such provision in his Budget, we will have the Deputy and his comrades on the opposite benches going into a Lobby different from the one they now go into, when asked to increase taxation.  The Deputy also raised a question about sporting rights.  I think these are confined to the National Park at Muckross.  We may take it that all these facilities which he considered desirable do exist. As to swimming pools, he knows from experience that we have tried very hard to meet particular situations as they have arisen.  Cul-de-sac roads are being treated and to a very considerable extent are being dealt with under minor relief schemes.  They cannot be treated by county councils at all.  It is only in cases where we connect up a cul-de-sac road from the other end of it to the main road that it is possible for the local authority to take cognisance of the road when it is finished or to attempt to maintain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised the question of summer drainage, and as I told him we are trying to do what we can in he matter.  In common with quite a <Col N="782" /> few other Deputies, he raised the question of whether or not the distribution of the Relief Fund on the basis of the U.A. register was a correct and sound method.  I want to be perfectly frank in saying that I have a great deal of sympathy with the objection which he has taken in that matter.  Previously, we distributed money on the basis of what you might call the rural poverty factor.  We took the agricultural valuation of every electoral area in the Saorstát, divided it by its agricultural population, gave it from that a poverty factor and from that calculated its share of the total allocations. When the U.A. register was adopted, and the State took upon itself the responsibility of paying during weeks of unemployment to particular people certain sums of money, it then became very difficult to justify the employment of people except upon that statutory qualification and for a year or so we have been distributing, as far as we can, on the basis of the U.A. register.  I am not satisfied that the distribution strictly on the U.A. register has, in fact, produced a fairer distribution than the previous one.  What we tend to do now is that we distribute a considerable proportion of the total amount of the fund on the basis of the U.A. register and then try to correct what seem to us to be discrepancies in the fairness of that by consulting the poverty factor matter.  That system, however, has the defect that money which is spent, to the extent to which it is spent in that way, does not reduce the U.A. or the unemployment register in the degree in which the House would think it should be reduced.  However, I have considerable sympathy with that view and I think it is very widely and very soundly held.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred&mdash;and in so doing anticipated what he was going to say in relation to No. 9; there is a motion to refer back No. 9 &mdash;to the work of the inter-Departmental Committee.  The inter-Departmental Committee has examined every possible scheme that has been put forward and it has graded these schemes from the point of view of <Col N="783" /> the labour content and from the point of view of what you might call their intrinsic merit.  Four valuable reports have been presented to the Executive Council, and the result of their labours is expressed to some extent in, and has certainly influenced considerably, the allocation which has been made this year.  In regard to that particular committee&mdash;I am speaking now impersonally&mdash;I have watched their labours and the energy which they put into their work and I am satisfied they have done all that a committee could do in that matter. They are dealing with an indeterminate problem.  It is not possible for them or anyone else to say that if certain moneys are spent in a certain way, their expenditure would be desirable or that if spent in another way, they would absorb more labour. Until you have tried out in practice the degree in which desirable public works with a high labour content will fall into areas in which there is a big demand for distress relief, neither they nor anybody else can give you a sound and watertight estimation of the results.  To the political matter which was introduced by the Deputy, I have nothing to say.  I have rigorously confined myself in these discussions to matters relevant to this Vote, that is to the proper, more honest and more useful distribution of funds.  I do not propose to follow Deputies into sidetracks of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes raised again the question of the Labour Exchange in Limerick. That exchange, I understand, is completed and he alleges that it is now in an unsatisfactory condition. We have no reason to believe that it is in an unsatisfactory condition.  We do know that it is a thousand times better than it was before we changed over but if it is defective we shall have the matter examined.  Deputy Keyes and Deputy Minch, and I think some other Deputy, raised the question of the degree in which it would be desirable to inform Deputies of the details of relief schemes.  I should like to do that but it is not by any means an easy matter.  At an early stage when we did distribute information, great difficulties arose as a <Col N="784" /> result of it.  A great number of Deputies did decide to advertise themselves at the expense of the relief schemes.</P>

      <P>There is no question of that.  We had: &ldquo;Here is the scheme I put forward and here is the scheme you put forward,&rdquo; and statements of that kind.  In addition to that, a considerable amount of local influence was brought to bear on the county surveyors in relation to the appointment of gangers.  Certainly we had very serious difficulties on that account but to a considerable extent we got over them.</P>

      <P>There was no question about where they occurred.  Things of that kind occurred in a great many places and they did not help to produce that atmosphere in relation to the administration of the Relief Fund which, I am glad to say, now exists. When we did to some extent do that, and when we started issuing lists of grants, we found we were up against this difficulty.  It was not possible for us to issue information to Deputies in relation to the whole of the scheme to be carried out at any particular time.  Those have to be issued in batches. When we made out one and people round the country found that their particular scheme was not on the first allocation, we were absolutely deluged with complaints and objections and difficulties of one kind or another.  What we have done, in recent years, is to give to Deputies, at the end of the year, an absolutely clear picture of the distribution and of every penny of it in every district in the place.  While I would like to find some machinery by which Deputies would get the information they are now asking, I am leaving it to the House to consider whether or not it would not be a much better idea to put up with the difficulties they know, than to get back to the difficulties from which they escaped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A question has been raised by Deputy P.J. Kelly in relation to Tara <Col N="785" /> Hill.  I shall look into that.  Deputy Pattison raised the question of local contributions which was dealt with in the general matter.  He also mentioned the old city walls of Kilkenny. They have been examined by us, and I do not think that they were regarded as suitable to take over and maintain as a national monument.  Deputy Minch raised the question of old burial grounds.  We have, on occasions, put roads to those burial grounds and, on occasions, in the islands off Donegal, and so on, we have extended or repaired them.  But anything in the nature of cleaning them would raise serious difficulties.  We would like to do it; but again it is a question whether it would not be wiser to leave them alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corkery raised the question of the method of district distribution of relief and U.A. forms, and whether or not they were producing satisfactory results.  We will look into that matter and will try to correct the U.A. formula by our actual experience of those places.  I do not know whether Deputy Corish was present when I was dealing with the question as to how the local authorities should be informed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  I will look into the question of works on barracks for which the provision is now definitely made.  I was under the impression that all arrangements were made in connection with Courtown Harbour, but I shall look into that. Deputy Bartley raised the question of marine works and their difficulties.  I think every one of the marine works schemes have gone, personally, through my hands.  I do not know any marine works that ought to be done that were turned down.  I think we have been more than liberal.  Deputy Bartley indicated that there was some such work almost every two miles around the coast.  We have avoided that.  There are three engineers actually working on marine works, and this matter is receiving very careful attention.  All our sympathies are with the people on the western fringe, facing up to the wild waters of the Atlantic, with which I am well acquainted, and all <Col N="786" /> our sympathies are in the direction of making life there, hard and insecure as it is, better and more secure.  The people may be sure that any marine works directed to the benefit of the people on the wild west coast would not be turned down except for the very best of reasons.  But we cannot put a pier and harbour at every couple of miles of the coast.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan raised a question of a national monument in Roscommon Abbey.  We will look into that. He raised the question of the Tinnecarra river and asked whether we would blow out a piece of rock, at considerable expense, which would render the scheme economic.  That brings us back to the whole question&mdash;and it is a very difficult one&mdash;as to whether ordinary drainage works for which there is machinery provided under various Acts should be undertaken out of relief work grants.  I think the House will agree that if we began to do out of relief money drainage work of that character we would soon be rid of the hope of any further provision by local authorities and local people for their own drainage.  These are real difficulties. We would very often like to do it but unless it is decided that drainage shall be a State charge as distinct from a charge distributed between the State, the local authority and the beneficiaries, it is altogether undesirable that we should queer the pitch by putting money into this drainage. There is at present a commission being set up to inquire into the whole drainage position.  I think that and analogous questions will be bound to be dealt with by them as a matter of general principle rather than as a particular class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all I think I have to say in relation to this Vote.  I can only say that I have received in the past the co-operation of members on all sides of the House in this matter.  I value that co-operation, and I think that co-operation is very valuable to the State.  Any criticism of our procedure which any Deputy either now, or afterwards, may choose to make will be welcomed by us.  Any knowledge any persons may have that will enable a more efficient use to be made of our <Col N="787" /> procedure will be welcomed as constructive criticism and as a constructive and valuable contribution by them to our office.</P>

A very considerable amount of very important evidence must have been <Col N="789" /> given before this Commission, whether by officials of Departments, by persons connected with banking or others interested.  It is of the greatest importance that the evidence placed before this Commission should be made available at once.  I put down this motion in order to hear from the Minister for Finance what he proposes to do with regard to the evidence given before the Commission and when we may expect a report from the Commission. When the Commission was set up, I raised the question whether the evidence would be published or not, and the Minister for Finance replied that, for the time being, it was decided not to publish the evidence. I think the development that has daily taken place in the situation is of a nature that dictates that the evidence should be made available forthwith and that we should be informed when a report may be expected.  Are we to wait for two more years for the report of this Commission, or what exactly is the Commission doing?  Why is it necessary, at this stage of the Commission's proceedings, to vote £2,200? The information contained on the face of the Estimate would suggest that we are not going to get a report from the Commission for 12 months or more.  I raised the matter in order to hear the Minister's views.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we have any right to try to control the manner in which the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit, which has been set up by the Government, conducts its inquiry.  One thing we may be certain of is that, constituted as it is of men experienced in these matters and broadly representative as it is of every interest in the community, it will do its work in the way which, in the collective view of the members, is best designed to secure reliable results.  The Commission has decided that, for the proper prosecution of its task, its sittings should be held <i>in camera</i> and that the evidence submitted to it should, for the time being at any rate, not be published.  There is nothing new or novel in that procedure.  It has been adopted before and, if my recollection <Col N="790" /> is correct, it was the procedure which was followed by the Banking Commission set up by our predecessors in the year 1925.</P>
      <P>Neither has this Commission been lax or indolent in prosecuting its inquiry.  Its first meeting was held on the 23rd November, 1934.  In the period up to 23rd April of this year, the full Commission had held 21 sessions, averaging three days each.  In addition, there have been numerous meetings of the statistical sub-committee set up by the Commission which has prepared and considered very valuable material not previously available concerning certain aspects of the economic and monetary position of the State.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say when the Commission will report.  I understand that it is at present engaged in reviewing the materials in its possession with a view to the formulation of its recommendations.  I am sure it will be as diligent and expeditious in formulating its recommendations as it has been in conducting the inquiry entrusted to it.  I cannot, at this stage, commit myself to any further statement with regard to the evidence but it may be taken that, as soon as the report has been presented and considered, the evidence will be made available to the general public.  As I have said, there is nothing unusual in the procedure which the Commission has seen fit to follow in prosecuting its inquiry.  It was the procedure adopted by the first Banking Commission, and I think it is the procedure generally adopted by Commissions of this kind. There would be no use in publishing evidence piecemeal.  If the sittings of the Commission were thrown open to the Press the proceedings would get, at the very best, a summary and, for that reason, perhaps, misleading report, simply because attempts would be made to summarise in a column or half a column evidence and discussions which might have, in fact, occupied the greater part of a day. Quite obviously, the wise thing to do is to wait until all the evidence is available and until those interested in the problems which the Commission is considering are able to peruse and analyse the evidence <i>in extenso.</i></P>

Here are the terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To examine and report on the system in Saorstát Eireann of currency, banking, credit, public borrowing and lending, and the pledging of State credit on behalf of agriculture, industry and social services, and to consider and report what changes, if any, are necessary or desirable to promote the social and economic welfare of the community and the interests of agriculture and industry.</P>

      <P>I ask to be protected from the impertinences and interruptions of the Minister and his attempt to draw a red herring across the issue.  The reply I got from the Commission was that there would be no immediate publication of the documentary evidence or the oral evidence. It is intended, however, they stated, that the evidence, both documentary and oral, will be published in due course in connection with the Commission's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that after the length of time that has passed since this Commission was set up, over 18 months, and considering the volume of evidence given before the Commission and the important nature of that evidence, that that evidence should now be published. As I understand it, however, from the ordinary operations in cases like this, and from what the letters from the Commission have indicated&mdash;that is to say, that the oral evidence would be taken&mdash;that evidence must be available and in printed form at the present time.  The Estimate of the Minister before us indicates that we <Col N="794" /> are going to lose another year before we see any sign of a report from the Commission.  In the meantime the subjects that are down here for consideration by the Commission have become more and more pressing.  The whole question of credit for the agricultural industry is infinitely more pressing to-day than it was in November, 1934, when the Commission was first set up and that question is going to be much more pressing after another 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to wait much longer for the findings of the Commission, the findings of the Commission are not going to be of much use to us, and they certainly will be findings dealing with a very different situation from the situation that confronted them when they sat down to their work in November, 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister tell the people of this country or the agricultural community who have lost £11,000,000 a year every year since this Commission was set up; does he tell the agricultural industry which gave employment to 5,464 less farmers and 1,055 less permanent agricultural labourers than it gave in the year in which the Commission was set up&mdash;does he tell the farmers who were given less employment to that extent in spite of the increases in beet, wheat and tobacco, that they are in a better position to-day than they were two years ago, losing as they are £11,000,000 a year on the trade that they could have?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want mainly to emphasise is that we have here a Commission that is dealing with a most important matter, and, if all the circumstances were known, dealing with a matter the circumstances of which are infinitely more important after 18 months have passed and a very considerable volume of evidence has been put before the Commission both in documentary form and as a result of the oral examination of witnesses.  The Commission is not going to report for another 12 months, judging by the amount of money we are asked to vote now.  Whether it is going to report inside 12 months or not, the evidence that has been accumulated in the meantime should now be made public, at any rate to Deputies in the Library, so that they will have an opportunity of making some study of the evidence given up to the present and be prepared to judge a very important report with some advertence to the evidence given.  I completely distrust the policy pursued by the Commission in withholding this evidence, and, in spite of the protestations of the Minister, I cannot excuse the Minister or his colleagues from having induced or compelled the Commission to withhold from the public the evidence given before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most extraordinary statement.  I have had no communication whatever with the chairman or other members of this Commission since it was set up.  Furthermore, I may say that I have no responsibility for the procedure which the Commission adopts in conducting this inquiry.  It has never been the custom in our time for the Government to attempt to interfere with the discretion of Commissions of this sort in prosecuting their inquiries.  As I say, we have no control over them. The Commission is set up to pursue an absolutely independent inquiry.  I have been meticulously careful not to communicate any views I may have on any of the matters the Commission has been asked to investigate to any of the members of the Commission and, beyond giving it its terms of reference, I have had no other contact <Col N="796" /> with it whatsoever.  Therefore, I think if the House were to refer this Vote back, because the Commission in conducting its investigation has seen fit to pursue a certain line, pursue what seems to me to be the intelligent course, to defer the publication of the evidence until the report is completed, the House, would stultify itself.  That would be, I think, an unjustifiable interference with the discretion of the Commission in conducting the investigation which it has been asked to undertake.</P>
      <P>What right have we to come along and say to men of eminence, to men of wide interests, which those who constitute this Commission have, that they shall do such-and-such a thing merely because I, or any other member of the House, think it is right to do such a thing, when they, in their wisdom, having considered all the implications in the matter, have decided that, if they are really to conduct this very critical and searching investigation in the best way possible, the sittings ought not to be held in public, that a verbatim report, as the Deputy has admitted, will be taken of the evidence, and that, presumably, in due course it will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Deputy is so anxious to press this matter.  He may have had some reason arising out of the Banking Commission which was set up here formerly.  I am not aware of the reason.  I would not say that any evidence given to that Commission was deliberately withheld because it might not have supported the report which that Commission presented.  I would not dare say that.  I do not know whether it was withheld or not &mdash;I am not in a position to say.  But, I certainly would say that, whatever was the report of that Commission, it would, if the evidence was available here to us, be justified by that evidence, and I say that because the men who were on that Commission were chosen, as we have endeavoured to select the personnel of this Commission, not because they had this view or that view, but because they were the men, of all who were available, the best qualified to carry out an inquiry of that kind.  As I say, having selected our Commission in that way, <Col N="797" /> having asked some very eminent economists, not merely eminent here, for we have quite a number of eminent people, but people who are international figures, to sit on that Commission, having, in addition, representatives, I may say, of every general interest in the country, I think that it would be an unwarranted impertinence on our part to dictate to them the manner in which the investigation should be conducted.  I, for one, would not be any party to that.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Mulcahy has not made the shadow of a case for referring back this Vote on these grounds.  As I said, when the report is available, I anticipate that the evidence upon which the report is based will be available also.  It will be available <i>in extenso,</i> and those who wish to study that report will have at their disposal the full text of the evidence given.  Certainly the study of that report, either on the part of the Government Departments concerned, or by any other student of the question, is not going to be a cursory study &mdash;it will have to be careful, searching and detailed.  It is not going to be the sort of thing that one could approach beforehand unless he had in his possession the whole volume of evidence upon which the report was based.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Deputy has made, as I said, a shadow of a case for referring this Vote back.  We set up this Commission.  We did not set it up because we hoped to secure any political or other advantage.  We set it up because we felt that, with the lapse of time which had taken place since the Saorstát was set up, an inquiry of this kind would be opportune and should not be any further delayed, bearing in mind that those who were on the first Banking Commission, and particularly that member who was associated with my predecessor as head of the Department of Finance, had indicated that, in their view, after a period of five years, or so, another investigation should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>We have taken the opportunity, in conducting that investigation to ask the Commission to inquire into very much wider problems, problems <Col N="798" /> that we might very easily, if we had wished, have burked. Upon occasions I have noticed leading articles in the Press about the income of this country: statements to the effect that some attempt should be made to assess it, and that other statistical data also ought to be available.  Of course, the people who write the articles do not know how involved and complicated a matter that may be.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said here this evening in dealing with the unemployment problem, those who attempt to make estimates of that sort are dealing with indeterminate equations. Certainly, neither I nor any of the ordinary personnel of the Civil Service would have time to devote ourselves to such a prolonged investigation as that would entail, and as I have said, we have set up a Commission to consider these things in a way that they have never been considered here before.  The Commission has, possibly, wider terms of reference than have been given to any similar body on the continent of Europe within the past 20 years or so.  I would like to see the report of that Commission at the earliest possible moment.  I would like to see it because I think it would be useful to everyone in this country, no matter what his political views may be, or what his commercial or other interest may be.  I would hope it would lay the foundations for a continuous study of economic conditions here which would be of very fruitful benefit to our people.  While, as I have said, I would like to have the results of the Commission's enquiries at the earliest possible moment, nevertheless, so important do I regard the investigation that I would not attempt either to hurry them or, as I have said before, to interfere with their discretion as to the manner in which the inquiry which they have undertaken can best be prosecuted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join completely with the Minister in saying that I regard this investigation as of the utmost importance.  I think it is of importance that the evidence which has been presented by way of memoranda from various people in the country, <Col N="799" /> from various Departments and from others as well as the evidence which has been obtained, following the examination of witnesses by members of the Commission, all of which is available as it has been taken and printed during the last 18 months&mdash; all this evidence which is to be the foundation of the Commission's report &mdash;should now be published even though the report itself is not available.  The Minister indicated truly that the terms of reference given to this Commission were much wider than the terms of reference given to the previous Banking Commission.  There was a very great necessity to make them wide, and, as I have already indicated, the necessity is growing more marked every day.  The Minister talked about burking things.  I submit that he is burking things, and that he is going to burk the publication of the report of this Commission until after the next general election, and that, as part of his desire to do that, he is going to burk allowing anyone to see the evidence given before the Commission before the next general election takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the House should vote this sum of money for the purpose of assisting the Minister to withhold from them vital information on this subject of agricultural credit and industrial credit by having some further long-drawn-out examination of some aspect of the inquiry carried on until after the next general election which has been promised to us within the next 12 months.  I say that because the people are going to have constitutional changes dangled before them as the major fare at the general election. This Commission has now been sitting for 18 months, and the House is asked to vote a further sum of £2,200 to meet the expenses of it.  I submit that is simply an attempt on the part of the Minister to provide money to keep this Commission talking and talking and talking for another 12 months.  The Commission has already been sitting for 18 months.  It is well known that a considerable amount of evidence has been given before it during that period, enough, at any rate, to warrant it in coming to conclusions, particularly <Col N="800" /> with regard to a situation that is getting worse and worse in a very rapid way.</P>
    <P>I think that, strictly speaking, I should ask the House to wipe out completely this sum of £2,200 and not simply the £100 which I put down for the purpose of raising this question. I again charge the Minister that, in putting this before us and in taking up the attitude he has taken with regard to the evidence, he is doing so for the purpose of depriving the people of seeing the report of the Commission at this side of the general election or the report of the evidence that was given before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I had not the opportunity of listening to the whole of the Minister's statement, but I did hear him draw attention to the fact that there had been a previous Currency Commission.  The work of the previous Commission was very different from the work that has been entrusted to this Commission. The circumstances of the time were very different also from what they are now.  The work that has been entrusted to this Commission is of very great importance.  It has a bearing, and must be expected to have a bearing, upon the national finances of the country, and, consequently, upon the policy that has been pursued during the past few years by this Government, a policy which has departed in principle from the accepted standards of national economics in most countries. During the last few years we have been in the throes of what is called an economic crisis.  That was the time selected by the Ministry for a very heavy increase in taxation, for huge borrowings and for leaving to their successors whoever they may be&mdash;assuming for the moment that they do not succeed themselves&mdash;the heavy task of meeting first of all the liabilities that have been undertaken so lightly and spent with so much eclát throughout the country in the hope of rehabilitating the damage they have done to the agricultural industry, and, generally speaking, of endeavouring to construct a system of national taxation which will not press very heavily on the people.  Last week the Ministry was in great glee when they <Col N="801" /> heard the first results of the County Dublin elections.  The later news that came in rather dissipated their hilariousness. Let us ignore for the moment the political considerations.</P>

      <P>Let us ignore that and realise that we have a certain responsibility here not to gain immediate popularity for any political Party but rather to see that the finances of the State are maintained in a sound condition.  Would the Minister say if he gave an undertaking to the Banking Commission that the evidence given before them would not be published prior to the publication of their report?  If any such undertaking was given, then this motion in the name of Deputy Mulcahy ought to be withdrawn.  If no such undertaking was given, what is the real reason why the people who are paying the expenses of this Commission, who are certainly interested in its proceedings and to whom the evidence given before it is of considerable importance, should not, as occasion requires, be afforded the opportunity of reading that evidence?</P>
      <P>Without being personal, there is scarcely a single member of the Ministry who has had any experience of administration, with possibly one exception.  It may happen that their successors will be in the same position, but they will have at least this advantage over this Ministry, that they will have a longer period of political responsibility in this country to look to for their guidance, whereas the Ministry here have had the experience of ten years of their predecessors and they have their own knowledge that they not alone opposed practically all that their predecessors did, but adopted an entirely different line of policy.  That of itself would be of great advantage to their successors. At the moment and in the future, and particularly as an election is pending, it is the people's right to see what exactly is the sort of evidence that is being given before this Commission.</P>

      <P>Did the Minister give an undertaking to this Commission that the evidence given before them would not be published until the report would be published?  If the Minister says he gave them that undertaking, we will withdraw this motion, because in the case of an undertaking given by the Minister in his capacity as a Minister, however we might disagree with it, we will consider ourselves bound by it.  To endeavour to equate or parallel this Commission with its predecessor, the Banking Commission set up in 1925 or 1926, is the merest humbug, and the Minister ought to know it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that that Commission was asked to report upon currency, upon separating our currency from what we had, upon the setting up of a national currency, and the question before this Commission is of a larger kind&mdash;it has a wider character in every respect.  This is a Commission which ought to have, and must have, having regard to the standing of certain people on it, reviewed the financial and economic policy here for the last four or five years and would not have been satisfied with that, but gone behind that.  What is the situation? Take the one main industry, the most important industry of the country.  The solvency of that industry bears no comparison to-day with its position five years ago.  Deputy O'Higgins stated here the other day that a large number of those engaged in agriculture were credit bad.  I had not heard the term before, but perhaps it aptly describes what the position of these people must be, having regard to the policy pursued by this Government during the last three or four years.  If that information or information of a character like that has been before the Commission, what is the reason why it should be kept from the people?  Is it <Col N="803" /> that the people might come to a conclusion different to the report of the Commission?</P>
      <P>If the Minister is reading the report of the Banking Commission, I advise him to look up the page upon which there is a return furnished of the arrears of Land Commission annuities. He will find there most instructive figures, and he will also find this, that although the previous Government entered into possession of arrears of something like £600,000, the arrears during three gales since this Government took up office exceed approximately twice that figure.  Further, he will find that during the ten years of office of his predecessors no addition was made to the arrears; in fact, in the case of the 1903 Act, there had been a substantial reduction; whereas in the short space of four years since the present Ministry commenced to interfere with the agricultural economy of this country the arrears of Land Commission annuities have increased to £1,200,000.</P>
      <P>What exactly is the policy of the Ministry with regard to the Commission? What do they want to keep from the people?  What has transpired at this Commission?  Are the people to be blindfolded at the forthcoming general election with regard to the financial and economic position of the country?  If one takes up the returns published in the statistical abstracts, one finds a difference between the figures in the Minister's Budget speech and the figures recorded there.  Let us at least have, if we can have it, a nonpolitical examination of the economic and financial condition of the country, and, if the Minister's policy has been sound or has been accepted by the Commission in any way, he is welcome to whatever political advantage he can get out of it.  If, on the other hand, he hides from the public the evidence that has gone before the Commission, there can be only one conclusion, and that is that they are afraid to publish the evidence given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended really to prolong this debate, but the speech we have just listened to would, for sheer nonsense, compel an answer. <Col N="804" /> The Deputy who has sat down said it was humbug to try to make any parallel between the Commission which this Government set up and that which was set up by our predecessors in 1926. I agree that the investigation which is now being conducted is much wider. I hope it will be very searching and very thorough.  But as to whether in character or in essence it differs so greatly from that which was set up by our predecessors as to entitle the Deputy to apply the word &ldquo;humbug&rdquo; to an attempt to make a parallel between the Banking Commission of 1926 and the present Commission, I entirely deny.  The Deputy has referred to the reports of the first Banking Commission.  I presume, therefore, I shall be in order in reminding the House that that Commission, though its terms of reference were apparently narrow and restricted, was in fact appointed to consider and report &ldquo;what changes, if any, in the law relative to banking and note issue are necessary and desirable, regard being had to the altered circumstances arising from the establishment of Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those terms of reference are undoubtedly narrower than what we have given to the Commission now sitting.  But if the Deputy knew anything about the work of his own Commission, he would have known it presented not merely a final report but four interim reports.  What did they deal with?  The first one dealt with banking and currency, that very narrow aspect of the problem to which the Deputy wished the House to believe the investigations of the first Commission had been confined.  The second one dealt with agricultural credit; the third one dealt with long-term business credit, and the fourth interim report dealt with Government financial business, all ground which will be traversed by the present Commission in its investigations.  An attempt has been made here to force me to interfere with the conduct of the present inquiry by the Commission to whom it has been entrusted. I said that I have had no communication of any sort with that Commission since I first gave it its terms of <Col N="805" /> reference.  I have been most meticulous to ensure that no allegation that I have attempted to influence, directly or indirectly, the Commission in the investigation which it has undertaken could be laid at my door.  The Commission, of its own volition &mdash;I do not know whether by an unanimous vote or otherwise; I have said I had no intimation from the Commission on the subject&mdash;decided that its inquiry would be most efficiently conducted if the sittings were held in private.  I do not propose to ask the Commission to change its decision in regard to that or any other matter which appertains to the investigation which has been undertaken. An attempt has been made here to say that because I refuse to interfere with the Commission in the way that has been suggested I am seeking to secure some political advantage. I do not know whether the report of the Commission will be critical of the policy we have pursued or commendatory of it.  I would like that it should commend us; if it criticises us I hope I shall be able to benefit from those criticisms if I happen to be in my present office.  I hope that those criticisms will be taken wisely, and that an attempt will be made to meet them by whoever may be in charge of public finances.  But I do not care what the nature of the report is so long as it is founded upon evidence, and so long as some benefit and advantage will result to the community from the labours of the Commission.  That is my primary concern, and it is the primary concern of the Government, which has agreed that the Commission should be set up.</P>
    <P>I was saying that an attempt has been made here by Deputy Mulcahy, and again by Deputy Cosgrave, to imply that it is because we fear the political consequences of public sittings or because we have some ulterior political purpose to serve, that I refuse to interfere with the Commission in the prosecution of its investigations.  I have told the House the nature of the inquiry which was pursued by the former Commission.  I have pointed out that it felt it a duty to submit four interim reports, one dealing with banking and currency, the second dealing <Col N="806" /> with agricultural credit, the third dealing with long-term business credit, and the fourth dealing with Government financial business.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me a question as to whether I had given this Commission any assurance that the evidence would not be published.  I have said that I have given the Commission no assurance; I have not interfered with it in any way. I think I am entitled to ask Deputy Cosgrave if he held in 1926 and 1927 the views which he now holds with regard to the publication of evidence given before Commissions of this sort?  I think the Deputy ought to answer that question.  Did he then believe that, while the Banking Commission which was set up by the Minister for Finance in his administration was sitting, the evidence given before it should be published at the time at which it was being taken.  I do not know, Sir, whether I might sit down&mdash;as the song says, whether we might not all sit down together&mdash;and wait for the Deputy's reply.</P>
    <P>I am sure it will come as a surprise to the House to learn&mdash;although this first Banking Commission reported upon the problem of agricultural credit, and upon long-term business credit and Government financial business&mdash;that 10 years after that Banking Commission sat there is not available in the Library for Deputies of this House a verbatim report of the evidence which was given before it.  Mind you, the final report of that Commission&mdash;significantly enough&mdash;was presented on 31st January, 1927, just five months before the General Election of 1927.  And we are told, without a shred or shadow of evidence or foundation for the statement, that we have endeavoured to influence the present Commission in withholding from the public the evidence which is given to them, because, forsooth, there is a General Election due within the next year or so! There was a General Election due in 1927; there was a General Election held in June, 1927, and one in September, 1927. The report of that Commission was presented to the then Minister, for Finance on 31st January, 1927, and, as I have said, to-day, ten years after that report was presented, there is not a transcript of that evidence available in the Oireachtas <Col N="807" /> Library for any Deputy who may care to consult it.</P>
    <P>It is an old saying that suspicion haunts the guilty mind.  I have been charged with withholding evidence because the suppression of such evidence might serve some ulterior political purpose of the Government.  Why was the evidence which was given to the first Banking Commission withheld by Deputy Cosgrave when he had it in his power to publish it in 1927?  I have no purpose to serve except this, that I will not interfere with this Commission in the conduct of its investigation.  I wish it to pursue that investigation purely in the spirit of a scientific investigator with a desire to find out the truth, and to make the truth in regard to those various matters available to the Irish people.  I have no other purpose than that to serve, and I am not going to hamper that Commission in its investigations by telling it that it is to conduct its investigation in public or in private, or by giving to it any direction or advice or hint or suggestion as to how it would be more or less pleasing to the Government that this inquiry should be pursued.  As I said at the beginning, we have here now in the fact that the previous Administration did not make the evidence available to the public, and in the suggestions which have been uttered in the speeches of Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Cosgrave, an indication and manifestation of the suspicion which haunts the guilty mind.</P>

      <P>I do not happen to have any responsibility for Government in this House.  When I had, I was able to answer it.  I was not on that occasion in the habit of saying what the British Government did in their time.  If the evidence was asked for on the occasion of the last Banking Commission, and if it was at my disposal, will the Minister say that I refused it?  The Minister need not adopt a lazy attitude with regard to public business.  Was the report in question kept from the people before the election when it was requested that it should be published?  Was there not introduced here in the Dáil a Bill to implement the findings of the <Col N="808" /> Commission, practically as they had recommended?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attempting to do that.  I am simply stating the <Col N="809" /> fact.  The Minister means to infer that, by reason of some remissness on my part, that evidence is missing.  I draw his attention to the fact that there is a statute law in connection with this matter, and the Minister hedges by saying that I am trying to put Mr. Blythe in that position.  I am doing no such thing.  I am merely saying that whatever documents were left under my control were left by me in the office, and I want to know if any charge or allegation is being made against me to the effect that I removed or destroyed documents.  If such charges are to be made, I want to know who is making the charges, and I shall meet them.  I shall then know how to treat those responsible for making these charges, and shall make them meet the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now to business.  These are the kind of digressions usually indulged in by the Minister for Finance when he has a bad case.  I have never seen or read of, in any country, such a manifestation of the slave mind as dominates the Ministry here when questions are put up to them in this House.  They are always trying to evade the issue or trying to blame somebody else. On this occasion we have not asked for the Press to be present at the meetings of the Banking Commission.  No claim is made in respect of that.  We are not even asking that the evidence tendered before the Banking Commission should be published, except with the consent of the Banking Commission, and we are not going to blame the Minister if the Banking Commission, in its discretion, objects to the publication of the evidence.  That point might have been clear from my statement, because I said that if the Minister had given any undertaking to the Banking Commission that the evidence would not be published we would not press for it.  We are saying, and we are entitled to say, that very material changes have been made in the economic and financial conditions of this country during the last four years, and we are entitled to assume that these matters came before the Banking Commission in connection with their discussions.  If the Banking Commission now, or at any time, <Col N="810" /> say that they object to the publication of the evidence, we say: &ldquo;Very well, we will accept that.&rdquo;  But will the Minister undertake to have the report of the Banking Commission published five months before the general election? He seems to have some fault to find with his predecessors in publishing the report in January and having a general election in the following June.  Will the Minister undertake to give that much notice this time?  Will he undertake to give four months' notice?  We are not asking for anything unreasonable.  Public money is involved here.  This is supposed to be a deliberative Assembly, and no matter what majority there may be in this House, when public money is voted it is our duty to see that value is got for the money voted.  We do not dispute or criticise the cost of this, but we do say that, in respect of the spending of that money, we are entitled to see some of the results. That is by no means an unreasonable request.  If, after 18 months, there is a very voluminous report published, and if the publication should take place on the eve of a general election, that is not fair to the public.  Of course, I am sure the Minister will now get up and say that the first Constitution of this State was published on the morning of a general election.  He will probably say that.</P>

      <P>I do not suppose that there is any chance of inducing the Department of Finance to increase the extent to which official envelopes of the Oireachtas are available for franked correspondence.  At present a letter written by a Deputy and enclosed in an envelope which has upon it the words &ldquo;Oireachtas Eireann,&rdquo; will travel free of postage to a Government Department.  Is there any hope that that privilege will be extended to cover all correspondence arising out of a Deputy's business transacted in this House?  I imagine that a restriction would have to be placed upon it lest abuses should creep in but, at the same time, I imagine a restricted privilege might be extended to Deputies by allowing them free postage in respect at least. to Oireachtas stationery which was <Col N="814" /> posted in the Oireachtas post office. That would avoid any possibility of the printed envelopes being taken out of the building and being used for general correspondence purposes in a city post office or elsewhere.  I throw out that suggestion.  It is not one to which I attach very great importance but apart from the expense of postage to Deputies, the convenience of not having to be perpetually buying stamps and sticking them on envelopes here would be considerable, particularly in view of the fact that it is becoming more difficult to buy a stamp in Leinster House.  The hours during which the Post Office is available are becoming more restricted with the passage of years.  However, that is another question.</P>
      <P>There is another matter on which I wish to raise a question of principle. If the Minister will turn to the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, he will there find that we pay a considerable contribution every year to a series of Imperial Research Institutions.  We pay a contribution every year, very properly, to a series of Imperial Research Institutions which provide a centre of co-operation for all the members of the Commonwealth in dealing with the obscure problems which affect agriculture in all parts of the Commonwealth. I apologise to the House for the delay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. We contribute to the Imperial Mycological Institute a sum of £150 a year. We contribute to the Imperial Institute of Entomology £50 a year.  We further contribute various sums to the Imperial Bureau of Soil Science, to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition, to the Imperial Bureau of Animal. Health, to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Genetics, to the Imperial Bureau of Agricultural Parasitology, to the Imperial Bureau of Plant Genetics and to the Imperial Bureau of Fruit Production.  I direct the attention of the House to that fact because under sub-head I of the Oireachtas Vote we contribute to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Saorstát Eireann Group.  In addition to the <Col N="815" /> Inter-Parliamentary Union, there is a Union known as the Imperial Parliamentary Union which provides a forum at which representatives of all Parties of the Parliaments of the Dominions meet and discuss matters of common constitutional interests, as the experts of the Dominions meet in the institutes referred to in the Agricultural Vote, for the discussion of technical questions of common interest.  Last year, as a delegate from the Saorstát Eireann Branch of the Imperial Parliamentary Union, I attended a conference in London and there met distinguished Irishmen from Australia representing the various Governments of Australia, distinguished Irishmen and New Zealanders representing New Zealand, with others from New Zealand who had no connection with this country, distinguished Irish-Canadians representing Canada with French-Canadians and English-Canadians&mdash;in fact, representatives of all the sovereign Governments of the Nations of the Commonwealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There, matters of mutual interest were discussed.  What struck me particularly was that matters peculiarly affecting the interests of this country received from those statesmen from all parts of the Commonwealth a consideration that was clearly indicative of their affection for the country to which they looked as the mother country&mdash;Ireland.  It was peculiarly striking that in matters arising in the ordinary course of our deliberations, they specially referred to Irish affairs and when our attitude on certain matters clashed diametrically with the attitude of British Cabinet Ministers, I personally found that not infrequently the representatives of the Dominions ranged themselves on my side of the discussion and warmly supported the Irish side of the question which on any given occasion I had the privilege to put forward.  I do not want for a single moment to suggest that I was the only delegate there. Deputy Doctor Rowlette was there, and he spoke frequently and with great effect from the Irish point of view. Senator Westropp Bennett was there. Senator O'Hanlon was there and <Col N="816" /> several other Senators and Deputies represented Ireland on that occasion. A contribution is made every year by each member of that Association to the joint fund in order to maintain a publication which contains a resume of the important Parliamentary proceedings that take place each month in the various Parliaments of the several Dominions.  That publication circulates through Great Britain and the other sovereign States of the Commonwealth, and keeps constantly before the Governments of the Commonwealth the views expressed by President de Valera and the several Ministers of the Crown in this country from an extreme Irish point of view&mdash;President de Valera's point of view&mdash;on all constitutional questions and on any other questions that arise from time to time in this House.</P>
    <P>I have a strong feeling that it is useful that the Irish Government's point of view should be circulated amongst the other Governments of the Commonwealth on all topics of that character without regard to what Party actually forms the Government of this country at any given time. From time to time our State might find itself in a conflict of interest with Great Britain, Canada or New Zealand and I should like a statement of our side of the case to circulate freely amongst our colleagues in the Commonwealth so that we might rest assured that it was brought under the attention of interested colleagues who, from my experience of them, if they had any bias whatever, had a bias in favour of this country, and were anxious to hear our side of the case in order that they could espouse the cause of this country.  To enable us to make that contribution, it was the practice of the late Government to make an annual grant similar to the grant made to the Inter-Parliamentary Union for which provision is made in the Oireachtas Estimate this year.</P>
    <P>It is to be borne in mind that in some of the Parliaments of the other several States there are a number of wealthy members who are in a position to put up substantial subscriptions themselves towards meeting the expenses of an organisation of that kind.  In this country we have not <Col N="817" /> got a large number of wealthy men in public life, and we cannot afford to contribute the sum necessary to maintain this organisation.  We are asking the present Government to continue the contribution to the fund of our branch that the late Government gave and to give a subscription similar to what they gave to the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  The present Government refuses to do so on the ground, apparently, that President de Valera could not see any reason for authorising a contribution of public moneys to a Union described as an Imperial Parliamentary Union.  But what consistency is there in such an attitude when we discover that his objection to a subscription to an imperial institution of that kind stops when the institution ceases to discuss matters of general interest and concentrates on separate interests. We contribute to nine separate institutions of that kind.</P>

      <P>Surely, my requests having been repeatedly made through the ordinary channels and answered on the ground that they cannot have anything to do with anything which bears the name imperial, I am entitled to point out that not only is that not the case, but that in fact they have made money subscriptions themselves directly to what are considered imperial institutions.  I am not asking for subscriptions directly to any imperial institution.  I am asking to give a subscription to an association embracing members of this Oireachtas, and which is perfectly legal and which is open to no censure of any properly constituted authority, and which for ten years appeared upon this Vote, and was only removed at the instance of this Government.  Surely one is entitled, if one seems to detect in the attitude of the Government, shameless hypocrisy, to direct the attention of the House and the people to that hypocrisy.  Separate imperial institutions are being maintained by moneys voted by this House at the instance of the Minister's colleague, and paid directly by the Minister to institutions, several of which have their headquarters in London and which are actually under the direct control of the British Government.  All of them are excellent and admirable institutions which should be supported by this. House and should be supported with my consent and encouragement.  So far as that part of the Estimate is concerned, it peculiarly recommends itself to me and to other Deputies in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is very narrow-minded and dictatorial on the part of the Government to withdraw from the Imperial Parliamentary Union a subscription they used to pay, and to place members of this Oireachtas in the embarrassing position of pleading to the States of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia that if we are to continue members of the association we must do so now on less onerous terms than formerly.  The House I think ought to know that our membership of the association will continue on the basis that, in view of the fact that we can <Col N="819" /> only make such contributions as the resources of our members permit, it will be no longer possible to print the debates of Dáil Eireann in the publication of the association.  Our colleagues in the association have gone a long way to make it possible to do that, largely because they felt it was in the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole that the views of the Irish Government should be contributed regularly by way of extracts from the official debates. They helped for some time, when we failed to pay our fair share, to keep these debates in that periodical.  That period has now passed.</P>

      <P>I am speaking now purely from recollection, but I think our annual contribution was expected to be about £100, and we were only paying £20 raised among our members themselves. I feel it is undesirable and narrow-minded and contemptible on the part of our Government, simply because they will not allow the members of their own Party to belong to this association, to refuse to contribute to at.  The Minister for Finance should appreciate my attitude if I say that it is perhaps as well I should not go further into the peculiarly ambiguous attitude adopted by the Minister, and another Minister, who recently left the Oireachtas for another place, and a certain Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party in regard to this institution.  I only wish they could produce in their official capacity the breadth of mind they seem to enjoy when acting as individuals abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>After the very moving plea that we have just listened to from Deputy Dillon, that at the expense of the people he should be provided with another forum in which, to use his own phrase, he might spread himself, it is difficult to treat his remarks upon this Vote seriously.  We are asked to pay £250 in order that we might read the report of some of our own speeches and some of Deputy Dillon's speeches in a certain publication. I think it requires a great deal of mutual forbearance to listen to the speeches on either side of this House without having to undergo the additional torment of reading them in cold print.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy endeavoured to make a point out of the fact that on page 207 provision is made for subscriptions to international and other research organisations. The organisations which come under the sub-head which enables these subscriptions to be paid include a considerable number of international organisations as well as a number of organisations of a more specialised character, but all of them are research organisations and all of them are likely to produce material results which will be beneficial to agriculturists in this country.  The reason why we contribute to these organisations and institutions, whether they call themselves &ldquo;imperial&rdquo; or &ldquo;international,&rdquo; is that we think the people of this country will be benefited by the contribution and that some good results will accrue to them. It is not because they bear this label or that we make the contribution but because of the good results that may accrue.  What good results would flow to the people of this country from a payment of £250 to the union to <Col N="821" /> which Deputy Dillon has referred? Such a contribution is not going to help our farmers or our industrialists, and it is not going even to strengthen the bonds of the Commonwealth with which Deputy Dillon seems to be concerned. It would merely ensure that speeches such as we have just listened to and speeches such as I am delivering would be reported for the benefit of Deputies and members of legislatures in other countries.  I do not think that that would be worth the money&mdash;£250.  That is what it comes down to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any question about that.  I think that the Deputy's statement as to the amount he is able to collect in regard to the Commonwealth Union indicates that comparatively little interest is taken in the proceedings of that body. I understand that much greater interest is taken in the proceedings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a limited amount at our disposal.  It might, perhaps, be said that we do not get a lot of benefit out of membership of either of these unions, but I do know that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has always been more favoured by members of the Oireachtas than the other Union.  They have, on occasion, been able to send fairly large delegations abroad to various countries to. participate in the proceedings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.  I do not think members have ever been quite so successful in regard to the proceedings of the Empire Parliamentary Association.  I am speaking with reservations and I say &ldquo;I do not think&rdquo; they have been able to do that.  The fact that more interest is taken in one <Col N="822" /> association than in the other and that no great advantage is to be gained by this contribution of £250 is, I think, almost a conclusive answer to Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other question raised as to the franking of Deputies' letters, I have had that matter considered. I do not think it is a matter that ought to be debated across the floor of the House, nor do I think that the other matter just referred to by Deputy Corish is one that should be discussed here.  It is a matter more for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which represents the general body of the Deputies in regard to matters of common concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I have carefully considered it.  I am satisfied that the privilege of franking cannot be safeguarded from abuse.  It has been universally abused and has had to be abolished in many places. Originally the privilege was, I think, enjoyed by members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, but it had to be abolished in 1838 owing to abuse. It is common knowledge that in the other countries in which it has been in use it has also been abused.  In addition, it would impose a fairly considerable burden upon this Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now offering an explanation to this House that he did not offer to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges when they put this matter unanimously before him.  He is now giving an explanation which is utterly at variance with the case he made to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not heard me to the end.  I advise the Deputy to read the debate which has just taken place on Vote 9 and to see what his leader said in regard to correspondence with the Banking Commission. I was saying that the privilege had been abused.  It is not necessary <Col N="823" /> for me, in correspondence with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to state all the results of my investigation.  It is generally admitted that, where granted elsewhere, the privilege has been abused. In addition, it would impose an additional burden on the public funds. In all the circumstances, we could not agree that Deputies should have not merely the privilege of franking letters addressed to Government Departments and sent in envelopes officially marked &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann,&rdquo; which they now have, but that they should also have the privilege of franking letters addressed to other correspondents. Who is going to open a Deputy's letter to see that it relates only to public business?  As I have said, we could not, for that reason and for other reasons, extend this principle of the franking of letters other than those sent on official stationery to the Government Departments.</P>

      <P>I would like to underline what Deputy Corish has said.  The fact is that they have not got enough medical inspectors in the Local Government Department and the Department will not take the certificate of the local dispensary doctors.  They have been asked to increase the medical officers in the country in order to help to do this work.  In my opinion a much more expeditious and prudent way of dealing with this problem would be to name certain dispensary medical officers in rural Ireland whose certificates the Department would accept, otherwise we would have another warble-fly host of inspectors. I asked the Department to name certain officers throughout the country from whom the Local Government Department would accept certificates in good faith.</P>

      <P>Of course this House is voting the money and I would be interested to know how it is to be spent.  I think the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would also be interested to know on what this money is being spent.  I remember in the old days how very interested the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would be in knowing on what was this money going to be spent.  Deputy Murphy from Cork would be interested in what it was being spent, so would Deputy Corkery and I am sure Deputy Mrs. Concannon if then in opposition would be up in arms against this libel on the people of Ireland.  Why does she not administer that interrogatory to the Minister now?  If the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party want to know on what this money is being spent they might have felt when they were in opposition that it was fruitless to ask.  But they may now compel the Minister to answer them, and if he does not answer them they can vote against giving him this money.  They have him where they want him and they can get the information which we are now unable to get.  Surely Deputy <Col N="828" /> Corkery, who feels so strongly on national matters will call to our aid the cohorts of West Cork to extract this information from the Minister. All the Deputy has to do is to ask for it and he will get it.  I look to him, as an independent-minded public man, to do his duty.</P>

It is particularly important that he should give us this information when we realise the substantial increases in the expenditure under this heading that there have been in the successive years of Fianna Fáil administration.

If he wanted to give me an opportunity of giving information to the House he could, as I have said often before, take the trouble of putting down a Parliamentary Question.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The Dáil expects us to spend what is necessary for the protection of this country.  We are doing what every other Government is doing.  The purpose of the Vote is to obtain information which is requisite for the security of this country and which cannot be obtained openly, and we are not doing anything except what other Governments are doing.  There has been an increase in expenditure upon the secret service elsewhere.  We are not blind to the situation; we are not blind to what has been going on here and elsewhere. We are perfectly willing, if we cannot get the necessary information in any other way, to get it by means of the secret service.  It is our duty to get it.  If this information is going to help to make this country more secure, it is our duty to get it in this way, if we cannot get it in any other way.  The very title of the Vote shows what it is for.  The need for a Vote of this kind has been recognised everywhere.  So hall-marked has been that recognition that the Dáil has expressly waived its right to the explanations which it might expect to get in regard to other Votes.  Particular precautions are taken in dealing with this Vote, because it is clearly recognised that it is not in the public interest that the sort of debates which have taken place year after year on the <Col N="831" /> Secret Service Vote should occur.  The comparatively trivial amount expended on secret service is, I think, a guarantee that there is no abuse.</P>
      <P>I again wish to make it clear that in every year since we came into office the Dáil has given, us authority to expend very considerable sums of money on the secret service and that in no single instance has more money been spent in securing this information than the responsible members of the Government deemed was absolutely necessary for the public security.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I would not wish the Minister to misunderstand the position, because I think it is right that he should know that we have not the slightest prejudice against the prudent expenditure of the money, but I do say that we are a little shocked by the imprudence with which he has laid it out.  I remember that a couple of years ago we had a decent man on the headquarters staff of our organisation.  He came to us one day and asked if we had any objection to his continuing to draw £4 a week from the secret service fund.  We said: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo; We understood that there were a couple more' in the office drawing money out of the secret service fund.  So far as we were concerned we looked on it that they were just supplementing their wages in that way, and that they were very welcome to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy Norton that the Minister is denying that he is paying such money to anybody.  Deputy Dillon has made a <Col N="832" /> statement in the House which I challenge him to substantiate by producing the gentleman to whom he has referred.  Naturally, because of the way the money has to be expended, anybody can get up here and say that so-and-so told him that he was receiving such-and-such an amount from the secret service, but let the Deputy produce the recipient of the money. Possibly that person was trying to get a rise from Fine Gael.  He was certainly taking a &ldquo;rise&rdquo; out of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not ask for any advance of salary.  He was getting a comfortable income out of this money, and we said that we did not object. It appeared to be well understood that there were a couple more drawing money.  I am entitled to raise this matter, because I say that I am entitled to direct the attention of the House to this: that some of this money is being improvidently spent.  If the Government are going to pay spies then they ought to send their spies to places where there is something to be found out.  They have sent a couple of spies into our headquarters, and if they want to send more to-morrow they will be heartily welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone must be responsible. The House is responsible for voting the money, and I am putting it that if we are going to spend money on spies then let us get value for the money.  I implore the Minister not to be part-paying the permanent staff of rival political organisations in this country out of the secret service fund.  If I heard that there were clerks in Deputy Norton's office getting 30/- a week from Deputy Norton and £2 a week from the Minister for Finance I would resent it, because I do not think it is any part of the business of this House to pay the clerks in Deputy Norton's office.  In the same way Deputy Norton is entitled to protest here when clerks on the headquarters staff of our political organisation are getting half their wages out of the secret service fund.</P>

      <P>No. We did not get any of the money.  From the point of view of his ordinary mode of life, this man was living in rather luxurious circumstances during that period.  I do not grudge it to him.  I think he deserved it if ho was able to persuade the Government that he was giving them information; if he was able to thrill them and make shivers run down their spines with stories of the plots that were being hatched under the black hood and under the dreadful incantations going on at 3 Merrion Square. The foolish men in the Government have since got sense.  They have realised that their legs were being pulled by the individuals on whom they were wasting secret service money.  So far as some of the money has been spent in teaching them that lesson, my own opinion is that it has been spent well, and I do not grudge what has gone in that way.  I think, however, that a time has now arrived when ordinary prudence should be exercised in the administration of this fund, and that the Minister ought to be more careful in future to ensure that if we pay spies we ought to get some value for our money.</P>

      <P>No, because the Deputy has told us that they are no longer with him and therefore they are not in any such danger.  I do say this, that it is not unknown for a man who is in danger of losing his job, or who is not satisfied with the salary which he is receiving, to go to his employer and say that &ldquo;so and so has offered me so much more if I will serve him instead of you,&rdquo; and to utilise that as a lever for extracting an increase in salary.  That is not unknown, and, possibly, some person may have worked that dodge on Deputy Dillon and his associates: to go to them and say &ldquo;the Government is prepared to give me £4 a week to give you away. What more are you going to give me?&rdquo; That stunt may possibly have been tried, though in view of the recent rather shaky condition of the Fine Gael finances I think the man who would try it would indeed be an optimist if he thought it was going to work.  At <Col N="835" /> any rate I am going to make this offer to Deputy Dillon and to Deputy Mulcahy. Mind you, Deputy Mulcahy ought to know something about paying secret service money to men who are engaged in the offices of political organisations because there is on record the report of a tribunal set up by this House which does show that during the period our predecessors were in office a certain man was paid to act as a Government agent in the Fianna Fáil organisation.  That is on record, and that has been proven.  I challenge Deputy Dillon, in order that this matter may be tested, to furnish me with the names of those employed by the Fine Gael organisation who allege that they have been retained as secret service agents by the Government, and I will let him know whether it is true or not.  Then we will be able to determine whether these men are as trustworthy as the Deputy seems to think.  He will be able at any rate to know whether they have been trying to fool him a little bit.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has made wild allegations which somebody may take at their face value, because they do not know the gentleman who has made them, but I challenge Deputy Dillon now to give me in confidence the names of those people who have told him that they were employed as Government agents in his organisation, and I will tell him whether it is true or not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon has already said that these men are no longer Government agents; that they are so honest, so upright and such models of rectitude that they could not possibly endure to continue <Col N="836" /> taking £4 a week from the Government and not render the Government the service for which they were being paid.  Deputy Dillon has already told us that and, therefore, his men are in no danger of losing their jobs, so far as we are concerned.  They might be in danger of losing their jobs if Deputy Dillon found he had been tricked, because, I presume, if he investigated this matter and was sufficiently assured&mdash;I am not certain whether it could be proved&mdash;not to believe their story, I take it the Deputy's organisation would dispense with the services of these men, if they have not done so already, merely because they cannot afford to provide for them any longer.  I know there have been gentlemen employed, gentlemen who were members of the Deputy's organisation particularly on its militant side, who were used by them in Government offices for the purpose of securing information&mdash; but who, needless to say, are not in Government employment any longer.  They were very prominent members of the Deputy's organisation at one period.  But that is possibly beside the point.  What is to the point now is that the Deputy has made an allegation here that Government money was used for a certain purpose, and I am asking him to give me the name of the individual who made the allegation and I will have the matter sifted, and I will let the Deputy know whether it is true or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me answer that.  I have not the slightest intention of rendering information to the Minister about the identity of the persons concerned. So far as I am concerned, any agent of the Government or the police is welcome to investigate any activity on my part in my public or private life, in so far as it is the right of the Government to intervene in my private life.  Any police agent and any representative of the Government or the forces of the State are welcome to go into my office at any time, on any occasion, to see any papers that they choose to see in their capacity as protectors of the public peace.  I have no objection whatever to the Government <Col N="837" /> using their secret service money to inform the Attorney-General's Department and the police force of any activities proceeding inside any organisation of which I am a member and I consider they have a perfect right to request me to inform them of any illegal activity good, bad or indifferent, promptly and immediately, that may be going on in any organisation to which I belong.</P>
      <P>I have no grudge, as a politician, against the Minister's Government for paying secret service agents in my political organisation or any other political organisation, but as a public man I say it is a waste of money.  The Government ought not to be paying spies where there is no crime to detect. It is the duty of the police to make up their minds approximately correctly before they distribute secret service money as to whether it is going to be properly expended or not.  If the police have information that there is illegal activity going on in any office with which I am associated, I have no complaint whatever to make in regard to any steps the police may think it expedient to take in order to track down any illegality that they believe to exist.  It is only right, in view of what the Minister has said, to mention that on one occasion I with, I think, the full approval of my colleagues on the National Executive of the United Ireland movement, went to the Attorney-General and said to him:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If there is any illegal activity going on in any branch of our organisation all you have to do is to acquaint me or any of my colleagues and it will be promptly stopped.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, that is irrelevant at the moment.  The Attorney-General asked if he could bring that to the notice of the Executive Council and I said he might do so and I stand over that now as I stood over it then. I do make the case that it is a waste of money to be sending spies where <Col N="838" /> there is nothing to so.  The Minister says to me:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Give me his name and I will tell you whether he is genuine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether he is genuine or not; he never got anything out of me.  The man told me quite honestly, I believe, that he was getting money out of the Government. I was glad to hear it.  It meant that his income was supplemented.  I saw no objection to his being there as a Government agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny he was there. I deny the existence of this person.  I think it is a another case of Mrs. Gamp's friend&mdash;the person does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely telling the Minister what took place.  The only objection I have to it is that it is unprofitable and a waste of money. What reason any man would have in our office to tell us that he was receiving money from the Government to give information to the police, I cannot imagine, because it would only induce us to give him less income in view of the income he was receiving from the police.  The Minister may weigh up all these possibilities.  I do not want him to think that I make any attack on him for sending this agent. It may be considered an enterprising thing, but in my opinion it is a very silly thing to do.  I think the Minister is getting more sense now.  I think he is beginning to realise that the ghosts that frightened him and the conspiracies that he believed to exist at one time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
