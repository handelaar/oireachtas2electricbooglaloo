      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state the grounds on which Corporal James Maloney, of Roscrea (No. 101,316), was not permitted to do the cadet course of the Volunteer force, particularly as he obtained first place in the final examination out of 50 Volunteers in 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such course in the Volunteer force as a cadet course.  There are potential non-commissioned officers' and potential officers' courses.  Ex-Volunteer James Maloney was permitted to undergo the potential non-commissioned officers' course held from the 1st May to the 13th August, 1934, and at the examination held on the conclusion of that course he obtained 19th place.  He was not permitted to undergo a potential officers' course as he was not considered suitable.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 43, to delete all words after the words &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; to the end of the section.</P>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned on the last occasion, I understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated his desire to redraft certain sections of the Bill, and on that understanding other amendments to Section 85 were withdrawn.  I mention that because it becomes rather difficult to deal with amendments that arise on the remaining sections of the Bill in view of the fact that the structure of this part of the Bill is going to be materially altered.  Section 85 sets out the conditions that would obtain after the reinsurance corporation had been set up.  As the Bill originally stood, everybody had to offer all their reinsurance to the reinsurance corporation risk by risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Now we understand that reinsurance is to be effected by an ordinary reinsurance treaty negotiated with the reinsurance corporation. One of the statutory conditions of each such reinsurance treaty shall be, according to Section 85:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> Every contract of reinsurance of assurance business entered into by the company within a period of ten years after the date on which the company commences business shall be guaranteed by the government of Saorstát Eireann, but no right of action shall lie, at the suit of the company or of any assurance company or other person, against the government of Saorstát Eireann under such guarantee or otherwise in respect of any liability on foot of such contract.</P>
    <P>I have yet to learn what value attaches to a guarantee which cannot be enforced against a guarantor, and I am moving, accordingly, to delete the words set out in the amendment.  It seems to me to be a travesty to announce that the Government are prepared to stand behind every contract of insurance and, in the same breath to announce that, while they do so stand behind them, they, by statute, withdraw from the persons depending on the Government guarantee the right to sue the Government, in the event of the Government failing to redeem the actual terms of the guarantee.</P>
    <P>It might very well happen that there would be a <i>bona fide</i> dispute between the company which had effected the treaty of reinsurance and the Government as to what the exact terms of the reinsurance treaty were and as to what the exact nature of the liability under the Government's guarantee was.  Section 85, as it stands at present, would prevent the company which had made the treaty, and which was depending on the Government's guarantee, going into court to recover from the Government what the company believed they were entitled to under the guarantee set out in Section 85.  A more extreme case would be if the Government simply refused to pay altogether.  That contingency, I admit, is unlikely to arise, but I do see a very real danger of a genuine difference of opinion arising between the Minister and the company which negotiated the treaty as to the exact liability of the Minister, and I think it is an absurd suggestion that the company should be prohibited from going into court in order to have substantial justice done <Col N="2315" /> between themselves and the Government in the matter of this guarantee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment and put before the Minister certain aspects of this case which I do not think Deputy Dillon has drawn to the attention of the House. The State are engaged in trading under this Bill.  For certain purposes, they have a reinsurance corporation and, apparently, they are going to stand behind that corporation to a limited extent.  I think people who, presumably, are going to entrust their money to insurance companies, and who believe that their money is safe when they pay their premiums, are entitled to know to what extent the Government are not standing behind the reinsurance corporation.  I take it that the Government could not be sued except where there was some sort of <i>prima facie</i> case or where a person who felt himself aggrieved at some particular decision, thought he would take the Government into the law courts. Surely if State trading is to be introduced into this country on certain lines in which it has not been introduced before, the State ought to take up the position that they stood in the shoes of the people who formerly carried out that business&mdash;that they do not want any better treatment and that they will not have themselves treated any worse. Surely the Government do not want to get the premiums and run none of the risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is probably a far-fetched idea, but supposing, for the sake of argument, there was some claim in which the Government, through the reinsurance corporation, were very largely interested, and the assessors had made a settlement which somebody in the reinsurance corporation thought was not sufficiently in their favour, and the individual, who had his claim guaranteed by the reinsurance corporation, found that, under some particular phase of the transaction, he could bring the Government into court. What are the Government afraid or ashamed of?  They are protecting themselves with the money of the country and they would be fighting the action on velvet.  Unless the Minister <Col N="2316" /> can give us some reasons, which have not been brought out up to this, to show that there are certain aspects in which a person ought not be allowed to sue the Government, I think we would be well advised to give way to this amendment, because nothing will make the public so suspicious as some concealed proviso that the Government are able to do something which, possibly, they may have no intention of doing.  The matter ought to be cleared by the Minister saying that, under certain circumstances, the Government are going to shelter behind the fact that they are not to be sued, and then the people would know where they are. I consider this is a most unfair provision, and introduces into the insurance business a circumstance which has not existed up to this, and may very well leave the public, who are insuring their premises, in a state of anxiety which the Minister might very well and very easily allay.  I would ask him to make a statement on this section as to the circumstances under which he considers the Government ought not to be sued if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary security for those who enter into contracts of reinsurance with the reinsurance corporation will be the resources of the reinsurance corporation, and, in the ordinary course, these resources will be quite adequate to enable it to carry out these contracts.  Behind these we put the Government guarantee provided by the section.  It is not correct, as Deputy Dockrell stated, that the Government propose to stand behind the reinsurance corporation to a limited extent.  The Government propose to stand behind the reinsurance corporation to an unlimited extent for a period of ten years.  I think that most people will agree that the Government guarantee provided for here, even with the qualification to which Deputies have adverted, is a valuable security for those who will be engaged in the effecting of reinsurance business with the reinsurance corporation. It is extremely improbable that, under any circumstances, the Government would fail to honour their guarantee of a contract of reinsurance.  But if these unlikely circumstances should <Col N="2317" /> arise, I doubt very much if the persons concerned would find that a court order would be very effective.  In any event, it is wrong in principle to give persons, in these circumstances, the right of action against the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government are guaranteeing the contracts of the reinsurance corporation, and if that guarantee has to be made good at any time, the Government will be obliged to come to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to vote the necessary money.  It will depend upon the concern which the Government in office have for the credit of the State and the general conduct of business here to see that that is done.  I think there is no prospect of circumstances arising by which it would not be done.  But it is considered undesirable in principle to give parties the right of action against the Government, and, as I have said, that right would be an illusory safeguard in the very improbable circumstances in which the Government would fail to honour the guarantee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister has quite cleared our minds as to the circumstances that might arise. I take it that there is mention somewhere in this Bill of a reinsurance corporation with a capital of £500,000. That £500,000 would be very adequate for meeting certain risks, but there are certain obscure risks involved in insurance, such as earthquakes and fire, arising possibly from riot and civil commotion, or some such hazard as that.  In those circumstances, £500,000 might go a very short distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of time, the resources of the company will be considerably in excess of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so, but there is an intervening period, and if the Minister could give the investing public a guarantee that there would be no earthquakes here for the next 25 years, it would remove that hazard, but there are other factors to be considered. To my mind, the kernel of the whole matter is the feature of compulsion. The people are compelled to reinsure with this reinsurance corporation.  In the ordinary open market, they can get companies with <Col N="2318" /> gigantic resources.  Apparently the Minister wants to stand behind this reinsurance company to a limited extent. This is the acid test so far as we are concerned.  Can the assets of the Government be brought in when there is some huge and unforeseen hazard?  In the case of money invested in insurance by the public at present, the insurance companies are backed by each other, and by other outside companies, and the risk is so spread that there is practically no chance of a default on the risk.  Now we are invited to do away with the chance of investing with those insurance companies.  I grant you that unusual events are not very likely to happen, but they occasionally do, and this country may be faced with a defaulting reinsurance company behind which the people thought the Government was standing, but which they find they are standing behind only to the extent of their guarantee.  That would be quite all right if the reinsurance corporation stood on all fours with every other company, and if it was a case of &ldquo;Let the buyer beware&rdquo; as to whom he puts his money with, but where compulsion is introduced, the security ought to be beyond question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dockrell is labouring under one misapprehension. He contemplates the reinsurance company retaining all the risks ceded to it by the insurance companies. To the extent that the board of the reinsurance company considers it wise to do so, having regard to its own resources, it will arrange to retrocede those risks to other insurance companies or reinsurance companies, and, as I explained before, carry on its business in an ordinary commercial way.  It will be the function of the board of the company to see that at no one time is it carrying greater risks than its resources would justify. It is not intended that the reinsurance company should carry all the risks ceded to it.  In so far as it is necessary to do so, they will arrange for the retrocession of these risks elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us suppose they can. That does not vitiate in the very least the point made by Deputy Dockrell, that where you compel them to transfer a certain part of their business to a given firm, you are not entitled to shake from your own shoulders, responsibility for that firm's solvency. The Minister admits that by the introduction of Section 85.  He sees that it is unreasonable to order people to deal with a firm which is only just set up without giving them some assurance that that firm has something more than the capital and combined experience of its board of directors, but he suggests in the terms of Section 85 that, after 10 years, there would be plenty of security there to provide for everybody.  If the Minister's attitude was that at the end of 10 years, you are perfectly free to insure with whom you like, nobody could press him on the subject of guarantee, but what the Minister says is &ldquo;For all time you must give this company, not so much of your reinsurance as you want to give them, but so much of your reinsurance as they want to take.&rdquo;  How on earth can he maintain that there is no obligation on the State to add &ldquo;If this reinsurance company with which we are forcing you to deal, very possibly against your will and your better judgment, fails, the Government will step in and meet whatever balance of your claim the corporation is unable to carry on whatever balance they have not already retroceded elsewhere&rdquo;?  That is one point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that the Minister has said it is contrary to principle to give anybody a right of action against the Government.  Since when did it become contrary to principle to give anyone a right of action against <Col N="2320" /> the Government?  If the Minister's motor car, in which he drives every day, and which is a charge on his Estimate, knocks me down, I can sue the Minister for Finance, I think, for damages, and recover from him.  I can sue any Department of State under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and recover damages.  The action of guarantee is closely analogous in this case to an action for damages.  If the Minister involves an insurance company in heavy losses, as a result of imposing a statutory obligation on it to deal with the reinsurance corporation, he says in the statute that he will pay any damages that may result from the compulsion he puts on them. Why cannot we sue for those damages in court in the same way as we sue the Minister for Finance for damages under the Workmen's Compensation Act and analogous circumstances? There is no principle at stake.  The only principle that was ever invoked to preclude persons from suing the Government is the principle that the citizen may not sue the King, and that is a wholly archaic principle which is steadily being swept away by statute in Great Britain and everywhere else. It is absurd to reinvoke it in connection with Section 85, and if there is any other principle on which a refusal to permit a citizen to sue the Government rests, I should be glad to hear of it, because I have never heard any other principle cited in defence of that proposition, except that the citizen should not sue the King and should have no right against the King except by a petition of right.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, Section 85 becomes perfectly useless unless you delete the remaining words.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that any Government solicitous for the credit of the country would come in here and introduce an estimate to meet any claim that should arise, but I put the case again: Suppose there is a bona fide difference between the Minister, or the Government of the day, and an assurance company as to what the Government's liability is under the guarantee set out in Section 85, who is going to decide it, and who is going to force the Minister to give something more than the Minister <Col N="2321" /> thinks he is obliged to give by the terms of Section 85?  Unless we have the right to sue the Minister and bring him into court, he becomes the guarantor and the arbitrator in his own business, and I suggest that that is a perfectly absurd position.  If there is a guarantee, I suggest that that guarantee should be enforceable by law&mdash;most especially because there is compulsion on the company as between it and the reinsurance corporation and because, at any moment, a case may arise in which it would be impossible to arrive at agreement between the company and the reinsurance corporation without resort to the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what Deputy Dillon has said, any question that might arise as to the rights of an insurance company, as between it and the reinsurance corporation, can be determined by the court.  I think that the only case of the type that Deputy Dillon has in mind could be determined by a court in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out that in the section, as drafted, looked at merely from a technical point of view, there is no guarantee whatever. Not merely is there no right of action, but in reality there is no guarantee at all.  In actual fact, there is no such thing as Saorstát Eireann. Nobody ever heard of such a thing as a Government of Saorstát Eireann except in reference to political matters. One speaks of the Government of Saorstát Eireann as a body of men responsible to the Dáil, but in effect, and legally, there is no such thing as Saorstát Eireann.  Nobody ever heard of the Government of Saorstát Eireann being sued as a legal entity.  There is no such legal entity as the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  It is not mentioned in the Constitution.  When one speaks of the Government of Saorstát Eireann, that is merely a popular term for the Executive Council, and that is merely a body which is politically responsible to the Dáil.  Therefore, looking at this thing from a purely technical point of view, to say that the Government guarantees it means nothing. If it means that a group of people <Col N="2322" /> who, for the moment, are politically responsible to the Dáil, are to guarantee this thing, then it is the most perfect nonsense that one can conceive. I do not say that it is deliberately done, but I suggest that it may be deliberately done in order to be able to say that, in fact, and in effect, there is no such thing as a guarantee at all if a dispute should arise.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said, in effect, that a matter of this kind can be left to the court, but, of course, that means that it is left to the Minister for Finance.  In other words, it is left in the hands of the officials, and Deputy Dillon put his finger on the real essence of the matter when he said, firstly, that if there is any foundation in what the Minister said about giving this right to the company, it is merely a harking back to what was done in earlier sections of this Bill&mdash;to the prerogative of the Crown&mdash;that the King can do no wrong&mdash;and, secondly, that there was a greater tendency to get away from such prerogatives and to give to ordinary citizens rights of action against Departments of State.  As he pointed out, even in England they are doing that.  They are getting away from such prerogatives in England.  As a matter of fact, a committee was set up there recently, I think, to decide what machinery should be set up to allow actions by individuals to be taken against the State.  That has been the case even in England.  In this country, as a matter of fact, we have nullified to a large extent the ban on taking action against the State by the passing of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, subject to the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General, and, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, the Attorney-General is an officer who is independent of the Executive Council.  The Attorney-General does not hold his office under the will of the Executive Council.  I am not going to enter into the merits of that, but I think that provision was inserted in that Act for the purpose of seeing that the Attorney-General, whoever he might be, would perform his duties impartially, irrespective of whatever Government or Executive Council might be in power, and irrespective of political considerations generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2323" /> I suggest that the position the Attorney-General holds, under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, is to give his <i>fiat</i> to the institution of actions against the Government or Government Departments and that he is not there to prevent actions, as such, but to prevent vexatious or frivolous actions against Government Departments.  It is open to the Attorney-General to prevent what he may think vexatious actions and, undoubtedly, he can use that power capriciously.  However, I do not want to express an opinion on that.  The point is that there is a responsible officer, independent of the Executive Council who can give his <i>fiat</i> irrespective of the views of any Government Department and irrespective of political considerations.  That is the principle which operates in this country. The under-lying principle of requiring the <i>fiat</i> of the Attorney-General before proceedings are taken against the Government is to prevent vexatious or frivolous actions.  I think that that will be admitted.  Why not, then, do the same in this case, and at least keep the principle in conformity with the principle underlying the Ministers and Secretaries Act, or, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, with the principle underlying the Road Traffic Act or the Workmen's Compensation Act? As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, you can do this under these Acts, and he has also pointed to the really bad principle here: and that is as to who is to adjudicate in a dispute between the Government and some person who is dissatisfied on this matter of reinsurance. As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, the Departmental officials will decide it, as things stand at present, and they will decide it according to their own views, and we all know that the Departmental officials are always right.  As a matter of fact, some of us have had considerable experience of the way Departmental officials work in connection with the various Damage to Property Acts.  We have had cases, known as &ldquo;Report Cases&rdquo; where all the formalities were gone through and where the judges concerned were asked to waste their time debating these things&mdash;and I, personally, have had <Col N="2324" /> some considerable experience, during a period of three or four years, in dealing with such cases&mdash;and where, after the judges' award these reports came in sheaves from the various High Court judges and were then gone through with a high-powered microscope in the Department of Finance. As a matter of fact, I was amazed by the ingenuity of the Department of Finance in finding out what was left undone by the State Solicitor or by the judge, and, not merely what was left undone by the State Solicitor or the judge concerned, but what was left undone, even on appeal, by the Chief State Solicitor or the judge of the Appeal Court.  In other words, the officials of the Department of Finance arrogated to themselves the absolute right to say whether or not the decision of a judge was right or wrong, and, even where the judge made the decision that a claim should be paid, the officials refused to pay.</P>
    <P>What will happen here&mdash;if anything will happen except a mere refusal to pay?  The Ministry of Finance will be the body that will have the power to decide whether to pay or not pay. I suggest to the Minister that he should leave this out.  Either let there be no guarantee at all or let there be a proper guarantee.  As Deputy Dillon has suggested, the insurance corporation should be left to stand on its own legs and not to be bolstered up by a completely illusory guarantee such as is suggested here.</P>

    <P>My first remedy is against the reinsurance company, and if that should fail my remedy is against the guarantor. The reinsurance company may redeem its treaty of insurance up to a certain sum and then go burst.  The Minister takes the view that he remains liable for £32,500.  I submit that the Government is liable for £67,000.  There was never a litigant who did not take up the position that the other party to the litigation was wholly unreasonable; that there was no question about the liability, and what the other party was to pay.  That is always the way.  The fact remains that <Col N="2326" /> there is litigation and that the parties cannot agree.</P>

Circumstances may arise in which there will be legitimate differences of opinion.  At this moment, if I were the insurance company, and the Minister was the Minister for Industry and Commerce, as he happens to be, and that this Bill was in operation, there would be a difference of opinion between him and me as to what our respective rights were under this section.

      <P>That explains the whole situation better than an hour's debate. The Minister's answer is that the Deputy is wrong.  I ask the House to give me the right to go to the High Court and to submit my case to a judge.  The Minister's contention is that I am wrong.  If I make representations, and if there is a clash, does the House wish to enshrine that principle in this Bill?  If that is so, it means that justice has vanished from the country.  I could talk for an hour, and I could get no more dramatic illustration of the position than the Minister's statement, and I have no hesitation in asking the House not to be led by what the Minister interpolated, but to strike out the words set out in my amendment, and to allow me the right to go to the High Court in the event of a legitimate difference arising between myself and the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear from the remark the Minister interpolated that he does not understand the first thing about the section.  In answer to Deputy Dillon the Minister on a couple of occasions stated that the contract of guarantee was between the Government and the reinsurance company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it be so, it is a guarantee whether provided by the section or not, and a guarantee, as the Minister must know is a contract and the person who is guaranteed can sue the guarantor, leaving out the principal debtor, without resorting to him at all.  Perhaps it is news to the Minister that if he guarantees a friend in the bank for £50 the bank can go against him for the £50 without bothering about the principal debtor.  The section contemplates that there might be a right of action against the insurance company.  It is clear there is not to be a right of action against the Government.  The company that reinsured the other insurance company could sue the guarantor.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Whether the reinsurance company may default or not.  The section prevents any other person but the insurance company taking action.  I drew attention to this on the Second Reading and a change was made, and as a result, reinsurance is itself insurance and nothing else.  What you are guaranteeing, if you are guaranteeing anything, is the moneys due to the policy-holder. <Col N="2328" /> It is the policy-holder who is interested in this guarantee of the original insurance company, and I say that he should have an action against the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  Will the Minister look up the Dutch case? It was in the 1925 appeal cases.  He will find something there that will enlighten him.  We are not now discussing a question of law in court.  We are discussing the section, and if there is anything in the section, or any substance in the Minister's contention, that the whole object of the Bill is the protection of the policy-holder, then he ought to be given this real guarantee, and to give effect to it by allowing a right of action in court, if necessary, at the instance of the policy-holder. It is the policy-holder is interested.  He is the person to be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>A policy-holder is interested in the fact that under the Bill the company with which he is forced to insure, or the small group of companies is selected from within <Col N="2329" /> a small range.  He is not allowed to insure with any company that has not a licence here. He is forced to do that in the first instance; he is forced to do that knowing that the company with whom he insures must itself pass off some of that risk, not to the various big reinsurance companies to whom it could have passed it before, but to this company that is coming up here for the first time, and about which the Minister has expressed in this House during the course of this debate the greatest possible fears and anxieties. The policy-holder that this Bill is supposed to be brought in to protect is not to have any right at all.  Surely he is interested in the question of where his reinsurance is going?  Before the passing of this Bill, if he insures with a certain company he knows that back of that company and on his risk there is a large number of very big backs which are able to bear it.  He has to look not merely to the company with whom he insures originally but he knows that he has the security of all the companies that are at the back of it, and which he can effectively get at if the need be.  The Minister may not have adverted to those considerations. It is quite obvious that he has not really given this matter consideration at all, and that behind the bringing in of this section to the Bill is the same mentality and the same idea which brought an earlier section into the Bill providing that State debts should be paid before anybody else got paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 85 proposes to operate only for ten years, but the obligation to reinsure which it imposes continues for ever.  All the arguments to justify a claim for a right of action against the Government apply after the extension of this period of ten years indefinitely, so long as the Government indefinitely requires persons in insurance here to reinsure with the company.  I would be glad to know how the Minister hopes to justify the termination of the Government guarantee after ten years.  I would be also glad to know if he would indicate to us his intention of maintaining the section in conformity with the suggestion made by Deputy Costello that the Government of Saorstát Eireann, in the eyes of the law, does not exist. He will probably remember that a case was brought in the courts, in this country, in which an attempt was made to sue the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  The claim in that case failed on the ground that no such person existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the ten years' provision is concerned, it was inserted in order to ensure that if after that period the Government desires to continue the guarantee further, new legislation would be required, and the Dáil would have to be consulted.  If, as is probable at the end of ten years, the provisions of the section would be continued in its present or some modified form, we think that, having regard to the provisions of the section, fresh legislation should be introduced.  I do not propose to discuss the question whether there is or not such a person as the Government of Saorstát Eireann.  I leave that to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may, if he pleases, be facetious, but I think he should consult the draftsman in order to consider whether the words are effective or not, or whether they operate effectively in regard to the persons <Col N="2333" /> guaranteed.  If the Minister will amend the section, no difficulty will arise, but it would be a grave matter if the Minister informed the House that the words were put there by design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think sub-section (2) answers that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may think that sub-section (2) answers the question which I put to him, but that is a matter upon which I am not going to give a conclusive opinion.  I do not think that the Minister would be wise in attempting to do so either.  It is clear that on a question of reference to the Government of Saorstát Eireann the courts have decided there is no such person.  Such a reference is, therefore, undesirable and dangerous, and should be eliminated, and words in accordance with that decision should be substituted.  So far as the Minister's intention of reviewing the section at the end of ten years, no difficulty would arise if the Minister also provided that Part VI of the Bill should only obtain for ten years in so far as it operates to compel the insurance company to reinsure with the corporation. If he is going to reconsider Section <Col N="2334" /> 85 at the end of ten years, he should also give notice that he will reconsider the section in Part VI of the Bill which compels the insurance companies to reinsure with the insurance corporation.  The whole substance of our case is that it is unfair to impose such obligations without giving effective guarantees of the ultimate point of view of the State.</P>

      <P>We are not responsible for what any Government might do. We are responsible here for what this House may do.  We have passed Section 84, and we are passing Section 85 in a form which intimates that every contract of reinsurance shall be guaranteed only for ten years.  That is wholly unjust and unreasonable.  We could suggest that we ought to pass the Bill without Section 85 at all.  No one would suggest we should compel insurance companies to reinsure with the corporation without any guarantee. But after ten years no one will know what the effect of the Bill will be without Section 85.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 168:</P>
      <P>Before Section 86 and in Part VII to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>So far as may be prescribed all printing for or in connection with assurance business licensed under this Act shall be done in Saorstát Eireann and all paper and other material used for the purpose of such business shall be of Saorstát Eireann manufacture.</P>
      <P>Amendments somewhat similar to this have been inserted in other Acts of the Oireachtas.  The amendment, I think, explains itself.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate the idea of having as much work as possible of this kind done in the country.  A considerable amount of insurance literature is issued and it would be in the interests of the trade to have it printed here, if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have complete sympathy with the object of Deputy Doyle's amendment but a provision of this kind would be inappropriate in this Bill.  There is a Customs duty on matter of this kind at present.  If it is contended that that duty is insufficient in relation to this class of printing, or to these classes of documents, it can be reconsidered or action could be taken under the Control of Imports Act but I do not think we could insert a provision of this kind in an assurance measure.  It would be more appropriate in a Finance Bill or a Control of Imports Bill.</P>

      <P>I know there are many difficulties in the way of giving effect to the amendment.  Since tabling the amendment, I have been somewhat enlightened as to the difficulties that would arise.  Nevertheless, I should like if the Minister could see his way to meet the amendment in any possible fashion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be interesting only to the Minister for Finance but the policy-holders would like to see some of their money going back to the people in the way of providing work.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why, where we have foreign companies and Saorstát Eireann companies operating within the Saorstát, the Minister should require the Saorstát Eireann companies to furnish him with certain particulars which are set out in the body of the Bill, while, at the same time, exempting foreign companies from furnishing the same particulars. This section gives the Minister power to accept from foreign companies in lieu of the accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements which such company is required by the Act of 1909, or this Act, to make or deposit, <Col N="2339" /> copies of the accounts or statements, which such company is, by the law of the country in which it is incorporated or constituted, required to make or deposit.  The object of this Bill is to set up a certain standard of insurance practice.  In some respects, the standard set by this Bill is more rigid than that set in other countries.  In certain particulars, the standard set by this Bill is more rigid than the standard set in Great Britain. I, therefore, suggest that we should prepare a schedule of accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements which every company operating in Saorstát Eireann will be required to furnish to the Government, whether such company be a foreign company or a Saorstát Eireann company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only purpose of the section is to allow the Minister to accept in lieu of the accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements for which the Bill provides, copies of documents of a similar character which the companies concerned are bound to submit under the law of their own country to the appropriate Government Department of their own country. These accounts, balance sheets, abstracts and statements must give precisely the same information as, or at least not less information than the information required under this Bill, and it is merely a matter of conveniencing the companies concerned to that extent.  It is not proposed to allow the foreign companies to give any less adequate information on these matters than the Bill requires the Saorstát Eireann companies to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have an undesirable situation arising after that.  If we do not set a standard form of documents for all the companies operating here, you may have one set of documents for the Saorstát Eireann companies, while the British companies will furnish a set similar to the set they furnish to the British Board of Trade and the British National Health authorities; then again, it may be that you have German companies having to furnish the same class of documents as the Saorstát Eireann companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is permitted, you will be asking a different set of documents from the Germans from what you will be requiring from the British. In that case it will be said you preferred the British to the Germans, or vice-versa.  It might happen that we might find some lacuna in the British companies.  In my opinion, the matter is purely an administrative one, and if the difficulty suggested by the Minister arises, his successor can introduce legislation to remedy it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 173.</P>
      <P>Before Section 91, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the coming into force of this part of the Act&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  no foreign company shall undewrite a greater amount of new life assurance premium than 90 per cent. of the preceding year's new business total;</P>
      <P>(b)  all original proposal forms issued by foreign companies shall be retained in their Irish branch offices, and all new policies shall be prepared, signed, stamped and issued from such offices where a complete register of all policies shall be kept;</P>
      <P>(c)  the amount of policy stamps issued to foreign offices each year shall not be greater than 90 per cent of the amount issued the previous year.</P>

      <P>Section 91 put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 92.</P>
      <P>The revenue account which every assurance company is required by Section 7 (which relates to deposit of accounts with the Board of Trade) of the Act of 1909 to deposit shall, in addition to the matters required to be contained therein, contain and set forth the following particulars in respect of every class of assurance business carried on by such assurance company in Saorstát Eireann, during the period to which such revenue account relates, that is to say&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  the amount (including any unpaid instalments of the full annual amount of a premium) of the premiums (ascertained as nearly as may be) which are due and unpaid at the date at which such account is made up and for which credit is taken in such account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 176:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 46, lines 22 to 26, to delete paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to delete paragraph (c) because of the serious practical difficulties it will occasion.  Companies will have great difficulty in fulfilling their obligations if paragraph (c) is insisted on in this Bill.  When the Bill was introduced originally it did not contain the words now in paragraph (c) of this section. The insertion of the words in parenthesis in this section&mdash;&ldquo;ascertained as nearly as may be&rdquo;&mdash;shows that the Minister has recognised the difficulties with which insurance companies will be faced in filling up these new revenue accounts with the particulars that are requested in the Bill.  In the case of a company doing general business <Col N="2342" /> it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for it to give the particulars asked for.  If the Minister would only consider the case of a company doing general business covering a variety of matters, for all of which there is only one premium payable in the case of all-in policies, he will find how difficult this sub-section will make the work for the companies.  It would be a matter of the most extreme difficulty for any company to furnish the particulars asked for.  I do not know what is the object in having this paragraph in the Bill which requires this information to be given in the revenue accounts.  If it is for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the companies take credit for premiums they have not received, then the Minister ought to put in that specifically, and he would achieve his object better by specifically requiring the information rather than put the companies to the considerable expense that this section will put them to.  The fact is that they will not be able to give the information that the Bill is asking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding premiums constitute part of the assets of the company and are included in the funds.  They are an item which can be inflated by the inclusion of premiums which may never be received and are therefore fictitious.  It is desirable on that account that the amount of the outstanding premiums should be disclosed. I think it will be necessary to introduce an amendment to this paragraph on the next stage and limit it to Saorstát business.  That is merely a slight change without altering the principle.  The purpose of getting this information is to enable the proper position of the company concerned to be ascertained.  That could not be done unless this information was available.  These outstanding premiums are part of the assets and are included in the insurance funds, which can be inflated by the inclusion of premiums which may never be received, and the extent to which outstanding premiums are included in the assets should be made known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not considered the question which is really <Col N="2343" /> the kernel of the matter&mdash;that is, whether the premiums are paid as part of a composite premium?  They need not be split up.  They could be put in some way in which the premiums could be bulked together.  The difficulty of the insurance company is that where they receive one insurance premium the Minister is looking for them to split it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the premiums are split up in the revenue account of the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>But I understand that this would involve some further splitting up.  I think the Minister should look carefully into that question.  I think the Minister has an idea that the insurance companies are trying to get away with not disclosing these assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in it.  A premium of that kind covering insurance in two or more cases must be split up in the various revenue accounts of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to one or two cases.  Take the case of a comprehensive policy which may cover burglary, accident, fire and third party damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In each case the relevant proportion of the premium must be credited to the proper revenue account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will look into the question and see how far he can meet the wishes of the insurance companies without giving away any detail that really matters to him.  I think if he were to reconsider the matter he would find he could meet the insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the companies are anxious to give whatever information the Minister wants.  It is only the way he requires it in this sub-section that causes the difficulty. They believe that that will put them to considerable expense and possibly <Col N="2344" /> revolutionise their existing practice. If the Minister wants a certain thing done, if he would put it in specifically, it would meet the wishes of the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Into whatever revenue accounts the company puts the premium, or part of the premium, then in relation to that account we will require the information, whatever process of splitting up is done when the premiums are being credited to the various revenue accounts.  The information would be necessary in any event, and I believe this does not involve any further difficulty.  The section provides that the information must be given in relation to any particular revenue accounts.  As I have said, into whatever revenue account the premium or part of it is put, then in relation to that account we will require that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister does not think that the insurance companies do not wish to furnish details of particular revenue accounts? The difficulty that they foresee is that they will be asked to split up still further these revenue accounts.</P>

An accident policy can be sub-divided into burglary or storm or a variety of specific accidents against each one of which a separate policy could be taken out, but in fact all of which would be covered by a composite policy.  It did appear, in as much as the Minister put in the words &ldquo;ascertained as nearly as may be,&rdquo; that he envisaged a situation in which the existing accounts would require to be further sub-divided and in such detail that he could not reasonably ask for an exact account, but only one &ldquo;ascertained as nearly as may be.&rdquo;  If the Minister says, &ldquo;We have no desire for an account any more elaborate than the accounts ordinarily furnished&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In one respect I think that it would be entirely undesirable to effect any such provision as the Deputy suggests, and that is in relation to income-tax.  I think that the principle on which the Revenue Commissioners have always stood, that there can be no exemption from income-tax, is a sound one.  If it is desired to give financial assistance at the expense of the revenue to any concern, it should be done directly by grants and not by remission of tax in this way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How many members of the House realise that the British insurance companies pay no income-tax? They do not pay corporation profits tax at all, because there is no corporation profits tax in Great Britain, but they pay no income-tax on that part of their profits which they distribute in the form of a bonus to their policy-holders. Therefore, for every £1 that they segregate for the purpose of distributing as a bonus to their policy-holders, their policy-holders get 20/-. But the Irish companies must pay income-tax, not only on the profits distributed to their shareholders, but also on the profits distributed as a bonus to their policy-holders, so that out of every £1 set aside by Irish insurance companies for distribution as a bonus on policies, the Irish policy-holder gets only 15/-.  Had he held his policy with a British company he would get 20/- for every £1, but because he takes a policy with an Irish company he can only get 15/-.  Is it unreasonable, in the light of those facts, that the Irish companies should get some slight concession? The Minister, at this juncture, throws the Minister for Finance into the breach, and the Minister for Finance discreetly absents himself.  In view of some of the matters that I intend to raise on the Schedule, dealing with amalgamations.  I do not propose to press this amendment.</P>

While in a sense that is what will happen, it would be impossible to impose that as a statutory obligation.

      <P>I move amendment No. 182:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 16, to delete all words from the words &ldquo;all or any&rdquo; to the end of the sub-section and substitute the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  employers' liability insurance business:</P>
      <P>(b)  mechanically propelled vehicle (third party) insurance business.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  This amendment has for its object the deletion of the wide general power of fixing rates of premiums which is proposed to be conferred on the Minister by the section as it stands, and of confining <Col N="2352" /> that power to two particular classes of insurance, namely, the employers' liability, and insurance in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles&mdash;third party insurance.  The reason why these two particular classes of insurance were selected was because there is either a statutory obligation or something very nearly approaching a compulsory obligation to insure, and the case might be made that, in reference to a class of insurance where people are under a statutory obligation or almost a compulsory obligation to effect policies of insurance, the Minister might have the right to interfere. In reference to the wide general power that is conferred on the Minister by this Bill to interfere and fix rates of premiums, there is no real justification whatever for that.  The fixing of rates of premiums for insurance business is a very technical matter governed by technical rules and based on wide experience.  Interference in that class of business by a Department of State or the head of a Department of State might seriously affect not merely the interests of companies but of policy-holders or of prospective policy-holders.  The outstanding case of that time that may be affected is what is known as poor risks, where companies take on risks, which they would not ordinarily undertake, at a slightly increased premium, merely for the sake of getting other business.  If, in that class of case, there is interference by the Minister, or an order fixing rates of premiums, then it will probably be dropped and possible policy-holders will be seriously prejudiced. Poor risks will not be undertaken at the rates fixed by ministerial order, and the people who want to effect those risks, and are prepared to effect them at a slightly increased premium, cannot do so.  What the section proposes is, in our opinion, quite unsound.  The amendment aims at something in the nature of a halfway house.  In regard to workmen's compensation or insurance in relation to mechanically propelled vehicles, the power proposed to be conferred on the Minister might, with some degree of reasonableness, be held to be justified, but as regards the general proposition that the Minister should interfere and <Col N="2353" /> fix rates in all cases, there is no possible justification whatever for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment proposes to confine the Minister's power to regulate the rates of premiums to employers' liability insurance business, and to insurance business relating to mechanically propelled vehicles.  The whole section, of course, is designed to give the Minister power to protect the public against the possibility of exploitation under the circumstances that will arise when the Bill comes into operation.  I think it is desirable that he should have that power over a wider range of insurance business than the two classes of business referred to in the Deputy's amendment.  I do not say that, however, with very great emphasis, because I can see considerable practical difficulty in exercising the power conferred by the section in connection with many classes of insurance business, such as fire insurance or other business of a similar class.  At the same time, it has to be recognised that there will be a limitation upon the number of companies doing business here, and certain difficulties imposed in the way of new companies entering the business.  In fact, so far as foreign offices are concerned, they will not be able to enter into the insurance business here unless they were doing it on the qualifying date in 1935, and, so far as new Saorstát companies are concerned, there are certain requirements to which they must conform before they can get a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of fire business, where probably the weight of the argument on practical grounds is greatest against me, because the operation of the power in the case of fire business would be a very difficult matter, there will, nevertheless, be a situation in which there will be little if any competition against the tariff offices.  On the whole, I think it is desirable that there should be this power, power which would only be used in very unusual circumstances, because of the difficulties associated with its use.  But as a check against the possibility of policy-holders being exploited, I think it should be there. I am prepared to consider the elimination from the scope of the section of <Col N="2354" /> other classes of business than life business, such as bond investment business, but I do not think it is desirable that we should narrow the powers of this section in such a way as to confine them only to the two classes of business mentioned in the Deputy's amendment.  I have not, as I indicated, I think, by the words I used, a very fixed opinion in relation to the matter.  But, on the whole, I think it is desirable that we should have this power and have it in relation to a greater number of classes of business than the two mentioned in Deputy Costello's amendment.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in respect of which there is a statutory obligation to engage in, it becomes difficult to say at what point Ministerial interference should be checked and where Ministerial interference becomes pure State socialism.  I think the further we go in the Bill the more manifest it has become that the Minister is determined to run the insurance business on State socialistic lines before very long. Whether it is desirable to create a sense of false security by restraining his activities in the earlier stages of the Bill or not is doubtful.  We are much in the same position in this matter as we are to the tariff and Price Controller situation.  The Minister says &ldquo;I create a grave menace of exploitation and profiteering by my tariffs, but the operations of the Price Controller are sufficient to abate the evils.&rdquo;  Here, he says, &ldquo;I am going to set up a virtual monopoly in general insurance business confined to three companies in this country&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

If, on the other hand, the Minister is going to create a monopoly, something may be said for it.  But, if that evil is going to arise from the creation of a monopoly, in my opinion that is more an argument against the creating of a monopoly than an argument for giving the Minister a right to control premiums.

      <P>In the existing circumstances, it means a company engaged in the tariff ring in Great Britain, which is admitted to tariff treaties of reinsurance, and admitted to them on the basis of some agreement as to the premiums charged and the nature of the risks taken.  Outside that, there is a considerable body of companies who negotiate their reinsurance with Lloyds or Continental reinsurance companies of one kind or another.  If the Bill is passed, there is going to be compulsory reinsurance with the Reinsurance Corporation of Ireland, in so far as that corporation wants to take the risk.  Is not that so?</P>

That is the basis on which this section is being discussed, and the Minister himself says he has not the vaguest notion what the nature of the competition will be.  Is it beginning to dawn on Deputy Moore that he is being led up the alley?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it would. However, my submission is and my figures stand until the Minister contradicts them, that out of the 57 companies eligible to do business under this Bill of a general and fire character, 50 will be in the tariff ring and seven outside.  I say that these seven will provide adequate competition to keep premiums at a reasonable level from the point of view of the policy-holder. Therefore, the Minister ought not to have statutory power to fix premiums when no danger threatens the policy-holding public of this country.  I allege that he wants that power simply for the purpose of facilitating him in a gradual regimentation of the insurance business, with a view to nationalising it, at the same time as he nationalises, or attempts to nationalise, a good many other commercial enterprises at present operating in this country, in order to go as far on the road to State socialism as he thinks it safe at any given moment to go.  In my opinion, he will not get to first base, because he will be kicked out before he gets half way, but I believe this section is part of a general scheme to facilitate nationalisation of the insurance business, and that that itself is only one small part of a larger scheme to nationalise a wide scope of commercial activity in this country, which I look forward to <Col N="2360" /> seeing fail, and which I think the Minister is foolish enough to hope will succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, a minority of non-tariff companies would not in itself be sufficient security against impossible rates.  It would depend entirely on the quality of those companies.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always been the case that a non-tariff company is prepared to undercut, but that affects very little the business of the average tariff company.  May I submit that whatever defect the section may have, the amendment would have many more defects?  The amendment proposes to give the Minister power to fix rates with regard to two classes of insurance, insurance in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles and another class. With regard to insurance affecting mechanically propelled vehicles, it has very often been held, and, in fact, I think is generally held, by the companies doing that insurance, that it is not a paying proposition at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that gag, too, but they still go on doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>They do, and that is the point.  If it is associated with other classes of insurance and if the Minister were to take power to fix premiums with regard to that class of insurance only, it would create a totally new situation for the companies. He would be creating a situation which would affect the general policy of the companies to a considerable extent, because it is the case, at present, that companies doing that class of business are prepared to lose on insurance affecting mechanically-propelled vehicles so long as they gain by insurance closely associated with it.  If they are subject now to a fixed premium in respect of motor insurance it means that the Minister's interference must be directed towards making such insurance a paying proposition in itself.  That is not a proposal that would be consistent with the Deputy's general criticism of the <Col N="2361" /> Bill.  His general criticism of the Bill is that it may make insurance expensive. He has been pleading for the insurer, but the effect of his amendment would be probably to increase the rates of one particular class of insurance which affects a great number of people and an increasing number of people all over the country. I submit that, whatever defects the section may have, the amendment has much more serious defects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurs to me that possibly Deputy Moore has mistaken the meaning of the amendment.  As I understand it, it is put forward, not as being advisable or desirable that the Minister should have power to fix rates for any class of insurance, but as being a lesser evil than the giving of comprehensive powers that the Minister should be authorised to fix rates for particular classes of insurance where a special case can be made.  If that be right, Deputy Moore's argument falls to the ground.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the two classes mentioned in the amendment, insurance in regard to mechanically-propelled vehicles and employers' liability insurance, there is in one case the absolute compulsion in law upon persons to cover themselves in respect of those risks, and, in the other, there is, if not an actual compulsion, a practical compulsion.  By law, any person driving a mechanically-propelled vehicle is bound to cover himself with an insurance policy.  An employer is practically bound, having regard to the Workmen's Compensation Act and the liabilities he has to his workmen, to cover himself with an insurance company against those risks. That being so, it might be urged, and, no doubt, would be if the section as a whole were to go, that a special case could be made for these two classes, but the object of the amendment is not to suggest that that is necessary. The object is to narrow the evil which a wide power embracing all classes of insurance would make for.  I suggest it is a better principle to go upon to indicate the particular <Col N="2362" /> subjects to be covered rather than to give the Minister the widest power of fixing rates for all classes.</P>
      <P>The undesirability of giving to the Minister, or to any Minister or Department, the power to fix matters which ordinarily ought to be regulated by free competition among companies and other bodies looking for business of a particular kind has been urged in other matters, and certainly I think it will be admitted that the ideal is to allow business to be conducted without State restriction and without State obligations being imposed upon the parties.  I understand that the Minister is afraid that the competition in this case between insurance companies offering to cover risks will not be sufficient to bring rates to the level at which they ought to stand having regard to the risk involved.  Does the Minister think that, by taking power to fix rates&mdash;presuming that a rates order would fix a maximum rate&mdash;he is going to remedy that state of affairs?  After all, it is not proposed that fire insurance should be made compulsory on the individual, and it is certainly not proposed that insurance companies should be laid under a compulsion to cover any fire risk that is offered to them.  I do not know how the situation should be met &mdash;how a particular person would feel he would be affected by a rates order if a rates order were fixed and if, as a result of that order, any insurance company refused to cover him at that risk.  The position of that person then would be that he would have to go uninsured, I suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there is no class of insurance in which more risks are involved, from the companies' point of view, than fire insurance.  Some classes of property, possibly, go without fire insurance because they are not so much exposed to the danger of fire, but all classes of property or premises which are peculiarly vulnerable to fire risks are described by insurance companies as poor risks, and I do not know how the Minister is able to say that he believes demands should be met if he is going to say that a rate should be fixed and if the insurance company concerned is not to be free <Col N="2363" /> to say to a particular person: &ldquo;We cannot cover you at such-and-such a rate, and if that rate exceeds the maximum then we cannot cover you at all.&rdquo;  Apart from the merits or demerits of exercising State control in a matter of this kind, I really think that this is going to be a disservice to people who might be able to get cover, and that it is really going to leave them without the possibility of getting cover at all.</P>

      <P>I think I dealt with that point already, and I do not like to speak about the same matter twice, if I can avoid it.  However, I realise that there may be some difficulty in differentiating between cases, as Deputy Lavery has pointed out. At the same time, I think the power should be there &mdash; recognising, of course, that that power should only be used in very exceptional circumstances, and only where the actions of the insurance companies concerned would be such as would demand that drastic action should be taken to prevent the exploitation of policy-holders. I admit that I am not very definite about this power, but I think we should have it in regard to all classes of insurance except life business.  I admit, however, that the application of these powers, if it should be necessary to use them, would be a difficult matter.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any such power in any part of the world.  However, with regard to what Deputy Lavery has suggested, would the Minister consider, between this and the next stage of the Bill, fixing a limitation of this power and confining <Col N="2364" /> it to a certain class of risk so that insurance companies would know where they stand?  I think, from what the Minister has said, that he recognises the difficulties of fixing rates generally, and I think it would probably be very much to the advantage of the proposed policy-holders, and also of the companies concerned, that the power should be limited to certain specified classes of insurance policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is limited in the sense that the word &ldquo;Iceland&rdquo; is limited.  However, there is a vast class of insurance to which this may apply, and there are other classes of insurance to which, I think, it could not in practice apply.  For instance, if the Minister started to fix a rate for the insurance to be fixed for a saw-mill, I think he would find some difficulty in doing so, and I suggest that if he would address his mind to fixing the rate of insurance for a saw-mill he might realise his difficulties and be able to limit still further than at the moment the classes of insurance that would be included in this power.</P>

At the same time, I think this particular method of control should be retained in case there is need for it, and I think it will be admitted that that need might exist where, in the new circumstances, a limited number of companies will be licensed to do certain classes of business.  There might be only one company in a particular class of business.  However, <Col N="2365" /> as I have said, I shall consider the matter.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 33, after the word &ldquo;greater&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or less than&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is really one of the most obnoxious sections of the whole Bill. It represents, so to speak, the high-water mark of the tendency that has been so obvious nowadays towards bureaucracy&mdash;the tendency to interfere with everything and to insist on having control over everything and everybody, while, at the same time, shirking responsibility&mdash;the tendency to adjudge and control while, at the same time keeping Pontius Pilate's finger-bowl alongside.  I think the effect of the Minister's statement is that everybody realises the difficulty of enforcing regulations of this kind.  The fire business varies in every case.  Even in the case of a company getting a particular business, say, in one street, the fire business may vary.  There might be four or five houses of a different kind in the same area and that makes it necessary for the companies concerned to change their attitude and get different premiums from the occupiers of the different houses.  The Minister, I am sure, realises what a difficult problem that presents, and I suggest that, in such circumstances, such drastic powers as are here proposed should not be given to a Minister. Deputy Costello made a case for varying the Minister's attitude towards fire insurance as against motor insurance and employers' liability insurance. However, I really do not think there is very much force in that.  Certainly, the fact that it is obligatory on these people to insure is something in their favour but, at the same time, two wrongs do not make a right, and it does not get over the difficulty of getting motorists to insure by asking insurance companies to take them at a rate that will not make it a paying proposition.  In this and every other business competition will look after the question of maximum premiums. <Col N="2366" /> In the cut-throat competition that there is in this particular line of business in the Saorstát there is not the slightest danger that the companies will go in for profiteering.  As a matter of fact, one of the reasons given as a justification for an Insurance Bill being brought before this House is the fact that the companies have been inclined to undercut.  I know that in connection with motor insurance business certain companies have taken business at half the tariff rates, and even at these rates most of it is not paying business, owing to the fact that there is exceptionally high damage.  It is not a paying business and the companies only undertake it to increase their incomes.  Very few companies are inclined to go mad about motor insurance.  If the Minister insists on maximum premiums, as a counterbalance he should insist also on having minimum premiums, and should see that companies trying to do business in a straightforward way, and with funds adequate to meet their liabilities, are not going to be penalised by those that are less conscientious.</P>

      <P>I think I had better read the section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Whenever a form of proposal for a policy of assurance is filled in wholly in the Irish language every policy of assurance issued in pursuance or as a consequence of such proposal and any other document issued in connection with such policy by the assurance company to which such proposal was made shall, if the proposer so requires, be issued by such assurance company in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>In the history of codology was there ever greater codology than that?  If so I have yet to hear it.  What fool is responsible for putting that in?  There is a statutory obligation on insurance companies to issue policies in Irish on request.  Is not that codology? Does it not bring the language movement into contempt?  Does it not bring a blush of shame to the cheek of anyone who ever advocated the promotion of the Irish language movement? God knows, when you spend years encouraging the promotion of the use of the Irish language in this country you find yourself being brought out to be made a fool of by an imbecile section of this kind being put into an Insurance Bill.</P>

      <P>You put that section into the Bill.  The implication outside is that the Irish language movement is codology.  No one wants that position except the pious warriors who are going around hoping that they will get jobs by the pretence that they are more enthusiastic Gaels than <Col N="2368" /> their neighbours.  No one who has any regard or respect for the language desires to be associated with codology of that kind.  The people responsible for introducing this section into a Bill of this character do the Irish language nothing but harm.  They bring it into disrepute and ridicule, and as far as I am concerned I think the section is greatly to be deplored.  It brings something to which I attach great value, and a movement for which I have deep respect, into disrepute.  It is a humiliation for anyone associated with it.</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by Mr. Dillon.  I asked the Minister when this section was considered on the Committee Stage if it was a joke.  I hardly believed that it was seriously intended.  Apparently it is going in as a joke and a futile joke.  The Government that is responsible for putting this futile section into the Bill and into legislation passed in this House is going to make the House and the country a laughing stock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise at once to refute everything that Deputy Costello has said.  The Deputy's position for the past two weeks has been that insurance law should be framed to meet the desires of the insurance companies.  They do not want a provision of this kind.  In fact, a very large number of them are in the position in which they will issue insurance policies in the Irish language to those who request them to do so.  I think this is a very desirable provision, and that they should be required to do so when persons doing business with them so desire.  Any company not prepared to conform to that condition is not required to do business here.</P>

      <P>I think it is perhaps not unreasonable that there should be some limit, but I think three years is much too short a period.  Certainly I could not agree to accept Deputy Dillon's amendment, which would have the effect of confining it to one year. I might be prepared to consider the insertion of an amendment providing for an overriding period of six years. I think it might be quite possible to conceal offences for more than three years.  It might even be possible to conceal offences for six years, but I agree that there should be some limit. I would be prepared to accept six years, but I would be very slow to consider any shorter period.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that the usual period within which summary proceedings must be brought is six months, and that this section is provided in order to take those cases out of that particular limitation? Surely, if a six months' period is ordinarily sufficient, three years is not too short a period to allow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the circumstances here are different.  The proposal here is similar to that which has <Col N="2371" /> been embodied in unemployment insurance law since its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal, in my experience of the working of unemployment insurance, is very bad.  Stale claims are resurrected by the officials in defence of the fund for which they have a tremendous admiration in the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It can frequently happen that knowledge of the fact that an offence has taken place may not come to light for years afterwards, when a repeat claim is made, or something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that the Minister should have a reasonable period within which to gain that knowledge.  I think Deputy Dockrell's period of three years is rather long, having regard to the fact which has been pointed out by Deputy Lavery&mdash;that six months is the ordinary period.  Certainly I would think that the period of six years suggested by the Minister is entirely too long.  The facts may come to the knowledge of the Minister after a lapse of five or six years, and the evidence to refute those particular facts which come to the knowledge of the Minister may have long since passed away. Evidence that might have been available to the person who is going to be prosecuted will probably, after a lapse of five or six years, have completely vanished or be unprocurable, and the only result might be that the person prosecuted after the lapse of such a considerable period would be quite unable to know what it was all about or to defend himself adequately.  The Minister should remember that what is being created here is a summary offence.  Therefore, it would be what is called in the Constitution a minor offence&mdash;not of a very serious character &mdash;and consequently I do not think it is desirable as a matter of principle that after such a long period as the Minister has suggested a person should be prosecuted in reference to minor offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal feeling is that it is proper not to have any limitation <Col N="2372" /> at all, but I am prepared to say that I cannot find strong arguments against the proposal that there should be an overriding maximum period.  I think six years would be not at all unreasonable, because having regard to the nature of this business, the long-term contracts that are made, and so forth, it may well happen that a considerable period may elapse before the knowledge that an offence has been committed will come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As between the suggested periods of three and six years, would the Minister consider between this and Report Stage whether six years is not too long?  I think it is a little bit too long.  If the Minister will look at the various offences which are created by this Bill I think he will find that a six years' period is a little bit unreasonable, having regard to the type of offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CecilLavery" hpid="Mr. Lavery Mr. Lavery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lavery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I am concerned only with the nature of the offences which are specified here.  I will just give the example that the valuation which each company is required to undertake operates only once every five years, and I think the period must therefore be some time longer than that, if, as a result, information that an offence was committed is brought to light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The First Schedule is the Schedule which implements the amalgamation scheme under this Bill.  This Bill has been one of very great complexity, and its full significance did not I believe present itself to most Deputies of this House until after a somewhat protracted debate, but from this Committee Stage it now clearly emerges that it will not be possible for any Irish solvent insurance company to carry on its business in this country.  It is an astonishing thing that the effect of this Bill is going to be that an Irish company which has become insolvent is going to be carried on in perpetuity, or an English company which has been operating in this country is going to be carried on in perpetuity.</P>

I believe that this Schedule forms <Col N="2374" /> part of a general scheme which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in his mind for the unification of the life and industrial life insurance business of this country under one large British combine.  I believe that when he has it assembled under that British combine he proposes to nationalise it as a body in insurance analogous to the Electricity Supply Board in the distribution of electricity.  I think it has become clear from an interjection made by the Minister in a debate on another measure which he was presenting to this House that he is now prepared to accept the philosophy of State Socialism; that he now takes the view that businesses of most kind can best be carried on by the Government, and should be carried on by the Government so long as he is entitled to run them.  He very wisely has made up his mind that the rank and file of his own Party either do not take the interest or have not got the intelligence to see whither he is going.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will get plenty of information before I am finished.  He will get all he wants.  I believe the Minister is deliberately leading the innocents of the Fianna Fáil Party along that line.  So far as they are concerned they will follow. They do not switch off, because they are told by the President that they must go along a certain line.  But I believe the people will not continue to go along that line.  I believe the people <Col N="2375" /> will kick the Minister out of office before he is able to consummate the job. But, in the course of carrying this into operation, I apprehend that he will destroy the livelihood of certain individuals who depend upon their business operations for a living.  I put it to the House that that is the general trend.  But this Schedule is entirely inadequate to the form outlined in the Bill.  We will have British companies with all their great wealth consolidated. We are going to have insolvent companies, in one way or another consolidated, and taken over, to enable them to carry on and to protect their policy-holders from loss.  When they come under this scheme, every policy they issue will carry an implied Government guarantee.</P>
      <P>The only persons left independent will be the solvent Irish companies, and they will be in this position: On the one hand, they will have as competitors the great British companies with their enormous reserves accumulated, offering far more advantageous terms than the Irish companies can offer.  On the other hand, there will be the amalgamated Irish insolvent companies, issuing policies each of which is endorsed with an implied Government guarantee.  Between these two competitors the independent Irish solvent firms will have nothing to offer.  They cannot plead for business on the ground that they are Irish companies because the amalgamated companies will also be Irish companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to submit a form of Schedule for the one I am discussing. I was indicating the views to the Minister by which he might devise a scheme under which every company could claim admission as a right, instead of, as under this scheme, making every company submit to him a scheme.  My contention is that the general trend of the Bill is that it forces every company either into bankruptcy or to amalgamate and, therefore, <Col N="2376" /> I contend that the duty devolves upon the Minister to devise an amalgamation scheme in which Irish companies could seek refuge.  I am offering the Minister, in lieu of the proposals in the First Schedule, a standard amalgamation scheme into which no one would be forced to come except insolvent companies, and into which each one could come if it claimed to do so as a right.  I, therefore, for the purpose of illustration, suggest that there may be in this country&mdash;I have no reason to believe that that is so&mdash;I am giving a pure illustration without any information on the facts&mdash; companies hopelessly insolvent, doing Irish insurance; and now I am submitting to the House the framework of an amalgamation scheme which I suggest should be adopted.  I suggest company A which has, actuarially, a deficiency of £250,000; company B which has an actuarial deficiency of £100,000.  I am suggesting a third company C as solvent and a fourth company D as solvent with a surplus, and a fifth company E with a greater surplus. I want the Minister to notify the company A that has an actuarial deficiency of £250,000 that he would take in exchange for the money he puts in ordinary shares to the value of £250,000.  Let me assume that the actual subscribed capital is £20,000. That would give the Minister the vast majority of the shares and would make the company solvent.  In regard to company B which has £100,000 deficiency I want the Minister to put in £100,000 in exchange for ordinary shares.  That would make the company solvent and the Minister secure because the subscribed capital would then be in the neighbourhood of £100,000.  Having done that, there would be five solvent companies, two owned by the Minister, and three by their own shareholders.  The two owned by the Minister would be just solvent. One other would be solvent, and two others would be solvent and have surpluses. I then would have the Minister value these five companies actuarially and my submission is that a fair basis of valuation would be to show that the goodwill of a solvent company is commensurate with one year's premium income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not know what I am talking about.  The memorandum of association having set out the value of the goodwill of the five companies, some of which are solvent, and some of which he would have been compelled to amalgamate, plus the value of the surplus, share capital to their joint value would be <Col N="2379" /> issued, and the five companies would be purchased from their present proprietors by the issue of shares to these proprietors in an amount equal to their several holdings in the five companies. That is to say that in respect of a company to which the Minister would have contributed £250,000 in order to make it solvent, taking 250,000 shares for the money contributed, whereas the capital is £25,000, the Minister would receive 1,000 shares in the amalgamated company for every one share the original proprietors of the insolvent company would receive.  I think, Sir, the memorandum of association of the amalgamated company should provide that the directors of a solvent company would be entitled to compensation in the event of its being deemed expedient to dispense with their services as supernumerary in order to facilitate the amalgamation.  I do not think that the memorandum of association of the amalgamated company should provide that a director of an insolvent company should be entitled to compensation inasmuch as by the failure of the company to maintain solvency he has disqualified himself.</P>

We now come to the First Schedule and I am suggesting the contents of the articles of association of the amalgamated company. However, I do not wish to detain the House any longer than is necessary to state the details of the scheme which should be incorporated in the First Schedule.  I trust the Minister will examine the suggestion <Col N="2381" /> I make.  I trust he will realise my desire to have outlined appropriate contents for this memoranadum and these articles so as to prevent a memorandum being drawn, the effect of which would be to destroy an independent solvent company which is at present in existence.  I believe there are at least three such companies threatened with extinction, if the memorandum of association of any amalgamated company is improperly or undesirably drawn.  I should be glad to know if the Minister would consider having his Department draw a memorandum of association and articles of association into which he will invite all the companies to come on the terms outlined by me as highly desirable, in view, and only in view, of the success with which the Minister has secured the assent of this House to the principles which were raised at earlier stages in our discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

There are certain companies which he will have to order to amalgamate as insolvent.  There may be one or two such companies; we do not know the number, but there are some.  I want to know whether he will consider <Col N="2382" /> drafting a scheme, under which he would feel, within the powers already contained in the Bill, competent to order insolvent companies to enter on terms and into which he would feel himself free to invite solvent companies to come on stated terms to be fixed in each particular case by arbitration, actuarial arbitration.</P>

What does that convey to any ordinary layman without the assistance of experts? We are supposed to understand the legislation we are asked to pass, whether we do or not.

      <P>I have explained that the four rules in Part II of the Schedule provide a basis upon which the value of a free paid-up policy or the cash surrender value of a policy can be determined.  Various modifications of each rule can be made, provided that the result represents a fair determination of the value of these policies.  In this particular case we provide that the first year may not be taken into account, so as to allow a set-off against initial expenses, but some other device might have been adopted and the same result secured.  The rules which we have taken and embodied in this Schedule are similar to those recommended by the Cohen Committee, the report of which Deputies opposite have frequently quoted in the course of this debate.  The Cohen Committee dealt with conditions in Great Britain and made recommendations in relation to the conduct of insurance in Great Britain.  In a matter of this kind it is merely a question of getting some fair basis, and this is as fair a basis as any other. Precisely the same result might be obtained by a completely different set of rules, and Deputies, if they so desired, could have moved to alter the rules which are set out.</P>

      <P>The Minister came in with a considerable bundle of papers under his arm, which it took two years to hatch out under the comfortable wing of every British insurance company which has invaded this country. What I am suggesting is that when complex legislation of a highly technical kind is brought before the House it would greatly expedite the discussion if the Minister's expert advisers would prepare a simple commentary on the more highly technical schedules and sections of the Bill, a commentary which would explain the general trend and purpose of the sections.  That is the universal practice in the House of Commons, in the United States House of Representatives and in the United States Senate, and in my opinion it is a practice that would be a very desirable one in this country, particularly now when we have here a mono-cameral Government.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, I think it does clearly express what the Government had in mind, but so that it shall be still further clarified I have agreed to accept certain amendments which appeared on the paper from Deputy Costello and to embody them in the section, not because I consider that these amendments are necessary or that a change in the section will be effected, but because it is desirable to have clarification.

      <P>&ldquo;I accept, of course, his statement that his idea is that this reinsurance company should operate on the same business lines as ordinary reinsurance companies do at the present moment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To that my reply was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That is intended, but a reinsurance treaty at the present time between one company and another is a voluntary arrangement.  To a certain extent that voluntary arrangement is being removed from the relations between companies licensed to do business here and the reinsurance company of Ireland, because it says that there shall be an agreement.  In these circumstances I think it is necessary to have the qualification to which the Deputy refers which is designed to prevent a company, having a reinsurance agreement with the reinsurance company, writing all sorts of bad risks, passing the whole of these risks on to the reinsurance company and retaining none itself.  The object of this provision is to ensure that this cannot happen ...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello I move amendment No. 187:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 55 and 56 to delete the words&mdash;&ldquo;(i) Third Party Claims, (ii) All other Claims&rdquo;&mdash;wherever they appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to simplify the form of the Schedule. Presumably the object of returning the fund in that form is to be found in Section 94 of the Bill, sub-section (1) of which sets out the nature of the returns to be made and sub-section (2) of which describes the form of this Schedule.  Under the first sub-section the assurance company carrying on the business of insuring mechanically propelled vehicles is required in addition to the statement made under Section 76 of the Road Traffic Act to prepare a statement of the estimated liability of such assurance company in respect of outstanding and unsettled claims relating to such business.  The object of the section is to ensure that the company are making proper provision in respect of outstanding and unsettled liabilities.  There is nothing to suggest that anything can be gained by dividing the return into two classes of claims, first, third party claims and, second, all other claims.  The amendment is that that division should be eliminated and that the returns asked for should merely be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the section. It is obvious that the division asked for in the Schedule cannot be made with any sense of reality.  No doubt it is possible for the company to say how much it has paid in respect of third party claims within the year, and how much in connection with mechanically <Col N="2389" /> propelled vehicles.  But by requiring a severance of the particulars between the third party claims and the other claims, the Bill is asking for something that can be done.  The object of the section will be fully satisfied by requiring a return to be made in respect of claims in connection with mechanically propelled vehicles.  There is no real purpose to be served by requiring this severance of the different claims.  Insisting on this severance will mean that costs must be incurred in regard to the claims as a whole. Ordinarily the claim in respect of this insurance would include the third party claims and the material damage claim in respect of the car.</P>

      <P>Following some remarks that Deputy Cosgrave made on this measure, I was asking that the Minister would give the House some assurance that the Government would approach the questions that had been raised, before they would be discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in a reasonable and satisfactory manner.  I want to indicate that, with the unicameral system now in operation, some safeguard is required that there will be sufficient time given for consideration, particularly between the introduction of a Bill and its Second Reading, and a normal period between the other stages.  As the Standing Orders of the House are at present, there is nothing to prevent a Bill being introduced to-day and passed through all its stages to-morrow.  I raise the question following Deputy Cosgrave's remarks and influenced also by this, that the Government's attitude as it has presented itself on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in so far as it has gone up to the present, has been rather antagonistic to the making of any changes.  I think the House should not agree with the proposals in this measure until we hear that the Government propose to approach the question that Deputy Cosgrave raised in a reasonable and helpful manner, considering the position of the House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave stated that there was no information given by the Minister.  I should have thought no great amount of information was necessary, having regard to the title of the Bill and the fact that I have just mentioned, that it simply proposes to delete all references to <Col N="2392" /> Seanad Eireann which may occur in the ordinary law of the country.  The Deputy also referred to the policy as a result of which this Bill had to be introduced and he described that policy as being hastily conceived and carried out with very little delay. Having regard to the fact that the matter of the abolition of the Seanad has been before the country for about two years, I do not think anybody will agree with Deputy Cosgrave that the policy has been hastily conceived and carried out with very little delay.  The surprising fact is that there has been so very little interest taken in this matter of the abolition of the Seanad, having regard to the dreadful consequences which Deputy Cosgrave even still tells us are bound to result.  He tells us, for instance, that when this Bill passes into law we can be presented at any sitting of the Dáil, so long as the notice is on the Order Paper, with the introduction of a Bill and with its passage into law before night.  Deputy Mulcahy suggests two days would be necessary, one to introduce a Bill and the second to pass it through all its stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that this matter would more properly arise on the resolution for the abolition of the Seanad, I might ask what will public opinion in the country and what will our friends in the Opposition be doing in this eventuality?  Are we to assume that the Executive of the day are to be permitted to introduce legislation affecting the rights and liberties of the people and rush it through this House within 24 hours, even if the Executive should so desire? I do not think we can rate the Opposition at quite such a low level, or that we need not fear that in such an emergency public opinion outside will not make itself felt.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the necessity for safeguards.  I should have thought the Deputy, and the other Deputies on that side who spoke, would have taken advantage of the opportunity which they were recently offered to <Col N="2393" /> try to effect a safeguard by suggesting how a Second Chamber might be usefully constituted, that, in their opinion, being the only really valuable safeguard or check upon the Government of the day.  The Deputy and his Party refused to take part in this Commission and now they come along scolding the members of the Commission, as Deputy McGilligan has done, telling us they possess a see-saw type of mind and so on.  The Deputy must be extremely annoyed with the independent and non-Government members of the Commission who have kindly consented to give their time and experience in an endeavour to find a solution of this question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon wants to know what our policy is.  That has already been pretty fully dealt with by the President, and the Deputy is the very person who should appreciate that. The President explained that we were waiting to see whether a Seanad that would be worth while would be suggested, and if such a suggestion comes from the Commission I have no doubt the Government will accept it, it being clearly understood, of course, that the Government are quite free to accept, reject or modify the recommendations of the Commission. Deputy Cosgrave, not having participated in the work of the Commission and having been left out in the cold, tells us that we should have in the interim some system by which it would be necessary to get a two-thirds, a three-fourths, or a five-sixths majority in the House.  Is not that an absurd idea?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, in the course of his speech, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If necessary, it could be provided for in the measure that a large majority of the House would be required.  When I speak of a majority in that case I mean a majority of the whole House rather than a majority that would be composed of the majority Parties.  I mean a majority of the House, or <Col N="2394" /> two-thirds or three-fourths or five-sixths or something of that sort.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to recollect that Deputy Cosgrave is only recommending such a majority on a motion as to the time that should be allowed between one stage of a Bill and another.  Deputy Cosgrave raised the point that some safeguards were necessary before the Second Reading of the measure was taken, so that the members of the House and the country would have time to understand what was in it: that no motion to take the Second Reading inside the stated time should be allowed without a substantial majority of the House voting.  His remarks did not apply to taking a decision of the House on any point of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that what the Deputy has said has not helped to make the matter clear.  The Deputy has referred to the fact that this matter is at present engaging the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Deputy Cosgrave's idea seems to me to be an absurd one, that the Dáil should be asked to discuss a question which is at the moment engaging the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That Committee will probably put forward recommendations, if it should consider it necessary to do so, and, presumably, the question may come before the House; but, in any case, it is really a matter, I think, of amending the Standing Orders and is not relevant to the legislation now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's references to the position of the judges and his contention that a bare majority of the Dáil can now remove a judge from office are not, in my opinion, relevant either to the measure under consideration. I am informed that the question of the security of the judges is already dealt with under the measure for the abolition of the Seanad: that it is provided in that measure that adjustments will be made in that connection, and that a majority of, I think, four-sevenths will be necessary.  In any case, <Col N="2395" /> it is quite clear that, until the question of a Second Chamber is finally resolved, it is most unlikely the Executive Council is going to introduce any measure of that kind.  There is no use in telling the House and the country that the Government of the day can, with a bare majority, do this, that and the other.  There are good reasons why an Executive, even if it should wish to do certain things to advance its own political programme or its own interests, is precluded from so doing.  I think Deputy Cosgrave admitted that fact when he said that, no doubt, it could be urged that the intention was not there.  Even if it was not a matter that should be provided for, it has been provided for to this extent, at any rate, that a four-sevenths majority is necessary.  I do not think that the matter is really relevant to the present Bill.  I am told that it is inserted in the Constitution. It is now part of the Constitution and will have to be regarded accordingly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy wishes that sufficient time should be given to Deputies to consult their constituents with regard to measures that come before the House.  I think that is a matter that can be taken up when measures are brought forward.  It is quite clear that the Opposition will have plenty of time between the different stages of Bills that come before the House to make their opinions felt, and to effect any changes that they may think necessary, in so far as they are able to bring about such changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is consequential on the University (Abolition of Seats) Bill, which was recently passed.  The Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act which recently became law deleted from the Constitution the provisions of Article 27 which gave to <Col N="2396" /> Universities the right to elect three representatives to Dáil Eireann upon a franchise and in a manner to be prescribed by law.  The Electoral Act, 1923, duly made provision for the compilation of registers of University electors and for the holding of elections in Universities, and this Bill repeals the sections of the Electoral Act which relate to University franchise and elections.</P>
      <P>Article 14 of the Constitution declares that no voter may exercise more than one vote at an election to Dáil Eireann, and Section 1 of the Electoral Act enables that a qualified citizen is entitled to be registered once as an elector in one, but not more than one, constituency in Saorstát Eireann. Rule 22 in the First Schedule to the Act directs registration officers to correct the electors' lists by removing duplicate entries.  Registration as a University elector does not in any way affect registration as a local government elector.  Removal of a duplicate entry thus means that the name is transferred to Division III of the register, that being the portion of the register containing the names of persons entitled to vote as local government electors only.</P>
      <P>In the register which has just come into force the entries of University electors have been generally removed as duplicate entries, and the University registers have been prepared as usual.  This is necessary because it might be necessary to hold a bye-election before University representation ceases.  As, however, there is no fixed date for the dissolution of the Oireachtas, but only a period of maximum duration, it is necessary to make arrangements which will have the effect of restoring to the registers in county and county borough constituencies the entries which had been removed as duplicate entries, and to make those entries effective when the Constitution (Amendment) No. 23 Act comes into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The register which came into force on the 1st June of this year, remains in force until 1st June, 1937; a new register will then come into force and remain in force until 1st June, 1938. This Bill makes the necessary provisions <Col N="2397" /> in the event of a general election during the continuance of either of those registers.  As regards the first register, it would not be a workable solution to make alterations on the printed page.  The only satisfactory solution is to extract by registration units the names of University electors appearing in the current register according to the place of residence and, in the event of a general election being held before 1st June, 1937, those extracts would be treated as part of the register of Dáil electors for the local constituency.  I believe that there are many instances of persons who are registered as Dáil electors in both a University and local constituency.  The reason is mainly due to the fact that the latest address for actual residence on the qualifying date does not always appear in the University registers. But if a person is registered twice he can only vote once, and the statutory question: &ldquo;Have you already voted at this election?&rdquo; can be asked in any case of doubt.</P>
    <P>These difficulties will disappear in regard to the 1937-1938 Register. Instead of removing the duplicate entry, the registration officer will place a mark against the entry which will indicate that the person is not entitled to vote in respect of that entry except at the general election, and subsequent elections to Dáil Eireann.</P>

As often as the Government feel that they ought to change their mind in regard to matters of this kind, and matters like the Seanad, the time of the House will be taken up.  Of course, we cannot object.  The Minister says it is possible and, apparently, probable that a university election will have to be held within the period between this and the time when the register will be properly constituted.  In that event, of course, we do not want to hinder his idea of having it on the old register and we have no objection to it.</P>

      <P>In page 3, before Section 5, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2400" /> (1)  The Minister may, whenever and so often as he thinks proper, by order (in this Act referred to as a suspension order) suspend, as on and from a date (not earlier than the date of such order) specified in such order, any appointed area order.</P>
    <P>(2)  Whenever the Minister has made a suspension order, he may at his discretion by order (in this section referred to as a termination order) terminate, as on and from a date (not earlier than the date of such termination order), specified in such termination order, the suspension effected by such suspension order of the appointed area order to which such suspension order relates.</P>
    <P>(3)  Whenever the Minister has made a suspension order, the appointed area order to which such suspension order relates shall be suspended as on and from the date specified in that behalf in such suspension order and shall continue to be so suspended until the date as on and from which such suspension is terminated by a termination order.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever an appointed area order is suspended under this section, the appointed area order to which such order relates shall, immediately upon the commencement of such suspension, cease to be an appointed area for the purposes of this Act, but shall, on the date as on and from which such suspension order is terminated, become and again be an appointed area for the said purposes.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever an appointed area order is suspended under this section, the Minister shall, during such suspension, maintain and keep in accordance with this Act the register of coal retailers established in pursuance of this Act in respect of the appointed area to which such order relates, but nothing in this sub-section shall render it obligatory upon any person to be registered in such register during such suspension.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to insert a new section with the object of providing for any unanticipated interruption of turf supplies, which, while not of sufficient magnitude to justify revoca- <Col N="2401" /> tion or amendment of an appointed area order, would, nevertheless, make it desirable to suspend the order. This section is designed to provide for that temporary suspension of the operation of an appointed area order where such circumstances might arise as would necessitate it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that when this Bill was before us on the previous occasion, he could give us no idea as to what an appointed area was going to be, and he could give us no reason why subdivisions of an appointed area that would involve all kinds of different provisions as to the quantity of turf to be bought with coal and that class of thing should be made.  Now he introduces an amendment which looks as if the plan was going to be further spotted.  Under the Bill as it stands, we may have an appointed area; we may have a part of an appointed area; and inside a part of an appointed area, we may have different regulations.  Is this amendment intended to apply to an appointed area as a whole?  Is it intended to be applicable simply to part of an appointed area, or is it intended to apply to certain sections of provisions inside an appointed area?  The plan which the Minister put before us with regard to differentiating between an appointed area, and different provisions with regard to turf inside part of an appointed area, led many members to emphasise that all these provisions indicated that the Minister did not know what he was going to do, and that he did not know what his Bill was intended to achieve, and, particularly, that he had no idea at all as to what steps he was going to take in any area to achieve anything he had in mind with regard to this Bill.  The provisions of this amendment, as I say, seem to add a few more spots to his plan, and I think he ought to take this opportunity of letting the House know whether he has cleared his mind with regard to his plan in so far as appointed areas, parts of appointed areas, and different provisions inside parts of appointed areas are features of that plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I missed it, because it is rather unique to have the Minister explain anything in this House.  I should have been very interested to hear the Minister's reasons for this amendment.  He is apparently cooling in his enthusiasm as to the possibilities of this Bill of his, and he seems to be afraid that there will not be as much turf available as he thought at first.  Is he finding that the people are not simply jumping at the 11/- a ton and that there is not going to be as much turf available as he led the House to believe when he brought the Bill before us?  As Deputy Mulcahy has said, we tried on Committee Stage to get some information from the Minister as to the size, location and so on of the specified areas, but the Minister was silent and refused to give any information.  The Minister is to specify certain quantities of turf within the specified areas, and he has taken power to make different orders for different parts of the same area, and now he wants to get the power to suspend an order at any time he thinks fit, and, so far as I can see, without any notice whatever, so that we may find an area prescribed and an obligation placed on people to purchase and sell specified quantities of turf, and the order may be in operation for a week, a month or three months, and then suddenly, at the whim of the Minister, suspended or allowed to operate in part of an area and suspended in another part.  So far as it will be possible to work this complicated Bill at all, it certainly is not going to make for easier working. In my opinion it is going to make for greater confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which may be considered a small point.  If the Minister prescribes a certain area and lays down the amount of turf to be sold in relation to coal in that area, the coal merchants will have to make provisions for supplies of turf, and, having made provision for supplies, and perhaps having entered into contracts for a whole season's supply, <Col N="2403" /> the society or approved source under the Bill may find the order which will enable them to get rid of those turf supplies suspended by the Minister, and may find themselves saddled, as I say, with a contract for a full season's supply of turf.  There is nothing in this amendment to safeguard the merchants from that position, because, so far as I can see, the order may be suspended at any time at the whim of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment is really evidence of the evaporation of the Minister's enthusiasm.  He has given himself a way to back out and I think it was an absolute necessity. The Minister, I think, realises that this is not going to be the success he had hoped, if he had hoped it was going to be a success.  Personally, I must say that we had not any hope for it at any time, and I think that something of the nature of the amendment was an absolute necessity, no matter what confusion it caused, because the operation of the Bill, in my opinion, will result in a hopeless muddle no matter what the Minister tries to do. I think that this particular amendment is an absolute necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister will reply to my point in regard to a coal merchant who has entered into a contract for a supply of turf for the whole season.  What will be the position of that merchant if the Minister uses this power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that Deputy's Brennan's remarks are completely unintelligible to me.  Under the Bill the Minister has power to revoke an Order of this kind and he can use that power of revocation at any time and thus make the Act cease to apply in the area concerned. In this section the Minister is merely taking power to make a suspension Order in any area where, for any unanticipated cause, there may be difficulty or inability to get turf supplies, and this power of suspension is designed to deal with such a set of circumstances only where it is not anticipated that the interruption of supplies will be for any length of time, <Col N="2404" /> and it is desired not to destroy the machinery set up for the administration of the Act, and to maintain the register of coal merchants while, at the same time, releasing them temporarily from the obligation to supply turf, when, for some reason, turf cannot be obtained.  It is only in these circumstances that the power of suspension will be operated, and I think it is desirable that we should have this power of suspension in the Bill because, otherwise, the only way of dealing with such circumstances as I have described would be by means of a revocation Order, and that would mean a lot of difficulty as well as considerable expense if, subsequently, it was desired to make a new Order. By this device of a temporary suspension Order we can maintain all the machinery while, at the same time, releasing the coal merchants from their obligations under the Act for the time being where necessary.</P>

    <P>There are four amendments to this section, and the purpose of these amendments is to give effect to a suggestion which was made here, I think, by Deputy O'Sullivan, in the course of the discussion on the Committee Stage of the Bill: namely, that approved sources other than the Turf Development Board should be able to furnish the certificates provided for in the section.  The first of these amendments&mdash;amendment No. 7&mdash;proposes to extend the privilege of issuing these certificates to any approved co-operative society or approved peat fuel company.  The other amendments are consequential upon that.  Amendment No. 7 provides for the deletion of certain words at the end of the section and the other amendments are consequential to the changes in the wording of the section.  I think it is a desirable amendment.  I agree that Deputy O'Sullivan proposed amendments of considerably wider scope, which I was unable to accept, but, arising out of the discussion at that time, I agreed to consider this suggestion which was a modification of Deputy O'Sullivan's original suggestion.  Now, under these amendments it is proposed to give the right of issuing certificates to any approved co-operative society or company. Certain risks are being taken in that regard even here, but we feel that the control the board will have over the co-operative societies will be such as to obviate any danger of these powers being used injudiciously or <Col N="2406" /> wrongly by these societies or companies, and we feel that it will facilitate the administration of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister indicates, the effect of this Bill, when it was first drafted, was that a person down the country buying turf from anybody&mdash;even from an approved society&mdash;could get no certificate which would be of any value to him under this Bill, no matter what amount of turf he bought in bulk from any coal retailer, unless he bought from a certain source, and it meant that he would have to buy more turf from that person&mdash;that turf being supplied from an approved society.  Now the Minister admits that he has been moved to accept an amendment the effect of which is that, where a person down the country buys a quantity of turf, the approved society will have to give him a certificate that he has got that turf. That will be a protection to him inasmuch as, when he does buy coal, he will not have to buy more turf, but it leaves aside completely the case made by Deputy Finlay when he mentioned that he bought, regularly every year, two ricks of turf and that he could get no certificate from the person who has been engaged in the turf industry to that extent&mdash;the person who, I suppose, has supplied other persons than Deputy Finlay, in his neighbourhood, with very substantial quantities of turf. Persons who buy in that particular way cannot get a certificate from the people from whom they buy their turf, and that means that such people are to be forced either to do without turf, if there is no approved society in the area, or leave the person with whom they have been dealing for, I suppose, many years in the past.  It means that they will be forced to deal with somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister speaks of the dangers he runs even by introducing the amendments here.  When the Minister was thinking of these dangers, I wish he had given a little more consideration to the point of view put forward from these benches.  I wish he had gone a little bit further and, if possible, given further thought to the view that has been expressed, I think, so cogently and clearly, from these benches, with regard to the large-scale vendor of turf. <Col N="2407" /> Perhaps the Minister would tell us what dangers would lie in further extending these amendments suggested here to include the large-scale vendor of turf down the country who has been in the habit of selling large quantities of turf in the way that has been indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the danger we are running in inserting the amendments proposed here is that secretaries of turf societies, on occasion, may issue these certificates improperly or inaccurately. In fact, it may even happen that inducements will be offered to secretaries of such societies to do so. I think, however, that, through the supervision of the Turf Board, and by reason of the general control which the Turf Board exercises over these societies, we will be able to minimise that danger, if not to eliminate it altogether.  However, that danger is there, and I think that danger would be very great&mdash;in fact, I doubt if any practicable means of meeting it could be devised&mdash;if we were to extend this arrangement to cover individual turf producers.  The number of such might be considerable.  At any rate, the number that might come forward and claim to be in that category would be probably considerable. There would be no effective means of checking the accuracy of any certificates which such persons might issue.  Under these circumstances we could not consider the proposal made in that regard.  It would operate, I think, to nullify the whole purpose of the Bill, and in any event I doubt if it could be regarded as necessary in all the circumstances, because the persons likely to be affected will be able to make other arrangements to continue their business.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £24,021 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1937, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The amount asked for is approximately £36,000 as compared with approximately £34,000 last year.  It will be observed that the comparatively small increase is more than balanced by decreases in the other Votes which come within the ambit of this Department&mdash;mainly by a decrease of over £14,000 in the Estimate for the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual increase in the Vote for <Col N="2409" /> the Minister's Office, as compared with last year's Vote, is £1,864.  This is made up of a number of items, none of them being of any great public importance, mainly as follows:&mdash;(a) Two new officers have been assigned temporarily to this Office to audit the accounts of county registrars and, where necessary, of under-sheriffs in connection with the sums passing through these officers' hands in the shape of land annuities recovered under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933.  When it is understood that the total amount recovered through the agency of these officers has reached the figure of £835,000 (from, say, March, 1934, to March, 1936)&mdash;comprising over 175,000 separate payments &mdash;it will be appreciated that some such audit was essential.</P>
    <P>(b) Some higher Executive posts (scale £400-£500) have been converted into assistant principal posts (scale £500-£600).  This will make very little difference in the actual year 1936-37 but is perhaps worth mentioning as explaining the appearance of the new posts on the face of the Estimates. (c) A long-delayed reform was carried out by the appointment of an inspector of explosives.  This inspector is an Army officer and gets his main salary from the Army, but is paid £100 per annum allowance from this Vote.  (d) The salary of the film censor&mdash;who is not pensionable&mdash;was increased from £800 to £900 owing to an increase in his work.  The costs of this officer and his staff are all covered by the fees received.  (e) Routine increases due to officers advancing on their scales of pay, by the usual increments, and an increase of £400 odd in the estimated amount for cost-of-living bonus.</P>
    <P>That is the usual statement and ordinarily I would not say more but I feel it my duty to refer to the recent murders of Vice-Admiral Somerville and John Egan, and to assure the House and the country that the police are doing their utmost to find the murderers.  I do not wish to say much about these crimes at the moment, as individuals may be charged definitely in connection with them.  The fact that these murders have occurred, however, makes it clear that stern action must be taken <Col N="2410" /> against any organisation which claims to have the power of life and death over its members or ex-members or other citizens, or which claims that it is entitled to use force upon the community to compel obedience to its will.

      <P>On the other matter I am not prepared to make any statement, but I repeat that no organisation such as the so-called I.R.A. or any other organisation of the kind will be tolerated.  The Deputy can take what he likes out of that statement. I would like to know what the procedure will be on this Vote.  There is a number of Votes for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, and the practice in the past has been to have a debate on all branches of <Col N="2411" /> his Department and then the reply separately.  Is that to be the practice now?</P>

      <P>Whatever may have been the practice in earlier years, there is a motion down: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration,&rdquo; and it is on that especially that I want to speak.  Before any heat may be engendered, I do not want any remarks of mine to be associated with the Civic Guards or officers of the Guards.  On anything I say I want to fix the responsibility entirely on the Minister or on the officials immediately under the Minister.</P>

Deputy McGilligan is entitled to say what he likes on any Vote.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am moving to refer back Vote No. 32, and that only. On that I am going to speak, and on that only.  I am doing that principally because I do not want any insinuations made afterwards that any remarks of mine have any reference <Col N="2412" /> to subordinates in the Gárda Síochána, to anybody connected with prisons, or anybody about or belonging to any of the courts.  I am not having that even in the <i>penumbra</i> of my consciousness at the moment.  I am moving to refer back the Vote for the Department of Justice.  There are two or three things to which I think the House ought to have its attention called in connection with this Vote. There are practices growing up in connection with the administration of justice that must give pause to most citizens, and must certainly create a feeling of disquiet and anxiety in the mind of anybody who has to deal with court matters, whether in a professional capacity or in any other capacity.  The first of these matters that I shall refer to is the attitude of the Gárda Síochána, and I name them, but having named them I go on to say that I do name them with this feeling, that the practice which I think has grown up, and which has been evidenced in a great number of cases&mdash;recent and fresh cases&mdash;could not have become the practice unless instructions with regard to those matters had been given by those in authority.  When I say, as I have to say in order to get a wide field for investigation, that there is a practice amongst officers of the Guards, I absolutely acquit individual members of the force of any blame, if there is to be blame associated with those activities to which I will go on to refer.  I think that if there is any blame it must be attached entirely to those who are responsible for the training of the force, or the lack of training of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In quite a number of recent cases the courts have found themselves very definitely prejudiced in the administration of justice in this country by reason of the method in which statements have been taken by members of the Gárda Síochána from people accused, or about to be accused of crimes.  I am going to refer to one or two examples.  Two of them are very recent.  It is necessary to join the third to show that the practice which has been established is a deliberate practice.  If anybody vigilant about the <Col N="2413" /> matter had observed this in its early stages, the practice&mdash;and a bad practice it is, I suggest&mdash;would have been stopped long ago.  There has grown up a definite procedure amongst members of the Gárda Síochána that if a statement has to be taken from any person it ought to be done in circumstances which do not enable that person to be, first of all, alert and vigilant about what is going on.  By degrees, and by gradual declension from that, they reach a level almost approaching third degree methods.  I think if anybody were asked here in the abstract to say what is the proper system by which to take statements from people either accused or about to be accused, he would say that the person ought to get notice that a statement is going to be taken; that the statement should be taken under ordinary circumstances&mdash;ordinary circumstances in reference to the natural divisions, say, of day and night; secondly, under natural circumstances and conditions of health and proper bearing of the person about to be accused.</P>
    <P>What actually happens?  In a case which, of course, cannot be regarded as normal because there was a certain political tinge about it, a certain man was arrested about 4 o'clock in the evening.  He was taken from his own home, which was a hotel, and arrived at a certain barracks, certain cells, somewhere between 4 and 6 o'clock. He was submitted to a long and searching interrogation.  When?  He was roused out of his sleep somewhere about 2 o'clock in the morning.  It was obvious to those who had arrested him that he had no food between 4 o'clock in the evening and 2 o'clock in the morning.  It must also have been obvious to those who arrested him that he had been supplied with a certain amount of drink.  Under those circumstances, about 2 o'clock in the morning certain officials of the Guards entered his cell and subjected him to an interrogation which lasted for over three hours.  I say that that was tinged with politics, and possibly one might not expect normal procedure to be attached to it.  That is a case of about two years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2414" /> Quite recently there have been two other cases, one of which is fresh in the public memory.  A boy, who was eventually found by a jury to be mentally unstable, suffered the impact, I think, of three different sections of the Gárda upon him, and his interrogation took place in the early hours of the morning.  The jury eventually found that that young gentleman, although guilty, was insane.  It must have been perfectly open to the Guards to conclude, at a very early period, that that particular type of defence would be put forward.  There was certain evidence from the circumstances, although not, of course, as revealed in the case afterwards, that mental instability was at any rate to be suspected.  The conduct I have described with regard to interrogating a person wakened from sleep in the early hours of the morning, not at the time one would expect interrogation, and without notice of it, is bad enough in the case of a definitely strong and healthy man about whom there is no suspicion of insanity, but where there is that suspicion it certainly&mdash;as it was described when the case was at hearing&mdash;approaches inhumanity. Apart from inhumanity, it does not lead to proper verdicts if interrogations of this sort against that type of person are going to be conducted in that way.</P>
    <P>There is another case, even more recent than that notorious one, where a young girl was brought up for concealment of birth of a child.  She was &mdash;I can use no other word&mdash;attacked by those officers who were sent to interrogate her within, I think, a week or certainly within ten days of the date on which the birth was alleged to have taken place.  She was interrogated, everybody else being put out of the room except herself and the members of the force.  When the case came on for trial one of the members of the force produced against her admitted that the interrogation went on for over three hours.  The sergeant in the case said he thought it did not last as long: maybe two hours was the most.  In any event, a young girl, certainly not an adult, under suspicion of concealment of birth, was approached by members of the Guards, who <Col N="2415" /> excluded from the room anybody belonging to her, and did not allow her to leave that room, no matter what she suffered from, until the conclusion of the interrogation, lasting, according to the evidence of one of the official witnesses, two hours, and according to the other, over three and a quarter hours.  The circumstances were such that in the end the judge&mdash;although undoubtedly there were other circumstances leading to a verdict of another type&mdash;advised the jury that he could not let the case go to them.  I give only three examples.</P>
    <P>It only requires a reading through the newspaper accounts of trials in the last four or five years to see that the Guards had apparently been advised&mdash;or have adopted a practice against which they have not been advised&mdash;that it is proper to submit to interrogation in the early hours of the morning people who are about to be charged with crimes, there being long-drawn-out interrogatories and no attempt being made to give those people the ordinary sustenance.  When I speak of sustenance I mean either in the way of food or in the way of support from people who are relatives of theirs.  Statements taken in these circumstances are formally brought forward when people are being paraded on most serious charges.</P>
    <P>One other event to which I would refer is where a charge of the most serious kind that the law contemplates was made against an individual.  In addition to that there is the question of expert evidence as brought into the courts at the moment.  The first case to which I wish to refer is that in which a document was in question, and the way in which the evidence was taken with regard to that document was roughly this.  A letter was suborned by an official of the Guards. That official of the Detective Division, having got the particular letter, handed it over to a higher official of the Guards.  That higher official wrote on the corner of the document handed to him by the detective officer, whose name he stated, and added the additional statement: &ldquo;This was written by&rdquo;&mdash;and the name was given. <Col N="2416" /> With that superscription this document was handed to an expert to say whether it was the handwriting of the man by whom it was alleged to be written.  We have two incidents combined in this case.  There is the interrogation of the man in the early hours of the morning, lasting for several hours, and at a time when he had no food but drink.  In addition to that we have the letter, which was supposed to be written, handed to an expert on handwriting with the superscription that it was handed on by a detective officer who said he saw it written by the man whose name was given.  That, of course, naturally gets the return from the handwriting expert that it was the writing of the man involved.  I say &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; without any reflection upon the expert. If a man gets handwriting about which he knows nothing he submits it to the ordinary test, but he is going to be slack in his scientific investigation if it has a note on it which is afterwards described as the best evidence possible, namely, that the somebody who was named had written the letter.</P>
    <P>Expert evidence generally nowadays &mdash;that is, abnormal types of evidence&mdash; takes the form that statements of interrogation were taken and concluded under circumstances similar to what I have spoken of.  Expert evidence in the courts here falls under three heads&mdash;medical evidence with regard to cases of death, wilful wounding, questions of the possibility or impossibility of suicide and things like that.  Then there is the handwriting expert evidence, and there is firearms evidence with regard to the fitting of missiles and so on.  With regard to the three types of people produced, I do not want to say that they are people who, in the particular cases, do not face up to the circumstances in which they are produced.  I do not want to query any want of the greatest efficiency, but rather the experience of some of the people produced.  With regard to the medical evidence.  I certainly say this: People brought forward undoubtedly give evidence of a type backed by a high degree of efficiency.  One thing that may be gathered is that there are no cases <Col N="2417" /> which arise in Dublin where the evidence is not backed up by the necessary amount of experience in the case of medical experts.  As regards the evidence of the handwriting expert, knowledge derived from experience is of little account compared with the examination of a number of human remains or as compared with the symbols of handwriting and the particular marks which cartridge cases bear.  As regards expert evidence of a particular type, the country has reason to be satisfied.  As far as handwriting is concerned, expert evidence in the main depends upon one or two people, and I think this statement can stand examination.</P>

It is bound to be derided if there is to be a particular weakness in those who present themselves as experts, and if there is to be added the habit of the police writing on the particular documents to the effect: &ldquo;This was written in the presence of So-and-so and was handed to me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that if a similar case should occur again, particularly if there is a political tinge about it, the same thing would happen, and you will get a detective to say: &ldquo;This was written in my presence; I saw this man write it,&rdquo; and the Chief Superintendent will repeat what I have said, should circumstances like that occur.  The Attorney-General, apparently, has not understood what I have said about <Col N="2421" /> the taking of statements, so that I have got to repeat it.  Within two months of the date on which I am speaking, statements have been taken at these abnormal hours, taken from people of abnormal temperament, taken in circumstances which approached inhumanity and which, apart from the inhumanity, did not lead to decent decisions being given.  So bad was this in one case against a young woman, against whom the element of suspicion was very strong, that the judge said he could not allow the case to go to the jury on account of the way members of the Guards had treated her in the course of their inquiries.</P>
      <P>On the question of handwriting, there is not the slightest doubt but that there is a field open in this country for expert testimony in regard to handwriting.  The particular people who are mainly paraded in the courts are people on whom there is no reliance placed.  That lack of reliance has come about because judges all round the country have had experts in different types of cases giving evidence and making the most categorical statements, statements which are so absurd that no jury would pay the slightest attention to them.  I take one case where, in the matter of peculiarity in handwriting, an expert said that in 16,000 specimens which he had examined he never saw such a characteristic twirl in the crossing of the letter &ldquo;t&rdquo; as was exhibited in a certain man's handwriting, and as was repeated in the disputed document. Without leaving the box the jury found the man not guilty.  That was sworn testimony of the most categorical kind, with the whole weight of whatever reputation he had behind it thrown into the scales, and, without even retiring for consultation, the jury was forced to the conclusion that the man was not worth believing.  Handwriting experts in all countries are subject to criticism, but I do not think they get as much in this country as is merited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there have emerged gunnery experts, men who say that it is quite possible to determine not merely from the appearance of a piece of lead found either in a wainscotting, a wall, <Col N="2422" /> or even in a human being&mdash;from the marking on it&mdash;that it proceeded from a certain rifle, gun or revolver, but who also go the length of saying that if a cartridge case is produced to them they can identify, by the marking made by the striking pin, the gun from which the cartridge came.  Again I have to go back a year or two for the most ludicrous example of evidence of that kind.  It was a case where certain people were accused of being in a hold-up.  Three shots were fired. The evidence of the people who were held-up was that there was only one rifle in the attacking party and from it three shots were fired.  Three cartridge cases were discovered and the gun expert produced on that occasion swore, without the  possibility of error, that one of these cartridge cases came from a rifle which was afterwards discovered.  He went on to say that there must have been two guns on the job, because the markings of these three cartridge cases were not exactly the same.  However, he concluded that one of them was definitely fired from a rifle found in a certain man's possession.  That was not believed, of course, as first of all there was the evidence of the people who said that there was only one rifle used, that three shots had been discharged from it and that possibly the three cartridges had been flung away.  That expert swore that he could identify the marking on the cartridge case as having been made by the striking pin of a certain rifle.  That man went to this extent: He swore that if a striking pin, in fact, in use wore out after, say, 5,000 shots had been discharged, the marking made by the first shot and by the one before the last was exactly the same.  He persisted in saying that.  That man is now one of the recognised experts, a member of the Gárda Síochána, produced to give evidence in gun-shot cases.  On that particular occasion he admitted that he had been about six months on the job.  I think, as far as I remember, that he had previously been employed as a clerk.  He had certainly been attached to some office in some sort of clerical position and for some reason he had been pulled out to be trained as a specialist in gun work.  However, <Col N="2423" /> that was in his earlier stage, and that may be regarded as a bad mistake made in the earlier period.  He is now thrust on this country as an expert in any case in which there are gun cartridges, bullets, or anything of that kind in question.</P>
    <P>These three matters in regard to expert testimony are only symptomatic of the greater evil.  It was hardly edifying, in connection with the notorious murder case to which I have referred, for the people of this country to have displayed before them, morning after morning, the photograph of the Civic Guards while looking out to sea to find whether a particular body would be washed up or not.  I saw no suggestion made anywhere, when that case eventually came to hearing, which would lead one to believe that the Civic Guards were doing anything but wasting their time along the seashore.  One did not get the feeling that clues of any other type than that set by the young boy were being followed.  One was definitely forced to the conclusion that a young man, found eventually to be mentally unstable, had put across a story on the Guards and that the Guards had focussed their attention entirely on that statement and blinded themselves to any other possible clue as to how that murder had occurred or where those human remains were to be found.</P>
    <P>That does raise the question as to what training there is with regard to detective work in this country.  In the old days, at the time of the takeover, it was known that there was some such training.  It had about it certain bad and vicious elements.  The training given in the old Depôt of the Royal Irish Constabulary made members who went into that force regard the ordinary people of the country as their enemies.  There was a certain warping of their minds, which was very bad, but it is an amazing swerve from that to decide that no training is better than the particular system then in operation.  Whatever mental outlook those people were given, some people received a certain training and it was passed on from year to year. If it was merely by, if I may use the <Col N="2424" /> word, &ldquo;contamination&rdquo; in the Depôt, certain things, as well as the warping of outlook, were passed on and there was a certain angle of view on criminality itself.  I wonder what is happening now.  Is there any educational course?  Are there any people there who are technically expert in the tracking of crime?  Is anything being done to see that a better system is growing up?  I myself complained of that often over a period of about four years.  The excuse could be made in those days that there was so much else to be done that certain things which were desirable, and recognised as desirable, had to be let go by for a bit.  We have now advanced two or three years.  Is any attempt being made to train the detective division, or do the detectives of the country still rely on natural gifts, plus a certain method which would be described by people who object to the system as the bribing of persons in low-class conditions to give information with regard to a certain class of the community?  Are we still relying on that sort of underworld evidence and natural gifts in order to get on the track of the expert criminal? Is there any attempt being made formally to educate Guards with regard to detective work?  Are there any people over that branch who themselves have such knowledge?  Is there any suggestion that people should be sent away for training?  Has any touch been maintained with persons trained in other countries?  Is any literature on the subject circulated to those on whom we have to rely for detective work, or are we still in the same old rut as we were at the start in which we have people with a certain natural inclination for the tracking out of minor and the more sordid and meaner forms of crime, such as petty theft, and are entirely at the mercy, save for what service these men can give us, of the more expert criminals which every country will breed from time to time?</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is work to be done in that field and that is no demeaning of the people of this country, of the people in charge of the Civic Guards or the members of the Civic Guards themselves to say that.  Although <Col N="2425" /> natural gifts will help, unless those natural gifts are sharpened somewhat by training and developed by some sort of intensive course, they are not going to come to much good. These are special matters with regard to the police which ought to be raised on this Vote.  Later, I may have to refer to the Attorney-General using unsuitable material.  I can appreciate the excuse that it is the best material a person may have at a particular moment.  I can raise the criticism on that that if bad results follow from the material so used in particular cases, then these cases should not be proceeded with.  In the end, if there is to be any improvement, it is in the hands of the Minister for Justice the whole matter lies.  Does he bend his attention at all to the necessity for having expert training brought to bear on the minds of those who are making their careers in the detective branch of the Gárda or are these people depending on their natural gifts towards sleuth-hound work developing with whatever associations they may get in the force itself?</P>
    <P>Apart from this absence of training, I suggest that there must be either a connivance at certain bad practices or a positive leaning towards these bad practices.  Otherwise, statements would not be taken in the circumstances I have indicated, and nobody would dare to introduce to the notice of courts statements so taken, and found criminal prosecutions upon them.  I suggest, further, that there is a field of effort to which the attention of some of the younger men might be directed&mdash;handwriting&mdash;and that if we are to have evidence of the gun-expert type produced in court, there ought to be this precaution taken: that if training is given, it ought to be systematic and scientific.  Until a person has undergone a course for some prolonged period, no man's life and no man's freedom ought to be made depend upon the credulity of a jury.  We should not have an ex-clerk, with six months' training, swearing to what he thinks about the markings of cartridge cases or the markings made on lumps of lead by, say, the barrel of a revolver, or an ejector of some other type of instrument.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2426" /> There is no relaxation with regard to the criminal classes in this country. The only type of legal activity that has not undergone a decline in the last couple of years is the criminal type. Criminal work is still as heavy as ever it was, while other classes of work have shown a decline.  If that is the situation, and if the populace has to rely for successful attack on the criminal element of the community on this bad procedure, with this lack of training, obviously, the criminal is going to get a much better chance than ordinary, decent forethought would give him. Previously I had complained of what appeared to me to be neglect of duty in this regard, and I am questioning now whether the same neglect does not prevail.  I want to find out whether there has been any change.  I do not care how recent that change has been. If there has been a change, it will be welcome information though necessarily a number of years would elapse before results are produced.  It is better even to make a late start in the hope of getting better results eventually than to drag on in the same old way, either pretending to believe the situation is as well as can be, or else&mdash; I rather suspect this is the reason&mdash; being afraid to take the necessary steps towards training, because the only source of training will be the country with which we are supposed to be at enmity.  I do suggest that if we are to get people trained in any way there is no reason certainly for people unversed in detective work, without a knowledge of foreign languages, being sent to foreign countries with the pretence that they are studying the criminal systems in those places on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to normal police matters, or at least what I would describe as normal police activities in the country, having opened with one phrase, I want to close with a similar phrase.  I make no accusation against the Civic Guards nor against the members of the Civic Guards.  If they are in the situation that I have described as not being trained it is not their fault.  I do say it is the fault of the responsible Minister&mdash;the fault of the responsible heads of the Civic Guards.  It is the Minister who <Col N="2427" /> should see that the training is given. If a suggestion to that effect has been made to him&mdash;and those in the front rank should make the suggestion, or else both the Minister and the heads of the Civic Guards should say that they have no responsibility because they are quite assured that the situation here is all it should be and that there is no necessity to urge against malpractices growing up in the force or any necessity for training.  As far as I hold that there is any lack of training or any connivance at improper practices, the responsibility is on the Commissioner, or on the Minister.  The Chief Commissioner may throw that a step further.  He admits that he acts on the information coming to him from those who are looking on at any of those matters happening in the country, as to whether the people are fully and properly buttressed against the impact of the criminals on these matters of which I have spoken.  As far as the Civic Guards are concerned, I make no complaint.  The only complaint I make is that they are being used to do work and not given the proper weapons with which to carry out the task.  The Minister in a very brief comment on this Vote said: &ldquo;The country might rest assured with regard to the murder of Admiral Somerville and Mr. Egan that the police were not relaxing in their efforts, and that stern action would be taken against the organisation which believes it is entitled to use force against members or ex-members.&rdquo;  I hope I have given the quotation correctly.  The Minister might have added &ldquo;or against the public.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister has talked about the I.R.A., but we had the President's statement on that matter some time ago.  If the Minister will to-night make another categorical statement he will be going a step further.  There is no doubt about it that there has been engendered in the minds of the youth of this country the belief that it is a patriotic thing to join the I.R.A.  Recently a case was presented to the Military Tribunal. Counsel for the Attorney-General put forward a case that the I.R.A. was an illegal association.  The Tribunal held that the case was not properly presented to them, and they held up two cases for argument as to whether the I.R.A. was a legal or an illegal association.  The Attorney-General, through his counsel, on the following day, said he would leave it to the Tribunal to say whether it was legal or illegal.  The Minister for Justice declared to-night that it was illegal. Does he still say it is illegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>How can anyone know what is the mentality of the Government?  The Attorney-General did not say it was illegal.  His <Col N="2429" /> counsel definitely and deliberately one day before the Military Tribunal said the I.R.A. was illegal, while another counsel, speaking for the Attorney-General on the next day, said that he would leave it to the Tribunal themselves to say whether the organisation was legal or illegal.  That is not a very responsible attitude nor a very brave attitude to take up.  The Minister to-night takes up a better attitude. The I.R.A. is illegal according to him. Why not the Minister go a step further?  The Government at any rate should go a step further to prevent young men being misguided.  Would the Minister go this one step further&mdash; take away the excuse of those young men who are misguided and tell them now deliberately that the I.R.A. is an illegal body?</P>
      <P>Previously we were told with regard to arms that the arms would not be collected.  But people have been murdered since that statement was made. There has been a big advance to-night in so far as we have a declaration from the Minister with regard to the I.R.A.; but how many more people will be murdered before the Government will say to these people: &ldquo;We will collect whatever arms are illegally held if we can get them&rdquo;?  The Minister can put in that proviso.  Will the Minister now say that, so far as he can, he will collect those arms, or will he wait until another murder has been committed?</P>

      <P>I put this to the Minister, that another categorical statement has got to be made to this effect: that just as we have got an advance to-night in the statement that the I.R.A. is an illegal body&mdash;the statement that the Attorney-General ran away from in very recent times&mdash; the Government must take one further step in order to prevent anybody <Col N="2430" /> in the country having any excuse hereafter with regard to his position. An illegal body is one thing.  There is still an outstanding phrase used in this House in the most public way by the President, that he would not collect these arms.  I want the Minister to give now categorically from this particular forum these instructions to the police, to every decent citizen and to everybody who is in favour of decent conditions.  Will the Minister make that announcement here this evening? &ldquo;You will be helping law and order in the country if you know anything about arms, if you tell us where they are.  In return for that you will get all the police protection that we can give you; you will get our thanks, and we will act on your information.&rdquo;  If the Minister does so, there is a completely new situation with regard to the I.R.A., and if the Minister makes that statement and adds it to the one he has made, then he has made a very big advance towards decent conditions in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points arising out of the administration of the Department of Justice to which I would like to direct the attention of the acting Minister.  Deputy McGilligan has drawn attention to two matters of the greatest public importance, in my view, matters that I think deserve the attention of the Government. The first one was the question of the taking of statements by the police from accused persons.  We have, in the system created under Article 2A of the Constitution, power given to the police in reference to cases that come within the provisions of Article 2A to cross-examine accused persons or persons whom they suspect of having committed crimes within the provisions of Article 2A, and if the person interrogated refuses to answer, he commits a crime.  I would like to get from the Minister an assurance that, in reference to the investigation of what we may call, for want of a better word, ordinary crime as distinct from crime coming within the ambit or the scope of the provisions of Article 2A, those provisions of Article 2A will not be put into operation, directly or indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2431" /> For very special reasons peculiar to the class of offences that were caught within the ambit of Article 2A, power was given to the police to interrogate accused persons in a way not recognised by the law as it existed prior to the introduction of that Article.  We have insisted that those provisions were for peculiar circumstances and peculiar cases, and I think it would tend very much to the betterment of the administration of the law, and also tend very much to the greater respect that would be given by the ordinary public to the administration of the law in this country, that we should, as far as possible, keep to the strict, the rigid rules which have been in force for so long and which have, in cases other than those coming under Article 2A, been in operation since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>I fully realise the difficulties of the police and the anxiety of the Government to get after ordinary crime.  It is difficult enough for the police, in the conduct of their ordinary affairs, conducting the investigation of crime, to get the necessary evidence to persuade a jury of the guilt of an accused person.  It has been accepted as an axiom of criminal administration that it is better for some of the guilty persons to get away rather than that abuses should creep into the administration of the law.  I do not want to go into any of these cases that have come up within the last 12 months, where statements have been taken by the police.  I content myself with asking the Attorney-General and the acting Minister for Justice that, as far as possible, it will be insisted upon by the Government that the police, in their investigation of ordinary crimes, shall adhere strictly to what were known in the old days as the judges' rules, and that in the interest of innocent persons people accused or suspected of crime by the police shall not be subjected to anything even approaching third degree.  These rules, known as the judges' rules, are really for the benefit of accused persons.  When people are charged with the administration of the law, or the conduct of Government, whether they are in responsible or subordinate positions, the natural <Col N="2432" /> tendency is to do everything to win their case, to do their job properly.  It should be impressed upon those people that it is much more important for the ultimate respect that will be given to the law that criminals should be prosecuted and convicted with the utmost adherence to the rigid principles that we have been accustomed to under what were known as the judges' rules before the introduction of the provisions contained in Article 2A of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Arising out of statements made to police officers in the course of investigating crimes or alleged crimes, there is one matter to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is a matter, not of the very greatest importance, but it is of considerable importance to the practitioners in the courts.  When accidents occur through the collision of motor cars, or when people are run down by motor cars, it is the practice of the police to take statements from the persons involved in the collisions immediately after those collisions.  Of course, these statements are for police purposes, usually with a view to seeing whether or not it is necessary in the public interest that either party or both of the parties involved in the accident should be prosecuted under the provisions of the Traffic Act.  The net result is that the policeman on the scene takes measurements and statements.  If civil proceedings result from the collision, we are faced, in the course of practice in these matters, with the question of what is in the statements made by persons immediately after an accident. The practice of the Gárda authorities so far has been to direct the Gárdaí who are responsible for the taking of the statements not to allow either party to the civil proceedings to have any view of the statements in question. They are instructed that if they are <i>sub poenaed</i> in the ordinary way to appear in court then, subject to and only on the order of the judge, will they produce these statements.</P>
    <P>I think the Attorney-General will tell the acting Minister that the position as regards these statements is, and it has been so ruled by our judges, that they are irrelevant in civil proceedings; they are not <Col N="2433" /> evidence in the ordinary way, and cannot be given as evidence by the police officer who took the statements. The way the matter has impressed itself on me is this: that they are, and have been, ruled to be capable of providing material for cross-examination in the event of a witness in the civil proceedings on his oath giving a different statement from that he gave to the police officer immediately after the accident.  If there is a controversy as to whether or not a particular thing occurred, the statement that a man makes immediately after an accident is much stronger than the statement he will make six or nine months afterwards when he comes in a civil action before a jury.  The practitioner in these cases has no material from which to find out whether or not a statement made by a party to the suit, or a witness in favour of either party, is in conflict with, or in accordance with, the statement made immediately after the accident to the police officer.  As it is, the statement is produced only on an order of the court, and the court will not order a police officer to produce it because it is not relevant unless one of the counsel engaged is able to indicate that the reason he wants the statement is to cross-examine the witness on the statement he makes in court as being in contradistinction to, and a contradiction of, the statement made to the police.</P>
    <P>In the interests of truth and justice, there ought to be a regulation made by the Gárda that either party to the civil proceedings in which these matters may become relevant should be allowed, or their legal representatives should be allowed, to view the statements before the case comes on, without an order of the court.  It is a matter that has given some concern to practitioners in these civil cases. It is perfectly useless bringing down the Guards to the civil tribunals, wasting their time and wasting a certain amount of the money of litigants, to produce these statements when they will not be produced except on an order of the court, and the court will not give such an order except for the purposes of cross-examination on the lines that I have already indicated. <Col N="2434" /> I do not press this from the point of view of serving the interests of private litigants, but I do press it from the point of view of preventing people from changing their story either in their own interests or in the interests of some person on whose behalf they are giving evidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan stated that the volume of criminal work has not decreased.  That is a point that has struck me personally in recent years, and in what I have to say on it I do not confine myself to this particular year.  I would like the Minister to give us some statement of the general position in the country in relation to what I shall call, for want of a better term, ordinary crime, leaving aside the crime dealt with by the Military Tribunal.  It appears to me that in Green Street some criminal tribunal is sitting continuously, practically without the lapse of one single day from year's end to year's end, subject only to the vacation periods. I would like to know if the Minister could tell us what is the cause of that. I hesitate to think that, since the establishment of our State, the criminal has got busier and better. In the days before the Great War, and for some years after it, there was an occasional commission and an occasional assize, and sometimes the Recorder of Dublin had a criminal sessions.  The impression left on my mind at all events is that, compared with those times, there is an increase of about 1,000 per cent. in the criminal work in this country.  It may be that the police are more active&mdash;I think not&mdash;but all sorts and varieties of crime are being tried in Green Street by the circuit judges, and by the judges in the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, throughout the year, some judge is sitting dealing with criminal work, and it would certainly not merely appease my curiosity, but even perhaps ease my mind from the point of view of social order in this country, if the Minister could give us some indication as to the volume of criminal work during last year as compared with previous years, and the reason why there is such a <Col N="2435" /> volume of criminal work in the courts in Dublin.  Perhaps he would also, if possible, give me some information as to whether or not there has been an increase in the number of cases that have been transferred from the country to the city.  There has been a fair amount of grumbling amongst jurors in the city and county of Dublin as to the excessive amount of duty that they are called upon to do in connection with the administration of justice.  The volume of civil work in which jurors are compelled to serve is not so large, but, notwithstanding that, a fair amount of the time of private citizens is taken up in connection with ordinary civil actions of tort, negligence, and so on.  On top of that, there is throughout the whole year a jury panel being called, and jurors have to sit investigating criminal cases in Green Street. Naturally, that work is greatly disliked. It is work of a very thankless nature, involving very often sordid surroundings and sordid considerations. It is work involving a considerable amount of public duty and the exercise of a considerable amount of tact and patience; but, above all, it calls for a considerable amount of time and a lot of money on the part of ordinary citizens.  I think we are entitled to know why jurors are called upon continuously to sit in Green Street from one year's end to the other.  Is it that crime has so greatly increased in its extent and variety in this State that there exists the necessity for the criminal courts to sit continuously, or is the reason that so many cases are being brought from the country to Dublin?  What is the explanation of the phenomenon to which I have just referred?</P>
    <P>If there are large numbers of cases being transferred from the country to the City of Dublin for hearing in Green Street, I would like to know what the reason for such transfer is. I have no information as to whether or not there is such an amount of cases being transferred.  I do recollect from my own experience, during the time that I was charged with the thankless job of conducting prosecutions <Col N="2436" /> in this country, that I was pressed again and again by police officers, in the country in particular, to transfer cases from the country to the city.  The jurors of the city and county of Dublin were supposed to be experienced jurors, and were supposed to have, apparently, much more courage than the country jurors.  I would like to know from the Minister for Justice whether or not country jurors are doing their ordinary job on juries with the same courage and the same self-sacrifice that the jurors in the city and county of Dublin are doing it.  I think it would be grossly unfair to put all the responsibility for convicting criminals on the jurors of the city and county of Dublin.  I think it is a bad policy to transfer cases from the country to the city. I would prefer to let the local criminals loose on the local people if they will not convict them in their own local venue.  I have always taken the view that the only way to bring home to people that they cannot have criminals and at the same time bring in verdicts of &ldquo;not guilty&rdquo; in obvious cases where they were guilty. is to let them have the criminals back at their own firesides.  So far as it lay in my hands, my policy always was to leave the local people with their local criminals either in jail locally or else at home locally.  I think it is not right or proper that the jurors of the city and county of Dublin should be called upon to do work that the country jurors are afraid to do, and I think that at some time or another &mdash;perhaps at no far distant date&mdash;the city and county of Dublin jurors will rise and go on strike against the amount of duty that they are called upon to do.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to give us some information on that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the training of the police.  I had a note to ask the Minister in reference to that matter.  It may be due to the pernicious habit I have of reading detective novels that I am interested in a variety of matters in which the police require to be trained.  I gather that in Scotland Yard they have very expert methods for training their recruits and their officers in <Col N="2437" /> expert detective requirements.  Now, I think that nobody ought to be put out on the public or before a jury&mdash; because juries will rely on the evidence given by the State and on the assistance that they get from State witnesses &mdash;as an expert unless he is really an expert, because in a very short time that expert testimony will be discredited. If one particular expert put forward by the State happens to be discredited in one case, that has its reactions on all other expert testimony that is put forward, and will eventually react very unfavourably on the administration of the criminal law, depending as it does on expert testimony. I think that there ought to be very considerable expenditure in connection with the training of detective officers.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind as to whether or not the system, which operates at the moment in the Guards, of promotion from the ranks to the rank of inspector or superintendent is the proper or the best system.  I do not know whether the Minister still considers that is the ideal system or whether he would think it more proper that some sort of dilution of the material available should be practised and people brought in with, perhaps, more training and more educational facilities than the ordinary Gárda has.  It is a matter upon which I have an open mind, but which is of vital concern.  Whether that system of promotion is adopted or not, I think, with Deputy McGilligan, that there ought to be very close consideration given to this question of the proper training of an expert staff in the detective branch.  I know that the Minister will defend the administration of his Department from the point of view of the training that they get&mdash; every Minister does that&mdash;but that will carry no conviction.  I am not making it a political point, but I want to know really, as a fact, whether or not the system that exists at present is regarded as the proper one; whether the Minister for Justice is satisfied that he is getting sufficient supplies to enable him to carry on a proper training department; or whether that particular department is being starved by the parsimonious outlook, usual in <Col N="2438" /> these matters, of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points I wish to mention on this Vote.  I should like to know whether or not the Department has had any advertence to the necessity that has existed for some considerable time to reform the law in a variety of directions.  I know that I am not at liberty, on the Vote, to speak on legislation to be promoted by the Department, but I do think that in the Department of Justice there ought to be some branch or officers or some machinery of some kind, either voluntary or otherwise, to examine into the points that require bringing up to date.  I propose, in the course of a day or two, to put questions on some of these matters that I personally think require reform.  We are a long way behind our neighbours across the water in connection with the reform of the ordinary civil law here. There are still enshrined in our law many archaic principles dating from the very earliest growth of English law.  The Department ought to look into these matters and see if they can devise any machinery for their consideration, but making it an absolute condition precedent that anybody who gives the Minister advice in reference to law reform should get a certificate from somebody that he is not a crank, because the question of law reform is one that will lend itself to the depredations of the crank more than any other aspect of administration.</P>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Department has yet dealt with the vexed question of the parking of cars. The newspapers are splashing the dicta of district justices on the subject of the parking of cars.  I do not care what any district justice thinks about the parking of cars.  All I want to know, as a motorist, is what I am entitled to do with my car if I come down town.  I see &ldquo;You may park your car here&rdquo; written up in various places.  I see cars parked somewhere else where there is not any such notice.  Then perhaps I go to a place which is also full of cars and where there is no notice.  In the first two places you are let pass by the police; in the third you are not.  The net <Col N="2439" /> result, as far as I can see, is that any ordinary motorist, even used to the conditions that exist in the city, has no particular notion of what is and what is not permitted within the law in reference to the parking of cars.</P>
    <P>The last point is that I want some information from the Minister as to how he is administering the Citizenship Act.  We had recently a very interesting list of names of people desiring to become citizens of Saorstát Eireann.  Their names, to put it mildly, were suggestive.  I want to know how these applications were dealt with; how many new Irish patriots we have got in the last 12 months; how many we are going to get in the future; and what is the policy of the Department in reference to aliens in general.</P>

      <P>Certain of the points raised by Deputy Costello, and some of the points raised by Deputy McGilligan, trench on my domain and certain other matters are partly my responsibility and partly the responsibility of the Minister.  Perhaps I might assist by answering some queries, which I think I may be better equipped from my experience to answer than the Minister or his Department, might be, as they really come within my bailiwick.  Deputy Costello asked questions, to take his points in the reverse order, some of which are entirely my concern.  He asked a question as regards the transfer of the cases from the country to the city and whether there has been an increase of cases transferred.  He is aware no doubt that cases may be transferred either on my application or on the application of an accused person. I think I may say, in answer to the simple question whether there has been any increase, that I do not think there has been an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that my attitude towards applications which come from the local Gárda superintendents for the transfer of certain cases is almost precisely the attitude which the Deputy says that he adopted when he held my position. I do not know that I would put it as strongly as he put it, that one <Col N="2440" /> should let the local criminals loose on the local people, though I have often said to superintendents, who were urging that cases should not be tried in local places, that, after all, if local jurors are prepared to let criminals go it is the local people who suffer.  I have set my face against transferring cases from the country to the city for that reason, and because I believe one of the underlying principles of the Courts of Justice Act was to devolve upon local tribunals the duty of trying certain types of cases.  My experience has been, despite the prophecies of the Gárdaí in charge of certain cases that verdicts cannot be obtained in certain local venues in certain types of cases, that very often that prophecy has been falsified and nobody has been better pleased with the result than the Gárda concerned.  In recent times jurors have brought in very courageous verdicts. In certain cases, although the local connections say, of a prisoner, or the influences which a prisoner might have, might have been expected to procure either a disagreement or an acquittal, local jurors have done their duty and convicted.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy will look at the list of the last Central Criminal Court here, or the previous Central Criminal Court, I think he will find that at the previous Central Criminal Court no transferred case was tried at all&mdash;that is the Central Criminal Court which ended before December.  There were some tried at the recent Central Criminal Court.  My memory may not serve me correctly, but I think that the number of transferred cases was, at the most, three or four&mdash;that is, of course, transferred at my instance.  There were some other cases tried which were transferred at the instance of the accused person himself.</P>
    <P>So far as possible, I have adopted, not for the purpose of saving the city jurors, but for the reasons I give&mdash;that the Courts of Justice Act intended that local tribunals should try certain types of cases and local jurors should do their own work&mdash;the same attitude towards applications to have cases transferred as apparently was favoured by the Deputy when he <Col N="2441" /> was Attorney-General.  I think I have answered the question he asked as to whether country jurors have not been doing their duty.  On the whole, from my experience, I am of the opinion that they are doing their duty and that the tendency to face their duty more squarely is growing.</P>
    <P>As regards the volume of business, the Minister would be better able to answer the Deputy's question than I. It is true that the Criminal Court has been sitting in the city practically continuously now since the opening of the legal year.  The Central Criminal Court sat for a long time before Christmas, and, directly the Christmas vacation ended, the Circuit Criminal Court took possession of Green Street, and continued until again the Central Criminal Court sat there.  At the moment, we have the Circuit Criminal Court there.  Although it may strike the Deputy as indicating a remarkable growth of business, I do not think the figures show there has been a tendency in recent years for criminal cases to increase. Possibly part of the explanation is due to the fact that the bulk of the crime in the country seems to be city-bred. The city seems to supply the greater proportion of the criminal statistics, and, in addition, as the Deputy knows, the Central Criminal Court now has sole and exclusive jurisdiction in certain types of cases, and may have its list added to by the transfer of cases at my instance or at the instance of prisoners, whereas, formerly, Assize Courts, sitting throughout the country, disposed of a number of cases of the type which are now solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, in common with Deputy McGilligan, referred to the training of the police.  That is again a matter which is within the Minister's peculiar province, but I think I may say something with regard to the criticisms which have been directed against the police, particularly as regards expert evidence, because eventually the evidence of the Guards passes through my hands and is presented to the courts.  I am aware that at the moment&mdash;the Minister will probably explain it more fully&mdash;there is an <Col N="2442" /> elaborate training system in operation at the Depot.  I visited the Depot at the invitation of the Commissioner and saw there the development which has taken place.  I was shown the various scientific instruments and had demonstrated to me the modern methods which have now been adopted here to assist in the detection of crime.  I think the Deputy will find that the Minister will satisfy both Deputy McGilligan and himself that there is a very keen appreciation on the part of the Commissioner of the necessity of having his police methods up-to-date.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy McGilligan might have been more careful in the criticism he directed against the Guards in his speech, and might have informed himself a little more before he set out to criticise the witnesses put forward by the Guards.  However, before I deal with that, there is another point of Deputy Costello's which I want to deal with, which I suppose is really within my province.  He asked about the statements which are obtained in connection with accident cases, and mentioned the difficulties which litigants in civil proceedings arising out of accidents find in procuring for their assistance the material at the disposal of the police.  I have frequently to advise the Guards as to whether privilege should be claimed in respect of these statements or not, and I realise fully and sympathise with the point of view the Deputy has expressed.  I would be quite willing to discuss with him to see if some method could be found by which the public interest, which is, I think, that police statements obtained for the purpose of investigating crime should not be made readily, or too readily, available to members of the public, would be safeguarded.  The Deputy will appreciate that that is the only reason why objection is taken to the production of these statements, and that it is not with any desire to hamper litigants or to prevent the truth being brought out.  It is because the Guards get these statements from members of the public, who happen to be in a position to give evidence, by reason of the fact that they are Guards, and for the purpose of assisting them in the investigation of possible offences, considering whether an offence has been committed, <Col N="2443" /> and so on.  I certainly think it would not be in the public interest to make these statements available, without any restriction, to such member of the public, or his solicitor, who happens to think they may be of value to him.  However, as I say, I am prepared to consider with the Deputy and see if we could devise some means by which we could have the public interest safeguarded and, at the same time, assist in having the truth made available in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked the Minister to assure him that Article 2A would not be made use of for the investigation of ordinary crime.  The Minister asks me to deal with that, but I think it is really a matter for the Minister because it is from him that instructions go to the Guards.  I can, however, give my experience and I am sure the Minister will bear me out in saying that there may have been one or two cases where, by accident, it happened that what might be styled ordinary crimes were investigated and the machinery of Article 2A used.  The offences, as I say, might be described as ordinary crimes in the sense that the Minister's certificate could not be obtained in respect of them, but the Guards put the machinery of the Article into operation because the person who was being questioned used firearms.  There are, in my experience, very few cases, and I think there was no intention whatever to use the Article for the investigation of what the Deputy describes as ordinary crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made an attack on the experts.  He toned it down and suggested that I misinterpreted what he said about certain of the experts, but I do think he ought to have been more cautious for several reasons. First, he was reflecting on men who cannot defend themselves.  He took three types of experts, and criticised each of them with different degrees of severity.  I accept his statement that he does not wish to be taken as in any way criticising or reflecting upon the ability or competency of the medical experts put forward.  It would be a rather strange thing if he did, because I presume he refers to the chief medical <Col N="2444" /> expert&mdash;the pathological expert who is the same expert who was employed during the previous Government's regime and who has had a long experience.  He was employed during my predecessor's period of office and, if he was thought competent five years ago, at least he ought to be thought competent now.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Deputy condemned the expert in ballistics.  I think that my experience with regard to practice in the Criminal Courts is much more extensive than that of Deputy McGilligan. I can go back to 1922 to cases where I was defending prisoners and where I frequently came across the same gunnery expert who is now employed.  I do not know what the Deputy means by speaking of a clerk in the office, with only six months' experience, acting as a gunnery expert.  I can only say that the same expert was giving evidence many years ago.  Of course, we all know that most expert evidence can be criticised along certain well-known lines. Some of them have been adopted by the Deputy here.  At any time, expert evidence can be condemned on certain grounds.  I quite agree that the type of expert evidence on ballistics can be condemned on the grounds the Deputy mentioned.  Any practitioner in the courts is familiar with the lines on which a gunnery expert can be cross-examined, but to say that a man who has had, to my knowledge, at least 14 years' experience of giving evidence in such cases, is incompetent, is a thing I cannot understand.  As a matter of fact I do not know whether the Deputy meant to suggest that this man is not competent to give evidence.  At one moment the Deputy seemed to be condemning him because he would be accepted as being so competent that people might be wrongfully convicted, and at another moment he seemed to suggest that the person in question was so incompetent that nobody would be convicted as a result of his evidence.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, amongst other apparatus that has been added to the laboratory at Kilmainham, there are means for detecting certain things that the Deputy referred to, such as the similarities of markings on bullet caps <Col N="2445" /> made by hammers in guns.  Everybody admits that, in a matter of that kind, dealing with materials such as bullets and cartridges, absolute certainly cannot be guaranteed by any expert.  No person can lay down as an absolute certainty that the markings of two hammer caps are made by the same gun, but an expert on such matters can put his evidence before a jury and a judge and they can use their own judgment and experience and intelligence upon his evidence.  The opinion of the expert can be put before a jury and a judge, and it can be given its due weight or not allowed to weigh at all.  I do not think it is reasonable for the Deputy to suggest that the ballistics expert is not an experienced man and that his experience does not weigh with juries. I think it does, and I have had some considerable experience.  I have never had a single complaint by counsel that the ballistics expert did not do his work well or that he was not accepted by judges and juries alike as a competent, reliable and honest witness.  In the light of what the Deputy has said, I think it is rather astonishing that I have not had some complaint or criticism from people who, I think it will be admitted, would be unprejudiced in the matter.  I have had criticisms of certain other witnesses, but I have not had any complaint or criticisms about the expert in this matter.  Therefore, when I find Deputy McGilligan speaking along the lines he has spoken in regard to this expert, it comes to me as a complete surprise, and I think that if the Deputy were honest in his criticism, he would have sent to me the complaints.</P>

      <P>May I be permitted to correct the Attorney-General, Sir, before he goes further along that line? Deputy McGilligan's remarks applied specifically to an individual who was put up as an expert, and who stated himself that he had had only six months' experience at the work&mdash;and not to the man who has been doing that work for 14 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="The Attorney-General The Attorney-General">
      <NameTxt>The Attorney-General</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I am very glad to hear it.  If that is so, I quite accept what Deputy McGilligan said as reasonable criticism.  I thought he was attacking the ballistics expert, but I quite agree, that if it were a case such as he has mentioned, it certainly is a matter for criticism. However, Deputy McGilligan then attacked the handwriting experts. First of all, the Deputy evidently fails to realise that the handwriting experts are not members of the Guards at all and that it has been generally recognised by the Guards that it is not desirable that a handwriting expert should be a trained member of the Guards.  As a matter of fact, I mentioned that point of view to the Commissioner, and I understood him to take the view that it is not feasible or desirable that the Gárdaí should attempt to train a handwriting expert and have him a member of the <Col N="2447" /> Force in the same way as other experts. That practice, I think, is the same across the water in England. Accordingly, we are in the position at the moment, as we have been all along, that we have got to rely on private people who practise as handwriting experts; and, as everybody knows, the field is limited in that regard. Deputy McGilligan was very scornful and was apparently attacking a particular expert, but if Deputy McGilligan had had experience of the courts for any length of time, he would know that, if a civil court case comes along, it is almost impossible to lay one's hands on a man who describes himself as a handwriting expert. There are only two, that I know of, in this country at the moment, and I think everyone will recognise that it is a particular profession, if one might call it so, which seems to require certain qualities that are very rare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is admitted in all countries and in all courts, and well known to all juries and all practitioners in the courts, that such evidence is unreliable, and I think that even the experts themselves will tell you that it would be unsafe to convict a man on the evidence of handwriting alone.  Of course, it does happen in certain cases that certain experts come a cropper because they are too positive in their evidence.  I can only say, however, that the Deputy's suggestion that we have been losing cases all over the country because we have been unable to produce proper evidence with regard to handwriting is entirely wrong.  It is just like what I mentioned in connection with ballistics.  The juror is able to assess the value of the evidence which is put forward by handwriting experts, and everybody knows, as I said already, what is the weakness that lies behind that evidence; and it is impossible, no matter what training the Commissioner might have, to produce an absolutely perfect handwriting expert or a man whose opinion can be taken with absolute certainty as regards the authorship of certain samples of handwriting submitted to him.  It suffers from the infirmities from which evidence <Col N="2448" /> given by handwriting experts in every country in the world suffers. It is clear that the suggestion was made by the Deputy from the depths of his experience, which is only, at most, about a year in the courts.  One would imagine that he was speaking from the depths of experience which would enable him to say that experts could be produced by some magic by the Minister for Justice or the Commissioner when everyone knows that even in England great difficulty is found in producing experts who will stand the test of continual appearance in court to satisfy juries as to their competence and ability to judge correctly in every case.  I am responsible to a certain extent for the provision of handwriting witnesses.  Our range is limited, but my experience, on the whole, is that it satisfies judges and juries, and I have had from no reliable source condemnation of it along the lines that the Deputy made. If I had I would discard it altogether. I never assent to a case going before a jury on handwriting evidence alone because, rightly or wrongly, I think it would not be safe to convict anyone on handwriting evidence alone. As regards interrogation, I suppose I may say something on that though, strictly speaking, it is the Minister's province to see that the Guards strictly adhere to the rules laid down for the interrogation of prisoners.  I accept what Deputy Costello suggests&mdash;that the judges' rules as regards the questioning and taking of statements from witnesses in ordinary cases should be adhered to, in fact, must be adhered to.  Because it happened in a recent case that Deputy McGilligan mentioned, that the Guards, in a certain instance, and in an out-of-the-way part of the country, overstepped the margin &mdash;not, I hope, in the circumstances described by Deputy McGilligan, which certainly were not brought to my notice, as I saw the questionnaire and it read to me as if it were a voluntary statement by a girl&mdash;that may or may not be so.  I did not see a weakness in it by reason of the fact that there were a number of questions to be answered, but, as happened, when the case came on I said that the judge <Col N="2449" /> might rule the statement out.  I do not think the Deputy's statement is correct that he went on to tell the jury that there was no case to go to them. The question of the admissibility of the statement was one for the judge. I did not see any comment upon that and I have not heard anything about it.  In any case, it was an isolated instance, and it is monstrous to suggest that the Guards have adopted a system of interrogation, or that they overstep the bounds provided by the law, in the taking of statements in that type of case.  It was the only recent instance in my memory where a statement that has been ruled out by a judge was on the grounds that it was improperly obtained or not obtained along the proper lines.</P>
    <P>As regards interrogation under Article 2A, the Deputy was driven to trot out a case that was two or three years old, and he attempted to link it up with two cases in recent memory, of which he gave vague particulars. He built on that the charge that there is a system sponsored by the Minister for interrogating prisoners under Article 2A, which is contrary to the spirit of the Article and improper.  I have had a great many of these Article 2A cases.  I suppose they run into thousands, and, except in one or two cases, no suggestion was made that statements were obtained by methods that could be questioned.  I do not wish to deny the suggestion made in two cases that charges have been made against the Guards that they detained prisoners for some hours and took statements in the middle of the night and that the members of the Tribunal had animadverted on the conduct of the Guards in these particular cases.  It is ridiculous to condemn out of hand on two or three instances&mdash;due perhaps to excessive zeal on the part of Guards&mdash; and to try to build on that the case that some instruction had been given to the Guards to behave in an unfair manner or to treat prisoners with undue severity in the taking of statements. I do not imagine in any police force in the world with such powers at their disposal would there be found less abuse than in the use of these powers by the Gárda Síochána, and it <Col N="2450" /> is most unfair to make the charge against them.  As a matter of fact, I think the lines of the interrogation were settled for the benefit of the commissioner or the Minister in my office.  I think it was first done in Deputy Costello's time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy did.  I am suggesting that the lines or the direction in which an interrogation should be taken were issued from your office, and I think I may say they have been issued from my office.  Assistance has been freely given them by me.  I only deal with them in connection with the Minister.  I have experience at the important end of this type of case. These statements come before me, and I have had to face before the Tribunal charges that in certain cases they were obtained by unfair methods.  I do not want to pledge myself to complete accuracy, but I think cases in which a challenge has been made can be numbered on the fingers of one hand. That being so, and as well over a thousand of these cases have been tried by the Tribunal in the last few years, I do not think it is fair to the Guards to have these charges made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather disappointed so late in the day as this, when the present Government is approaching its fifth year in office, that we should still have to listen to that weak, apologetic semi-defence that we heard twice in the course of the Attorney-General's remarks.  When he was asked either to stand over a state of affairs or to scrap it, what was the line taken?  Not that it was a state of affairs that should be recommended or a state of affairs that should be dispensed with, but that it <Col N="2451" /> was a state of affairs which existed in the time of the late Government. Now, for a year or two that kind of tactics is all right; it is admissible and defensible.  But sooner or later every Government must stand over its own acts and its own services.  Surely, after four years a Government Minister or a Government spokesman should either stand over a thing or not, and that kind of nonsense should be dispensed with.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, when speaking earlier, referred to a type of expert who was put up when a man's liberty was jeopardised, and when if that alleged expert was accepted as an expert that man's liberty would be lost for a greater or lesser length of time. It so happens that in the particular case mentioned the man put up as an expert on ballistics was a man who had been a clerk for some years and had been six months handling firearms. The responsibility was on the defence to call the accepted State expert on ballistics to prove that the other man put up by the police as an expert was in fact anything but an expert.  Let us assume that the men in the dock in that case had not had the assistance of a lawyer; if they were not in a position to call the State expert on ballistics those men would have been put away for a period of a year to three years' imprisonment on the evidence of a clerk put up by the police as an expert in ballistics.  Surely it is perfectly understandable that a Deputy, in discussing the Vote for the Department of Justice, should raise such a point, and that the Attorney-General or anybody else over there should be the very first to agree that it was a reasonable point to raise, and that this was the type of evidence which should not be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing further with Deputy McGilligan's statement the Attorney-General had a cheap jibe at Deputy McGilligan's experience in the courts. He said that speaking from his inexperience, or his experience of one year's practice in the courts, he could not possibly know what he was talking about, and that he, the Attorney-General, with a much greater number of <Col N="2452" /> year's experience, disagreed with him. One would imagine that the procedure in the courts was strictly the preserve of the lawyers.  It is more strictly the concern of the man in the street.  The lawyers are in there to make their money out of the courts, and the administration of justice within the courts is more the impartial concern of the ordinary citizen than it is of the lawyers practising in the courts.  The point raised by Deputy McGilligan was quite properly a point which should receive more consideration from the Attorney-General than just to turn it aside with a cheap jibe of that kind.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to the Minister in reply to Deputy McGilligan when he referred to the Irish Republican Army as being an illegal association. As a layman, I should like a little information on this point.  What exactly is an illegal organisation in the eyes of the Minister, or what is the difference between an illegal organisation and a banned organisation? Is it that there are degrees of illegality in the eyes of the Government and in the opinion of the Minister?  I am rather puzzled when I hear of an organisation such as the I.R.A. being referred to by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil as definitely an illegal organisation. Then I think of other organisations which are illegal organisations because they are banned.  I should like some information on that point.  What is the difference between a banned organisation and an illegal organisation, and why is one organisation banned and another not banned?</P>
    <P>Another point on which I should like information is this: we heard a discussion between Deputy Costello and the Attorney-General as to how and why it was decided to take certain cases to Dublin and have other cases tried in the country.  I should like to know what is the deciding factor as to whether a case will be sent before a jury or before the Military Tribunal. We have all seen very similar types of cases where murder was committed, one set of suspects being sent before a jury and another set of suspects sent before the Military Tribunal.  What type of crime or what circumstances decide when a case will be tried before a jury and when it will go <Col N="2453" /> before the Military Tribunal?  If there is a Departmental decision in each case as it arises, then what is the Department which makes the decision, and what are the circumstances that decide before which particular tribunal any given case will go?  I should imagine that the idea of having such a thing as a Military Tribunal is that it is essentially a tribunal to deal with organised crime, or any class of crime which on the face of it appears to be the work of an armed organisation. That being so, I fail to see any explanation why one case of murder&mdash; definitely and clearly the work of an organisation with arms in their hands &mdash;should go before a jury, while another goes before the Military Tribunal. On that particular point it is information I am looking for.  I have heard the question asked probably many hundreds of times since those cases were decided.  A Deputy of this House should be in a position to say exactly what the Military Tribunal is for.  The idea in my mind at least always was that the Military Tribunal was established to deal with organised crime, particularly in association with firearms.</P>
    <P>We have had some discussion this evening on the question of the special training of the Guards in detective work.  We have had a reply from the Attorney-General to say that there was most elaborate machinery in the depôt for training the Guards.  That may be. But what is the objection of having certain selected men trained elsewhere &mdash;Scotland Yard, for instance?  These men would then come back, after their training, and instruct others.  Your expensive machinery would be all the more effective, and more likely to produce satisfactory results if you had more highly trained expert instructors. The Army are far ahead of the Guards in that way.  There is no national or sentimental, or patriotic, objection to sending officers and N.C.O.'s to the British Army to get special training and instruction, not available here before.  When they come home they are able to instruct others in turn.  If there is no sentimental or national objection in the case of the Army surely such should not exist in the case of the <Col N="2454" /> Civic Guards.  It is about time we should judge of these services according to the results obtained.</P>
    <P>A police force is a very expensive service and a highly costly machine. Millions of Irish taxpayers' money has to be paid for the maintenance of our Irish police force.  A police force is only justifiable for one or two purposes, either to prevent crime, or, when crime is committed, to detect the criminal, bring him to justice and have him convicted.  I dislike saying this, but I am forced to say that, in regard to one class of crime, not merely during the life of this Government but of their predecessors, in dealing with organised crime there has been 100 per cent.  failure over a period of ten, 11 or 12 years, in what I would describe as major crimes where there is every evidence of its being the result of organised criminality.  There has been, right down from year to year, a dismal, unbroken series of failures to bring anyone to justice, or if brought to justice of finding anyone guilty. That is a very serious state of affairs. In the face of such a set of circumstances we are entitled to ask why are we paying more and more money for our police force?  What return or results are we getting for a very much increased cost of the Civic Guards?</P>
    <P>We do not pay policemen in order to have fine-looking fellows decorating our street corners.  We do not pay policemen merely for ceremonial effect. We pay them to prevent crime and to detect crime.  So far as anti-State crime goes, or semi-political crime, there has been no success either in prevention or detection.  When I am talking of major crime I am dealing specifically with murder.  If the Minister can point out any case of political murder, where the criminals were found and brought to justice, then I shall admit I am speaking in error.  I am speaking at the moment from recollection, and without looking up the records from year to year, but I think I am speaking with a fairly clear and accurate knowledge of the circumstances as they exist.  That being so, would it not be well for the Government to listen to the suggestions made by Deputy McGilligan?  When a situation <Col N="2455" /> is desperately serious that is not the time to rely upon jog-along methods of failure.  It is the time to attempt something now even if that new attempt may fail.</P>
    <P>Little by little, organised criminals are not attracting more respect than the law, but they are attracting more attention than the law.  The fear of organised criminals instilled into the minds of the people living in rural Ireland is far greater than the respect in those people's minds for the law, or the fear of the law, or the majesty of the State.  It is not quite correct to say you have had six murders in two years, or only six murders in two years. It is not the corpses I am concerned about.  The corpses have ceased to worry.  It is the effect upon the minds of thousands of people that I am thinking about.  It is in that direction that the mind of the Department of Justice must turn, because every one of us knows that each and all of these murders were committed, not just for the sake of killing the individual but in order that the killing of the individual would have a terrorist effect upon the minds of hundreds and thousands of people living.  They either close their mouths or are terrorised to the extent of not speaking fearlessly when questioned or even on oath, so that it would have a terrorist effect in another direction and in another case.  The effect of these cases happening one after another, and nobody paying the penalty, will have, and is having, a disastrous effect upon the stability of the State no matter who rules to-day. It is far more menacing and threatening than any process of sapping and undermining.  There is no greater tragedy, no greater evil, that I can picture to occur in the State, than to have the whole population of the State turning their eyes away from government and being bound unwillingly to comply with its decrees, or afraid to take action against organised criminals in the State.</P>

      <P>It was the speech of the Deputy opposite in connection with the parking of cars that brought me to my feet.  I am not much interested in the parking of cars but I am interested <Col N="2456" /> in the speed of cars.  The Minister is a man of common sense.  In fact when common sense was being given out he got more than the ordinary man's share.  I direct attention to the fact that quite recently&mdash;only a few months ago&mdash;the police issued a statement concerning the number of deaths that occurred in this country as a result of motor car accidents and also the number of people who had been injured. I think in the first case the figure was about 130 and in the other case it was at least 1,000.  These are very sad figures.  I do not suggest for one moment that any motorist would be willingly guilty of driving in a manner that would endanger the lives of men, women or children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless the fact remains that these accidents occur.  My own opinion of the matter is that motorists are allowed to drive at too great a speed, and all necessary steps should be taken to reduce that speed.  I brought this matter before the Corporation quite recently.  They listened to me and said: &ldquo;We have no power; the police control the traffic.&rdquo;  One member of the Corporation undoubtedly made the statement that almost every day in the country he saw breaches of the Traffic Acts being committed.  I do not think it is in the power of the police, considering the duties they have to perform, to give proper attention to these Acts.  I am convinced from my own experience of passing through the streets, and along the roads within the city and around it, that the speed should be curtailed.  There was a very wholesome Act in operation some time ago governing the speed of motor cars. I do not see why that Act should not be revived if that can be done or else new regulations should be brought in by the Minister to control speed.  It is almost impossible sometimes to cross College Green owing to the speed of cars and buses.  On the roads surrounding the city, over and over again I have seen motor cars going at a tremendous speed, sometimes on the wrong side, and sometimes passing trams on the wrong side.  I hope the Minister will take these matters to heart.  It is a very serious thing indeed to have this terrible list of fatal <Col N="2457" /> accidents on the roads and streets of this country within the last 12 months or so.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It concerns the treatment of prisoners who are convicted of what I would call very minor offences.  I have a case in mind of one man who was sent to prison for contempt of court.  His contempt consisted in resisting certain orders made in connection with a sewer underneath his house.  The man was several weeks in prison and he told me that he had to mix with people who had been convicted of very serious crimes.  He did not think that was fair at all and neither did I.  I spoke to a lawyer about this some time ago and the lawyer said to me: &ldquo;Look here, that man was convicted of the greatest crime that is known to the law.  He was convicted of contempt of court.&rdquo; I do not think the punishment in that case fitted the crime.  There are a number of other individuals in the community who suffer in that way, namely, street traders.  I have been concerned about these people for some time.  They are a very hard-working, decent body.  For some time they have been subjected to extraordinary fines, fines of £3 and £4.  You might as well subject them to a fine of £3,000.  They cannot pay it.  They have to go to jail.  Sometimes they go to jail for 14 days, sometimes for a month.  They tell me that they have to mix with women whose characters are not of the best or have not been of the best for a long time.  I do not think that is right and I submit the Minister should look into it.  Surely certain classes should exist in the jails, so that people who are convicted of crimes which do not affect their character should be treated differently from those who are convicted of crimes which do affect their character.  That is all I have to say in regard to the Estimate.  I submit my grievances to the Minister and I hope he will take action to remedy them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points which I should like to put to the Minister.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins referred to one of the points which I <Col N="2458" /> intended to raise, and in regard to which I hope that we shall have an answer from the Minister, namely, the factors which enter into the determination of whether certain cases are to be brought before the ordinary courts or the Military Tribunal.  It is a matter which has been commented on, that certain cases which appeared glaringly to be cases which should be brought before the Military Tribunal were brought before the ordinary civil courts, whereas other cases which seemed to be cases which should have been brought before the civil authority were brought before the Military Tribunal.  As I say, it would be no harm if we had from the Minister some information on that point.  I want to get from the Minister also some information as to the circumstances under which meetings or processions can be proclaimed or prohibited on the ground that they may lead to breaches of the peace.  We have had certain demonstrations and processions proclaimed by the present Government on the ground that if they were allowed they would inevitably lead to breaches of the peace.  These prohibitions, so far as I know, were applied to one organisation and one organisation only by the present Government.  We have had other organisations, which, so far as I know, do not commend themselves to very many people in this country, allowed to hold meetings and demonstrations which any person, even outside the Department of Justice or the Gárda Síochána, would know must inevitably lead to breaches of the peace.  We have had one such demonstration that very nearly led to very serious crime and serious personal injury. There was at least a possibility of loss of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to go as far as anybody to see that all organisations will get full freedom in putting their point of view before the people, but there is a certain school of thought in this country which I do not think should be allowed to proclaim their particular teachings in this country.  I think we should know where the Department stands in regard to that particular organisation.  That organisation is working in many ways.  Again, I <Col N="2459" /> should like to know from the Minister whether reports have been received by his Department of the activities of certain persons who are travelling through this country circulating certain literature.  It may be known to Deputies here, and it certainly has been reported to me from many parts of my constituency, that gentlemen, not natives of this country, are travelling throughout the country distributing and selling certain books which in some cases have been seized from them and have been denounced by clergymen in particular parishes. These books, to say the least of it, were books that should not, in my opinion, be allowed to be circulated or sold in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>What sort of books?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Communist, if you like.  I saw some of them.  They were brought to me by the person at whose house they had been left and I did not believe that anything like those doctrines would be put between the covers of a book.  Certain clergymen had some of these books submitted to them and it is safe to say that they were shocked.  I want to know whether the Minister has had those matters brought to his attention.  I should also like to know whether the Minister has any definite information as to the extent of the Communist organisation in this country and its allied organisations or offshoots.  Is he in a position to inform us whether or not the Communist organisation is making any advance; whether there is an increase in the membership; whether there are reports made by the members of the detective force, and whether the same close supervision is kept over that organisation and the same enthusiasm displayed in cramping its style as was shown in the case of another organisation? The Minister knows well to what organisation I am referring.  The Government ought to show at least as much anxiety to clip the wings of this organisation as they showed to clip the wings of another organisation which, in my opinion, did not at all merit the attention which the Government <Col N="2460" /> so kindly gave it.  I should like if the Minister would assure us that steps are being taken to ensure that no more of this dirty literature to which I have referred, and which must have been the subject of report from members of the Gárda Síochána, will be circulated.  It was distributed in a number of districts in the South of Ireland.  A number of people were engaged in the distribution, and in at least two cases the supplies were seized by civilians and destroyed.  I do not think that that is a desirable way of dealing with the matter.  I do not think that that duty should have to be undertaken by civilians. I think it is a matter for the Guards. Whatever steps are to be taken to put an end to that sort of thing should be taken by State forces and not by civilians.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to get that matter cleared up.  As I propose in the short remarks I have to make to criticise the Government for lack of backbone, I want to make clear at the outset that I am not in favour of any Governmental efforts to stifle free speech.  I consider that people ought not to be allowed to advocate the overthrow of the State by force but, short of that, it seems to me that no sort of political opinion ought to be stifled by the Government. Indeed, as I read our Constitution, it would be entirely unconstitutional for the Government to do anything of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to support this motion for referring back the Estimate of the Department of Justice for reconsideration. I intend to support it primarily because I am extremely dissatisfied <Col N="2461" /> with the record of the Government in regard to political murder.  There have been three cold-blooded and most brutal political murders in the course of the last year and a half for which nobody has been brought to book, or looks like being brought to book.  All the Minister can do to-night in dealing with this subject is to get up and say impressively that the Government do not intend to tolerate such things or to tolerate the organisations that do such things.  While general statements of that sort are welcome, so far as they go, the fact remains that these things have occurred and, as I submit, the Government is largely to blame for their having occurred.</P>
    <P>We were not able, at the time, to have full discussion of the More O'Ferrall case in the House because certain people were under arrest and the Minister excused himself from dealing with the subject with any thoroughness on that account.  The More O'Ferrall case has a considerable bearing on the Somerville case and the Egan case.  I think it is worth our while, therefore, to refresh our memories about it to-night.  It will be recollected that down in Edgeworthstown there had been a strong agitation for a reduction of the town tenants' rents &mdash;an agitation that had been conducted, in the first instance, on ordinary, constitutional lines, an agitation which had called in the assistance of the Deputies for the constituency.  The High Court of Justice, which was responsible for the administration of that particular estate, decided against the views of the people who were engaged in that agitation and they, thereupon, quite openly and by resolution which appeared in the newspapers, called the organisation known as the I.R.A. to their aid.  The Government was quite aware of that fact.  The emissaries of that organisation, known as the I.R.A., arrived in the town&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy MacDermot will allow me, I want to say that the Deputy is wrong in saying that the town did not accept the Chief Justice's decision, because they did accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of the last decision of the Chief Justice. I suppose the Deputy is referring to <Col N="2462" /> the recent reduction given by the Chief Justice.  The original decision not to reduce came from the Chief Justice through Mr. More O'Ferrall.  The people were dissatisfied with that decision. They were dissatisfied with the result of constitutional agitation, and they, therefore, embarked on something stronger.  As I was just saying, the emissaries of that organisation, known as the I.R.A., arrived.  They made very inflammatory and threatening speeches; they recruited, they drilled and they had the whole district in an uproar for a period of months.  The Government was kept fully informed by the police of what was going on. They received notes of the speeches made, and what did they do?  They did nothing beyond, I believe, offering to guard Mr. More O'Ferrall when actually collecting the rents and only when collecting the rents.  The result was that feeling got more and more worked up in the district and eventually that particularly brutal crime of which we all know was committed.  Then the Government, whether or not as a result of the pressure applied in this House &mdash;I give them the benefit of the doubt and presume they would have acted as they did in any event&mdash;showed a certain amount of activity.  After the deed was done they showed a certain amount of eagerness to obtain such evidence as would enable them to prosecute successfully.  But they have failed to convict anybody of that crime. Can we be surprised at their failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we be surprised that people are slow to take the risk of coming forward to give evidence when they had before their eyes the spectacle of the weakness and subserviency of the Government themselves during a period of months before the crime occurred?  I do not purpose to comment on the actual details of the More O'Ferrall case other than to say that it is to me a complete mystery why that case was not sent before the Military Tribunal. If there is any ground for having the Military Tribunal at all in this country it is that it is needed for the trial of political murder cases.  If there is any sort of case that is unlikely to be well tried by an ordinary jury in this country it is the political murder case.  If the Military Tribunal <Col N="2463" /> is not to be given the responsibility of dealing with political murder cases the Military Tribunal might just as well be swept away.  What happened in the More O'Ferrall case?  What happened before the murder and what happened after the murder?  The whole course of the Government's dealing with the circumstances of that murder combined to constitute a sort of Magna Charta for political murderers in this country. I have not the smallest doubt that the murders of Admiral Somerville and John Egan are the consequences of the failure of the Government to deal adequately with that agitation in Edgeworthstown and to deal adequately with the problems raised in the course of seeking to arrest and convict the parties who were guilty of that murder.</P>
    <P>I wish to echo the question put to the Minister by Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Morrissey.  That question is: What is the principle upon which a decision is taken as to whether a case is to go before an ordinary jury or whether it is to go before the Military Tribunal?  I can conceive of only one respectable principle and that is, the sort of case that should go to the Military Tribunal is the sort of case in which intimidation is likely in the case of an ordinary jury.  Heaven knows it is hard enough, in view of the extraordinary weakness that has been shown for years towards illegal and revolutionary organisations, to get the evidence that is necessary in order to convict anybody of a crime of that sort without having the additional difficulty of a tribunal that is afraid or unwilling to convict in political cases. I hope the Minister will not forget to deal with that question&mdash;what is the principle upon which criminal cases are sent to the Military Tribunal or sent to the ordinary courts?</P>
    <P>Now there is another question that I want to put.  We have heard these references to the organisation known as the Irish Republican Army, that it is an illegal organisation.  If that be the view of its status, why is not the obvious course taken of declaring it to be an illegal organisation under the Public Safety Act?  It is all very well <Col N="2464" /> when a case gets into court or when the subject is raised here in the Dáil to talk loosely of its being an illegal organisation.  But is that view of the case made plain in advance to the young men who might be tempted to join it?  When the young men of the country see the Irish Republican Army parading through the streets or along the country road in military formation, when they see them holding celebrations at cemeteries and elsewhere, when they see them in all the glory and panoply of military array, how can they be expected to take seriously these allusions to the organisation as illegal?  Deputy O'Higgins has talked of an organisation of that kind obtaining more respect from the country people than the law itself.  If that is so, surely it is largely the fault of the Government?  Surely, if they are justified in coming in here and saying that the organisation is illegal, or if they are justified in saying so, now and again, in court&mdash;and perhaps the next day in court saying something that seems to contradict that statement&mdash; surely they ought to take the obvious course, and that would be to issue a warning to the young people and declare in advance that the organisation is unlawful so that the young people would know from the start where they stand with regard to it?  That is the second question which I put to the Minister.  I ask him to give some explanation as to why that simple and straightforward course is not taken. Too often throughout the countryside the rank and file of the Government Party&mdash;the Fianna Fáil clubs and so forth&mdash;are constantly truckling to the Irish Republican Army, trying to retain the favour of the extreme element who belong to that organisation.  As long as that sort of thing goes on you cannot expect to have a proper state of public opinion about these matters. Surely the parting of the ways has now come.  If the Government have any sense of their duty to the people of this country at all they must put an end to that.</P>
    <P>Now, when I call for clarification of their attitude in this matter it is not from any spirit of vindictiveness towards the peope who compose the <Col N="2465" /> I.R.A. I think, for the sake of the decency and safety of life in this country, for the sake of democracy, for the sake of the ordinary citizen, and especially the ordinary citizen in remote and deserted parts of the country, that crime and intimidation of that kind must be stopped.  But to be perfectly honest about the matter, I do not think it is a case in which it is reasonable to feel nothing but anger and vindictiveness against the people in the I.R.A. who engage in such activities.  I think&mdash;and here again I have to allot a very large portion of blame to the Government&mdash; that a great deal of the fault in regard to these occurrences lies in the general policy of the Government.  That is a matter I cannot deal with adequately on this Vote; it is rather a matter for the President's Vote, I suppose. But I can just say this, that so long as the Government keeps up this pretence of being in the British Empire under constraint, so long excuses can be found for political crimes in this country.  These young men are not able to make the subtle distinctions that the Government's policy expects of them.  So long as we go on saying that we are compelled by force to remain in the British Empire, so long will a certain number of people in this country fail to see any great difference between the act of those who shot down Admiral Somerville and the act of those, shall we say, who dragged out Alan Bell from a tramcar in Ballsbridge and shot him down.</P>
    <P>If the Government want to stamp out political crime in this country, they must in the first place administer justice with far greater firmness and consistency than they have done since they came into office and, in the second place, they must make a fundamental change in their national policy.  They must cease to keep up these pretences that we are being compelled by some external force to stay in the British Empire and they must give the people the opportunity of deciding whether to go out of that Empire or to accept it and all its implications with loyalty and goodwill.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made <Col N="2466" /> a statement to-night which should be supplemented, in view of our past experience, by some additional statement. We should like to hear emphatically from the Minister that he is going to adopt a policy in future that will enable the ordinary person in the country, going about his business in the ordinary way, to be free from interference of any kind by organised parties who, as he indicated to-night, take the power of life and death in their hands or take the power of organised interference with people in in their hands.  There is a method of interfering in small ways with people's comforts and people's amenities; there is a way of keeping people cowed by making them feel they are under observation by a particular class of person.  Only comparatively recently have we seen incidents of this particular kind.  The Minister makes a very sweeping statement which, as has been pointed out, is to some extent a reversal of the attitude taken up by the Attorney-General when advising some people in the courts quite recently.</P>
      <P>I have particulars here of a case that occurred on the 3rd June.  A party of five men drove up in a motor car on a Sunday afternoon and stopped outside the house of a person who gave very distinguished service as an officer in the pre-Truce Volunteers and later in the National Army.  Two of them intruded into this man's house, where they found him with his wife and a friend.  They began interfering by demanding tea, and when they were told it was not a restaurant they began to abuse the man of the house, charged him with having given service in the National Army, threatened him, said that they were the I.R.A., assaulted his friend and generally created a very ugly and disturbing situation in the man's home.  They said they were soldiers of the I.R.A.  When the case was brought to the courts, the superintendent asked to have both accused bound to the peace for 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is going to pursue such a policy as is reflected by the attituude of the superintendent in West Cork, that when people announce themselves as members of the I.R.A. and intrude into a private house with <Col N="2467" /> the object of interfering with the owner and using very bad language, according to the superintendent&mdash;if the policy to be pursued is to allow that sort of thing to go on and have people simply bound to the peace for 12 months for doing it, then the Minister is only leaving a spawning ground for major actions such as have been mentioned here to-night.  If the Minister was speaking honestly to the House to-night he would go further and he would make it quite clear that people will not be interfered with, with impunity, in that particular way.</P>
    <P>He should also make it clear to the Guards that he expects detached and loyal service from them.  The Minister is quite well aware that when this Government came into office they stuffed the Guards with a particular type of recruit who would be useful and convenient for their immediate political purpose.  They had to raise all kinds of scares in the country to cover their action.  They had to pretend that a Minister of the former Government went to Glasgow, saw a British Minister there, and was <Col N="2468" /> endeavouring to get arms to bring over here to dislodge the Government elected here by the people.  They had to raise scares of that kind to cover the action that they took at that time by recruiting particular types of men into the Guards.  At the top throughout the country they made promotions that were intended to be of a political kind and without reference to the efficiency or integrity of the men concerned; promotions were made at various stages throughout the Guards purely on political grounds.  It would be useless now to go into the matter, but I do say that the morale of the Guards has been seriously injured as a result of that, and the Minister must make it clear that in future he is going to look on the Guards as an instrument of the State completely detached from politics, carrying out, above all, one special duty, and that is the duty of the protection of the people.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
