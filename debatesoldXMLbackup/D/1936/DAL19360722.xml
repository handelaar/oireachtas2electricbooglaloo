      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of the hardship imposed on piece-workers employed on road work as a result of the operation of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936; that they are limited to a 48-hour week as in the case of men paid at day rates, and that as many of these pieceworkers are subject to long periods of unemployment this limitation of hours of work constitutes a distinct hardship, <Col N="1632" /> and if he proposes to introduce amending proposals for legislation to remedy this state of affairs.</P>

      <P>No cases of hardship as suggested in the first part of the question have been brought to the notice of the Department.

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, might I ask if the Minister is aware that those men, who are engaged on piece-work, are compelled to work the same hours as the men who are engaged and paid a weekly wage?  They are compelled to cease work on Saturday at 12 o'clock with the men who are paid a weekly wage.  As a result, their earnings have been very substantially reduced.</P>

      <P>In the unavoidable absence of the President and the Vice-President, I have to refer to the unexpected death of Deputy Sir Osmond Esmonde, which no doubt has become known to members of the Dáil.  Deputy Esmonde belonged to a distinguished family which, through many generations, has been identified with the national cause. As a young man he devoted himself to the service of Ireland, and he gave valuable assistance to the national movement during the struggle of 1920-1921.  His death is a loss to Irish public life and to this House, of which he has been a member for many years. I ask you, A Chinn Comhairle, to convey to Deputy Esmonde's family the sincere sympathy of Dáil Eireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I oppose this Money Resolution.  In the last 50 years of the history of this country many Land Bills have been introduced in the Parliament of Westminster and in the Parliament of Saorstát Eireann, and up until a very few years ago the introduction of a Land Bill was identified in the minds of the Irish people with recognisable progress on the part of the small farmers of this country to the three things for which the Land League was founded 50 years ago: fair rent, free sale, and fixity of tenure.  It was not until Fianna Fáil came into office that Land Bills have come to be identified in the public mind with the destruction of these things, and it was not until 1936 that a Land Purchase Bill was <Col N="1634" /> introduced into this House to facilitate the sheriff and the bailiff to evict from their holdings farmers who could not pay their rents and to imprison those from whom the ordinary methods of distress could extract no money.</P>
      <P>This Financial Resolution that we consider here to-day provides the machinery whereby the sheriff's bailiff can go into a tenant purchaser in the country and, if that tenant purchaser is unable to pay his rent, he can have him removed to jail indefinitely until such time as the rent is paid.  Does any Deputy in this House remember to have read of any Land Bill which contained such a provision in the past? Balfour never tried it.  Forster never tried it.  Nobody who ever pretended, either on behalf of England or on behalf of Ireland, to be charged with the responsibility for the tenant farmers of this country ever sought powers from Parliament to jail a man who is unable to pay his rent.  I want to know if the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party stand for that policy or if they do not; and, if they do not stand for it, have they the courage to get up here and say and do the things that they would say and do in the country if their own constituents asked them the meaning of the section of the Land Bill, 1936, to which I refer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I want to put this matter in issue also: either our fathers were right in 1880, when they fought for fixity of tenure and free sale, and we are wrong now, or else we are right now and they were wrong then.  Fixity of tenure is ultimately and finally destroyed by the provisions of the Land Bill of 1936.  It is now open to the Government, if this Bill becomes law, to go in upon the holding of any man, whether he owns ten acres or 1,000 acres, and take that land from him and give it to his neighbours.  I ask the Deputies of this House, do they stand for a policy which gives the Government that right? Because, if they do, fixity of tenure is gone for all time, and the land settlement of this country is back in the melting-pot; and this time it is not being put into the melting-pot for the purpose of establishing the people on the land; it is being put back into the melting-pot for the purpose of taking <Col N="1635" /> one set of people off the land to put their neighbours on in their places. Heretofore a Land Bill was a Land Bill for the tenant farmers.</P>
    <P>The Land Bill of 1936 is a grabbers' Bill and it is being passed in the interests of land grabbers who are covetous of their neighbours' land and who want to take it from them.  The remedy we had for land grabbers in the past was to boycott them, and that remained the method of dealing with land grabbers in this country until Fianna Fáil came into office.  Under the new dispensation the land grabber has become the protected favourite of the Government and the tenant farmer is to be thrown on the roadside in order to accommodate the grabber. Do the members of the Fianna Fáil Party stand for that?  If they do, then the Land League was a fraud.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, in answering to the debate on the Second Stage of this Bill, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not believe in the philosophy that a man's property is his own to do just whatever he likes with it. He is bound by certain moral conventions and he should be bound also by certain legal conventions, to use that land in the best interest of the entire community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That quotation is in column 1425, Volume 63, No. 4.  Now let us examine the Minister's philosophy.  I accept the words that a man who owns land or any other property is bound by moral obligations in the sight of God to use it in accordance with the laws of God.  I do not accept the doctrine that the State has any right to come in on my land or into my home and tell me how to run it.  The State has no right to do that.  If I own my land, if I live upon it and rear my family on it, the Minister for Lands has no right to come in and tell me how to run my own, and I tell you this: that if that right is once admitted here, the logical conclusion of that philosophy is to take over all the land of this country and let the Government run it and make the farmers in this land tenants of the Government. There is no other way of running it. If you once assert the right of the <Col N="1636" /> Government to go in and direct the farmers of this country as to how they are to farm their land in all the details of that operation, the logical conclusion of that doctrine is that the land should be transferred to the Government and that the farmers of this country should occupy the same position as the farmers of Russia occupy on the collective farms in Russia. Now, the difference between the system in this country and the system in Russia has been that we believe in private ownership in the land and that in Russia they believe in State ownership. Which is it going to be in this country?  Is it to be a private ownership or ownership on sufferance of the Minister for Lands?</P>
    <P>I hold land and I use no single acre of it in accordance with any of the policies of the Fianna Fáil Government, and I would regard it as a scandalous misuse of my land to use it in accordance with the tomfool fallacies of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Does that entitle the Minister for Lands to take my land from me?  I regard him as an incompetent.  I regard the Minister for Agriculture as an incompetent. I regard him as entirely unfit to advise any single tenant farmer in this country as to how land should be used.  I do not believe there is a single responsible agriculturist in this country who believes in the policy of either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Does that give them the right to come in and take my land from me, and, if it does, if the Fine Gael Party should form a Government to-morrow, will that Government have the right to take Deputy Aiken's land, as he then will be, from him because he is not prepared to farm it in accordancee with what we think to be the right way to do it?  I say no.  So long as he is living on his land, and farming his land conscientiously to the best of his ability, no Fine Gael Government, or any other Government, has the right to put him off it.</P>
    <P>Deputies of this House may allow themselves to be dragged along paths the end of which they do not fully understand, but I invite Deputies who are living in the country to ask themselves <Col N="1637" /> this question: going about amongst their own neighbours, do their own neighbours living on the land feel that they have fixity of tenure?  Do they not all live in a constant state of anxiety that they will get a notice from the Land Commission that inspectors are going down to inspect the land with a view to acquisition?  I challenge the Minister for Lands to deny that his Department at present is greatly embarrassed by the fact that his inspectors are wasting a great deal of their time in having to go around examining people's land, with a view to acquisition, which the Land Commission should never have been asked to examine at all.  I appreciate that the Land Commission is endeavouring to examine every application that reaches it impartially and fully, but I say that, as a result of the Fianna Fáil policy since they took over the Land Commission, men are writing to them continually, asking them to send inspectors to inspect farms with a view to acquisition that ought never to have been inspected, and I say that the mental anguish and misery which is caused to small farmers by having these inspections carried out is an outrage on our people.</P>
    <P>It may be that owing to the fact that there is a shortage of land in this island for the population, this Legislature should make up its mind that no individual citizen will be allowed to retain in his ownership more than a given acreage of land.  Very well, let the Legislature make up its mind to that fact, and, having made up its mind, let there be fixity of tenure on the basis of that maximum ownership of land.  Let the landlord have fixity on his demesne; let the farmer have fixity on his farm; and let the tenant purchaser have fixity on his holding. All I ask is that this House shall say: &ldquo;There is a certain maximum quantity of land beyond which we will allow no individual proprietor to go; any individual proprietor holding that quantity or less who lives upon his land and who works his land conscientiously, according to his own conscience, is guaranteed from interference in the enjoyment of that land for all time.&rdquo;  That is what I mean by fixity of tenure, and I say that the people of <Col N="1638" /> this country are entitled to demand that.  What Deputy is there sitting in this House, whose father and grandfather, and his father before him, lived on the holding where he now lives, would admit the right of the Land Commission to come into that land now, order him off it and tell him that they are going to give that land away to his neighbours and that he must migrate to another part of the country? What is the use of telling me that you will give me land of equal value in County Louth, when I was born and reared in County Mayo?  I do not want to go and live in County Louth.  What Deputy here whose father and grandfather before him lived in the West of Ireland wants to migrate to the south-east?  What consolation is it to me to be told that I can have a farm at the other end of the country?</P>
    <P>How can you expect any farmer in this country to put his heart and his mind into building-up and improving the conditions of his land if he knows that the minute he makes it any better than the land of his neighbours he is going to be the object of the envy and covetousness of every unscrupulous neighbour of his, and that he will have an inspector inspecting the land with a view to distributing it amongst his neighbours?  I say that if this goes on, we are going to have precisely the same condition developing in this country as precipitated the famine of 1879.  No farmer in this country will dare improve his land because he will know that the moment it stands out from amongst his neighbours' land, his neighbours will covet it and he will be in danger of having it taken from him and of being asked to migrate to the other end of the country.  So, you will get every farmer vying with his neighbour in allowing his land to become more disreputable and impoverished. He wants to stay there because people love the land they were born on and they do not want to be migrated.  If you are going to make the penalty of improving their land compulsory acquisition and migration to another part of the country there is going to be no improvement of land in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands says that a <Col N="1639" /> man is not only bound by moral obligations before God to administer his property in a conscientious way, but should also be bound by legal conventions to use that land in the best interests of the entire community.  Is not the logical conclusion of that thesis that the Government should take over the land and that the farmer should run it in accordance with the Government's instructions?  I tell you that if you start along those lines, if this country is going to advance along those lines, you are going to advance to a civil war.  There are a lot of people anxious to say: &ldquo;Do not be saying nasty things; do not be creating alarms.&rdquo;  Now is the time to create alarms before damage is done.  If you are going to destroy the fixity of tenure of every tenant farmer in this country, there is going to come a point when there will be an uprising by the tenant farmers in defence of their holdings, and this time it will not be an uprising against the British Government, but against an Irish Government.  What I put to Deputies is that nothing ought to be done by any Party in this House which would give the colour of justification to any body of persons in this country to take up arms against the established Government of the country.  I heard from the Labour Benches yesterday approval of violent action by farmers in overturning milk cans.  I know these farmers are supporters of the Fine Gael Party, and I say here in public they did wrong.  I admit that they had, provocation; I admit that they were exasperated; I admit that the Minister for Agriculture was behaving badly in regard to their particular claim; but whatever the provocation was, to take action of that kind against the established Government of this country is wrong.</P>
    <P>I say that if the farmers of this country are driven to defend their holdings by force, they will be driven to a course which is wrong, and which will do inestimable damage to this country, but how can any body of men who have grown up in this country during the last 30 or 40 years not realise that if you reopen the whole agrarian struggle in this country, you <Col N="1640" /> are going to have the farmers banding themselves together to defend their legitimate interests?  How can Deputies be so blind as not to see that and, seeing it now, why can you not face it?  There is only one way of facing it and that is to fix a maximum acreage of land which any man may hold and to say: &ldquo;Once you are below that acreage, you are there until you want to go, and no Government or anybody else will attempt to disturb you.&rdquo;  Fixity of tenure is gone.  I want it back, and, so far as this Party is concerned, if and when we take power in this country, I say that fixity of tenure will be restored to the tenant farmers, whatever legislative steps may be necessary to achieve that end, and I say with the fullest sense of responsibility that any failure to do that will drag this country into appalling disaster.  Free sale is gone.  I put this to Deputies here: Suppose a small tenant farmer in this country wants to sell his land to-morrow, does not every Deputy here know that in seven cases out of ten&mdash;and I am deliberately understating the case because I believe it to be unanswerable&mdash;the moment the auction is announced, or the desire to sell the land expressed, there is a notice in from the Land Commission that they are going to inspect the land with a view to compulsory acquisition?  If all deeds and all agreements to sell are drawn up and awaiting signature, the moment that notice issues the agreements can be thrown into the waste-paper basket, and the vendor told that no further action will be taken until he gets an undertaking that the Land Commission will go no further.</P>
    <P>Have we all forgotten the fight made for free sale?  Is it because we have enjoyed free sale so long that we have forgotten what an important thing it is?  Do you not know that if a man puts all his savings and all his money into land, he does so because he believes that it is the best security he could possibly get? He is willing to take out of land a much smaller return on his money than he would get on stocks or shares, and so instead of constituting himself a rentier he accepts the lesser return which he secures in a much <Col N="1641" /> more arduous way, because he believes that land is a better security than any security he could buy.  The belief that land is a better security is founded in the confidence that there is free sale, that if he wants to move away from the homestead he has his savings to get by putting the land on the market and realising those savings.  If a man puts money into land, and takes a lesser return on the money than he could have got by putting it into stocks and becoming a rentier, once you make it clear that he will not be able to sell the land, or to get his capital out of it, then no man of foresight, of prudence, or good citizenship who saved money will ever put it into land.  The only person you are going to get to take land is the man who has nothing to lose, the man who is prepared to go into land without capital, the man without anything who can pull up the stumps any time and move on.  The man I want to get on the land is that member of the community who, given a chance, is prepared to build up a home and to establish a homestead&mdash; the prudent hard-working man.  You cannot get that kind of man to buy land if he knows that if he spends £1,000 on a little farm, when he comes to sell it, the Land Commission will not give him more than £400 or £500 for it.  That is why we want fixity of tenure.</P>
    <P>It astonishes me that Deputies seem to forget what happened in the past.  What happened was that if an existing tenant wanted to sell his tenant right to an incoming tenant, the landlord intervened and said that he had to be dealt with.  He might ask the incoming tenant for a line, or specify certain things which made the incoming tenant, when the landlords were on the rampage, draw back from the deal and the tenant could not sell his tenant right.  That became so great an abuse that it was put in the front platform of the Land League.  One of the things pointed to was the Ulster custom and a demand was made that it should be available for all farmers. Can it be that Deputies have forgotten all that?  I think they have <Col N="1642" /> forgotten the evils that obtained in the absence of fixity of tenure.  They have disappeared so completely that people have become as much accustomed to that position as the air they breathe.  If you want to re-establish the evils that obtained before we got fixity of tenure, if you want to fix in the minds of the people, that having put money into land they cannot get it out of it again, all the old evils which the Land League fought against are going to manifest themselves, and to be aggravated.  The evils now will have their root, not in the British landlord system but in an Irish Land Commission, with the added evil that it will not be done by the landlord system but by an institution set up by this Parliament.  That is what I want to avoid.  The Minister may say in reply, to meet Deputies' points of view, that land purchase will have to cease.  Land purchase, as we understand it, must cease some time, when all the land of this country has been sub-divided.  That may not be in our day or in our children's day, but some day the job must be done.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, all I ask is that this House will fix some condition of tenure which will give fixity to the tenant purchaser.  Let there be a limit as to its area.  Let there be an obligation on a tenant to live on the land and to work it, but let there be an assurance that no one will have the right to take the land from him.  At present nobody knows from hour to hour or from day to day how long the land is going to be left to him.  There is no use in my trying to drive home to the minds of Deputies who are born in Dublin what that means.  There is no use in my trying to persuade people who have never lived on the land what that means, but any Deputy who is the son of a small farmer must know what it would mean to his father if, at any moment, he might have got notice requiring him to move off to the other end of the country, to leave neighbours and friends, and break up the homestead and to set up one somewhere he was never before.  When you think of an individual <Col N="1643" /> case, it is unthinkable that any Irish Parliament would conceive such powers being given in a Land Act. I do not believe that one-half of the Fianna Fáil Party believe in the propriety of this proposal.  We want to help in the work of the Land Commission. Many of us here have perhaps what might be described as a sentimental feeling that the Land Commission is something outside Government, that the Land Commission used to be something identified in the minds of our people with deliverance from landlords.  I want that identity to be maintained.  I was brought up to believe that the Land Commission was the friend of the people, that the small farmer had the Land Commission behind him as against the landlord who tried to deprive him of his rights.</P>
    <P>I do not want a situation to develop in which the Land Commission, instead of being the friend of the small farmer, becomes a substitute for the landlord that used to oppress him.  I ask this House to take counsel with all sides so as to devise a scheme which will secure a settlement of the maximum number of our people on the land, and will at the same time ensure that fixity of tenure and free sale will be inviolate from any interference by any authority, no matter whence it comes. I believe that if Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Party felt themselves free to speak their minds they would make the same appeal that I am making.  I believe that this matter of land purchase and land tenure is something about which we can get agreement, if we only sit down to it, and I most strongly urge the Government not to go blindly ahead in a policy which may secure passing popularity amongst those who will get land, but which, in the long run, is going to undermine the entire stability of the State.  We are all agreed on fundamental principles in this matter; we are all anxious to help in disposing of it, but remember that if a Fianna Fáil Government destroys fixity of tenure and free sale, there is no stability in that settlement. Let the Fianna Fáil Government remember that if in their time fixity of <Col N="1644" /> tenure and free sale are destroyed, then their successors will re-establish these two things.  I want no revolutionary changes in the land policy of this country with change of Government. I believe we can find a common platform upon which this problem could be solved, without violent changes with every change of Government, and I earnestly appeal to the present Government to consider whether ways and means could not be devised to reach that end.  I ask them to reconsider the Bill before the House, and to bear in mind that many believe it strikes a mortal blow at two things that we consider to be absolutely vital to a satisfactory land settlement, these two things being fixity of tenure and free sale.</P>

      <P>I only intervene in this debate at the moment to bring before the Minister and the House an incident which came to my notice very recently&mdash;an incident which occurred within the last three weeks or a month. I was informed by a farmer living not very far distant from my place, a man who farms 60 acres of land and who has four sons, that an inspector went down to examine his farm with a view either to its acquisition or division, I cannot say which.  Does anybody in the country imagine that action like that on behalf of the Government is justifiable?  Although that farm may not be farmed in accordance with Government policy, just like the case Deputy Dillon mentioned a moment ago, I defy any Deputy in this House to point out a better-managed farm from here to the place where the farm is situated.  That man has four sons.</P>

Is <Col N="1645" /> that what we are coming to here, that because some Fianna Fáil supporter has some grudge against a man, who has only 60 acres, the Land Commission will be put to the expense of sending down an inspector to view that man's farm?</P>

      <P>That is the situation, and the law which tolerates that or expects that is good for nobody.  It is only for that reason, and to bring that matter before the Minister, that I have intervened in the debate.  I know where small farms have been put up for sale, and I know that certain people interfere with these sales because of this policy of &ldquo;I can get a piece of somebody else's holding&rdquo;.  I know where the Government have had to send down some of their armed detectives to keep order and to ensure that, to a certain extent, there would be free sale in connection with such farms.  It is time the people knew where they stood in connection with land purchase and land policy in this country.  If I bought land and acquired it honestly I have a right to hold it and sell it in the open market when I wish.  That is not the situation at the present time.  I merely avail of this occasion to put these few remarks before the House.  I shall send across the name of the owner of the farm I mentioned to the Minister.</P>

We shall leave it at that. As for Deputy Dillon, I am not going to attempt to reply to his ranting at the moment.  I suppose he felt on the Second Stage that he could not get himself sufficiently worked up.  He did not remain to speak then.  He went off to take a few days or a week to try to work himself up.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, if the Minister considers it proper to jeer at me for leaving the House on last Wednesday to attend the funeral of the late Deputy Patrick Hogan, I can only leave that to his sense of good taste, but the Minister knows that I fixed the Chair and the Minister with notice of the reason I left the House on that day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I got no notice of that, but I accept what the Deputy says. Fixity of tenure and free sale must have as many lives as a cat, because Deputy Dillon asserted that they were both killed many times in the past.  He said that they were as dead as Alexander under the Act of 1933.  According to him also, they were as dead as Alexander under the Act of 1923.  I do not believe that Deputy Dillon expresses either the policy of the Front Bench opposite or of Fine Gael as a whole in regard to land purchase. I heard the speech he made to-day and I heard him make a similar speech in 1933.  According to him then, every farmer in the country was to be on the road in 12 months.  The Act of 1933 has been in operation for three years and nothing serious has happened.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can hardly prove his denials.  The Deputy <Col N="1647" /> worked himself up to a fever pitch on the Land Bill of 1933.  I was disappointed that he did not work himself to a greater pitch to-day.  After all, it was a very poor show for Deputy Dillon.  He did not get half excited. The tears should have been streaming out of his eyes and his hair should have been flying about the place.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon knew something about the Land Bill, it would be all right. I made up my mind in 1933 that he did not know what the Land Bill of 1933 meant.  He <Col N="1648" /> did not even know what the Land Act of 1923 meant.  He did not know what was contained in the Land Bill of 1933, and I am sure he does not know what is contained in this Bill.  Deputies who knew something about land law discussed the Bill here on the last day, and they were able to discuss it intelligently. I do not intend to take up the time of the House in replying to the ranting of Deputy Dillon.  I know there are people in Fine Gael who must know something more about land law and about what is contained in the Bill, and we can debate these matters on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the concluding sentence of his introduction on the last day, before dealing with the section, the Minister said: &ldquo;I may say here that it is not anticipated that the working of this Bill is going to involve any abnormal expense or, indeed, any appreciable fresh expense, but the usual provision must be inserted in the Bill.&rdquo;  I agree that the usual provision <Col N="1649" /> must be inserted, but I should like to know, at this stage, if the Minister has attempted to form any estimate&mdash; even an approximate estimate&mdash;of what the administration of the Bill will cost.  It seems to me that the statement which I have quoted is rather contradictory.  The Minister says that the Bill will not involve any abnormal expense, but then he goes on to say that it will not involve any appreciable fresh expense.  The Bill will involve the expenditure of an enormous amount of additional money, and it seems to me that the Minister should give the Dáil some estimate of the fresh expenditure which will be necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to do some revolutionary things.  He proposes to feed and warm the colonies of migrants he is bringing from the Irish-speaking parts of the country to the eastern districts.  He proposes to take them round on grand tours to select farms in Meath and adjoining counties.  Following upon that, he proposes to give lands encumbered with debt away for nothing to tenants selected by the lay commissioners.  In addition, he is resuming land for purposes for which land has not hitherto been resumed. Likewise, he proposes to take over, under a section of the Bill, a number of farms which are now excluded because they have been used up to recently for the breeding of live stock. He is also taking unlimited power to take up land compulsorily which has already been vested under the 1923 Act.  Last of all he proposes to take over untenanted land which is held either under fee farm grant or long lease or which was excluded under the previous Land Acts because of its potential value for housing purposes. Surely to goodness all these operations &mdash;and I only mention a few of them&mdash; will involve an enormous expenditure of money.  Before he proceeds further, I suggest that the Minister should give the Dáil some estimate of what the administration of this Bill will actually cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to go into that matter in detail I wish to point out that it is one of the matters that must be so gone into on the Estimates. <Col N="1650" /> The operations of the Land Commission under this Bill as against the operations of the Land Commission under previous Acts will not tend to any greater expenditure of money. This Bill will enable us, of course, to speed up and hasten the work of the Land Commission.  That policy can be debated when the Estimates come along.  It is not proper to this Bill. If the Land Commission did not have a policy in regard to the division of land which is normally discussed on the Estimates, the putting of this Bill into operation would not cost a fraction. I think we can postpone the detailed examination of the Land Commission expenditure until the Land Commission Estimate comes along.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the power which the Minister is seeking in this section, that is to say, the power of postponing the drawing operations in connection with the Sinking Fund, may have an appreciable effect on the capital value of the stock and may tend to lower the security of the capital issue of land stock.  Probably 80 per cent. of the 4½ per cent. land bonds created by the Land Act of 1923 are not registered yet in the National City Bank.  I do not think more than 20 per cent. are still in the Land Commission pending allocation.  I do not know the actual amount as I did not see any issues of land stock for a very long time.  If, therefore, the acouisition of land is to be dealt with as under the Land Act of 1923, these outstanding drawings being postponed might mean the postponement of payment for many years and would naturally have a disastrous effect on the security of these land bonds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the introduction of this section is to secure that the value of the bonds will not be depressed. The bonds to which this section refers may stand at a premium and when bonds stand at a premium the holders of the bonds do not want them to be redeemed at par.  That is the full effect of this section.  It is a hardship on bond holders if less than 80 per cent. of a certain block of land stock is to be drawn for redemption. The reason is this: If you are to redeem 100 out of 1,000, the holder of the stock has a much better chance of getting away with it than he has if the stock in question is 500.  The chances in 500 are one in five and in the other case the chances are one in ten.  This section is simply postponing the lotteries or the drawings until there is 80 per cent. of the stock out.  This is meant to secure that the man who holds stock standing at a premium will not be subject to these drawings until 80 per cent. of the stock in that series is issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to get from the Minister some explanation of the terminology which hides an arrear? There is an arrear here which is the subject of consideration.  What exactly is the figure which is being wiped out? A man was entitled to have whatever arrears he had standardised by three half gales being added to the principal. That was added presumably at 5 per cent., which will include principal and interest.  Does this mean that in respect of the wiping out of that particular sum a greater sum than he owed may possibly be included in the deduction to be made from the sum of money that is going to be paid to him? What calculation is made in respect of that?  Is the interest added to it at 5 per cent. when the Government is only paying 4 per cent.?  When the Government offered to have these particular arrears added to the man's <Col N="1653" /> annuity they had in mind the fact that at the time he was not in a position to pay the annuity.  But look at the position the man will find himself in when after 30 or 40 years' time he finds he is in debt to the Land Commission and he suddenly is deprived of his holding, when it is resumed by the Land Commission, and he is asked then to pay a debt to the Government which the Government themselves were satisfied two or three years ago he was unable to pay.  While it may seem to be excellent business from the point of view of the Land Commission, from the business man's point of view it does not seem to be fair.  The man may possibly take land somewhere else or go into business somewhere else.  But, if he does, he goes in having paid a debt which he was unable to pay two or three years ago and which he certainly has not been in a much better position to pay since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If the holding is resumed the man has to pay off the full revised annuity, and it is only right that he should redeem the funded annuity as well.  The funded annuity in all cases is a very small fraction of the total annuity.  If he has to pay it off, he is getting the money to pay it off&mdash;we are not asking him to find the cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will go a step further and give an example in respect of a particular case. The Land Commission must have dealt with some one case or other in connection with this matter.  Could the Minister give us a figure of the price per acre which has been paid for land, and what the deduction has been in respect of funded arrears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is entitled to certain information.  We are laying down the law and giving directions to the Land Commission as to what they are to do.  It is our responsibility to make the law, and we are entitled to know that we are dealing with justness, fairness and equity with every Land Commission annuitant.  Only once, I think, is the word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo; mentioned in this Bill.  In previous Land Acts the words &ldquo;fair, just and <Col N="1654" /> equitable&rdquo; were regularly used.  If we are going to insist upon a man paying a debt which the Government told him a short time ago he could extend over 40 or 50 years, we are reversing engines and changing our minds on the subject.  We ought to know what is the average price per acre in the case of resumed land where deductions such as these have been made, and what proportion the deductions represent.  If the Minister is not in a position to answer that question will he answer this one?  These arrears were funded in the annuities.  Will he tell us, in respect of the sum of money which is now going to be deducted from these people, whether the money is going to be paid into the Guarantee Fund or the Land Bond Fund?  That is a simple question which the Minister ought to be in a position to answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be paid into the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, I say it is not due to the Exchequer. This is a sum of money which has been deducted already out of the Guarantee Fund and, being deducted out of that Fund, the rates were made responsible for making it good.  It is not a debt to the Government&mdash;not in all cases, at any rate.  Is there going to be any allocation of whatever portion of that was originally deducted from the Guarantee Fund, so that it will be put into the Guarantee Fund?  I do not want to trap the Minister, but this is a matter upon which I feel rather keenly, for this reason.  Arrears to the extent of approximately £600,000 were due in respect of the Land Acts from 1903 to 1931, a period of over 28 years.  The rates made good that deficiency.  In 1933 an alteration took place in respect of the collection of these arrears.  Some of them were wiped out and others were added to the annuities.  A sum of something like £250,000 was wiped out, and the remainder has been collected by the Land Commission since.  Two sums of money were voted to the Guarantee Fund.  My recollection is that they were £250,000 and £300,000.  We are now proceeding to cash in those funded arrears in certain cases.  If they go <Col N="1655" /> into the Exchequer while they are properly due to the Guarantee Fund, we are doing an injustice to the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>The Minister may not be aware of the fact that I raised the question with the Minister for Finance on the Final Stage of the Appropriation Bill.  I pointed out that he was taking credit for having collected considerable sums of money since 31st January in respect of land annuities, and that so far as the rates were concerned they had got no benefit from that collection up to the 1st April.  There were moneys collected which in the meantime the rates were called upon to provide.  In other words, assuming £150,000 was collected from 31st January to 1st April, that money was available, but although it was available the rates are saddled to the extent of £150,000 this year, and the assessments are made out, making it mandatory on county councils to collect that money, although it was in the hands of the Exchequer or the Land Commission.  £150,000 is a considerable sum.  It is quite possible that it will mean about 6d. in the £ on the rates all over the country.  But the local authorities will not get that money.  I presume there will be accountancy difficulties, or something of that sort.  Will the Minister undertake, if possible, to make it available for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this particular section there may be another £150,000 involved.  I want to know if the Minister can give the House any information as to how it is proposed to recoup the Guarantee Fund in respect of such deductions as will be made from these people.  Let me put it this way.  In the first place, I object to the people, who were not in a position to pay this debt two years ago, now being called upon suddenly, when a rock-bottom price is being paid to them by the Land Commission for their land, to pay this money.  In the second place, if it is collected from the persons concerned in such very hard circumstances, I say that the people who have most claim to it, or at any rate a good claim to it, having regard to what they have paid already, are the ratepayers.  I should like to know what provision is being made to refund <Col N="1656" /> the portion of these funded arrears which are their due.</P>

      <P>I know, but we might discuss it on this.  I support the request made by Deputy Cosgrave in this matter.  The Minister, I think, is misinformed or has come to a wrong conclusion in respect to this going to the Exchequer.  It may go to the Exchequer now, but it is not due to the Exchequer.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, this money, or portion of it, is due to the local authorities who have made this good to the Guarantee Fund.  If the Minister cannot give us a definite answer to that question he should consider it and give a definite answer later, because, in equity, portion of this money is due to the local authorities.  That is the reason I put down the amendment which has been ruled out of order.</P>

      <P>We threshed all this out, so far as I remember, in 1933.  At that time Deputies opposite wanted to have all the arrears that were not collected immediately by the Land Commission repaid by the Minister for Finance into the Guarantee Fund.  The Government could not accept it at the time, but there was a promise that from time to time certain moneys would be paid out of the Exchequer into the Guarantee Fund, and that the farmers' rates would be relieved.  That has since been done.</P>

In a period of three years, he has paid off&mdash;I will take the Deputy's figure&mdash;over £550,000.  The Minister for Finance may pay off more of it next year.

      <P>Well, it is subject to an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal. If people are not satisfied with the Land Commission's price, they can go to the Appeal Tribunal.  If a man is paying off his revised annuity, I think it is not too much to expect that he will also pay off the funding annuity.  It cannot be very much.  It is a very small percentage of the total amount of the revised annuity.</P>

      <P>I maintain that this is a totally different matter to the question that was raised when the 1933 Act was going through.  My recollection is that at that time the amount of the funding annuities was an unascertained figure.  Now, we have the ascertained amounts that are going to be paid in in cash where the funding annuity is redeemed.  It ought to be a very easy matter for the Minister to set aside this money in the Guarantee Fund.  It is provided in sub-section (2) that the funding annuity is to be redeemed out of the resumption price.  In view of the fact that that is going to be done, the moneys so obtained should, as has been pointed out by Deputy Cosgrave, be paid to the local authorities as they belong to them. The ratepayers of the country have already paid these moneys, and as this is now an ascertained amount it ought to be set aside for that particular purpose and be paid back to the people who have already been mulcted in these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the redemption of funding annuities, it was not intended in 1933 that at some specific date the funding annuity would have been paid off <Col N="1658" /> by the tenant because the case then made by the Government was that they were funding the annuities for the reason that the tenants could not pay them.  What I am anxious to find out from the Minister is, will there be an apportionment of this money.  Will the amount that is due to the local authorities be set aside and sent on to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the local authorities did very well out of the arrangement that was made in 1933. They never had any hope of getting any of the arrears.  On Deputy Cosgrave's figure, the sum of over £550,000 has already been paid back since 1933 so that they have done pretty well.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with money, portion of which is due to certain people.  It is our duty to be just.  The apportionment of the amount that is due to the local authorities is a very simple matter, and this House should see that it is given to them.  This House has no right, in equity, to retain that money, and neither has the Exchequer nor the Guarantee Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the Minister's last answer was distinctly weak, to say the least of it.  The Minister's answer, in effect, was: &ldquo;We owe you a considerable amount of money; you have got back some of it and you ought to be very thankful.&rdquo;  Surely that would be a justification for paying no debt in full, if a creditor is to be thankful when he gets back portion of what is due to him.  It is a new principle of dishonesty that is coming into force.  That may not be the Minister's considered intention, but it certainly was a strange principle which he announced when he said &ldquo;You have got back portion of it and you ought to be very glad.&rdquo; That, I submit, is a very dangerous principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a very dangerous principle at all.  There are a lot of creditors in this country who would be very glad to get back <Col N="1659" /> something that they never expected to get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the local authorities should be very thankful for getting something that is due to them, and drew a comparison between them and other creditors. There are assets here to be divided. The local authority is a creditor, and has a right to get what it is entitled to out of the assets which, in this instance, is represented by the redemption price of the funding annuities. The Government are going to make a charge on the purchase money.  Portion of that belongs to the local authorities, and, on the comparison that the Minister has made about other creditors, the local authorities are surely entitled to get what belongs to them.  They have already paid these moneys.  The Government are getting them back now, and they should repay to the local authorities what belongs to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities have got back from the Minister for Finance very much more than what was collected under the funding annuities clause of the 1933 Act.  They have got back more than they expected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister does not appreciate the evil that is involved in a doctrine of this kind&mdash; that a Government will not discharge its debts.  I think that the Minister is not fair to himself or to the Government in laying down a principle such as that.  The sum involved here is not very big.  Every debtor is bound to discharge his obligations in full, if he is not insolvent.  This State is not insolvent, and for that reason it should discharge its obligations to the local authorities.  There should be an apportionment of these moneys, and the local authorities should be paid the <Col N="1660" /> amounts due to them.  I would appeal to the Minister to be fair in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at Section 9.  It has a more important bearing on this than the actual sum that the local authorities are going to get out of this. Under Section 9 it is provided that where the Land Commission have obtained possession of a holding on account of default in the payment of the purchase annuity charged on the holding, or have taken up a parcel of land from an allottee on account of default in the payment of interest, etc...  I want to direct the Minister's special attention to the term &ldquo;allottee&rdquo; in that section.  When land purchase was first introduced in this country it was a considerable concession to the people.  It was of great benefit to them generally.  In order to facilitate the financial provisions in the Land Purchase Acts, and to give extra security for the sums of money advanced by the State, the rates were made liable for any default that occurred.  That bargain was accepted and understood by practically everybody in the country.  In this measure the Minister contemplates the possibility of default on the part of allottees.  Steps are being taken to wipe out the possibility of chance on the part of a local authority getting back the money for which it has to accept responsibility in respect of land distribution.  In the first instance the liability in respect of local taxation moneys, plus the rates, was in respect of persons in occupation of land.  Now the State steps in and extends the list of persons in respect of whom the guarantee is given.  The guarantor was not asked or invited to give a guarantee.  It was imposed on him. Surely it is not to be thought unreasonable if we utter a word on behalf of the guarantor, because Section 9 points out to us that it is in contemplation that the guarantor is going to be called upon to give security in respect of people in whom the Minister has not absolute confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that section was not in, one could assume that the Land Commission was taking special precautions to <Col N="1661" /> ensure that the persons who would get land would not alone have something which would enable them to pay their rates but the annuities as well. The ratepayers generally are called upon to guarantee these individuals. They are not the selection of the ratepayers; they are the selection of the Land Commission and, being a human institution, in the exercise of its judgment and wisdom it may select people who will add on arrears, some year or other, and ultimately the Land Commission itself must take up that holding. There we have a case in which there is an expansion of the liability upon rates.  The Minister will admit that there was an interruption of the normal circumstances in which people <Col N="1662" /> undertook to pay these annuities and in which the rates guaranteed them. While a considerable sum has been paid, remember that the deductions that have been made by the Government since the 1903 Act are at least once and a half the sums that have been collected within the last three years, so that if the Government have given something they have taken more and, notwithstanding their generosity, they have insisted on the ratepayers being as generous and a half to them in the short space of three years as the British Government asked them to be in the course of something like 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain this section, because my interpretation of it is that it is a section which is not just to the person who would have to meet the liability which is incurred by reason of the premium <Col N="1663" /> on land bonds.  If the land bonds were at par I would not raise any particular objection to it, but as land bonds are now at a premium, I consider that those persons will suffer a loss, and I do not think it is fair that they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only applying to lands compulsorily acquired the same operations as would apply to lands that were voluntarily acquired.  This is exactly the same thing as happened in 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not more in it?  The 1927 circumstances and the circumstances of to-day are not comparable, and I hope that we are not going to have Ministers addressing themselves to that subject as if they were comparable.  The fact is that if we take the 4½ per cent. land bonds that are guaranteed by the British they are now standing at something like £10 premium per cent.  Does that mean, if lands are going to be compulsorily acquired from a man who was a land purchase tenant under the 1923 Act, that when it falls to wipe out the purchase annuity on his land he will be called upon to do it at £110 for every £100?  If that is so it is a manifest injustice to him.  It is too much of Pontius Pilate for the Government to come along and say it is no part of their business that when the purchase annuity in one of those cases comes to be wiped out the unfortunate man who has been in occupation for a great number of years is called upon to wipe it out at £110 for every £100 due.  If that is what it means I am amazed at the Minister standing over it.  In the first place, land was never cheaper in this country than it is at present.  I say that, whether the Minister thinks it is political criticism or not.  The security or stability of land owners was never at a lower ebb than it is to-day, and it is not fair to ask a man who undertook to pay interest on £100 a year to shoulder £110 for every £100 he undertook to repay.  I should like to hear whether the Minister stands over the section as it is drawn, or as I understand it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the Deputy is mistaken. As a matter of fact it will be advantageous to the vendor.  It allows <Col N="1664" /> the market value instead of the nominal value of the bonds, and will be advantageous to the vendor.  It will cut the other way.</P>

Those rents were fixed having relation to price.  The purchase was based upon those rents, which in turn, of course, had relation to price.  Now you are taking that land from those people to-day, and you are asking them to pay out of the purchase money you give them a sum of money to liquidate the debt due to the Land Commission, but you are not giving them a price based on the same conditions on which the Land Commission lent that money.

      <P>Possibly, I have not made myself clear.  What I am getting at is this: Could not the Minister put in some such words as &ldquo;provided that the bonds are not standing below par&rdquo;?  I think that if a man is being paid in land bonds, if those bonds are sold when they are above par with only enough cash to be taken to pay off the annuity, it is all right, but if they fall below par there will be a very heavy loss to him. In other words, he will be paid in depreciated land bonds, and my suggestion is that the Minister should put in some such words as &ldquo;provided land bonds are not standing below par.&rdquo; I am not saying that the land bonds are below par.  I am only saying that <Col N="1666" /> there should be some such provision to safeguard him in case the land bonds in which he would be paid were standing below par.</P>

      <P>I know, but I should like to safeguard the people against such a contingency as the land bonds falling below par.  Legislation cannot possibly keep up with the variations of stock exchange prices, of course, and I should like to have this safeguard for the individual farmer whose land is being acquired.  In that case, if the land bonds are above par, then the man gets the benefit; but if they are below par, then he will suffer a loss, and I want to safeguard him from having to suffer such a loss. Of course he is not having it both ways because, if the bonds are being sold in the open market, it is quite sufficient for the Government to get the money and they should not want to make any profit, whereas if the bonds fell below par, the Government would be making a profit by paying in depreciated stock.  Therefore I would ask the Minister to put in some such words as I have suggested.</P>

      <P>We were all congratulating ourselves upon having persuaded the Minister for Finance to agree to this proposal, seeing that it is conferring an immediate benefit on the people concerned, and I think that if the Deputy would postpone bidding the devil good-morrow till he meets him it would be better.  I do not believe, however, that the Minister for Finance would have agreed to this section being brought in if we had put in that other clause&mdash;for the moment, at any rate&mdash;and as far as we can see, in the immediate future this clause is going to benefit the people affected, and I think that is good enough.  If the time should come when they would be adversely affected, then we might consider what we would do.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will take note of this.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has said, there is no loss to the Ministry of Finance in this case.  Let us take a case in which a purchase annuity falls to be redeemed when below par.  Now the bond that will be issued in respect of the resale of that will also be below par.  It would be scarcely fair to put the man who is going out in a position of suffering loss and to confer a benefit on the person coming in.  The Land Commission lose nothing because they will issue bonds in respect of it.  If they had to transfer other bonds it would be different, but they are issuing bonds. I say that it would be hard on the man to expect him to accept depreciated currency, and I do not think the Minister for Finance could enter an objection to the proposal.</P>

As well as being able to give a grant to a migrant, we want this section to cover the expenditure which the Land Commission incurs on behalf of a migrant.  I explained the thing fully in my Second Reading speech.  I explained that we might want to till land for the incoming migrant if he were coming at a time of the year when it would be to his disadvantage if the land were not prepared for him, and also that we wanted legal authority to spend certain sums on his behalf by way of cutting turf and providing a meal for him on the day on which he arrived, and doing a few things like that generally.</P>

      <P>It does seem to me that the Land Commission are limited by the two sub-clauses (a) and (b) so far as I can read the section, and it seems to me that the putting in of these new words rather makes the section nonsensical.  The section sets out that the purposes for which a grant may be made are (a) the purchase by the migrant of provisions and fuel, etc., and (b) to assist him in the cultivation and development of his new holding, but there is to be a distinction drawn between a grant to a migrant and a grant for the benefit of a migrant, which means that the money is to be expended by the Land Commission.

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I should like to have drafted it in such a way as to prevent the Minister from spending any <Col N="1672" /> money at all for the purposes of this section.  This section, according to the Minister's statement in introducing the Bill, is designed primarily for the purpose of facilitating him in migrating colonies of Irish speakers from Irish-speaking districts to Meath and other Eastern counties.  The Minister knows perfectly well what my views are on the question of the migration of these types of people.  It appears to me to be a bad policy and bound to end in disaster.  It will be stopped by the Minister when he has succeeded in incurring such a huge expenditure that the Minister for Finance, or the Dáil, or the members of the Executive Council will not tolerate any further expenditure for such a purpose. Although the experiment was only begun, I think, in April, 1935, and these migrants have been subsidised at the rate of 30/- per week each since that date, they are already in arrear with the payment of their rates and Land Commission annuities.  Fifteen of them were before the District Justice at the Athboy District Court recently, and decrees were given against them, with a stay of, I think, a month.  It appears that others of them are in almost a similar position.</P>
      <P>Surely it is time the Minister examined this whole question of the migration of these types of people to the very best land in the country.  It was admitted in the evidence before the District Justice at Athboy that these people were planted on some of the very best land in County Meath, and the solicitor for the county council said it was admitted to be some of the very best land in Ireland.  Does the Minister reasonably expect people taken off the very poorest land in Connemara and transplanted to such land in County Meath to make a success of it, even with the assistance of the Government and their subsidies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure provides all sorts of grants for giving of facilities to these types of people.  If the Minister takes the trouble to look up the files of the Land Commission, he will find that experiments of this kind were tried by the Congested Districts Board very many years ago and that <Col N="1673" /> these experiments failed.  He will find the records of these experiments in the Land Commission, and, if he will take the time to read them, he will get an amount of valuable information which he will be able to apply to a very good purpose.  My object in proposing this amendment is to limit as far as possible the expenditure of money for this particular purpose.  I do feel that this money is money that is wasted.  This type of experiment can never hope to succeed because the ordinary human factors are against its success.  You cannot transplant people from the very poorest parts of the seaboard counties to a county like Meath, and expect them to make a success of the land there, and for that reason I move this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I think the Minister is endeavouring to provide homes for imbeciles on land rather than homes for farmers.  It is a shocking waste of public money, and I hope that the writers of all the anonymous correspondence that came to me recently when I referred to this colony in Meath will now take notice of the facts given by Deputy Roddy.  If they doubt Deputy Roddy's word, I hope they will read the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> for the last two or three weeks, and I hope that Deputy O'Reilly, who supported this policy in Meath, will contradict the facts stated by Deputy Roddy now, if he can.  These people have not paid their rates or their annuities.  They are being carted up to the best lands in Ireland and they are not working them.  I have heard that their youths are coming into Dublin looking for jobs and I do not blame them.  It cannot be otherwise while we have a certain policy being &ldquo;put-over&rdquo; on the country.  The people who have to put up the money to pay for all these subsidies cannot carry on on the land. If a man is worthy and fit to get land he will make good, but if he wants a subsidy to work a farm that he got for nothing, he should not get it.  There is no so-called ranch in Ireland that the Land Commission are dividing around which there are not good young men who are making a living by taking con-acre.  If that type of men get land they will not want a penny of subsidy. <Col N="1674" /> What is at the bottom of this?  It is not farmers the Minister wants to produce or &ldquo;a bold peasantry, a country's pride.&rdquo;  He wants to compensate political hacks for services rendered.  I asked for the name of places where land had been acquired by the Land Commission in County Dublin and I guaranteed that I would get good young men to work it as farmers, but I would not be given the information. What happened?  A few days afterwards a man was given 70 acres of land for £200.  He put it on the market later and made a couple of hundred pounds profit.  He was a political hack of the Minister for Finance.  There is no trouble in getting prospective farmers with a little capital to take any parcel of land that the Land Commission has to give away. I have every sympathy with the intention&mdash;the foolish intention, I always thought&mdash;of bringing up people from the Gaeltacht to establish a Gaelic colony in Meath or elsewhere but the Minister should remember that he is dealing with land as a business proposition and should not mix up sentimentality or misplaced patriotism with it.  If you are dealing with land deal with it and not with the propagation of ideals.  This country has not the resources to subsidise every parcel of land that it is proposed to deal with under the section, or to bring people up to have a look at land that they are going to get for nothing.  When I bought land no one paid me to look at it, although I was in as poor circumstances as any of the migrants from the west.  I had not a shilling in my pocket at the time.  I had just come out of jail, and there was no one to subsidise me.  Perhaps if there was I would have failed as these fellows will fail, when they are not able to pay their rates or annuities.  The section should be wiped out without having any tinkering with amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to have a check on the money when there is consultation between the Land Commission and the Department of Finance.  It is essential that money spent by the Land Commission should be checked by some authority, and the only body to do that is the Department of Finance. <Col N="1675" /> I am not aware of the amount of money that is going to be spent on each of the migrants.  If the policy of migrating these people is to be pursued that is all very well.  This is not the first hare which was put up in this country, so let us chase it and know the expense incurred in doing so.  As far as the Land Commission is concerned there is no check on the amount of money to be spent on individual migrants.  Surely the proper thing for the House to do is to see that there is control over what the Land Commission expends, and that in any particular allocation the Department of Finance will be consulted and asked for approval of the amount to be spent.  That is the issue involved in the amendment which, I think, is one the House should adopt.  A paragraph in the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which was before the House last week, pointed out that there was a conflict between the Department of Finance and the Land Commission about money that was spent, and it was suggested that in certain matters the Land Commission should consult the Department of Finance with regard to expenditure. It would be a wise provision to have here, so that there would be legislation whereby this House would have authority after voting money to see how it was spent.</P>

      <P>I am not talking of what authority there was for that statement.  I am making an effort to clear up the position, because there was a certain amount of justification for what these people did which did not appear in the newspapers.  The case against them was not gone on with, and the solicitor admitted in court that he did not think it advisable to pursue that line of argument.  Some people believe they were not entitled to the benefit of the agricultural grant, but the migrants believed they were. That is the reason they would not pay. Since then I am informed by the rate collector that they have all paid up. We must be honest about these things. I see their lands reasonably well tilled. They failed as far as sheep are concerned, but that was not their fault. They say there was negligence in other quarters, with which they had nothing to do.  As far as working of the land is concerned, it is reasonably well done. I think it is highly unfair to stigmatise in this way people who are working under difficulties.  I do not approve 100 per cent. of this particular scheme, but I am not going to have statements made about people who cannot defend themselves, when the real situation is as I stated, that they had made reasonably good in the situation in which they found themselves, and that they did <Col N="1677" /> not get the benefit of the agricultural grant this year or next year.  That benefit is worthy of consideration in Meath where valuations are extremely high.  As far as I know, they work reasonably well and make a good effort to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The landless men of Meath and Dublin are better off than the congests in Connemara, who have, perhaps, 13 or 14 in family.  I am sorry that it is impossible to relieve the whole situation in the West by this policy of migration but an effort is being made to do something towards relieving it.  I do not believe it is &ldquo;a mad policy,&rdquo; as Deputy Roddy calls it. I believe that in setting up these homes in Meath for people from Connemara we are not creating homes for imbeciles.  From what I saw of the way in which they are working, I think we are creating model farms in Meath that will set a headline for some of the people in Meath.  I do not believe it is money wasted.  I think it is money well spent.  I thought that when Deputy Roddy introduced this amendment, which would compel us to go to the Minister for Finance for approval for every fiddle-faddle on which the Land Commission may spend money, he was only trying to pull Deputy McMenamin's leg, to see if there was any amendment in the world he would not sign.  Deputy Roddy knows perfectly well that the Land Commission could not work on that basis.  We have got to have a certain amount of freedom and a certain amount of discretion. Of course, if he wants to tie up the work of the Land Commission, to bring it to a standstill, this is one way to help to do that, but if he or any member of his Party has any hope of ever again getting control of the Land Commission, I do not think he would like to see that amendment carried in regard to the work of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this amendment, we have discussed practically the whole policy embodied in the section and I hope that when we come to consider the section itself we shall not have a further discussion on it.  I think that there is no reason for this amendment. The Land Commission are operating <Col N="1679" /> a certain policy laid down by the Ministry and approved by the Dáil by the adoption of the Estimates last year.  That is a policy of migration. If they are to carry out migration from the West properly, they must have certain powers of expenditure.  They must be given certain grants to enable them to incur expenditure on behalf of these migrants.  I think that it would be unwise to limit the powers of the Land Commission in any way in regard to that.  Deputy Roddy must know perfectly well that the Land Commission are not over-generous in giving grants and that every penny they spend is subject to scrutiny at headquarters.  Their expenditure is also subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor-General and if there is any undue expenditure it will not go on for very long.  Their hands must be kept free.  If an inspector down in Athboy, who found that he had no butter or meat to supply an incoming migrant, had to send up to the Land Commission and ask them to obtain the consent of the Department for Finance for the necessary expenditure, the incoming migrant would be left very hungry for quite a time.  We want certain powers here so that when a migration scheme is being started, the people who are to be given land will be taken over the ground and shown the lands they are going to get, so that they will have no reason to &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; afterwards that they did not know where they were coming. We want also power to enable the inspectors to make the houses comfortable for them on their arrival after their long journey from the West.</P>

      <P>I should like to get some information from the Minister on this section as to how this policy has been working.  Certain colonists have been brought up to Meath.  As to whether they have been a complete success, as the Minister says, and are now operating a series of model farms, or whether they have been a complete failure, as Deputy Belton says, we do not know.  Deputy O'Reilly, who possibly is on the spot, seems to me at any rate to be very much on the side of Deputy Belton. <Col N="1680" /> He said that although he is on the side of the Minister, he is not 100 per cent. with him.  I must translate Deputy O'Reilly's &ldquo;not 100 per cent.&rdquo; into a positive 1 per cent. on the side of the Minister.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the policy of the Land Commission for the future, because we are really dealing with the future.  We want to know how much money this is likely to cost.  Is it the intention of the Land Commission to acquire large areas in Meath or similar counties and bring up a very considerable number of migrants, or is it the policy to watch how the present scheme is working before they develop it any further.</P>

You have 20 or 25 families in Athboy already and there will be another batch up to 100 coming in the coming winter.  I cannot give the Deputy exactly the amount of money which will be expended under this clause, but we can deal with the matter when the <Col N="1681" /> Estimates come along.

      <P>The Minister states that the Comptroller and Auditor-General will afford protection as regards the spending of this money.  He has no authority over the spending of money if there is a general clause inserted in regard to the expenditure.  I do not suggest that when an inspector goes down there and sees that a ton of turf is necessary, it should be necessary to obtain authority from the Department of Finance for that purchase.  But I think that, when a migrant is planted on a farm, the Land Commission should ascertain how much it will take to fence the land, build out-offices, provide fuel, and do all the other things that are necessary, include the total in one bill and ask authority for the spending of that money.  Nobody makes the ridiculous suggestion that it should be necessary to obtain the authority of the Department of Finance for the purchase of a ton of turf.</P>

Nobody with the experience that we had during nine or ten years, while in charge of Departments, and knowing how in season and out of season the Department of Finance butts in, could have any sympathy with a proposal to extend their powers and to permit them to put their noses into every action of a Government Department. While I have every sympathy with Deputy Roddy's aim, I have no sympathy with his amendment.  When you have a responsible body like the Land Commission, civil servants should not have to go to the Department of Finance with their hats in their hands every time they want to put through a transaction in the ordinary course of their duties.

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), page 5, line 6, to substitute the word &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;development.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to substitute the word &ldquo;seeding&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;development.&rdquo;  It would probably be easy to get a better word than &ldquo;seeding.&rdquo;  My object was primarily to limit the Minister's power in the expenditure of money under this paragraph. In the first paragraph the Minister proposes to provide food and light for the migrants.  Then he proceeds to cultivate and develop their land.  It seems to me that the process of development may go on for an indefinite period.  I want to fix a limit to that period.  It is true that, in paragraph (a), it is provided that the money may be spent either before the migrant is put into occupation or during 18 months subsequently.  It is, however, possible that the Minister will introduce another Bill in 12 months' time to amend and interpret this Bill.  That amending Bill may include a clause to extend the period for development to four or five years. In that way the period of development may continue for a very long time. My only object in substituting &ldquo;seeding&rdquo;<Col N="1683" /> for &ldquo;development&rdquo; is to put a definite limit to the Minister's power of expenditure for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>We have enough to discuss without discussing fancy ideas. We are asking the Dáil for power to make these grants in order to enable migrants to get on their feet.  As I said on Second Reading, we do not intend to go beyond that.  Once they are established, it is up to them to make a success of their holdings.  They are getting a valuable property, and, when they are firmly established, they should be able to make a success of it. I would not believe in spoon-feeding them when they are established. Until they are about 18 months installed, it may be necessary for the Land Commission to do certain things for them to put them in a position to work their lands properly.  We are not asking for power to spend one penny after that period of 18 months.</P>

In so far as they require the specified assistance immediately, the migrants will be entitled to it, but what we want to secure is that &ldquo;development&rdquo; will not take the form of draining and sub-soiling. That is their job as farmers. This word &ldquo;development&rdquo; is too wide. Development of a farm is a matter for the farmer.  I think the term should be restricted.</P>

      <P>Everything the Minister has said so far, in reply to these two amendments that I proposed, confirms what I did say when moving the first amendment.  The Minister now says that he wants to give these migrants a chance and put them on their feet. What has the Minister done?  What is he proposing to do?  He consolidated their lands.  He ploughed and sowed their tillage portions before the migrants were brought over.  In addition he gave them a subsidy of 30/- a week; he provided them with farm implements and stocked their lands. And already, after being only 12 months in occupation of these lands, these migrants are in arrears with their rates and with their annuities.  Then we have the Minister talking about giving these people an opportunity of getting on their feet.  What will be the position of these people in another 12 months?  Personally I am as interested as the Minister in this enterprise.  I have watched the enterprise very closely.  I am sorry that these unfortunate people have been placed in such a position by the mistaken policy on which the Minister for Lands has embarked.  What are the facts?  Everything was against the success of these people.  The present Minister is not to be blamed for it.  His predecessor it was who is responsible for this.  He acted on the advice of certain officials of the Land Commission, idealists if you like, or faddists if you like.  The present Minister is not in favour of the enterprise.  Judging by what he said on the Second Reading of this Bill, it <Col N="1685" /> is clear that he was not in favour of it. He is now placed in the position of defending a policy of which he is not in favour.  How is it possible to put these people on their feet in view of what has been already done?  When people find themselves at the end of the first year owing rates and land annuities and unable to pay them they become disheartened.  They lose initiative, and become indifferent about the cultivation of their holdings.  What does the Minister propose to do now to help them out of their difficulties? That is the situation with which he is faced.  On this particular section, I suggest to the Minister that he should face up to the position and tell us plainly if he finds that at the end of 12 months the circumstances remain as they are, he will abandon this scheme. I suggest that if it is not a success he should abandon it and adopt some other means of dealing with the problem of congestion.  Deputy Belton suggests that it would be better, from the standpoint of the State and of the Government, to give these holdings to good farmers' sons.  Either that or he should take up another policy and pursue it.  He should take up the larger holdings in the West of Ireland and migrate the occupiers of those farms to Meath.  That would leave the larger farms in the congested areas in the West of Ireland for division amongst congests.  It would be the means of enlarging the holdings of the congests in those areas.  If the policy of migration is to succeed at all, it is clear now that it can only be made a success by bringing out the larger holders in the congested areas and giving them holdings in Meath.</P>

I would guarantee that no matter how much land the Minister has to offer in Dublin or in the neighbourhood I would get plenty landless men who will want no subsidy, men who will be glad to take this land, men who will want no grant to build a house or out-offices or anything like that.  All they will want is to be given the land and they will go <Col N="1686" /> and work it and give a good account of themselves.</P>

I quite understand that there must be an enormous number of congests on the western seaboard. Possibly somebody in authority has to interview the applicants and arrange for their transference from the West to the lands available for them in the East.  In what way is this test made? Is it on the basis of good husbandry or good health or on the anxiety of the applicants to get on?  In what way are their capabilities ascertained?  Has the Department got any psychological test to apply so as to discover whether the individual would be likely to be a worthy migrant?  How do they arrive at the decision and by what test do they reach it?  I am sure the House would like to have answers to these questions.</P>

      <P>Deputy Roddy has raised certain objections to this policy of migration.  The former Minister for Lands started the policy.  He explained to the Dáil that he was starting an experiment in Athboy and that he would watch the results very carefully. I feel satisfied that that experiment was a success.  I know there was a certain amount of publicity given to the Athboy colony simply because they refused to pay their rates when they stated that they did not know that the rates were going to be as high as they turned out to be.  We took powers to spend certain money in putting these people on their feet for a period of 18 months.  When that period of 18 months is over these farmers must stand on their feet or they must fall in the same way as any other small holder in the country.  When land is divided it often happens that in the immediate locality there are allottees who are to get a portion of that land. These people get 25/- a week, or whatever is the wage given by the Land Commission for improvements on the estate divided up.  Instead of doing the improvements before these migrants from the West came into possession of the land, the Land Commission <Col N="1687" /> did a lot of the improvements afterwards.  These are improvements similar to the improvements that would have taken place where in a locality there has been provision for relief works, and the improvements which in other places take place before the sub-division of the land take place in this colony after the sub-division of the land, and when the migrant has been installed in his house.  I do not know whether there is very much more being spent in improvements on these holdings in Athboy, for instance, than there would be in new holdings created in other localities.  The people who have come over to the County Meath have been pretty well vetted by the Land Commission inspectors and by the local agricultural inspectors working under the Galway County Committee.  When all is said and done, the people migrated are, in the opinion of the Land Commission inspectors, deemed to be the sort of people who would make a success of their new holdings.</P>

It would be the job of the man who got the farm from the Land Commission to do that work himself.  Anybody who is used to working land knows how to make a drain or to subsoil land and public money should not be spent on that.  This land that is being divided is good arable land. All that has to be done is to plough it and turn it up and that is a thing that any man can do himself.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 7, after the word &ldquo;holding&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;providing that in all cases where possible the cultivation and seeding were done by the migrant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section provides that the Minister shall give a grant to these migrants for certain purposes and the amendment would prevent them from expecting that the Minister would cultivate and develop their holdings himself.  But it appears to me that according to the wording of the section, the migrant might engage labourers for the purpose of carrying out the cultivation and development of the holding and that he himself might procure other employment whilst the labourers are engaged, at the expense of the State, in cultivating and developing the holding.  There is nothing in the section to prevent a migrant employing one labourer, two labourers or even three labourers for that matter, to carry out the cultivation of his holding and at the same time he himself can engage in other more lucrative and profitable employment.  My only object in introducing the amendment is to prevent such a thing happening and ensure that the cultivation and development of the holding will be done by the migrant himself.</P>

      <P>The Minister is treating the matter in a rather flippant fashion. I mean the amendment seriously. As the section stands there is no obligation on the migrant to carry out the work himself.  The migrant can engage in other employment and employ labourers at the expense of the Land Commission to do the work which he himself, I have no doubt, is supposed to do.  I am sure that when the section was drafted it was contemplated that the cultivation and development should be carried out by the migrant but, as the section is drafted, it is certainly possible for the migrant to engage other labour for the purpose of doing the work that the Land Commission undoubtedly intended he should do himself.  Is the Minister going to look into the amendment between this and the Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), line 12, after the word &ldquo;expenses&rdquo; to add the figures &ldquo;£5&rdquo; and after the word &ldquo;expenses&rdquo;, line 15, to add the figures &ldquo;£5&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment should read &ldquo;not exceeding the sum of £5.&rdquo;  I propose the amendment for the purpose of preventing the Land Commission giving joy rides to colonies of migrants all over the available estates in the eastern counties.  As the sub-section is worded, a prospective migrant may be taken up several times to inspect different holdings, and there is no obligation on him to make a decision as to which holding he will take.  This may go on indefinitely at great expense to the Land Commission.  My sole object is to limit the power of the Land Commission in expending money for such a purpose to one or two visits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Perhaps the sum of £5 would be rather restrictive, but a migrant at least should not be shown a holding on more than two estates.  If there were an estate to be divided he should be taken up and shown a holding on that and, if he did not like it, he could be taken to another holding. But if he would not accept either of these, he should go without a holding. As the section is drafted a migrant could inspect a dozen estates.  It might be taken that the Land Commission would not tolerate such a thing but, as the section is drafted, it permits of that.</P>

The Land Commission are not out to spend any more than is necessary in this regard.  There is no use in attempting to limit them to a certain figure.  If there is a limit of £5, and it comes to £5 1s., they simply cannot carry out the transaction.  The Land Commission are not going to incur any undue expense in bringing a man up to County Meath two or three times.  If they make him a reasonable offer and he does not clinch it when he comes the first time, he has a very poor chance of being shown a second holding.  Anyway, if he did not accept the second holding, I think it would be foolish for the Land Commission to bring him up a third time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this House feels compelled to insert a section like this in a Land Bill I am afraid it does not offer any great prospect for the future prosperity of farming in this country. I think the Minister and the House ought to set themselves out to see that people shall not be put on the land in the belief that they are going to be spoon-fed and kept on the land whether they work it or not.  I do not think anybody in the House has expressed himself more forcibly than the Minister has upon the necessity of <Col N="1692" /> working the land.  During the passage of the 1933 Act he laid special stress upon the fact that people must be made to work their land, and, if they do not, that the Government must be in a position to take it off them.  Now, if that is so, I fail to reconcile it with a section of this sort.  We are now going to put people on the land, and we are making provision not only to till the land for them, but to cut their turf for them and to pay them 30/- a week as well.  I am not against this experiment which has been tried by the Government, but we have had some very conflicting views about it.  Those views were expressed in the House to-day We had the view expressed by the Minister himself that these people were working the land so well that they were now conducting model farms. Deputy O'Reilly said that certain reliefs, in the way of agricultural grants, did not apply to them last year. I asked for some explanation of that, but did not get it, and I am hoping that somebody will give it to me.  We had on the other side a statement made by Deputy Roddy, borne out by a newspaper report of court proceedings, which went to show that these people were not paying their rates.  If these people, who, according to the Minister, are running model farms and are being supported by the State to the extent of 30/- a week, are not able to pay their rates&mdash;well, it does not look well for the whole experiment.  I am entirely in sympathy with the movement to try to get these people on the land if we can possibly do it.  But they ought to be made understand that when they are given land they will have to work it.  We all know the position in which the farming community finds itself at the present time, and how hard people find it to make ends meet.  In view of the fact that the Minister is putting a provision of this kind in the Bill, it looks as if he feels that this scheme is not going to be a great success.  Under Section 9 the Minister is given power to take up land from allottees who are not able to pay their way.  Is that what he has in view?  Apparently it is.  I would advise the Minister to walk warily in <Col N="1693" /> this respect.  As I have said, these people, when they are given land, ought to be made understand that they will have to work it and make a living out of it.  They cannot expect the general body of the people to support them all their lives.</P>

This campaign against the migrants and the policy of the Government has been going on now for some time, and I think it is quite unfair, in view of the fact that America is closed to them.  This debate will make very interesting reading for the teeming thousands in places like Connemara to find that the chief Opposition Party in the State opposes a laudable scheme of this kind for their betterment. It is surely unfair to expect that people, such as the migrants, would be able to make good in one year.  It is strange, too, that objection should be taken to the subsidy which the Government have been able to give them in the first year.  As I have said, all this will make very interesting reading for the people of Connemara, and there are many thousands of them interested in this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O Briain that there is far too much complaint and too much mocking of this particular scheme.  I think it is only reasonable that the Government should try to work out something for these people in response to the appeals put forward by those interested not alone in the economic salvation of the west but in the Irish language, and that this scheme should be given a decent trial.  All that we are asking here is that the Land Commission should have power legally to give the scheme a decent chance.  I do not know whether it has been deliberate or not, but there has been a lot of misrepresentation with regard to the position of migrants in the County Meath because of the fact that they did not pay their rates.  They did not pay their rates because they thought that they were not legally bound to pay as much as was demanded from them. But since the court decision was given, I am informed that they have paid their rates.  They are like a lot of other people.  If they thought that <Col N="1695" /> their rates were not a legal debt on them and had a try-out to avoid paying an extra few pounds and if they thought they could get away with it, it would be all right.  Since they have found that their rates are a legal debt on them, they have paid them, and as far as I can see, they are as well fit to pay as anybody else.  Deputy Brennan said that I had described these farms as model farms.  I did not do that. I would not say that they are model farms to be visited by all the farmers in the country, but as far as the County Meath is concerned they are model farms, and if a lot of people around them would only work their farms as well as these people are working their holdings it would be a lot better for the country.  They are in a district that may be said to be devoted almost entirely to grazing.  I just had a glance at it.  I saw that they had their crops in and that they seemed to be doing their work well.  I think they will be a success, and there is no reason why the scheme should not be a success.</P>
      <P>I hope that the migrants in County Meath are not going to pay too much attention to all that goes on here across the floor of the House.  Deputy Roddy made a case against the migrants and had to make it in such a way that one would think we should be sorry for the migrants who have gone into these holdings.  There is no reason to be sorry for them.  They have come from very poor holdings in the West, and they have got from the Land Commission economic holdings on some of the best land in the country.  If, after 18 months or so, when they are put on their feet, they cannot make a success of it, then they should clear out.  After 18 months they will be in the same position as any other farmer or smallholder; they will have to pay all the ordinary outgoings out of the profits they derive from the farm.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9 practically run together, and, in the circumstances, I will move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) (a), lines 21 and 22, to delete the words &ldquo;unless the Land Commission otherwise orders&rdquo; and insert instead the words &ldquo;if the Judicial Commissioner considers it to be fair, just and equitable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has almost the opposite effect to what we have been debating for the last hour or so.  We have been debating the poverty of the migrants and the necessity for subsidising them by weekly payments and in other ways.  In the course of other debates attention has been called to their desperate circumstances and the difficulty they have in carrying on in their new holdings.  In this section the Minister, who is so anxious to lighten the burden of these unfortunate migrants, proposes to make them responsible for a liability that accrues in the case of the land they have left. If they are in the position that they cannot meet the liability on the land they actually hold, and if there is any truth in the statements that the migrants are in an impoverished condition, that they are facing great difficulties in their new undertakings, surely no case can be made for asking them to undertake a liability which their neighbours are not asked to undertake around the new colony?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to amend paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) to read:&mdash;&ldquo;...such funding annuity shall, if the Judicial Commissioner considers it to be fair, just and equitable...&rdquo;  I am there giving a loop-hole; I am giving the <Col N="1698" /> Land Commission some discretion in certain cases, but I am also giving the migrant some hope that his case will be considered by the Judicial Commissioner or some person who will weigh up the equity of the case.  It does not need a lengthy argument.  I think my case is proved by the debate on the previous amendment.  The Minister cannot advance any claim that these men are in a position to bear this added liability.  Everything points to the fact that they cannot bear their existing liability, not to talk of adding the liability that has accrued on land in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this amendment.  While I would endeavour to do everything, when placing these men on the land, to see that they were made work, yet when I put them there I want them to get every opportunity that can possibly be given to them so as to allow them to succeed.  I put down certain amendments with the intention that no loop-hole would be left whereby those people would have an inducement not to work hard.  I am anxious that they will get every chance and every inducement to work.  This amendment is put down for the purpose of seeing that no burden that would embarrass them is placed around their necks.  It may be said that this is admitting the principle of not discharging your obligations.  The Land Commission in another section propose to wipe off arrears where a holding is overcharged to an extent above its value &mdash;to wipe them off as irrecoverable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us remember that we take people from places where they are bred, born and reared, from their relations and from all those things so dear to them.  It is where people are happy and not where they are prosperous that really matters.  The important thing is where a person is happy, and it does not matter so much how poor the holding may be.  I do not want any handicap to be placed on these people that might tend to prevent them succeeding.  I do not see any reason why they should not succeed. There is a certain debt on this land, but the fact is that, not being able to make any profit out of the land, <Col N="1699" /> those people could not pay.  The Land Commission are taking certain powers in regard to holdings overcharged with debt.  I will ask the Minister not to burden these people by charging the new holdings with the arrears of the old ones.  I take it that when the annuity is fixed on these holdings, consideration is given to what the farm can produce and what the cost of the holding entails in the way of rent, rates and the maintenance of the family.  If you add on this burden I do not think you are doing a wise or a fair thing.  You are really obstructing these people in their efforts to make good in the new holdings.  We should put no brake on them.  Perhaps it was calculated, when fixing the rent of these holdings, that the arrears on the old holdings would be charged.  If that is not so, if the annuity is fixed on the basis of the productivity of the allotment, then I think it is not right to charge them with the arrears of rent from the old holdings.  The principle 60 or 70 years ago was that the rent was fixed on the capacity of a farm to pay rent, rates, and maintain a family.</P>
    <P>I do not see why the arrears from the old holdings in Connemara, Donegal or Kerry should be charged on this land.  I think these people will get it into their heads that the Government are imposing an unjust burden on them.  They will complain that the Government have taken them up on the pretence of doing something for them, and now they have to pay not only the outgoings on the new holdings but also the arrears on old holdings in Connemara that other men now occupy.  That is a bad feeling to give them.  It is psychologically bad.  The sum may not be very big, but it is bad to put that burden on them.  I understand that already some of those people complained that they were promised a whole lot by the Government and that the Government are not discharging what they promised.  Of course, perhaps those people think they were promised things that they were not promised at all.  Now when they find they are up against the hard facts of the situation they say: &ldquo;We have been let down&rdquo;.  That is bad <Col N="1700" /> enough, but to impose this new burden of arrears on them is a thing which I think should not be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrears must be paid by somebody.  I think that if we were leaving them, as they were heretofore, on the old holding, Deputy McMenamin could make a much stronger case for having that policy changed.  It is not usually the policy of the Land Commission to migrate people who have arrears on their holdings, but it is sometimes necessary for the relief of congestion to move a man on whose holding there are arrears.  If you move such a man I think it is only right that his arrears should follow him, and that the people who are coming in should not pay them.  It does not really amount to a whole lot either way, but the people who get new holdings out of the old holding of a migrant who has gone off to the east of the country have a sense of grievance if they have to pay off his arrears as well as the rent apportioned to them, or if in their annuity there is included any portion of his funding annuity.  I think the thing is perfectly all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The mere fact of transferring a man from one county to another, or even from one portion of a county to another portion of it, imposes a hardship on him.  He is transferred from land which he has been accustomed to manage and cultivate for a number of years.  He thoroughly understands the conditions relating to the cultivation and management of that particular holding.  He understands thoroughly the general conditions relating to the carrying on of his business there.  He is transferred, let us say, from County Galway to County Dublin or County Meath&mdash;to a completely different class of land, where the marketing conditions and the general conditions relating to the management of land are totally different.  That in itself is an initial hardship.  As the Minister knows from experience, it takes even the very best farmer, when he is transferred from one county to another, some years before he is able to cope with the changed conditions which he encounters.  The Minister knows perfectly well that even migrants taken from County Galway, let us say, in the years 1927 and 1928, are only gradually beginning to find their feet to-day. They understood perfectly the land which they left.  There was not a field in the farms they vacated which they did not know.  They knew how best to utilise those fields in order to get the utmost value out of them. When transferred to a new farm it takes years to understand the value of the land, and to learn how to manage it in such a way as to derive the best livelihood out of it.  As I say, that is an initial hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now the Land Commission shall exercise certain discretion as to whether the funding annuity is to be transferred to the new holding or not. The Minister made no reference a moment ago to the discretion which the Land Commission shall exercise in those cases.  How is that discretion to be used?  In what cases is it to be used?  Why discriminate against the tenant in one case and not in another case?  The sub-section says that unless the Land Commission otherwise orders <Col N="1702" /> such funding annuity shall be transferred to the new holding.  In the ordinary way the funding annuity shall be transferred to the new holding unless the Land Commission otherwise orders; in other words, the Land Commission exercises a certain discretion as to whether, in a particular case, the funding annuity will be transferred or otherwise.  It seems to me that this sub-section, if the Minister insists on leaving it in the Bill, should be amended so as to include the words &ldquo;fair, just and equitable&rdquo;.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who referred earlier this afternoon to the use of those words in the earlier land legislation, and it seems to me that in this sub-section the words should certainly be introduced for the purpose of giving the Land Commission even a wider discretion than they have taken in the sub-section.  I think this sub-section should be deleted altogether, and that the funding annuity should either be wiped out altogether at the discretion of the Land Commission or should be apportioned amongst the tenants who get the holding of land which the migrant relinquishes.  That would be a much fairer way than transferring this burden to the new holding.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, the migrant is handicapped by the fact that he is managing a new farm of land, under completely new conditions with which he is totally unacquainted.  At the very best, it will take him four or five years to become thoroughly acquainted with the nature of the new holding of land which he has got, and with the new conditions under which he has to carry on the management and cultivation of that land.  That is a very large initial handicap.  In addition to that, the funding annuity is to be transferred to the new holding.  If he was not able to meet those funded arrears when he was managing his farm under better and more suitable conditions, is it likely that he will be able to pay that funding annuity under conditions wholly new to him, and on land with which he is altogether unacquainted?</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister how the Land Commission is to exercise the discretion referred to in this sub-section.  In what type of case is the discretion to be exercised? <Col N="1703" /> Under what circumstances is that discretion to be exercised?  Why discriminate as between one case and another?  I should like to hear the Minister make a case for that.  At all events I should like him to give me an example of the type of case where that discretion will be exercised. If it is to be exercised in one case why not in another case? This section as I understand it, is to apply not only to migrants taken from the Irish-speaking areas, but to every class of migrant.  It would certainly impose a much greater hardship on the larger type of migrant than it would in the case of the colonies of migrants taken from the poorer areas, let us say, to the eastern counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if this particular section is necessary at all?  I never understood that there was a hard and fast formula for the Land Commission in fixing annuities.  I always understood that, as far as migrants were concerned, the annuity on their new holding was fixed on the basis of what they left after them.  If a migrant is changed from a holding which carries a funding annuity, it depreciates to that extent the holding which he has left after him.  The Land Commission, as far as I understand it at any rate, have always taken into consideration all the factors in connection with the old holding which was vacated.  Consequently the thing appears to me to be totally unnecessary; the Land Commission would fix what they thought was a reasonable annuity and they would fix it on the basis of whatever was the value of the holding vacated.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £10,000 chun íochta an Mhuirir <Col N="1704" /> a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníochta i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1937, mar chúiteamh don <i>National Greyhound Racing Company, Ltd.</i></P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £10,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1937, for compensation to the National Greyhound Racing Company, Ltd.</P>
    <P>In moving the Vote, Sir, it may be desirable that I should briefly explain to the House the circumstances in which it is necessary to ask the Dáil to grant this sum.  It will be noted that, according to the face of the Estimate, the amount is required to pay compensation in pursuance of a court order, but I should explain that the sum covered by the Estimate was agreed upon as full and final settlement of an action which was taken against the Minister for Finance.  The £10,000 includes the costs incurred by the plaintiffs in this action, and I may say that the judge who heard the case stated that he considered that the Minister had met the plaintiffs very fairly.  The matter was a rather complicated one&mdash;complicated by the fact that, while it was felt on strictly legal grounds that the claims of the plaintiffs in this action could have been successfully resisted upon the technicalities of the case, it was felt at the same time that the company were entitled on equitable grounds to some measure of compensation.</P>
    <P>This matter arose out of an application for a totalisator licence made to the Minister for Finance on the 25th April, 1931.  After a certain amount of correspondence and a number of interviews in connection with the matter the then Minister directed that a letter should issue to the company stating that the Minister was prepared to grant a totalisator licence, subject to certain conditions. This letter was issued on the 7th December, 1931.  While the conditions set out in the letter were never fully accepted by the applicants for the licence, nevertheless they entered into contracts for the supply and <Col N="1705" /> erection of an automatic electric totalisator on the strength of the promise contained in the letter.  Later on, however, a dispute arose between certain parties and the company to whom this letter was addressed, and the then Minister had a message conveyed to the company that he would not grant a totalisator licence until the dispute to which I have referred had been satisfactorily settled.</P>
    <P>This was the position as it stood when the present Government took office, and as there were some doubts in my mind as to whether, on broad grounds of public policy, it was desirable that such a totalisator licence should be granted, it was decided not to grant any licence for greyhound racing tracks until the whole matter had been reported on by a Committee of Inquiry.  This Committee of Inquiry was appointed on the 20th April, 1932, and it had the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To inquire into and report to the Minister for Finance as to whether, in the opinion of the Committee, it would be desirable in the public interest to grant licences to set up and maintain totalisators as defined by the Totalisator Act, 1929, in connection with greyhound racing tracks, and to advise the Minister as to the person or persons to whom such licences should be granted and the conditions, if any, which should be attached to such licence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And further:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To inquire as to the precise nature of the arrangement made by the Minister for Finance of the late Government with the National Greyhound Racing Company, Ltd., and the Sports Association, Ltd., and as to whether any expense and, if so, the amount thereof, has been incurred by these companies or either of them by reason of any such arrangement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Committee heard evidence from all the parties interested, and it presented its report on the 19th July, 1932. The Committee reported, by a majority, that they had come to the conclusion that it was not desirable in <Col N="1706" /> the public interest to grant licences to set up and maintain totalisators in greyhound racing tracks in the Irish Free State.  Two members of the Committee, however, dissented, as I have indicated, from this proposal.</P>
    <P>As regards the precise nature of the arrangement made by the then Minister for Finance with the company, the Committee were satisfied that the promise was made to grant a totalisator licence to the company on certain conditions.  They considered it clear, however, that at no stage was there a complete acceptance by the company of all the conditions which the Minister sought to attach to the grant of the licence.  The Committee felt it proper to state, however, that in their opinion the company acted throughout in perfect good faith and in the belief that they would obtain the licence they were seeking.  The Committee also reported that, in their view, the company, acting on the strength of the promise made by the then Minister for Finance to grant a totalisator licence, had incurred a certain amount of expenditure, and, therefore, that their case merited special consideration.</P>
    <P>They further reported that the National Greyhound Racing Company, by reason of the arrangement which they understood the then Minister for Finance would be prepared to enter into, had incurred, up to the 26th March, 1932, a total expenditure of £10,169 19s. odd.  They further pointed out that the expenditure was still being incurred owing to the payment of interest charges and to the employment of some people to look after and take care of the totalisator machine.</P>
    <P>The position with which the Government was faced was, naturally, one of great difficulty.  On the one hand, they had a virtual undertaking on the part of my predecessor to grant a totalisator licence.  The fact remained, however, that owing to developments which took place immediately before he relinquished office, the totalisator licence was not signed, and the responsibility then fell upon me of approving the policy of my predecessor in regard to this whole question of <Col N="1707" /> issuing totalisator licences for greyhound racing tracks.</P>
    <P>Those who are familiar with the various aspects of this rather complicated problem will know that that was not an easy matter of public policy to decide, and, to assist me in that connection, I appointed a commission of inquiry, which, by a majority, recommended that it was not in the public interest that such totalisator licences should be granted.  I felt it was not possible for me to ignore the report of the commission which had been appointed in the circumstances I have related, and that, accordingly, it would not be right for me to grant a totalisator licence, particularly to a proprietary concern.  On the other hand, it was clear that the applicants for this licence, the undertakers in this matter, had entered into certain commitments in good faith, and it was difficult for me to assess in my own mind how much of the total expenditure of £10,169/19/5 which they had undertaken was in all the circumstances fully justifiable.  The matter then lay at issue between us until it was resolved by the applicants deciding to go to the court, and there an amicable settlement was made which, I think, has done substantial justice to the applicants, while, at the same time, honouring in full the report of the commission of inquiry.  It is in these circumstances I am moving this Vote and I hope the Dáil will accept it.</P>

      <P>This is a compromise of an action brought <Col N="1708" /> against the Minister by which this very substantial sum of money is to be voted by this House.  The reason the Minister asks us to vote this sum of money is that he obviously had not a defence to the action brought against him.  Otherwise, I take it, he would not have compromised, and there must have been, therefore, a bargain which was considered by the law officers as being a binding bargain.  Otherwise, I take it, if he was going to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, he would not have waited until the actual trial of the action came on.  We have, therefore, this position, that an action is brought against the Minister to which the Minister has no answer because he has reversed a decision which was in fact a binding contract entered into by his predecessor.  I am perfectly ready and willing to admit that, under tremendous force of circumstances, a continuity between different Governments need not be kept up, but it does seem to me to be quite wrong that the mere change of the personnel of a Government should mean such a complete change of policy that binding contracts entered into by one Minister will not be accepted by a succeeding Minister. There should always be a certain amount of continuity between one Government and the Government which succeeds it.  Quick reversals of policy will shake the confidence of persons who are dealing with Departments of State or with the heads of Departments of State.  If one Government will not honour the obligations of the preceding Government, and the contracts that have been entered into, people who are entering into contracts with a Government will have no confidence and, as I say, in my judgment, at any rate, it is only when there are overwhelming reasons for adopting that course that that course should be adopted.  It is a highly undesirable course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get a bit farther, and let me assume that there was not a completely binding agreement.  If there was such a course of conduct pursued by the Department of Finance under one head as to lead people into expenditure, it should be carried out, unless there are overwhelming reasons for not carrying <Col N="1709" /> it out.  Now, what are the reasons which the Minister has put forward? Just none at all.  He has told us that he got a report from a committee, and that that committee, by a majority, advised against the granting of the licence.  I do not know the number of persons who were on the committee, but I rather gather from the Minister that the majority was a majority of one, and that, anyhow, there were two persons who differed.  The House is not given the reasons, and I personally would very much like to know why it is not in the public interest that a totalisator should be on a greyhound track.  There may be very strong reasons, but I should like to know what they are.  I do not at all subscribe to the opinion that if a Departmental committee is set up, this House is bound by its decisions or its report, and that we are not even to be given the reasons upon which that Departmental committee arrived at its conclusions, but are just to be told that they came to the conclusion that it was against the public interest. What were the grounds upon which they came to that conclusion?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I correct the Deputy, and point out that it was not a Departmental committee.  It was a public Committee of Inquiry, which sat in public and heard evidence; the evidence was reported in the Press; the report was published and circulated to the House, and all the reasons are in that report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>We come to to this House and we have the Minister addressing the House.  The Minister's argument is that the committee reported, and because the majority of that committee came to a conclusion, his job is finished.  He is not going to put forward their arguments, and he does not mention whether their arguments were sound or unsound. The Minister's statement is: &ldquo;Having had a report from a majority of the committee, I acted as I did.&rdquo;  What were the reasons?  How is this totalisator on a greyhound track, which is allowed on a racecourse, so obviously and so greatly against the public interest that an entire course of conduct shall be completely <Col N="1710" /> reversed?  It seems to me that the Minister's opening statement has been entirely too bald, and that he should not come to this House and merely say: &ldquo;The committee has reported; you have the report of that committee, and that is quite sufficient.&rdquo;  The House has to use its own judgment, and is not bound by the report of any committee.  The arguments of the committee should be weighed on the merits.  I sincerely hope that for the future the Minister will adopt a very much different course of action, and if any cases arise will see that there is a continuity, and not an abrupt departure in the policy of the Department, and that when he comes to this House to defend a course of conduct, or to ask it to vote a very substantial sum of public money, which a reversal of policy cost the ratepayers, he will come forward with a more drastic reason than the mere statement that a majority of the committee advised he should take the course of action that has been taken.</P>

      <P>I should perhaps begin by again pointing out that the committee which was appointed by me was not a Departmental committee.  It was a public Committee of Inquiry, presided over by senior counsel, and included in its personnel experienced public servants, accountants, and men of standing generally in the State, who had some practical experience of all these matters which were referred to.</P>

      <P>Evidence was tendered on behalf of the National Greyhound Racing Association by Mr. J.D. Woods, by Professor Dunne, by Mr. Patrick Gallagher, by the secretary of the Irish Coursing Club, by the secretary and a director of Dublin Sports and Greyhound Association, and by people representing various turf accountants' associations, by architects, clergymen and others, and practically all the parties giving evidence before the committee were represented by counsel.  That committee heard <Col N="1711" /> evidence at length, and after very careful consideration of it, and backing up their view by very cogent arguments, reported</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that having carefully considered all the relevant factors we feel that the social and ethical considerations already referred to, far outweigh the economic advantages which it is claimed would follow the installation of the totalisator on greyhound racing tracks, and we have, accordingly, come to the conclusion that it is not desirable in the public interest to grant licences to set up and maintain such totalisators in the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I contend that I was free to adopt the report of that Committee of Inquiry if I felt the conclusions to which it had come were sound.  I was free, because my predecessor left me entirely free. I may say that this licence was ready for the signature of the Minister for Finance some time before I took office. If the question of public policy, which was involved in the issue of the licence, had been decided by my predecessor, and if he had granted that licence, I should have honoured it, but when the responsibility of granting the licence fell to me, I was quite entitled, since I should have had to come to the Dáil to defend that licence, to consider the whole matter afresh, and consider the whole matter afresh I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say in connection with this matter that we had a very sound defence to this action, so sound that when the settlement was submitted to the court, the judge who heard the case stated that he thought we had met the plaintiffs very fairly, and that in view of the terms of the report the settlement was not unwarranted.  I think that is a complete justification for the action which we have taken.  There was no binding contract.  At the last moment certain conditions were sought to be enforced by my predecessor upon the applicants for this licence. They did not see fit to accept them.  The two parties were not, I think, <i>ad idem,</i> and if we had fought the case I am certain&mdash;at least I am reasonably assured&mdash;we would have a fair chance of success.  But that <Col N="1712" /> would not have settled the matter, because it was quite clear the applicants' commitments had been entered into by reason of the tentative undertaking which was given by my predecessor, and I desire, in accordance with the principle which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has laid down, since commitments were so assumed that we should, to the extent which it may be possible in the changed circumstances, honour them.  The Committee of Inquiry which was appointed to investigate the whole matter recommended that it would not be in the public interest to grant these totalisator licences, but, on the other hand, there was some provisional undertaking on the part of my predecessor to grant them, an undertaking which it was within his power, before we came into office, to implement, but which he failed to do.  Therefore, the responsibility falling upon me, and the committee having reported that it was not in the public interest that a licence of this sort should be granted, I think I am quite within my rights in not granting it.  But adverting to the statement in the other portion of the committee's report, that the applicants for this licence were entitled to special consideration, I am meeting them fairly and reasonably, to the extent of recouping almost 100 per cent. the expenditure which they undertook.</P>

      <P>I have asked a question.  If you say it is not relevant, I shall submit to your ruling.  I think it is a relevant question and it has been the practice to have such questions answered.  Did the Minister get legal advice as to the prospects of the case?</P>

      <P>It is not a question of what legal advice I got that is relevant in this matter.  The question is whether I am entitled to honour or to implement a report of the Committee of Inquiry which did report that the total amount expended by the original applicants for a totalisator licence was £10,691.  We have settled the case for £10,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the situation is this.  The Minister is throwing away £10,000 of public money.  We want to know whether the words &ldquo;throwing away&rdquo; are properly applied there.  If the Minister got legal advice that he could win, he ought to justify his giving in to the demand with much more detail.  The Minister has told us <Col N="1714" /> that he had a good case.  That is futile. The Minister need not think that he is being insulted by my saying that.  The Minister could have no conception of the prospects.  This is a legal matter. Was he guided by legal advice, and what advice?</P>

      <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the statute would have supported my action in refusing a totalisator licence.  The fact of the matter is that we had to pay this £10,000 because our predecessors provisionally undertook to grant a licence which a Committee of Inquiry found it would not be in the public interest to grant.</P>

      <P>Yes, for bringing forward proposals for taxation, but the lay Minister has never arrogated to himself the right to pass his lay judgment on matters of this kind.  That is the only basis for the paying out of this £10,000 of the taxpayers' money. We want to know this.  The Minister went so far as to brief quite a number of eminent people.  He must have had consultations with them.  He must have got advice from them.  The case <Col N="1715" /> was carried on until the morning of the court hearing and it was then compromised on the basis of paying out £10,000.  We want to know what was the legal advice given as to the prospects of the action and why the action was carried so far.  The Minister has <Col N="1716" /> told us that there were reasonable grounds for believing that he would win.  He would not back that with his money but £10,000 of the taxpayers' money is being paid out here.  This was a gamble.  We shall have a division on that explanation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have carefully gone through this Bill, and I do not find <Col N="1717" /> that, any more than its predecessors, it deals with the position created in years gone by in any equitable manner or that it metes out justice to those civil servants who took the side of Ireland at a critical time in our history. When the Treaty came, the British Government took care to protect in the Treaty those civil servants who held on to their positions and were loyal to the old régime.  Protection was given to them if they remained on, and they were accorded rights that even the Free State Government could not take from them.  If they retired, they were to have the advantage of a certain number of added years.  If it could be shown that their position was being worsened, they could apply for still better conditions on retirement. The least our Government could have done was to have seen that Irish civil servants who took the side of Ireland in that period would be given similar treatment.  Even now, perhaps, it is not too late to remedy the injustice that was then permitted.  These victimised civil servants should get from our Government at least as good terms as were given by the British Government to those who were considered loyal to the British régime.  That was not done at that time, it has not been done since, and it is not proposed to be done by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can speak with authority on behalf of those civil servants to whom I refer.  When the Treaty came, these victimised civil servants came together and formed an association.  They asked for an interview with the then head of the Provisional Government, the late General Collins.  He gave that interview.  A deputation of three from the victimised civil servants' association waited on General Collins in the City Hall.  That deputation consisted of Mr. Dowling, who had been dismissed from the Registrar-General's office in 1918; Mr. P.S. O'Hegarty, the present Secretary of the G.P.O., and myself.  On behalf of the victimised civil servants, we put up certain proposals.  Briefly, they were that, from the time of our dismissal up to that date, we should get our back pay; that we should get compulsory retirement terms as good as those given in the Treaty to those civil servants <Col N="1718" /> who were not disturbed, or that we should have the option of reinstatement with the rank and emoluments we would have attained if we had not been disturbed.  General Collins promised us those terms, with the proviso that, in the case of any victimised civil servant who had got financial help from public funds, the amount, when ascertained, should be deducted from the back money when ascertained. That proviso was at once accepted. That agreement with General Collins has never been honoured.</P>
    <P>As I read this Bill it is not proposed to honour that undertaking now.  It is not proposed to give even-handed justice to Irish civil servants who then took the part of Ireland; it is not proposed to give them equal treatment with those who remained loyal to the British and worked the British régime here while we had to walk the streets of Dublin, perhaps without a bob in our pockets.  We are grateful now after having gone through these privations. We are grateful we do not owe any gratitude to the Government, past or present, for any position we are in. But we are still grateful that we are not now paupers knocking at the workhouse doors.  At the same time I say this&mdash;and I am speaking with the full authority of all those victimised civil servants&mdash;that we demand of this Government at least as good treatment as those civil servants, who were not disturbed, got from the British Government.  I think the Irish people would endorse that and say that that treatment should be granted.  I remember after the rising in 1916 when the National Aid Fund and the Prisoners' Dependents' Fund were set up here to help the victims and the dependents of those who were killed or executed as a result of the insurrection that the Irish people in a few months, at home and over the water, subscribed £150,000 to help the victims.  That showed how the heart of the Irish people at home and abroad was beating.  I am sure those who so generously contributed to help the people who suffered in the national effort in 1916 will be surprised to hear that up to this justice has not been done to those who took the side of Ireland from 1916 onwards.</P>
    <P>I hope before this Bill leaves the <Col N="1719" /> House the Minister will see that justice will be done both to civil servants who got reinstatement and to ex-civil servants who did not get reinstatement, and that their claims will be met.  I hope they will have this justice, not as charity, not as a concession but as a right at least equal to the rights other civil servants have under the Treaty.  These latter successfully defended their rights in the courts against our own Government.</P>
    <P>I am putting this forward as a national question and I hope it will be treated by the Minister for Finance as a national question.  It is not a political question in any sense of the word. I am quite hopeful that the Minister and his colleagues, however their outlook in politics may differ from ours, will give full justice to those who suffered in the national struggle. Those sufferers are claiming those rights not as a privilege.  They are claiming equal rights with their colleagues in the Civil Service who did not give assistance in the national effort but who got these rights under the Treaty.  As I read the Bill, full justice has not been done to those victimised civil servants.  I have studied every section of the Bill to see how those victimised civil servants can be put into as good a position as if they had not been victimised.  I can see no such provision in the Bill.  I will be glad if the Minister or anybody else with authority to speak on it will show me that such provision is there. Nobody would be more pleased than I to see that such provision is in it for these men.  At this stage I warn the Government that that is the view I and others have&mdash;that is the view of those who have authority and right to speak for victimised civil servants.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I can say that those who have suffered privation and want, as I know many of them have, are prepared to let that go.  But at this stage when an attempt is being made to give equitable treatment and to place those people back in their rights I hope they will get their full rights and not nominal rights.  I hope that the right will be there as an absolute right, a right that can be claimed in law and that will not be at the discretion <Col N="1720" /> of any individual to give or withhold from them.  In other words, that they will be placed in a position at least as well secured as the civil servants of the British régime who were transferred over subsequent to the Treaty of 1921.  I hope there will not be any condition precedent to the getting of the full benefit of these rights.  I remember in 1922 that a half-dozen of these ex-civil servants reluctantly decided that they would have to take reinstatement because owing to the then disturbed state of the country they were not able to make a living out of their business.  I remember on one occasion our pooling our resources in order to help those people to make a struggle to get over their difficulties. It is a sad comment on the freedom we have won that these people have been left there with their claims unattended to and that justice has not been meted out to them for 14 years. I hope now the Minister will face up to the task as an Irish Minister for Finance and not in any Party spirit. I know this Bill is an attempt to face up to what should be put right long ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will have noticed, I put down two amendments to cover these people to whom Deputy Kelly was going to refer.  The facts of the case are quite simple.  I am not going to deal with the provision that is made for other people who are loyal or disloyal.  I shall merely put the facts of this case before the House and ask the House to support the claim.  These men engaged in the Ordnance Survey were taken on as young men, the conditions of their engagement being that they would be employed for a probationary period of 15 years.  At the end of that time, if they were passed as being medically fit, they were to be made permanent civil servants, and 7½ years of the 15 years that they had served were to be calculated for pension purposes.  In 1916, during the European War, the Ordnance Survey in this country was controlled by the Royal Engineers section of the British Army, who insisted that these men should join the Army. A number of these men refused.  I am not going to make any comment on that.  The fact is that they refused to join up and were dismissed.  After their dismissal a sum of £28 was sent to each of them, without their being asked whether they would take it or not or being told what it was for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These men were reinstated under the <Col N="1722" /> 1923 Superannuation Act as from 1916, from which date their probationary period was to run.  That probationary period expired in 1931, and 7½ years of that were to be calculated for pension purposes, although some of them had served about 30 years.  I consider that an injustice was done to that body of men.  I am not going to refer to the action that they took on behalf of this country.  It is a mere question of justice to citizens.  These men went into the employment of the State; this State was then part of the United Kingdom, and we took over all the liabilities, rights and duties appurtenant thereto.  These men refused to do something which they considered would be unnational on their part as citizens.  I think the majority of the Irish people would agree that they were right in that.  It is the duty of the State, therefore, to see that these men are not penalised.  Take a man who had 15 years' service in 1916.  He is probably getting on to 60 years of age now, with a wife and family, and in a few years he will be retiring.  He will only have roughly 14 or 15 years' service which will be counted for pensionable purposes, although he had probably served about 40 years.  I consider that that is unjust and that these men were unfairly treated.  It is all right to talk about economy, but the view I take is that, if a man is engaged in any employment, he should get good conditions of employment, be well paid, and get the full perquisites arising from his original contract.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance between the time he entered this House in 1927 and the time he took office raised this question&mdash;I am informed that he did.  He is well acquainted with the facts of the case.  I do not know the number of men concerned, but the number is very small.  In my opinion, they have been unfairly treated.  It is only a question of giving them their pension rights from 1916, adding on the seven and a half years, provided they had 15 years' service then, or whatever portion of their service prior to 1916 should be calculated for pension purposes.  These men were paid 36/- per week.  They were formerly employed under the Royal <Col N="1723" /> Engineers.  Their work was measured up every morning and, if they had not done the work they were ordered to do, 3d. per day or 1/6 per week was deducted from that 36/-.  That may seem a small sum to many people, but a deduction of 1/6 from the wages of a man with only 36/- a week is a serious matter.  These Ordnance Survey men are doing highly technical work, on which the whole ownership of land depends, for 36/- a week.  They have been denied a substantial part of their pension rights.  This Ordnance Survey work is very important work.  The men have to go out at 8 o'clock in the morning and work until 5 p.m. and next morning have to hand in a report of the work done on the previous day. If they had not done what was expected of them, as I say, a deduction was made of 3d. per day or 1/6 per week off their wages.  A man with a wife and family accepted that wage of 36/- because at the end of his service he was to be entitled to a pension.  I think that restitution should be made to these men under this Bill, and that they should be given credit for the period they served prior to 1916.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always believed that it was the duty of whatever Government was set up by the people of the country since 1922, whether the last Government or the present Government, to redeem the promises and the pledges given by the Sinn Féin Party or the Republican Party previous to the Treaty.  On many occasions the members of this Party have raised in this House the failure of the last Government to redeem such promises.  We had every reason to hope, however, from the promises made by the present Government when in opposition, that they at least would redeem any pledges they made to the people who made sacrifices previous to the Treaty.  I consider that the Ordnance Survey people have been very unfairly and unjustly treated. It is not for me to argue in detail in favour of what they are entitled to, because I know that the Minister for Finance is fully conversant with the position of the men concerned, and he should here and now give reasons, if he can give any justifiable reasons, for <Col N="1724" /> refusing to treat these people in the way they are entitled to be treated for pension purposes.  The Minister, I am informed, has been furnished with the full facts regarding the position of the individuals who claim that they have a grievance, and I think we are entitled, before voting on the Money Resolution, to hear from him the reasons why he declines to meet their reasonable demands.</P>
      <P>The Schedule to this Bill contains a list of eight names of persons who, in my opinion, are going to be given very generous gratuities if the Bill passes in its present form.  Now, I do not know what right they have to any exceptional treatment or what grounds can be given in support of the refusal of the Minister to treat Ordnance Survey people at least as generously as others have been treated.  If that is done it will not cost the taxpayers one-third of what it is going to cost them in the case of the eight people referred to in the Schedule.  I do not care whether the promises or pledges made on behalf of Sinn Féin previous to the Treaty were made by the late Cathal Brugha or the late General Collins, but it is the duty of the republican Minister for Finance&mdash;and the present Minister boasts that he is the only republican Minister for Finance that we have ever had&mdash;it is his duty if he has any justification to that title to redeem the pledges given either by the late General Collins or the late Cathal Brugha.</P>

      <P>I have not before me the words of the pledge that was given by General Collins on the one hand or by <Col N="1725" /> the late Cathal Brugha on the other. I would like if the Minister for Finance would give to the House the pledge that was given by any person in justification for the generous gratuities that are being given to the eight people named in the Schedule to this Bill.  I put that as a problem to the Minister. I am sure that he has all the information necessary to support his own case or to check any quotation that I might give from memory.  I am not going to quote from memory what was said by any man who has since died.  I did quote cases in the House on previous occasions.  They were quoted from all parts of the House, and quoted, I believe, by the Minister himself when he sat on the Opposition benches.  At any rate, I would ask the Minister, in fairness to the people in the Ordnance Survey who feel that they have a grievance, to give justifiable reasons as to why he is not prepared to meet their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give now the case of an old civil servant who at the present time is in a home in the City of Dublin.  He gave valuable and faithful service to the British Government and to the Governments here which succeeded it. He is a man who had 38 years' service. He got a miserably small amount as a gratuity six months after he was fired out of the service of this Government, while in the Schedule to this Bill the Government are proposing to give gratuities to the tune of £300 to people who did not give one-twelfth of his service.  I am not going to mention the name of that individual, but I know that his case has been before the Minister for Finance.  There is a big file in the Minister's Department supporting the claim for a pension or a more generous gratuity than that given to him by the present Government. Because of his circumstances he is at the moment in a home on the south side of the city.  Before he was put into that home, I am aware that a number of civil servants subscribed a shilling a week in order to maintain him in decency and comfort.  Where is the justification for giving generous gratuities to people with one, two or three years' service and refusing to give anything further to a man who gave 38 <Col N="1726" /> years of faithful service.  There are high officials in the Department of Finance who will admit that that man gave faithful service to the British Government and to the Governments, including the present one which succeeded it.  Let us have quotations from any dead or living person in justification of the generous gratuities that are going to be given to the people named on the Schedule to the Bill.  If a case can be made for turning down the reasonable claim made on behalf of the Ordnance Survey staffs, then let it be made in this House.</P>

      <P>As regards the Ordnance Survey staff, I am not putting the case for them on promises that were made by General Collins or by Cathal Brugha or by anybody else. I am putting their case to the Minister as a matter of justice.  The fact that these men were established as from 1916 is an admission that they have a claim to just treatment.  Since they were re-established after 1916, how can the Government, in justice, discount the years of service that they had given previously?  In justice, I say, that cannot be done.  Therefore, the Government should do justice to these officials.  It is a cruel thing to treat men in the way that these men have been treated.  They joined the service with a small salary in the expectation that in their old age they would have substantial pension rights. When they entered the service they calculated the amount of pension that, in the normal course, they would have at the date of their retirement.  It was on that understanding they entered, and it would be a bad thing if there was any departure from it.  I do not think that the case of these men should be bandied across the floor of the House. I am basing the case for them on the principles of justice and right, and I hope the Minister will see his way to concede the claim made on their behalf.</P>

      <P>When I was speaking I only put up the case of a class who, if they had not taken the line they did, would have been protected under the Treaty.  I am not putting up the case of a class who want to make any special plea for a pension, for <Col N="1727" /> reinstatement in the civil service or compensation.  I am simply asking the Minister to do justice to that section of a general class who took risks and went out to give service to their country.  I could quote promises given by many public men living and dead.  There is a document from which I can also quote. I, with two colleagues, waited on General Collins in the beginning of 1922 when he gave the undertaking that I referred to in speaking earlier.  Further, I can produce to the Minister an affidavit that was sworn in May, 1924, only two years after that promise was made.  That affidavit was sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths for the City of Dublin.  It sets forth in detail the promises and the conditions which were agreed to between the deputation representating the victimised civil servants under the British régime and General Collins.  I am quite sure the Minister will accept that.  Further, I could get, if necessary, sworn testimony from my two colleagues, Mr. O'Heagarty, who is now the secretary to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and a Mr. Dowling.  I do not know whether he is now in the civil service or not, but I believe he is in Dublin.  We can give sworn testimony as to the promises that were made in the days prior to the Treaty.  Subsequent to 1916 people did not expect promises. On the face of it the promises then made were simply an offer of justice if certain circumstances came about. At that time nobody was looking for promises on parchment to be produced at a later date.  The Minister knows that as well as anybody else. It is now a question of giving justice or of withholding it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin, in the latter part of his speech, made reference to a particular case.  If what the Deputy stated is correct, then obviously a grave injustice has been done to that particular man.  Deputy Davin stated that all the circumstances of that case were on a file in the Minister's Department.  As put before the House, the case was a very sad one.  The Deputy told us that that man's companions had to make up a weekly collection in order to maintain him in ordinary decency. I think the time has come for this House to consider some method of dealing finally with this question of victimisation and pensions.  Session after session and year after year the question of pensions has been coming up before this House and to my mind it is a very sad reflection on the patriotism of all those great nationalists, soldiers, statesmen, civil servants or civilians who fought or acted in some capacity for this country.  The sooner we have this whole thing cleared up the better. It seems to me that even when the next Government comes in there will possibly be claims made in one respect or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to the statements made by Deputies McMenamin, Belton and Davin I would like to hear him saying that some definite decision will be taken to finish once and for all the hawking of patriotism around this House and outside it for the purpose of getting pensions for people who, we were led to believe, were ready to serve this country without becoming mercenaries.  After all, there were others, thousands and tens of thousands who followed the political leaders of the time and, for a mighty poor remuneration, a mere daily pay, they made sacrifices and went through hell and damnation and got nobody's praise afterwards.  When they crawled back to this country they were treated as mere dogs.  It is time they got some praise in this House.  I would not intervene in the debate at all were it not for the fact that I am sick and tired listening to what ought to be done for those who are supposed to be the only patriots, <Col N="1729" /> those who were supposed in a spirit of patriotism to go out and serve their country without any idea of becoming mercenaries.</P>

      <P>I would like to refute, as strongly as I resent, the remarks made by Deputy Minch.  If he does not understand this matter that is before the House, why did he get up to speak on it?  Those Irish civil servants who volunteered to fight for small nationalities on the Continent got their full pay while they were away and their wives and families got their allowances, and they got gratuities when they came out.  They got their pay as soldiers in addition to full Civil Service pay, and they all got pensions.  Where was their patriotism? If we who were victimised by the British in this country got nearly that, we would be more than satisfied.  I do not see why Deputy Minch wants to cast reflections on anybody who went out to serve this country without one hope in a million that a penny would ever come their way.  If that hope in a million bore fruit, and if those who spied on us&mdash;I did not want to say that&mdash;in the Departments in which we served up to the time of the Rebellion, and subsequent to it, got their pensions, and are now enjoying fat pensions protected under the Treaty, surely we who are supposed to have won the war in this country should get as much as they got?</P>

      <P>All I know is this: that those who were in close contact with the late General Collins, who were members with him of the Provisional Government and who, I am certain, would have been concerned to honour to the full any undertaking he gave, on the 23rd of February, 1923, through the then President of the Executive Council, made this statement to the House:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;After careful consideration the Government has decided that in no circumstances will any payment be made in respect of salary for the period of dismissal or by way of compensation for loss of office.  In so far as the conditions of the public service permit, reinstatement will be offered to any officer who establishes that he left the public service by reason of political victimisation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know whether I am strictly in order in dealing with this question on the Superannuation Bill, but if I may be permitted to say it, in my view any person who came in as a reinstatee into the public service or who, being a re-instatee, remained in it after that declaration, accepted the terms of it and is bound by them, and I am not going at this stage to reopen that contract.</P>

I have already pointed out to the House the only official statement that I know of which deals with this question of the terms and conditions upon which the old British civil servants were going to be reinstated.  As I have already said, I think that any person who came into the Service after President Cosgrave's declaration, or who remained in it after it was made, has accepted the contract, and I am not prepared to reopen the question.  In any event it has nothing to do with this Bill.  As to the other point in connection with certain Ordnance Survey officers, I do not know what the position of those officers may be in view of the Departmental regulations relating to overtures to Deputies.  But I want to say this, that every one of them received a gratuity.  There was a matter of grave doubt, and they got the benefit of the doubt when they were reinstated, as to whether they were in fact the subject of political victimisation.  When their services were dispensed with they received the gratuity to which their then services entitled them, and so far as the Covenant went it was fulfilled fully in their regard.  They have been reinstated, and taking all the circumstances into consideration, I do not <Col N="1734" /> think they are entitled to any better treatment than we are proposing to give them.

      <P>No; the Deputy did. I did not refer to the Schedule in the first instance.  It was the Deputy made the comparison.  I say that every one of the people who figure in this Schedule risked life and limb in the service of this country when the Deputy was not associated with the movement of which they were part. Every one of them worked under conditions of great danger; they were employed in highly-confidential circumstances. As I say, if they had remained in the Service, and, in the ordinary course, got married out of the Service, they would have got approximately what we are giving them under this Bill.</P>

      <P>No.  We are giving it more or less in lieu of reinstatement &mdash;in full discharge of any claim they may have to reinstatement, and taking into consideration what they might have been entitled to if they had left the service in ordinary circumstances. We heard a most unworthy speech from Deputy Minch.  It is not the first time that Deputy Minch has talked about people hawking their patriotism around in order to secure pensions.  Does Deputy Minch enjoy a pension?  Did he get a gratuity when he retired from the service of a certain Government? Was Deputy Minch paid when he was playing his patriotic part out on the fields of Flanders?  In regard to the people who are affected by this Bill, most of them served this country during periods and under conditions of extreme danger, without any payment, and they made sacrifices in order to serve it.  The Deputy gets up here and talks about hawking patriotism around in order to secure pensions; does the Deputy say that in the councils of his own Party, and does he throw that statement in the teeth of some of his own colleagues?  The Deputy is sitting here as a member of an Irish Legislature. Let the Deputy remember, as I said to Deputy Davin, that he would not represent Kildare or any other constituency in the Parliament of this country if it were not for the part that most of the people affected by this Bill played in the national movement in the period from 1916 to 1922, when the Deputy was not associated with any national interest in this country.</P>

Under his hand he can get all the particulars of every alleged dismissed civil servant by inquiring in the Departments in which they were serving.

      <P>I was there before. I think the two-edged sword is cutting both ways.  I do not want to reduce this to the level of politics, but if the Minister has a number of people to whom he wants to mete out special treatment, he must do it on some general principle.  Why does he select eight out of perhaps a couple of hundred persons?  From the names I recognise some of these as people who were attending our meetings in 1922, and whose condition I know of.  I do not see why the Minister selects these people to be dealt with in a spasmodic kind of way.  Why does he not deal with them on some general principle, and apply that principle all round?  He stated that he acted on a declaration made by the then head of the Provisional Government, in February 1923, that there would be no compensation for the period between then and dismissal from the British Civil Service.  In effect, the Minister said that he was acting on that principle.</P>

Does the Minister say that the people referred to here have given greater service than eight I could pick out who were subsequently reinstated in the service?  If he does, I will take him up on that.  Why should not people who contracted debts at that time, and who perhaps have large families and who even with a struggle have not been able to get out of these debts, get compensation? I believe I am right in saying that since the Minister became Minister for Finance an Act was passed in this House directing the Corporation to reinstate certain people who were out in the civil war on the Minister's side, and who lost their positions.  They were reinstated, and got their back pay. If that is so, why does it not apply in the case of those who did not fight against their own countrymen, but who fought against the British?  Why should they not get compensation for the period they were out?  I think the Minister is muddled about the principle he has adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>None of them has been reinstated because it is not our practice to reinstate married women, even though some of these persons were married when they were employed in the Service of Dáil Eireann from the time it was established in 1919 until they left that service for political reasons in 1922.  Every one of them, having been in the Service of Dáil Eireann, was entitled, in accordance with the principles upon which this Bill is based, to reinstatement, by reason of that fact, in the present Civil Service.  It is not out policy, however, to reinstate married women. Accordingly, we have to meet their entitlement to reinstatement in this way, by giving them monetary compensation and saying to them: &ldquo;We are giving you a lump sum in full discharge of any claims you have for reinstatement.&rdquo;  The services which they rendered were of a most diversified kind and were of a highly confidential nature.  They rendered these services in circumstances of risk and <Col N="1751" /> danger, and I do not think that we can disregard their claim for reinstatement and simply disallow it unless we are prepared to give them something in exchange for it. That is the basis of this gratuity.  This gratuity has not been assessed upon how many years service these persons gave.  It is based on the fact that they rendered these services during the period when the old Dáil was the functioning authority in this country.  It is based on the fact, and also on the fact that they rendered these services in circumstances of difficulty and danger.  There has been no weighing of one claim against any other to see which of them was entitled to the greater compensation. It is a case where it was felt that the only equitable way to deal with the varieties of service and the circumstances in which that service was rendered, was to treat every one of these applicants alike.  If they had been single they would have been entitled to reinstatement without question.  Because there was no barrier in the old Dáil Service regulations to the employment of married women they would still, as married women, be entitled to reinstatement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Salaries under the old Dáil, I am not going to say had no relation, but I will say had little relation, to the duties which its officers discharged.  When it was functioning in this country, it was a point of honour with every servant of the old Dáil to take only what was sufficient to meet his ordinary every day needs.  It was not given to him as a sort of emolument or remuneration. Many of the people who were in most responsible positions, because their family responsibilities were comparatively light, were able to get along with very much smaller remuneration than other people who were subordinate to them.  This question of what a person was paid in the old Dáil Civil Service, as I have pointed out to other people, had very little relation to a person's status or responsibility in the Service.  The remuneration was fixed rather in accordance with the <Col N="1752" /> needs of the person than in accordance with the responsibility of the post.  It was, as I have said, a point of honour that any person who was receiving remuneration from the Dáil funds should accept the lowest possible amount, particularly during the period from 1919 up to the Truce.  That is why, in dealing with every one of these people, it was thought that the best way was to treat them alike, to make no exception in the case of any one of them, because they had all equal claims.  There is the case of one lady who did apply for reinstatement prior to 1932.  I think that, in that one case, reinstatement was at first refused, but, I think, on a second application reinstatement would have been granted.  I have reason to know that the lady reconsidered her position at the time, and decided not to re-enter the Civil Service at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And I have given you a plain answer, and given it in its proper logical sequence.  I am not accustomed to the sort of huggermugger in which Deputy Davin indulges.  I said, and I repeat it, that all these ladies, having applied for reinstatement since 1932, are, in our view, entitled to reinstatement. That is the principle on which the whole Bill has been drafted, that we were prepared to reinstate any person who applied since 1932 and <Col N="1753" /> who could prove that he or she had resigned from the Service of Dáil Eireann, from the British Service or from the Service of Northern Ireland, owing to political reasons, if he or she applied since 1932. Notice to that effect was duly published. Every one of these persons in response to that notice did apply for reinstatement since 1932.  In addition one of them, only one, applied for reinstatement prior to 1932.  In the case of her first application for reinstatement there was a refusal to reinstate her.  In the case of the second application, it was intimated that reinstatement would be granted, but subsequently that lady changed her mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and again applied after 1932.  The other point made was why should these people be singled out?  The reason they are taken out is because they are the only married ladies who have applied for reinstatement and, out of all the applications, these are the only married ladies who are entitled to reinstatement.  If they had been single they would have been reinstated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any married man who applied for reinstatement and who was found to be entitled to reinstatement, was offered reinstatement because there is no barrier against bringing married men into the Service.  We are anxious to get them and to get single men also but we are not anxious to have married ladies in the Service.  There is a small number of married ladies in the Service who were brought in a long time ago, but there has been no addition to that number recently. No married lady, so far as the present regulations are concerned, can be admitted to the Service.  That is the only reason why these eight persons are being treated in this way, simply because they would have been entitled to reinstatement otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it does, yet I have already made several admissions in this House in respect of matters of which I am ignorant, one of them being the pledges and promises to which Deputy Davin referred on the Money Resolution.  There are a number of other matters of which I <Col N="1755" /> am not aware.  I am merely making the case now that there was no barrier to the employment of married women in the old Dáil Civil Service.  Even under the British régime, married women were employed in the Civil Service.  Therefore, every person who comes within this Schedule, on the ground that she might have continued to be employed if she had not resigned from either the British or the Dáil Civil Service for political reasons, has a certain claim to compensation. We say that, in our view, it is not in the interests of the Service that married women should again be brought into it.  But we are not going to deal unjustly with these ladies as compared with other persons.  We cannot give them reinstatement and, accordingly, we are giving them the compensation provided for in this Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this compensation was being given to these eight ladies in lieu of their claim to reinstatement.  I ask him to mention one post in the Civil Service from 1932 to date that could be occupied by a married woman.  I know the positions some of these ladies held in the British Service and I know that it was a condition of their employment that they should vacate these positions on marriage.  I must not be taken as opposing the little bit of compensation being given these people.  I think they are entitled to it.  They have earned it and I should be glad to see them given greater compensation.  By the work they did for the country, they have earned this compensation.  But the line the Minister has taken in supporting the case of these ladies is not the true one.  He tells the House that compensation is being given in lieu of their claim on the Government for reinstatement.  In fact, they have no claim to reinstatement because they are married women.  That cuts them out.  He has not told us why he has singled out eight victimised civil servants for compensation and left out a couple of hundred.  The reason he has given for granting compensation is not the true reason because these ladies have no claim to reinstatement.  The Minister should say &ldquo;We are giving <Col N="1756" /> these people compensation because of the national service they rendered in a time of emergency.&rdquo;  He should not camouflage the issue.  That is the reason why they should get compensation&mdash;because of the service they have given.  To proceed in the way the Minister is doing is to show partisanship. In the division on the Treaty, I know what side these eight ladies took.  Women who gave equally good service and who took the side of the Treaty are not included in this Schedule, although they were victimised too.  Why are they not included?  This is a political measure and I do not know whether or not it is worth voting for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put one or two points to the Minister. Does the Minister propose to carry this principle further into the Bill than Section 18?  He tells us that the principle on which he worked is that these people, being married women, cannot be brought into established positions in the present Civil Service and that when they entered the previous Service there was no bar against marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the statement, at all events.  There is an attempt to continue service as between the first Dáil down to the present day. All the people who entered the Service of the first Dáil, equally with these eight persons, entered in the absence of any precluding rule regarding marriage. Did they carry that right with them into the present Civil Service? Is it not true that any woman who came into the Civil Service when there was no such prohibition against marriage, now being in the Civil Service, will be removed if she gets married? The principle is, therefore, not going to be carried comprehensively into the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To that very illogical position the Minister has added two very serious misstatements.  He was asked how the standard of £300 was arrived at.  If any formula was used at all, it must have been based upon years of service with. perhaps, some computation of what these people might have been <Col N="1757" /> entitled to if they had remained in the Civil Service over a particular period. The Minister was questioned about that by Deputy Davin, who asked some questions as to salaries in the Service of the first Dáil.  The Minister made the astounding statement that, in the case of service in the first Dáil, pay had no relation to the service rendered.</P>

He said these people had applied since the present Government came in.  He said that in answer to a question which sought information as to whether any of these people had applied prior to that time.  The Minister did say in that context that they had all applied since the present Government came in.  In the context that meant that they had not applied earlier.</P>

      <P>Then it emerged that one person had applied, one of those eight who is now going to be given £300.  She applied because she was entitled to reinstatement but was precluded by marriage from continuing in the service.  But she had applied and it had been intimated to her that she could be reinstated, but she thought better of it and decided to wait for the £300.  That is a shocking state of affairs.  The principle goes by the board.  The principle is not running through the Bill, the principle of people who went into the service where there was no marriage bar. That has only been brought out by the Minister because he does not want to admit what Deputy Belton has said more crudely, that this is purely a political Bill.  If we are going to vote £300 let us consider that.  A lot of <Col N="1759" /> people would vote for that in order to get rid of the whole business, but we ought to know why the £300 is fixed on. It must be an amazing formula or principle which enables eight people with divers work and in divers occupations to get that same sum of £300. Was there any formula or any principle in that at all?  Was there any reason for giving one of them any greater pay than the others because of more danger or because of longer services or more responsibility?  Where they were allowed to go back one of them thought better of it; it would be better to take the £300.  Deputy Belton raised the question of a married man. Let us suppose some married man applies to go back.  He is bluffing, his bluff is called and a post is made for him.  Will he go back and take the post or will he be given the £300? Not likely.  If the man's bluff was called he would not get the £300.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan has explained to my satisfaction what I, when speaking previously, meant in the general statement to which the Minister has taken exception.  When I was referring to this question of pensions, etc., I was referring to the repeated Acts or Bills of a similar kind passed in this House.  I said that the time had arrived when the thing should be put on a fair basis and finished with once and for all.  Deputy McGilligan has confirmed what has been my suspicion, namely, that there is some thimble-rigging going on as to how one is to obtain a pension on the basis discussed here to-day.  I made a general statement at the time that all this thing should be finished and wound up. I think I never suggested that there were not brave men in the country who are not entitled to decent pensions. I never made such a suggestion, but I have complained that the thing has grown to an abuse and that different types of new claimants for pensions are coming along.  The Minister for Finance turned the whole matter into personal abuse of myself.</P>

      <P>My accuracy has been challenged with regard to the statement I made that the old Dáil had more regard to family responsibility than to any other consideration.  That is more or less what I said. Deputy Cosgrave has been given as an authority upon which that statement is challenged.  I am sure Deputy Cosgrave recollects as well as I do the day upon which the Cabinet of the Republic came to Dáil Eireann with proposals for the remuneration of the members of that Cabinet.  The Deputy can recollect as well as I do the discussion which took place on the occasion.  He can recollect how Arthur Griffith himself unwillingly accepted the sum fixed for him; he wished to have it reduced on the grounds that it was more than sufficient for his needs. The Deputy will recollect that Cathal Brugha refused to take any remuneration even though he was Minister for Defence.  He refused on the ground that his other resources would enable him to do without any remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Others members of the Cabinet took the same course.  When that was the principle which they laid down for themselves, we might be perfectly well satisfied that every other person who served them in the movement and who were comrades of theirs in that movement was anxious to follow their example in regard to the service given to the movement.  We may be perfectly well <Col N="1761" /> satisfied that every person connected with the movement would do the same thing no matter whether they were high in the Hierarchy or were lower in grade.  That is my authority for the statement I made and I am certain that if the records of the old Dáil were available, they would be found to bear that out.</P>

      <P>I had intended to raise a point which might be ruled out of order, but this section will give me an opportunity of getting it in by a side wind.  The Minister mentioned that in Section 4 there is a reference to a certain date.  There is one person in the service of the Local Government Department who was appointed at a date previous to the Truce.  The Truce had no reference whatever to the appointment, but that official was unable to take up duty until after the Truce.  Will the Minister say whether the appointment is likely to date from the date of the making of the appointment, or the date of taking up duty?  I think that is the only case in which such a thing occurred.  Everything in connection with the proceeding was regular.  It was on the recommendation of one of the members of the former Dáil Cabinet that the person was taken on in the Department, and it would be unfortunate that, by reason of circumstances which had nothing whatever to do with the date of the Truce, the person should be precluded from any advantage which would accrue to him otherwise.</P>

But I should like to know from the Minister whether the effect of the section is to restore, for all superannuation purposes, and for grants made under the Superannuation Acts, the position as if there had been no interruption in the service during the period in 1922. The case I have in mind is that under the ordinary Superannuation Acts a female civil servant, who retires on marriage, is granted a gratuity based upon certain established service.  A couple of cases probably have occurred where, as a result of the exclusion of the 19 days period, which is now restored in this section, the effect is to lose a year's reckonable service for the purpose of a gratuity.  Can I take it that this section would normally restore the service for that purpose as well?</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 18, line 4, after the word &ldquo;liability&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;or, in the case of persons partly employed as hereinafter mentioned, the due proportion of the liability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Section 30 is directed to giving effect to an undertaking given to the Public Accounts Committee in 1931 that provision would be made for charging against the funds of the Post Office Savings Bank, as part of the expenses of administering the savings bank, the pensions liabilities accruing from day to day in respect of civil servants employed on savings bank work.  The question has been raised since the section was drafted that as it stands it might be construed as authorising, if not actually requiring, a charge to be raised against the bank for the entire pension liability accruing in respect of a person employed only partly on savings bank work.  Now, it is not, of course, the intention, nor has it been the practice in the past, to charge more in the case of such persons than the amount of the pension appropriate to the time spent on savings bank work. It has been agreed that the section, as drafted, is somewhat ambiguous, and that possibly there is room for the interpretation which I have indicated.  Accordingly, this amendment has been drafted which makes it clear that it is only the due proportion attributable to savings bank work of pension liabilty that can be recovered from the funds of the bank.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have debated this section long enough.  The Land Commission must have a certain discretion when they are bargaining with a migrant to vacate his old holding. One of the difficulties that they have had in getting new allottees for the old holding is the fact that they object to paying off arrears incurred by the former occupier&mdash;the migrant who has gone some place else.  We want to give the Land Commission a free hand in bargaining both with the migrant and with the new allottees.  Now, in regard to the burdens that the new man is carrying there is always some saleable interest in the old holding, and when they transfer him to a new one they allow him for them.  It may be a few pounds a year.  Take a migrant paying a £10 annuity.  The Land Commission may charge the incoming allottees £13 or £14.  In his new holding the migrant is credited with the difference between his old annuity and the annuity paid by the incoming tenants.  The carrying of his old arrears will not amount to a very big burden on the migrant when he goes to other land.</P>

      <P>Amongst other things which the Land Commission will deal with is the question of the payment of arrears.  Quite a number of questions do arise in connection with the transfer of charges to holdings especially in the case of migrating a farmer from one county to another.  These are covered by a section in the 1923 Act. I think it outlines the machinery, relating to burdens and charges, in connection with the transfer of migrants, but this is in addition to the existing charges.  This is something quite new.  It is not in substitution for any of the existing charges.  This proposes to transfer a funding annuity on a holding, let us say, in the County Galway to a new holding which will be given, or which probably has already been given, to a migrant in the County Dublin.  The thing seems on the face of it inequitable, unfair, and unjust. After all, how can you consolidate a charge on a holding in the County Galway with an annuity on a holding of land in the County Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no analogy between shop debts and a funding annuity.  After all, these unpaid arrears of annuities accumulated during the years from 1930 to 1933, and if a tenant was unable to pay these annuities during those years, does the Minister imagine that he is able to pay them to-day&mdash;that a <Col N="1768" /> farmer is in a better position to meet arrears of that kind to-day than he was in 1933?  As I stated earlier this evening, the mere fact of transferring a migrant from one county to another is in itself a sufficient handicap without adding charges which already can be transferred under Section 46 or Section 47 of the Land Act of 1923.  This is quite a new charge.  It does appear to me to be grossly unfair.  It seems to me it is one of those charges that the Minister should either transfer to the tenant who will take over the old holding or else it should be wiped out altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be in some way logical.  The Minister said that the Land Commission did not propose to transfer tenants who were in arrear, to any great extent.  I hope if he is going to proceed in this particular matter that he does not do so.  In any case, if we do proceed to transfer a migrant, we are taking pains in this measure to assume that the individual is in an impoverished condition, because apparently he needs assistance, a subsistence allowance, a travelling allowance and he has to be established in his new home.  When he gets into the new home we will provide him with maintenance for 12 or 15 months.  In view of all that, how can he be regarded as financially strong enough to meet the debts on his old holding?  It is really an illogical proposition and I think, on reflection, the Minister should withdraw the first sub-section of this section.  I do not think he has made any particular case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you do select a migrant who is in arrears&mdash;they are not always the best kind of migrants to select and I do not suppose the Minister will select them to any great extent-and if you are going to give him any prospect of being a useful occupant of land, you will have to put him in the same position as the migrant who is transferred without any burdens.  The least you may do is to leave the old holding clear of debt.  I would rather not see him transferred at all than transferred <Col N="1769" /> under such conditions.  In the case of a man who would get into arrears and who then would be provided with travelling expenses, maintenance expenses and a subsistence allowance and everything else, it is rather illogical to say that that man can bear the added burden of arrears on his old farm, the burden of the annuities on his old holding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister any regard for equity when he is dealing with matters of this kind? That funded annuity represents arrears of annuity contracted on the first holding in a particular county and it belongs in equity to the county council of that county from which the agricultural grant has been deducted for that amount.  The Minister deals with this as if it were Central Fund money.  He transfers the obligation of paying a debt that arose on a particular farm in a certain county to another farm in another county.  I take it he does not make it a personal obligation on the man who contracted it, but he places it as a mortgage debt on a farm on which it has never been contracted.  Would not the equitable way of dealing with that be to have the man who is leaving the original holding discharged of responsibility?  If the Minister does not want to penalise the man, then give him a loan on his new farm.  It was a common thing in the old days, in addition to free grants in the case of new holdings of that kind, also to give loans that would be consolidated in the annuity.  Why not let this man, out of a loan so given, redeem the funded annuity and let the county council in that county be paid that funded annuity which is due to that county council by reason of deductions that heretofore have been made in the agricultural grant on foot of these arrears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy Bennett has said has very real force.  The Minister in a previous section wants to give travelling expenses, money for food and money to work the land; he did not say beer money, but it almost amounted to that.  He said a man would be paid for going to look at the holding that he was going to get.  That man might say: &ldquo;I will not take <Col N="1770" /> that,&rdquo; although he would be getting it reasonably, but still he would be paid for going to see it.  He would be helped to work his land and he would be paid a weekly allowance for a year and a half.  Now, if it is necessary to give such financial help to a migrant, surely it cannot be justified that that man carries a debt with him.  Here is another view of the type of new farmer that is going to be transplanted in another county.  We are being told, and I do not think by anybody have we been told so frequently and with such emphasis as by the Minister, that people who have not paid their annuities would not pay them.  It was not a question of ability, but they just would not pay their annuities.</P>
    <P>Why then does the Minister propose to give a better farm to a man who has not paid his annuities on his old farm?  If he did pay his annuities and was up to the standard of farming that the Minister would expect, if we are to take his public declarations as a near approximation to what he believes with regard to the ability of farmers to run farms, then the man who has to have the arrears of his annuities funded would be a failure in farming and why take him from a small holding in which he failed and from surroundings to which he was accustomed and transplant him into another county, into a larger holding, into conditions that he does not understand and into land that he does not know and expect him to be a successful farmer in the new farm when he had failed in the other?</P>
    <P>From any angle that this can be looked at, there is no sense in transferring a debt that belongs to the farm, and not to the man, to another farm in another county.  That debt belongs in equity to the county council of the county in which the original farm is situated.  It is really a monstrous proposal, but no more monstrous than the Bill itself, and, seeing the peculiar proposals that are in this measure, one is hardly surprised at anything.  I should like to know how the Minister can justify the plunder of county council money&mdash;I might almost say the misappropriation of county council money&mdash;by the Government through an Act or a Resolution of this House, and <Col N="1771" /> then, having done that, the transfer of the debt from one county to another. It seems to me a monstrous proposal.</P>

      <P>I should like to know how those sub-sections (a), (b) and (c), hang together in view of what the Minister says.  He says that the farm from which a man has been taken has some saleable value, and allowance is made for that in fixing the rent of the new holding.  Sub-section (b) says that the charge of such funding annuity on the new holding shall rank next in priority to the purchase annuity.  Sub-section (c) says that the arrears and the annuity fixed for the new holding shall be consolidated.  If that is so, I take it that one has not priority over the other.  The payment shall be made from the time that the holding is transferred to the Land Commission.  It looks then as if it is not paid until after the man has been transferred to the new holding.  How then is it consolidated with the rent that is fixed on the new holding before he is transferred? I take it that the rent is fixed before he is transferred to the new holding.  It is not payable until the land is transferred to the Land Commission, and then it has priority after the annuity that is fixed on the new holding.  I should like to know how those two things are going to be operated, because to me it appears that when they are consolidated, it is one rent, and that they both are a first charge on the new holding.</P>

      <P>There is only one point on which I should like some information from the Minister on this section.  Sub-section (1) (b) says:</P>
      <P>The charge of such funding annuity on the new holding shall rank next in priority after the purchase annuity.</P>
      <P>That seems to be rather inconsistent with sub-section (c).  At any rate, it seems to be concluded that they are two separate and distinct charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There does not seem to me to be provided any remedy for the recovery of that other annuity.  I notice that when you come down to sub-section (4) you do provide, in those circumstances, a remedy for the recovery. <Col N="1772" /> It shall be &ldquo;recoverable out of the new holding in like manner in all respects as if the said purchase annuity, interest, rent, or other annual payment had been payable in respect of the new holding&rdquo;; that is, when you transfer arrears that have not been funded you provide a specific remedy for that.  When you transfer a funded annuity why do you not put in a statement as to how it can be recovered?  I am rather puzzled by it.  It seems to me that you have left yourself without any remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have thrashed this matter out pretty fully.  There is one fallacy that a lot of the arguments of Deputies opposite seem to be based on, and it is that this is meant to deal with the type of migrants who have been recently transferred to Athboy, whereas, in point of fact, it is brought in primarily to deal with holdings where migrants have been taken from the West for the relief of congestion in the West.  That is the type of farm that it is designed to deal with.  I explained before that it is not a very big economic problem; it is rather a psychological problem.  The incoming allottees in the West who get those old farms object strongly to paying the arrears of the former occupier.  Deputy Roddy says it is grossly unfair that the former occupier should carry his arrears with him, but the new allottees consider it grossly unfair that they should have to pay them. As I say, in pounds, shillings and pence it does not amount to very much; it is rather a psychological problem.  The Land Commission want to have bargaining power either to keep the arrears on the old holding or to transfer them to the new holding given to the migrant.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's point, I do not know whether as a matter of fact sub-section (1) (b) is necessary.  I would have said that sub-sections (a) and (c) are sufficient, but it is the draftsman's way of putting it, and we can look into the matter.</P>

      <P>I do not know how much is in it.  In regard to Deputy Belton's point about the harm done to the County Council of Galway, or Kerry, or wherever the migrant comes from, by having the arrears transferred to County Meath, the whole business of the repayment of the arrears and the funding annuities is a matter that does not affect the county council very much. The Deputy and others objected very strongly that we should fund those arrears at all in 1933, and pointed out that the local county councils would not be repaid for 50 years.  I made here on behalf of the Minister for Finance a promise that they would be recouped their arrears before the 50 years&mdash;that within as short a time as the Exchequer funds permitted we would repay in lump sums into the Guarantee Fund the arrears that were funded.  That has been done already in a couple of years to the extent of over £500,000 and it really does not matter a thraneen to the County Council of Galway whether those arrears attach to the allottees down there or whether they go to Meath with the migrants.  Largely, as I say, the whole section was brought in to deal with rather large farmers in the West whose lands were acquired for the relief of congestion there, and who were transferred to the East.  It is not proper to associate this section with the other section that we passed here giving us certain powers to help the small migrant.</P>

      <P>This section gives the Land Commission power to take up a holding for arrears of annuities, and to discharge arrears-wipe them out. Now, in doing that, the Ministry is <Col N="1776" /> wiping out a charge which, in reality, does not belong to the Land Commission. It is the property of the county council in whatever county such land is situated.  We had a long argument on another section on practically the same principle, but it seems to me unfair that such a procedure should be adopted in the case of lands which are valuable, because I am sure it will not be held that they are not of some value; otherwise, if they are waste or mountain lands, they will not be fit for distributing to anybody.  Accordingly, we will have to assume that they are lands of value, and, if they are, and the Land Commission takes them over for arrears of rent, they take them over without any compensation except the arrears.  Under this section they are now going to wipe out the arrears, and so diddle, if I may use the word, the county councils out of any chance they would have in the future to recoup themselves for reductions in the Agricultural Grant because of those arrears.</P>
      <P>I am strongly opposed to this section and I believe that all my colleagues here are strongly opposed to it.  It is unfair to do away with the possibility of county councils ever receiving compensation for the reductions in their grants and I believe that it would not be unfair to put these charges on the land just as the Minister put the charges on the man who was migrating from one county to another.  It would not be unfair to put these charges on his land when a man migrated into a new farm.  The Land Commission would be making some use of them and the added arrears if there were no other compensation given.  I presume it could not amount to a desperate amount of money.  The land, however, must be of some value.  Anyhow, I object to these arrears being wiped out entirely at the expense of the county bodies.</P>

      <P>This is a rather novel proposal, and one has difficulty in seeing how to approach it in order to justify it.  Of course, one can see that where the Land Commission see any chance of getting money into the Exchequer or the <Col N="1777" /> Guarantee Fund they will see that they get it.  Here, however, they are going to wipe out a debt that is really not due to them at all, a debt that is being paid by the ratepayers. It is certainly a very generous thing to cancel a debt due by a person to somebody else.  That is a very simple method of book-keeping, but when it comes to any money that is due to the Land Commission themselves, of course they make sure to get it. How can this section be justified?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether previous speakers saw this case as it appears to me.  The Land Commission have obtained possession of a holding under section so-and-so. Well, then, the Land Commission will be the owner of such holding and the Land Commission will be liable for the arrears.  These are not funded arrears.  In such circumstances, could the Guarantee Fund be made to meet those arrears? Would the amount of those arrears be deducted from the Agricultural Grant?  The Land Commission is the owner of the holding.  Otherwise, it cannot have possession of it.  The Land Commission is the owner of the holding or the parcel of land previously held by the allottee.  Why, then, does not the Land Commission pay the arrears before it resells? What right has it to reallocate to somebody and wipe out the arrears when the county councils lose so much off their Agricultural Grant on account of those arrears?  I take it that the Land Commission should pay the arrears when it resumes and not, in effect, make the county council pay them over.  That is what it amounts to.</P>

There are arrears because the Land Commission did not do its job in collecting them.  Then the Land Commission takes up the land and, as the owner or the mortgagee in possession, <Col N="1778" /> is it not liable for the arrears? I am not a lawyer but it seems to me that the Land Commission should be liable.  It can relet, resell or reallocate those lands to somebody else, but while it is in possession of the lands, it seems to me that it is liable for the arrears and that it should pay itself.</P>

      <P>I think that that section amounts to a pure swindle on the county councils.  Words are juggled in order to swindle the county councils. Why place an annuity on a holding that the holding is not able to bear? If such an annuity is placed on the holding, then it is, due to the incompetence of the Land Commission, and if it is a fair annuity, surely the Land Commission, under the 1933 Act, took the direct method of collecting.  They have the machinery&mdash;a machinery very well oiled and always going at high pressure, full steam ahead; and in the hands of its new chief I am sure it will go better than ever, because he seems to glory in that kind of thing, but he might be travelling a little fast in respect of this section.  With such ample machinery at his disposal, and with his sense of justice and fair play, surely he ought to expect a fair annuity on a farm to be paid.  If it is not paid within a reasonable time, it is his fault, and if he puts that machinery into operation, it will be paid before the arrears accumulate to any extent. Mind you, a half-year's annuity is not long in arrears until a duplicate copy of the demand is forwarded to the annuitant from the sheriff or the court messenger or whatever he is called now.  It is some nicer name than sheriff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all the same.  A rose smells the same no matter what you call it.  The most that could accrue would be one year's annuity, and surely if the business is done efficiently at the beginning, by the placing of a fair annuity on the farm&mdash;<Col N="1779" /> and that is the responsibility of the Land Commission&mdash;a year's arrears of that annuity are not going to impose rack-rent conditions on the owner.</P>
      <P>When the Land Commission resumes, the most there can be is a year's arrears, and perhaps only a half-year. Why remit it?  It takes up possession, and surely it must meet its own obligations?  It wants to create a line of least resistance for itself, and wants to offer the land with no arrears on it.  It is its own funeral.  Let it come out of the expenses of the Land Commission, and let the Minister in charge of that Department come here annually with his Estimates.  Otherwise, to take an extreme view of it, the Minister can be the good fellow and give time to everybody who comes to him. He need not press them, knowing that he is sure to get the annuities, and that if he does not get them he has to sell out these farmers.  He knows the Land Commission will not have to foot the bill, but that the local authorities will have to foot it.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister in charge of the Land Commission should do his work properly in the first instance, and put a fair annuity on those farms, an annuity which a man can pay and live. If the annuity is not paid, the machinery at the disposal of the Minister can be put in motion in due time to clear it, and if the worst happens, and the Minister has to take possession and become mortgagee in possession, the load of arrears will not be so heavy as to preclude a sale in the open market. What would the Minister have to recover?  Only a half-year's annuity and the little cost attached to the sale. Would that not be all he would need to get for the farm?  He could then hand it over free to the new allottee. Take the man who has a farm and who runs into arrears.  The Land Commission sells that by putting it up for auction.  Will the Land Commission not be recouped if they get the arrears and the cost of the sale?  The Minister wants to give that farm to somebody else, apparently, for nothing, and make the county council pay the arrears. Why not put it into the market and sell it for the arrears?</P>

I suppose the Land Commission are trying to let it each year to get even the annuities out of it, but the position with regard to that farm is that the longer it is in the Land Commission's hands, the higher are the arrears becoming, and the greater is the sum being taken out of the guarantee fund of the local county council.  It is much better to cut the losses on it and get a tenant into it who will pay his annuities and relieve the local ratepayers of paying.</P>

How would it be a business proposition for any man to take up that farm and to pay the annuities when the previous tenant failed to pay? Apparently the Minister does not understand the job.  If the Land Commission put up land for sale could they not buy it and divide the 180 acres into two or three holdings, if the land lends itself to sub-division?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the farm.  The 190 acres would make eight or nine farms and that would be better than to have the Land Commission ranching it.  The Minister knows that the Land Commission lost thousands of pounds out of money voted by this House on the purchase and resale of land. Why not purchase this land and resell it at a loss instead of pushing the baby on to the county councils? Is this section for the purpose of relieving the Land Commission of two derelict farms on which there are <Col N="1783" /> arrears that the Land Commission failed to collect?  It is a censure on the Land Commission.  It surprises me that even the Minister for Lands has sufficient cheek to bring forward a Bill asking county councils to pay arrears due on that farm the Land Commission failed to collect.  A separate section has been introduced for that purpose.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with what has been said by Deputy Belton, Deputy Bennett, and Deputy McMenamin as to the manner in which this section deals with the county councils, but I want to approach it from another angle, and to suggest that this is a section it would be wise for the Minister to withdraw from the Bill.  I do not think the section is in any way helpful.  It certainly puts power into the hands of the Land Commission that ought not to be in their hands.  This section enables county councils to sell land subject to the annuities and if there are arrears subject to the funded arrears.  The maximum amount of arrears that can be on a holding is something in the nature of three years.  Arrears prior to that can be funded.  The Minister asks the House to believe that there are holdings of land which are not worth three years purchase of the annuities.  I am willing to agree with the Minister in the contention that the value of land has depreciated within the last three or four years to a tremendous extent, but I do not believe that land put on the open market for public auction would not bring more than three years purchase.  While there might be circumstances to prevent land having what might be called a free market, such as local agitation and things of that kind, I do not think this section serves any purpose.  I wonder if in the case the Minister mentioned, the land was unsaleable in a large division.  The Land Commission has perfect power to divide and sell in smaller areas of 15 or 20 acres. Some farms of 100 acres would be more valuable as one holding than if divided into smaller lots.  A big grazing run will turn out better cattle than small areas of land.  Taking the proposition <Col N="1784" /> as a whole I am perfectly certain that there is no land which is not worth three years purchase.</P>
      <P>What are the disadvantages of this section?  The Land Commission takes possession of a farm which may have been held by a certain type of tenant. It may have been held by an undeserving man who let the annuities run into arrears.  If the Land Commission takes it over, they need not sell it by public auction, nor attempt to get the highest price for it.  Properly speaking they should get the highest price, and should then pay the mortgagees or persons who have charges against it, giving the owner the difference between the amount of arrears due and the purchase price.  Under this section the Land Commission need not put up the land for sale but can hand it to any person they like as an absolutely free gift, discharged from all arrears of annuities.  These annuities may run for five or six years or they may run for 40 or 50 years.  No matter how long they run the Land Commission can hand over the land discharged from any charges.  I do not think the Land Commission should be given such power, and I do not think the Minister made a case for getting such power.  Remember that this land is not being given to congests or to migrants but is land that is going to be sold, possibly, to very rich people.  Suppose that one of the wealthy members of the Fianna Fáil Party, a rich man like Deputy Corry, bought a holding of land on which there were arrears due, the Land Commission could wipe out the arrears.  It did not matter whether the purchaser was a rich man or a poor man.</P>

      <P>Men of straw?  Are you?  &ldquo;I hae ma doots.&rdquo; That is the position in which the Land Commission are.  That is not necessarily helping some poor person coming in.  This is to help a person who is buying land in an open market.  It <Col N="1785" /> is not land which is being divided amongst migrants or poor people.  I think that when the Minister was considering this he would have been better advised to take these powers to wipe off arrears in another direction.  I mentioned the case of an undeserving person.  There may be the case of a deserving person, a man who has met with a great number of catastrophes, whose cattle or sheep may have died from fluke.  He may be very much reduced in circumstances and he is not able to pay his arrears.  I think it is the arrears of a person like that the Land Commission ought to take powers to wipe out and not the arrears of some person coming in to a holding who had no prior claim to the land at all.  I put it to the Minister that he has not really made a case here for Section 9 at all and that he would be well advised to withdraw that section from the Bill altogether.</P>

      <P>I should like to inform Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, if he does not know it already, that there are several derelict farms in my constituency which nobody would accept as a present.  Nobody would take a present of them during the years the Deputies over there were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not take them at all.  They would not take them even if they had to pay only the current annuity and I shall tell you why. When these estates were taken over in the first instance and when the Land Commission and judicial commissioner had finished with them, the annuity fixed on them was so high that nobody could ever hope to pay it.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, who was Minister for Justice at that time, might get some information from his colleague. Deputy Roddy, if he does not know of these matters himself, as to how many farms were put up for auction by the Land Commission in their time and how many buyers they got.  In how many of these cases were they able to clear the arrears of annuities?  I am <Col N="1786" /> aware that they would not be sold unless the purchasers offered to clear the arrears.  The majority of these cases have been handed down to us as legacies of past maladministration. They are lying there to-day as derelicts and legacies.</P>

The people who accepted holdings on these estates walked blindly into it. Then after a couple of years they were put out by the Land Commission. These holdings have been lying derelict there ever since.  I would also tell the Minister that it is useless for him to wipe out the arrears on these farms unless he takes power also to deal with the annuities on them.  We have heard a lot of talk about the loss to the ratepayers as a result of this section, but <Col N="1787" /> these farms have been a loss to the ratepayers for the past eight or nine years and they will continue to be a loss unless the annuities are reviewed, no matter what Government is in power.</P>

When I asked the Minister for an instance, he gave me an instance of a farm of 190 acres on which he said there was a debt of £200.  The Minister expects us to believe that a sum of £200 could not be funded on a 190 acre farm in such a way that it would amount to a very small burden on an incoming tenant.</P>
