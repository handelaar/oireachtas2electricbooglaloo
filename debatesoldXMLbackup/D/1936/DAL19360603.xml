      <P>asked the President whether he is aware that a considerable number of Irish people residing in England are of opinion that the remains of the late Roger Casement are not available for repatriation; and whether in order to allay apprehension he is prepared to cause inquiry to be made for the purpose of ascertaining if the remains are in a condition to be repatriated.</P>

      <P>I have reason to believe that the opinion referred to by the Deputy is held by many people in Ireland and by many Irish people in Great Britain.  I have caused inquiries on the matter to be addressed to the British Government. I have been informed in reply that, so far as is known, there was no difference between the treatment of Roger Casement's body and that of anyone else buried as the law requires within the walls of a prison.  I do not know the precise implications of that statement, and I am endeavouring to obtain a more definite answer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received a resolution from the Tipperary Urban Council protesting against his delay in sanctioning plans for the extension and improvement of Tipperary District Hospital and calling on him to take immediate steps to have the work carried out; whether his attention has been directed to the report of the <Col N="1532" /> county medical officer of health, concerning the condition of the existing institution; whether he is aware that the present maternity ward, containing seven beds, is situated on the ground floor of the Fever Hospital, where operations are performed in the presence of patients; and whether he is in a position to state if the work of reconstruction decided upon by the local authority will be sanctioned in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first two parts of the question is in the affirmative.  I am not aware that the present maternity ward is situated on the ground floor of the Fever Hospital.  On the 29th April, 1936, the local authority was directed to discontinue the Fever Hospital at Tipperary as such, and to arrange for the treatment of all fever cases in the Fever Hospital at Clonmel.  It is not proposed to sanction the reconstruction proposals of the local authority for Tipperary Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that three cattle have died in the County Kilkenny with one farmer, and the recovery of two others is doubtful, after the warble fly dressing having been applied, and, if so, if he will state if the matter was investigated by the Department and what was the result; and if he will state if there is any danger to the cattle attendant on the application of the dressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigations have been carried out in the case referred to.  As is usual where death arises from the warble fly treatment, a payment equal to the market value has been made in respect of the three animals mentioned, and inquiries are being conducted with regard to the other two animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of such fatalities is extremely small when considered in relation to the number of animals treated.  Normally the treatment is innocuous, but in the case of supersensitive <Col N="1533" /> animals death may ensue from shock or anaphylaxis arising from absorption of the toxic products resulting from the crushing of immature larvae.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the reply that the cattle died from the effects of the dressing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not from the effects of the dressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHolohan" hpid="Mr. Holohan Mr. Holohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any danger in connection with the continued application of this dressing in future?  Further losses may occur if the people are not made aware of the fact that cattle can die from this if not applied properly. Something should be done in the immediate future in order to prevent further losses.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that he has granted compensation to the people who have lost cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular was issued, as a matter of fact, pointing out that any rough treatment was likely to lead to trouble&mdash;the crushing of the larvae or using a wire brush, as has been done in some cases.  The dressing itself is absolutely innocuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it strange that anaphylaxis should affect three cattle on the one farm?  Would it not be much more likely that anaphylaxis would appear in 2 per cent. of cattle very widely distributed over the country, and has he caused special inquiries to be made into the case referred to with a view to ascertaining whether the cattle licked one another, and whether, in the event of their so doing, the dressing can poison them, as such an allegation was made in Great Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, cattle and sheep have been drenched with four or five times the amount of the dressing put on one beast without any harm to them.  The reason why it occurred in one particular herd is that the same treatment was given in regard to crushing the larvae.  It is the crushing that causes the trouble.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1534" /> for Lands whether he is aware that William Duffily has been herd on the Hodson Estate, Johnsport, Lecarrow, County Roscommon, for 40 years, and that his father and brother held the same position before him; that in that capacity he received £26 per annum, grass for three cows, five calves, a horse and a donkey, a house and garden free of rent, and fuel; that he has living with him and dependent on him a wife, a brother, two sons and a daughter; that the estate is now in process of being divided up by the Land Commission and that Mr. Duffily has been informed that none of it will be allotted to him and that he and his family will be turned out of their house; and whether if these facts are correct, he will state why Mr. Duffily and his family are being treated in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission are fully aware of the position and family circumstances of Mr. William Duffily as mentioned by the Deputy and have taken them duly into account in considering the resale scheme for the lands acquired on the Hodson Estate, but having regard to the area available for allotment and the number of applicants for parcels thereon, they cannot see their way to make any allotment to Mr. Duffily.  The division of these lands will not disturb him in the possession of the house in which he at present resides, which is situate on lands held by Mr. Hodson, other than those which have been acquired for division.  Mr. Duffily already has a holding of some 39 acres, with a poor law valuation of £16 15s., on which is a good house which he does not occupy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OsmondGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Sir Osmond Esmonde Sir Osmond Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Osmond Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally object to this motion.  I think it shows on the part of the Government a tendency to minimise the importance of national defence.  Apparently it is the opinion of the Executive Council that the important problem of national defence is not one which would require the whole-time study of a member of the Executive Council.  In this matter I assume that the majority of the House is in agreement with the Government, and possibly I am only a one-man minority, but I certainly think that when the rest of the world is paying so much attention to defence we in this country should pay more attention to this matter, and we should at least give one Minister a free hand in studying the problems which affect the defences of our coasts.  The matter concerned is not only one of defence with regard to the possibility of a European war; there is also the question of the defence of our rights in our territorial waters.  Some of the members of this House may have noticed in the papers during the last few days a letter, which was not, I think, political; it was from a very distinguished member of the judiciary, and dealt with the violation of our rights in territorial waters.  I think that that is a matter which should have been considered by the Executive Council, but apparently it is thrown aside as of no importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now acquainted with the fact, that whereas all other countries <Col N="1537" /> in Europe are studying their national obligations and their national defences, we here in Ireland&mdash;faced with the problem of a new régime, of a new Constitution; faced with the problem of what we should do about our oblígations with regard to the treaty ports in this country, and the very important obligations imposed upon us with regard to our relations with Great Britain &mdash; are renouncing our rights and are looking on our obligations of national defence as a matter of minor importance, as a matter which does not merit having a whole-time Minister for Defence, and we are now definitely assuming the position of a protected colonial State.  That is the implication which I read into this motion combining the Ministry of Defence with the Ministry of Lands.  We are definitely accepting the position of a Protectorate.  We are definitely renouncing our right to protect our own shores, and to assume the full responsibility of a sovereign State. That is the implication which is quite clearly expressed in the combination of the offices of Minister for Defence and Minister for Lands.  Other people may think differently.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy MacDermot is probably pleased that we are clearly establishing ourselves as a Protectorate of the British Empire, and that we are accepting the position that national defence is only a minor matter to be associated with some internal administrative office such as that of Minister for Lands.  But there are other people in the country, who are not represented in this House, and who have very clear views as to the responsibilities of national defence, people who are cheated out of their right to take part in the establishment of the new Constitution by the forestalling of their election as representatives of the people, and they will have something to say to this violation of the sovereign rights of this people.  The Government is ill-advised in minimising the importance of national defence at this moment, and I think that, when the next general election comes on, the new Party, which will be interested in our national defences, will have something to say <Col N="1538" /> as to this violation of our sovereign rights by the Government in reducing the whole problem of our national defences to a minor internal problem. The Government will be well advised to keep the Department of Defence separate. They would be well advised to keep, according to the Constitution, the dignity of the Commander-in-Chief of the forces of this State&mdash;because that, in case the Government should not know it, is the title of the Minister for Defence&mdash;they would be well advised to keep that title distinct from some Ministerial office which has nothing to do with the military forces of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, contrary to the expectation of Deputy Esmonde, I am not gratified at the amalgamation of these two Ministries, but my point of view differs considerably from that of Deputy Esmonde.  My fear would be that the preoccupation of the now Minister for Defence with the problems of defence and the matters in which he has been showing so much interest for the last few years would prevent him from giving adequate attention to the Ministry of Lands and the problems of the Gaeltacht.  That, I think, is the real danger.  If Deputy Esmonde's argument were pushed to its logical conclusion, it is quite plain that we ought to set about at once creating a navy.  Certainly, as regards this invasion of our fishery rights, a navy, presumably, would be of more value than an expansion of the Army, but I would suggest to Deputy Esmonde that, if we want to show our teeth at all in that matter, we could do so more effectively, as regards the French Republic, by economic sanctions than by military ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt whether Deputy Esmonde is correct in assuming that his attitude corresponds with that of the I.R.A. on this subject.  My own information as to their attitude, so far as I can gather it from their writings and speeches, is that they are far from wishing any expansion or improvement of our regular Army or of the Volunteer force, and I hardly think they will thank Deputy Esmonde for his effort to represent their views here to-day.  I would, however, suggest to <Col N="1539" /> the President and to the Executive Council that the Ministry of Lands and the Gaeltacht and Forestry has got very ample duties to perform, and that the Minister responsible for these things ought not to be distracted from them by looking after Defence as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most striking things that has disclosed itself with regard to the Department of Lands is the fact that was recently disclosed that, in spite of the fact that there was a separate Minister for Lands and a Parliamentary Secretary, the Land Commission told the House that they were unable to give any information as to what it cost to place a new holder on untenanted land.  Now figures have been given, and there has been fairly wide propaganda on the part of the Government that it was the Government's policy to place new holders on untenanted land, and, in fact, more than 2,000 persons have been so placed.  A promise was given to the House that the work of the Land Commission would be so conducted in future that this House would be able to be informed what it cost to put a new holder on a farm of untenanted land.  I should like to ask whether the saddling of one person with the responsibility of the Department of Defence and the Department of Lands is going to create the situation that this House will be able to be informed within a reasonable time what the cost of dividing untenanted land into new holdings is.  The matter is an important one.  It is, in my opinion, involving a very considerable expenditure of public money at the present time, and the sooner we get definite information as to what the cost of this division is, the better we will be able to make satisfactory provision for the proper distribution of untenanted land to occupiers, and the better we will be able to say how much money is going to be used on this and in what way it can be most satisfactorily used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say, Sir, that, from the point of view of the <Col N="1540" /> ordinary person, I think that, if there were a complaint about combining the two Ministries, Deputy MacDermot would be nearer the mark than Deputy Esmonde.  It is precisely because we do not think&mdash;or because I do not think, if you like&mdash;that at the present time it would be wise for the present Minister for Defence to sever his connection entirely with that Department that we have made the arrangement that he should continue on in that Department, and that he should be assisted in the Department of Defence by one Parliamentary Secretary and in the Department of Lands by another Parliamentary Secretary who has had already considerable experience in that Department.  I do not think there is any likelihood that the interests of either Department are going to suffer by the dual appointment. I do not suggest that it is an ideal arrangement, but I think it is the best I can do under the present circumstances, and it is for that reason that I make the nomination.</P>
      <P>With regard to some information for which Deputy Mulcahy asked, I do not think I was here at the time the matter was being dealt with, but I imagine the difficulty would be that there is a variety of cases and that all you would get at the end would be some sort of average figure which would not indicate in any precise form what the amount was.  I am sure that it varies from holding to holding and from allottee to allottee. I do not think it is necessary to keep the House any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the President's remarks, Sir, I may say that it was agreed that we would not ask for research into the past although we did consider that we could have been given some information.  It was definitely asserted, however, that future divisions would be handled in such a way that we would be able to be told what was the cost of placing a new holder on a new holding of land, taken from untenanted land.  In the making of these appointments, I should like to have a reiteration of that assurance that nothing now proposed to be done is going to prevent <Col N="1541" /> the House from being informed what is the cost of placing a new holder on untenanted land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The President The President">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions were raised on this section last evening, neither of which was cleared up.  One concerned the basis of calculation.  The Minister was not in a position to tell us what the exact amount of the fee would be.  The other question arose in connection with sub-section 5 which refers to information supplied by insurance companies.  The sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If any person, in an application for an assurance licence or in furnishing any information in pursuance of a requisition of the Minister under this section makes any statement which is false or misleading in any material respect, such a person shall be guilty of an offence...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think qualifying words are required there.  If some person makes a statement in answer to prescribed questions which is misleading he may have had no criminal intent at all. The form of words adopted is to the <Col N="1542" /> effect that a person who made a false statement did so with the intention of misleading and committed an offence. Perhaps the Minister would give some information on the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be impossible to determine what were the motives of the persons who when making the application furnished statements which were misleading.  The provisions of the sub-section are in the usual form.  If a person making an application makes a statement in support of it which is misleading in a material respect, that person commits an offence under the sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister reached any conclusion as to the probable amount of the fee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what the amount of the fee will be, but it will be the amount required to recoup the expenses that arise in the determination of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has in fact no idea of what the fee will be.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the point made by Deputy Dillon on sub-section (5), surely the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; ought to be inserted before the words &ldquo;false or misleading.&rdquo;  A statement might be false in the event of something subsequently transpiring, but when made may not in fact have been false to the knowledge of the person concerned.  As the section stands it puts the matter in the abstract.  If a thing is false in fact or is misleading in fact, whether or not the person who made the statement knew it to be false, or intended to mislead, he is liable to a criminal prosecution.  This certainly creates a new offence, leaving out the <i>mens rea</i> necessary in the criminal court.  I think the Minister should insert some such word as &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;false.&rdquo;  The other point on sub-section (2) returns to a matter that was discussed yesterday on some of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House has negatived the idea <Col N="1543" /> that the Minister should lay the regulations that he proposes to make on the Table of the House.  I should like to know from the Minister the general nature of the particulars which may be required.  The House will not have any method of ascertaining the information until the regulations are made, and even then Deputies will not know unless they are interested.  The Minister should give some information of the kind of particulars he will require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>The particulars will be such as will enable the Minister to determine whether he should grant an application for a licence or not.  Any Deputy studying the relevant sections of the Bill will see that the Minister must have information before he can determine such applications.  In Section 12 (3) certain provisions are set out to which a company applying under that section must conform. Obviously a company applying must state whether in fact it conforms to these conditions or not.  The same will apply to other provisions of the Bill.  The information sought will be information to enable the various matters that necessarily arise to be examined in accordance with the provisions of the Bill.  Decisions will be made in the light of the information supplied, and it is on the nature of the information required that the provisions of sub-section (5) are framed. In respect to these matters it is difficult to conceive how a statement misleading in a material respect could be made in error.  It is possible that some such statement might be made for the purpose of deceiving, and therefore the proposal in the sub-section makes it an offence to give information which in a material respect is misleading or false.</P>

      <P>If the Minister refers to precedents he will find that in many cases sections were so amended.  Sub-section (2) says that applications shall be in the prescribed form.  Are we to understand that the Minister reserves to himself the right to prescribe a separate form of application for each insurance company?  If the Minister was under the obligation of laying every prescribed document on the Table of this House any person applying for a licence could compare his application form with it.  That principle is not going to be followed in connection with the regulations made under this Bill, and so one insurance company may have a questionnaire addressed to it of a comparatively simple kind, while another company may have a questionnaire of quite another character addressed to it.  I do not think that is right.  The Minister <Col N="1545" /> should inform us whether that is his intention, and whether the class of examination referred to in the sub-section confers that power upon him. I think it does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious different questions will be addressed to different classes of insurance companies. The information we would require from a Saorstát company would be of an entirely different character from the information we would require from a foreign company. It is quite clear from the provisions of the Bill that the queries will be according to the class into which the company goes.</P>

      <P>So that we have a situation arising in which the Minister will be able to place any applicant for a licence under this Bill under a requisition of an indefinite character which may go on for ever, and this House is never informed, at any stage of the proceedings, what rights the Minister has under sub-section (2).  If a citizen of the State feels that the rights conferred on the Minister under sub-section (2) are oppressive, there is no means of raising it in this House.  There is no means of pinning the Minister down to any definite form of application in connection with his power here.  At this stage of the Bill details of this character may sound trivial.  I imagine when we were discussing the Conditions of Employment Bill, representations of this kind would have been heard with impatience by the House, but I think that if Deputies would ask people who have come within the scope of the Conditions of Employment Bill since it came into force, they would tell them that there are many minor points that they, had they been in this House, would have raised and argued very heatedly if they appreciated their significance when they appeared in the Bill.  They would tell them that they did not appreciate their significance until they came into operation.  I feel that sub-section (2) can become an instrument of oppression, and I object to it very strenuously.</P>

      <P>In every sub-section of this section of the Bill, as in every other part of the Bill, it appears that the Minister is given more than ample powers of control. I do not see what is the necessity for an over-riding condition of this kind.  It simply means that, if put into operation, any company which may conform with all the other requirements of the Bill will still acquire no rights under the Bill.  It all depends on the whim of the Minister or his officials. I think it is very unfair that companies which have in all other respects conformed to the other requirements of the Bill, should be ruled out just because some official in the Minister's Department objected to its coming within the scope of the measure, and that, in consequence of that, the company should be put to the cost and trouble of going into the High Court to get the decision of the Minister reversed.  I think the Minister should try to attempt to justify this provision in some way.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I could not agree to accept this amendment.  As the Deputy will have seen from the provisions of the Bill, in the case of solvent Saorstát companies, it is made mandatory on the Minister under the various sub-sections of this section to grant the licence applied for, subject to the over-riding condition that a company shall not be licensed except temporarily to do both life and non-life classes of business.  If the Minister refuses to grant a licence, as he may do, if the company has failed to make the required deposit, or if he has good reason for believing that the company is insolvent, then there is an appeal to the High Court.  I could not agree to accept an amendment which made it obligatory on the Minister to license <Col N="1547" /> companies which appear to him to be insolvent.  I think we must be given an opportunity of considering that aspect of the matter in relation to each application, bearing in mind that the applicant who is refused a licence has a right to appeal to the High Court.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After the coming into force of this part of this Act no foreign company shall be licensed to carry on&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I had a number of amendments more or less on the lines of this one and the amendment of the Labour Party which has not been moved.  By the way, I think it is a pity that the Labour Party is not here to discuss this amendment.  Perhaps they are unable to be present to-day owing to the convention which is being held elsewhere.  If that is the case, I <Col N="1548" /> think we should adjourn consideration of this measure to allow of their being present because this is a matter in which I think they should be interested. The Minister has apparently set his face against giving any concessions to the Saorstát companies. In that attitude I think he is very ill-advised.  He has told us that the native companies will receive consideration in the Bill in a different way from that which I have been trying to achieve by inserting these amendments. When he was asked to explain what were the advantages that the native companies were going to get, he said they were in the reinsurance provisions of the Bill. Then he admitted afterwards that the whole question of the reinsurance provisions is very problematical.  We do not know whether they are going to come into operation at all and certainly as they appear in the Bill, it does not appear as if they were going to be of any advantage to the Irish insurance companies.  The Minister has said that this Bill is not going to do any serious injury to the Irish companies.  I do not wish to go back over the arguments I have already used, but there is no doubt about it that if this Bill is put through in its present form, as a result of the partition measures in the Bill, it is going to destroy the identity of Irish companies and place them under other hardships which will put them at a serious disadvantage in competing with other companies. I would ask the Minister again to accept the amendment or to bring forward some alternative proposal which will indicate that there is a possibility of allowing native companies to do fire and accident business along solvent lines.</P>

      <P>This amendment and a number of other amendments of a somewhat similar kind raise directly the principle of the Bill.  The Deputy has stated that I have set my face against giving any consideration to the Saorstát companies.  I deny that emphatically.  In my opinion the Bill which is before the Dáil is the best possible measure that can be produced for the assistance of the Saorstát <Col N="1549" /> companies in the present stage of their development.  It is brought before the House here because we regard it in that light.  For reasons which I explained at length when introducing the measure, I do not think it advisable at the present time to exclude external companies from carrying on insurance business here.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to exclude foreign companies from doing certain classes of business.  Part of the amendment is designed to prevent their doing a class of business which is more profitable than any other class of business. I think that is the wrong way to set about restricting the activities of foreign insurance companies here.</P>

      <P>I think I have done so. If the Deputy studies the Bill closely and the statements which have been made as to the manner in which the provisions of the Bill will be operated, he will discover what, in my opinion, is the right way to deal with the position.  If we tried to do too much now, we might inflict very considerable harm not merely upon the country but also upon the Saorstát insurance companies.  It is necessary to encourage the growth of the Saorstát companies into strong organisations before any step forward from the position taken up in this Bill is attempted.  It is also, perhaps, necessary to emphasise that this Bill does not confer any privileges upon foreign insurance companies.  The right to receive a licence to carry on insurance business here is conferred upon foreign companies which have been doing these classes of business in the past.  If we were proposing to allow new foreign companies to come in or existing foreign companies to extend the classes of business in which they have been engaged, then it might be contended that we were giving them some privileges.  That is not proposed.  In fact, the only provisions contained in <Col N="1550" /> the Bill relating to foreign companies are provisions designed to allow these companies which were doing business in the past to continue to do it in the future, subject to the more severe restrictions which the Bill imposes upon all companies engaging in insurance.</P>

      <P>(a) the issued capital of such company is not less than two hundred thousand pounds and the paid-up capital of such company is not less than one hundred thousand pounds, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 is consequential on amendment No. 40. In all legislative measures which have for their object economic or financial charges which may result in people who have the opportunity of getting inside information, it is generally a point of honour for the Government to see that proposals which are afterwards to take legislative form are not forestalled and that nobody will be able to anticipate what the proposals will be.  We have had considerable information in the Press recently of a not too pleasant kind with regard to the divulging of Budget secrets.  The Press is so full of that information at the present time that I do not intend to make further comment upon it.  In connection with this particular Bill, I regret to say that something very similar to the revelation of a Budget secret seems to have taken place. After going over the genesis of this Bill, a measure was first introduced about 18 months ago.  The title and long title were placed before the Dáil. Between the introduction of that particular measure and the Second Reading of the Bill which we have now before us, a company happened to be incorporated in the Saorstát.  In dealing with a measure of this kind the Minister could have taken up two possible attitudes.  He could have said: &ldquo;I am introducing a measure which is going to deal with the insurance business of this country and, while that measure is going through the Dáil, I am going to see that no further insurance companies are established and that the status quo will remain until the Bill becomes law.&rdquo;  In the second place, he could have said: &ldquo;I am introducing this measure and the field will remain open until, finally, the Bill becomes law.  After that, I am not going to allow any other companies to start operations in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, after the First Reading of the Bill that preceded this Bill, a company was floated in this country and, as I said on a previous occasion, it did not get very much support from the public.  Everybody who knew anything about the condition of the market in Ireland realised that there was very little prospect of an Irish insurance company being floated successfully. <Col N="1552" /> Apart from the subscriptions of the directors, their friends and people intimately associated with them, the public took very little interest in that flotation.  To make up for that difficulty, the Industrial Credit Corporation came to the rescue and subscribed £56,000.  In addition to that, a corporation which was set up as a result of the intervention of the Dáil, a corporation which was given its status by the Dáil&mdash;the Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company, a company established for the purpose of providing insurance for local authorities at a lower premium than the premium which would be payable to other companies &mdash; subscribed £5,000 to this company, a company which, we must assume, will be in competition with itself for the fire business of public authorities.  This particular company was so constituted and its articles of association were so drafted that they fit, as the fingers of one's hand fit into a glove, into the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It so happens that that company has since been given practically a monopoly of the fire and accident business of this country which was previously done by Irish companies. A promising Irish company doing fire, general and life business could not drop its life business and do fire business.  They are blocked by Section 12 (9) of this Bill.  This company has been given practically a monopoly of the fire and general business previously done by Irish companies.  I think it is a very unfair thing that the old-time companies who actually travelled a very rough road in order to get to the present <Col N="1553" /> position should be shouldered aside by this new company, a company which I would describe as a cuckoo company. Apparently the old-time companies are to be shouldered aside; this new company is put in the position of eventually excluding all the other birds, and is to remain in the nest for the future.  That was what influenced me in introducing this amendment.  I think that such a company should not be started, and the Minister should not stand over giving it a monopoly in this country.</P>

      <P>There is something self-contradictory in Deputy Bourke's description of the origin of the new insurance company.  The Deputy suggests that in its origin it had the benefit of information as to the contents of the then forthcoming Insurance Bill.  At the same time the Deputy points to the failure of the company as a public flotation; the issue was not taken up.  It looks rather curious that people who were in possession of valuable information and who knew that this company would be in such a very exceptional position were prepared to make a present of the profit on 56,000 shares to a semi-State corporation.</P>

      <P>So far as I am informed, the capital is £500,000.  What are the provisions of this Bill concerning the directors?  It is that two-thirds of them should be Saorstát nationals.  Is there anything about that in the prospectus to which the Deputy refers?  The Deputy's allegations are based on very tenuous grounds.  That company was formed with a capital of £500,000; all the directors are Irish nationals and all the shares are owned by Irish nationals. Because the provisions of this Bill require that a new company must have an authorised capital of £200,000 and that two-thirds of its directors must be Irish nationals, the Deputy has jumped to a certain conclusion.</P>

      <P>Who says they cannot? The Deputy has said something about the Industrial Credit Corporation. The Industrial Credit Corporation is completely independent of Government influence.  Its board is not composed of Government officials.  I have nothing to do with the decision of the Industrial Credit Company.  I have nothing to say as to whether they grant a loan or as to whether they are to underwrite any issue.  The Industrial Credit Company entered into an agreement to underwrite the Insurance Corporation of Ireland's issue of stock.  Some part of the issue was not subscribed, and the Industrial Credit Company hold the shares.  How many I do not know.  That was not the only proposition that was put up to the Industrial Credit Company with a view to underwriting public issues.  There were other propositions of a similar nature put to that body.  The decision of the Industrial Credit Company not to underwrite or to support those issues was not influenced in any way by the Government or by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This business of making wild allegations without foundation of any kind is bringing the Dáil into disrepute.  It is a thing that the Deputy ought to discontinue.  It is not doing my reputation any harm, and it certainly is not doing the Deputy's reputation any good.  In this particular case it is just nonsense to say that there was information given to these people that was not given to <Col N="1557" /> others.  It is perfectly true that some weeks before the Bill was circulated to Deputies, a draft of the measure was given to everybody interested in industrial companies.  That is the only possible leakage of information to which the Deputy could refer.  Some weeks before the Bill was circulated to the House, every insurance company operating in this country received a copy of the Bill and was asked for its opinions concerning the measure.  That matter was discussed here.  I think I did quite right in providing for the circulation of these draft copies.  It enabled the insurance companies to make their representations concerning the provisions of the Bill, not merely to the Department of Industry and Commerce, but to Deputies in due time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>You gave them a very short time, a matter of days, although it took some seven years to produce the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other thing I want to say.  Some time before that, representatives of the Industrial Credit Corporation approached my Department and stated they had before them certain proposals for the underwriting of public issues relating to insurance propositions.  I understood there was not merely one, but a number of such propositions under consideration by the board of the company at the time, and, as a First Reading had been given to an Insurance Bill, they asked for information on this point, whether there was anything in the intended legislation which would make it impossible for any of the companies in the flotation of which they were asked to take an interest to carry on and which would justify them in delaying the public issues in each case until the legislation had been enacted.  They were advised that the nature of the proposals was such that there was no provision in the Bill which would make it illegal for such companies to engage in such business here, provided they qualified under the various provisions set out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that information was available to anybody who sought it at that time and, in fact, as Deputy Bourke well knows, there was a very large number of different insurance propositions <Col N="1558" /> being discussed in various circles at the same time, not all of which were proceeded with.  The particular company to which the Deputy refers was in no different position to any other company or group interested in a public issue in connection with insurance business and they got no information that was not available to anyone else.  In fact, their articles of association do not conform so closely to the provisions of the Bill as to justify the Deputy's suspicions. In one respect only is there similarity and in every other respect to which the Deputy refers the Deputy is wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I intervene on a point of personal explanation?  I said that the company got no information which was not available to anyone else.  That is a somewhat different statement to that which the Deputy attributed to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We will extract slowly the fact that these gentlemen did get information and did float the company with the consent and the approval of the Minister and we may get to the fact, after some time, that it was floated with the deliberate purpose of forming a repository into which would go the fire and accident business of all existing Irish companies who come within paragraph (b) of sub-section (4) of Section 12. Everybody knows that that was the purpose of this flotation.  Everybody knows these gentlemen must have <Col N="1559" /> been advised that there was some such provision in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I again state there was no such advice given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone knows these gentlemen must have had some knowledge that there was a proposal of this kind on the stocks; otherwise, being gentlemen of such high standing in commercial circles in this country, they would not have dreamt of floating a company of this kind, where you have already dozens of companies fighting for fire and accident business and quite unable to get enough to satisfy their present requirements. It is not a question of a series of Irish companies notoriously insolvent looking for fire or accident insurance risks.  Nothing of the kind is happening. I can think of at least four Irish companies operating here that are perfectly solvent and have funds adequate to meet any risk, and reinsurance treaties adequate to cover any conceivable risk that could be put up to them in regard to fire or accident. Let the House understand this, because an attempt will probably be made to put something over on the House in this regard, that fire and accident business bears no relation at all to life business.  Those of the Irish companies which are tariff companies confer complete immunity on any person offering them a risk.  The moment they accept the risk a tariff agreement enters into operation and the risk is spread over a series of companies with which the Irish company has reinsurance treaties.  Some of the Irish companies are not tariff companies and they have their reinsurance treaties with Lloyds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could arise in no rational person's mind any doubt of their security in giving a fire or accident insurance contract to any Irish tariff company or any company which had a reinsurance treaty with Lloyds.  In face of that situation we are asked to believe that a body of the most prominent business men in the country suddenly assembled and someone said: &ldquo;Boys, what about starting a new insurance company?&rdquo; and they all <Col N="1560" /> said: &ldquo;Yes, it will be great fun.&rdquo;  No one asked if there was going to be an Insurance Bill.  Perhaps somebody did and everybody said: &ldquo;It is a secret; we do not know what is in it.  It is a toss-up whether our company will be able to carry on profitably or not after this Bill passes, but let us take a chance.  We will not wait here.  We are a body of seven men going to ask the public for funds. We will not wait to see what is in the Bill.  When the Bill is published it may transpire that this cannot be carried on profitably, but let us take a chance.&rdquo;  These seven distinguished men then put their names to a prospectus of that kind.</P>
    <P>Does anybody outside Grangegorman believe a tale like that?  Of course they got the information that the proposal they were going to put before the people could be profitably carried on under the terms of the Bill, and I have no doubt they were told that it was highly likely the provisions of the Bill would materially assist a company of their standing in going in for the fire and accident business. The Minister, in his reply to Deputy Bourke, shows his own hand.  The policy of the Minister was to strip the fire and accident business off all the existing composite companies and leave two companies operating in the Saorstát, the Hibernian Insurance Company and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, controlled by Irish nationals, competing for the fire and accident business.  That was his policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the policy as stated by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister challenges Deputy Bourke on the point that he is leaving the two companies to compete for the fire and accident business. The Minister points out that that rebuts any suggestion of a monopoly. The Minister did not want to be put in the position of creating a monopoly for Irish companies; he wanted to be <Col N="1561" /> in a position to say to Deputy Bourke if he suggested there was going to be a monopoly in favour of the Hibernian Company: &ldquo;There is not; we are going to have the Hibernian and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.&rdquo; The purpose of setting up the Insurance Corporation is to provide a repository for the fire and accident business.  The Minister says that allegations of this kind bring discredit on the Dáil.  If the Minister will deal frankly with the Dáil it would be unnecessary to extract information from him just as if one were getting a cork out of a vintage wine bottle, breaking the cork half a dozen times before you extract the last scrap of it. Why did he not get up and tell us honestly and frankly that he wanted to have two insurance corporations, that he wanted to have two companies competing for fire and accident business? Why did he not tell them that, if this company was started, they stood a good chance of getting business?  If he had gone to all the insurance companies and told them that neither Deputy Bourke nor I would have any trouble.  But what I certainly complain of is that under a cloud of anonymity and secrecy a certain group of honourable citizens are put in an extremely ambiguous position of having taken action which can only be explained by the fact that they had some information from the Minister that nobody else had.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have inferences, drawn from a series of incidents that have taken place, sufficient to satisfy anybody who is not an inmate, or who ought not to be an inmate, of the Grangegorman Lunatic Asylum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are the facts, and the Minister, it is perfectly obvious, <Col N="1562" /> knows that those facts are true.  If he had told them out honestly and frankly at the beginning there would be no necessity for any trouble at all, but the Minister delights in conducting clandestine transactions of this kind and of doing the petty dictator in Upper Merrion Street.  That is what has given rise to all the trouble.  If he took Parliament into his confidence no difficulty would arise.  I think that the circumstances surrounding that flotation are undesirable.  They are undesirable as a result of secrecy. There would have been no objection at all if the Minister had made a public statement giving to every insurance company in the country the same notice that he gave to these.  Now Deputy Bourke puts in an amendment to alter the year to 1934, but that would have operated this insurance company out of existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to support the Deputy in doing that, and I will state my reasons why.  The Minister for good or ill&mdash;I think for ill&mdash;is the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and if the Minister, through his indiscretions, leads a body of honourable citizens into committing themselves financially to a project of this kind, then I think the House is bound to stand over what the Minister has done.  I do not believe, and I know that neither Deputy Bourke nor anybody believes, that the Minister has been engaged in some transaction designed to secure for himself, or for anyone in whom he is personally interested, a material reward.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I do not think it is true.  If I thought it were, I would say it.  The Minister, because he looks upon himself as a little Hitler, a little tin god, dispensing lordly favours <Col N="1563" /> from Merrion Street, has got himself into silly messes of this kind.  I do not think that we should visit the consequences of the Minister's folly on the heads of enterprising citizens who have fallen in with what I believe to have been the Minister's suggestion.  I have no doubt, however, that he represented to these gentlemen that a proposal of this kind would be useful from the national point of view.  I think that he acted foolishly in making the suggestion, and I think he ought to be warned by what has happened and not go on with that kind of codology in the future.  If he has a plan of this kind in mind, then he ought to open his mind to Parliament and allow the suggestion to come from Parliament and not from the inner sanctums of Upper Merrion Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to point out that the enactment of this amendment would not alter the position of any insurance company in relation to the Bill, and, therefore, it is entirely unnecessary.  I do not propose to deal with the impertinences of Deputy Dillon but, in case any one should be misled by what he has said as to my attitude, I want to make the position clear and to say that I hope to see not one but at least half a dozen Irish insurance companies, with the same financial resources as the strongest of the existing Saorstát companies, formed to engage in fire and accident business here.  I hope that the operation of this measure will result in the formation of such companies, and that its introduction will induce people to take the necessary steps to that end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I, no more than Deputy Dillon, have no intention of penalising the people who, as a result of this company being established, took shares in it; or of preventing them from competing in the ordinary way for insurance business.  This amendment, which is really a consequential amendment, and the other amendments in my name were put down in order to clear the air on this particular point.  In my opinion this is a method of doing business that should not commend itself to the Minister or to anybody else.  If the <Col N="1564" /> Minister had taken the various other companies into his confidence and consulted them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he would have got co-operation from them in drafting this Bill.  We all realise that there is a difficulty in dealing with the situation in the country, but if the Minister had done that he would have got full co-operation.  This hole-and-corner method of doing business is not satisfactory. The Minister says that he hopes there will be half a dozen Irish insurance companies formed to engage in fire and accident business here.  If people want to start a company they must first of all have a paid-up capital of £100,000.  In view of the experience of this particular company which could not even get £50,000 from the board, how does he think that six new companies are going to get the amount of money that they would require from the Industrial Credit Corporation? Does he think that people are going to invest their money in these companies to compete against the one already established?</P>

      <P>It is perfectly true. Deputy Bourke made the allegation that a particular company, for some reason which I do not know, was given privileges which were not available to <Col N="1565" /> others.  Deputy Bourke is a director of an insurance company, and, presumably, he knows the contacts that exist between that insurance company and my Department.  I invite him or any other Deputy who is familiar with the business relations between insurance companies in this State and my Department&mdash;they are continuously coming to the Department and getting information from it on matters relating to the intentions of the Government, or as to the nature of the legislation that we have in contemplation, and have discussed these matters with me on many occasions&mdash;to say that they were not given the fullest information that it was possible to give.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Long before the Bill was circulated, and long before the heads of the Bill were drafted.  The managing director of the company in which the Deputy is interested had many discussions with me as to the nature of the legislation that might be introduced.  The Association of Irish Insurance Companies sent deputation after deputation to put forward their proposals.  These proposals were discussed at length, and various objections to them were pointed out and answered.  Perhaps it is too much to say that they were fully aware, but at any rate they had a general idea of the lines that the legislation to be introduced were likely to take.  The people who are concerned with the particular insurance company that the Deputy has attacked had no more information on that point than other people interested in the extension of existing insurance businesses or in the establishment of new ones.  They had no more information than was given to the parties who acquired the equity in the Hibernian Insurance Company, or the parties associated with proposals for the formation of other insurance companies which have not yet been created, no more information than was available to the existing Saorstát companies who were interested in various projects of one kind or another, and Deputy Bourke is in a position to get full information upon that point. <Col N="1566" /> He is in a position to know that, and if he had made the inquiries he should have made before committing himself to these statements in the Dáil, I do not think the speech he delivered here would have been delivered.</P>

      <P>The Deputy stated that I said that all the information that could be asked for by insurance companies was supplied.  I made no such statement.

      <P>That is a very much more moderate statement than that which <Col N="1567" /> the Minister first made.  Certain discussions did take place from time to time between the Minister and representatives of the Irish insurance companies, but I am not aware that, at so early a stage as April, 1935&mdash;15 months ago&mdash;the Irish companies had any definite information as to the nature of Section 12, sub-section (4) (b).  My submission is that it is perfectly clear that that information was available at that time to somebody.  The Minister works himself up into a rage with regard to this matter, and endeavours to suggest that allegations of corruption are being made against him and his Department.  I want to make this very clear, that, when I consider it necessary to make an allegation against the Minister, or any of his officials, of corruption, that is to say, the acceptance of a bribe or personal advantage for communicating confidential information to outside persons, I shall make that charge.  Until I make it, I do not want to have it saddled upon me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Bourke very properly drew the attention of the House to the fact that while that kind of talk was going on, it was very necessary that we should make it perfectly clear that we in this House have no reason to believe, or any desire to allege, that there is any corruption of that character in the Minister's Department. As I say, when there is, I shall allege it, but it is quite another thing to allege, as we do now, that the Minister acts with indiscretion and, in effect, unjustly, in taking to himself the dictatorial powers he longs to enjoy and a wide discretion as to what consultations he will enter into and at what stage these may properly be entered into.  This is exactly the same issue that arises in connection with licences and a variety of other matters in his Department.  The Minister wants to arrogate to himself the right to decide finally as between the rights of one citizen and another, and that is a matter upon which we challenge <Col N="1568" /> him.  We say that the exercise of that right is indiscreet and undesirable in this case, and I think it has been pretty clear from the debate here that while the Minister's first position was that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland had no information that everybody else had not got at any time, or did not know anything about what was contained in the Insurance Bill, other than the Long Title, it now emerges that, in fact, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland had very extensive information, was given abundant information, and the Minister goes on to say that similar information was given to everybody else.  That is a very different position from the position taken up by the Minister when this matter was first mentioned and, I think, something much closer to the truth than his first suggestion.  At the same time, I think it is a pity that the thing should have proceeded along the lines it has, and I suggest that, in future, if the Minister thinks it desirable to communicate prognostications of the contents of impending legislation which would affect vested interests in this country he should communicate them by way of White Paper and distribute them broadcast amongst all interested parties and not wait for certain parties to come to his office and ask questions, while others who want information just as badly do not approach him at all and have to do without.  Let him draw up a memorandum of so much information as he is prepared to publish and make that available to everybody.  In that event, nobody will be entitled to complain.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> I do not see why the Minister is so keen on the figure of £200,000 issued capital and £100,000 paid-up capital.  I think a much smaller amount, say, £35,000, would be much better in the conditions obtaining in this country for the establishment of a company.  The Minister must realise that, after all, capital is not such an important thing in an insurance company.  A company with a large fund, with an expanding business and doing a profitable business is in a very much sounder position than a company started top-heavy with capital, which is never able to build up a fund or to do the type of business sufficient to maintain it.  Unless the Minister, for some reason, is wedded to the figures of £200,000 and £100,000, I think he should accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, perhaps, not correct to say that I am wedded to the particular figures in the Bill, but I think it is necessary in order to protect the insuring public that we should require that companies commencing to undertake insurance business should, in future, be provided with adequate capital resources.  The proposals in the Bill are, in our opinion, not unreasonable. The acceptance from the public of immediate subscriptions for the purpose of providing benefits at some indefinite date in the future carries with it a very grave responsibility.  An institution accepting that responsibility puts itself in the position of a trustee towards its clients, and where so many opportunities exist for mismanagement and misapplication of funds, it is essential that those who undertake this class of business should themselves possess reasonable financial strength to justify the trust which their clients place in them.  Failure in the past by insurance companies to meet their obligations has resulted from the fact that they started business without sufficient capital.  The best way to protect the public against what I may call mushroom insurance companies, is the requirement of a minimum paid-up capital.  In fixing a minimum at a sum of £100,000 we do not think we are fixing an excessive figure.  I may say that the question arose as to the formation of a new company to take over the fire and accident business of certain <Col N="1570" /> Saorstát composite companies, and, possibly, Deputy Bourke has some such matter as that in his mind.  I caused to be intimated to certain parties interested my willingness to consider an amendment to the Bill which would permit such a company to operate, irrespective of this provision, provided that it was reasonably sound in capital, even though the capital resources did not reach the figure mentioned in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to have that matter considered.  There is on me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, an obligation to see that any such company is reasonably sound and likely to succeed.  But having regard to the fact that any such Saorstát company, entitled to do fire and accident business at present, will be entitled to do so although not having the same resources as mentioned in the Bill, I am willing to put into that position a new company formed for the purpose of taking over, and carrying on this fire and accident business, but the whole scheme is subject to the new company being a sound one.  I am sure there should be no difficulty in that if the companies concerned are anxious to proceed in the matter.  But in regard to new companies to be started after the Bill becomes law, I do not think the requirement of a minimum capital of £100,000 is excessive.  My feeling in that regard is all the stronger, because I am anxious to see a number of such companies started, as I said; but I would dislike very much to see a number of companies started that did not possess the strength and resources indicated in the Bill.  I do not think, when the Bill becomes law and the manner of its operation becomes known, that there will be difficulty in securing the co-operation of the investing public in establishing such companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically the same argument holds good in both cases.  I think there is no justification on the part of the Minister for splitting up these Saorstát companies, and not allowing them to carry on as composite bodies&mdash;those companies which are already composite bodies.  This amendment is put down for the purpose of enabling any company, at present a composite company, to continue as such if it so desires.  As I said, when speaking on an earlier amendment, the real hardship consists in that.  By the licensing provisions in the Bill, the Minister puts all companies, irrespective of their genesis or antecedents, whether foreign or native, on the same level.  Once they get a licence, the general public will regard them as on the same footing.  They will not get any business by merely being labelled Saorstát companies. That was one advantage that native companies had, in the past, over foreign corporations, but in every other respect they were in a position to get business that the others could not. The cream of the business has been skimmed off by foreign companies. When the Minister brings into force the licensing provision he will do away with any advantage that the native company had.  Also, by what I call his partition proposals, he destroys the identity of the Irish companies, and by destroying their identity he destroys their good-will.  These companies while in existence had time to build up a reputation of giving good service to the <Col N="1572" /> public generally.  That good-will was worth a considerable amount of money, and was more valuable in some respects than their capital.  Under the Bill, also, the overhead charges will be increased.  They will not be increased actually, but every overhead charge which covered the two halves of the business will now be incurred to cover only one half of the line.  Everyone will realise how composite companies will suffer when half of their business is taken away from them.  Such companies at head office and in the country will only have one class of business to attend to as compared with the time when they were composite companies.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  The conditions under which insurance will be done here will be more onerous than in other countries, particularly in Great Britain.  The foreign companies do about 10 per cent. of their business in this country.  No matter how bad conditions are here it would pay them to carry on and to wait on until the native companies went to the wall.  When the Irish companies are knocked out of business then the foreign companies will make their own terms with the Minister.  For this reason I think the Minister should be very slow in going ahead with this provision.  I know his main reason in insisting upon it is because of the fact that companies doing composite business are under great temptation to support their fire and accident business out of their life business.  Certainly it is a practice which should not be tolerated, and I myself would be willing to support the Minister in taking most drastic powers to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did make a suggestion on another portion of the Bill, but a person is at a disadvantage in trying to introduce an amendment, because you have to attach the amendment to something, and it is not always satisfactory. However, I am making the suggestion that the Minister should make the regulations as drastic as possible, so that it would be impossible for companies in future to deal with their funds in this way.  I think that would be a more satisfactory way of dealing with the matter than this way of cutting the companies in two, and leaving them with top-heavy overhead expenses, thus <Col N="1573" /> adding very considerably to the great task that the Irish companies, and, in fact, all insurance companies have, of bringing the expense ratio down to a proper level.  It is not lack of capital so much as the difficulty of reducing expenses that has been the bane of Irish companies.  Let the Minister's intentions be what they will, I am afraid that he is not going to improve the conditions under which Irish companies are doing business by insisting on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment of Deputy Bourke's raises, as he has stated, the question of the principle embodied in the section.  Beyond partitioning the business of life and general, accident, and all these other kinds of businesses it also raises some other points of detail on the proposal contained in paragraph (b) of the sub-section.  I would prefer to deal with the general principle underlying the idea of the partitioning of the two classes of business when speaking on the section as a whole, but I may, in the course of the remarks I have to make on the amendment, make some observations on the general principle. Before I do so, I should like some explanation from the Minister as to the precise significance of paragraph (b) of this sub-section.  I confess that I find the sub-section as it stands extremely difficult to construe. So far as I have been able to satisfy myself as to its meaning and intent, the sub-section appears to impose on Irish companies, which have hitherto been carrying on a composite business, the necessity of doing one of two things.  They must either, immediately this Bill becomes law, drop their fire and general business, or else apply to the Minister for a licence to carry on fire and general business in conjunction with their life business for the purpose of enabling them to amalgamate with another company and also to transfer their fire and general business to still another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside for the moment the position of an Irish office which has hitherto been carrying on a composite business, a life and general business, where the company decides to drop its general accident business, let us <Col N="1574" /> consider the position where they want to get rid of that business.  Under the proposal in paragraph (b) they cannot merely transfer their general and accident business to another company. They must, first of all, amalgamate themselves as a life office with another life office or offices.  Then they must find some other company to take over their general and accident business.  So that you have this extraordinary position of an existing company carrying on, prior to the passage of the Bill into law, fire, general, accident and life business, and when the Bill becomes law, it can no longer carry on a composite business. It must carry on life and industrial insurance and, either drop the rest of its business, or proceed to amalgamate with another company.  If it wants to carry on its composite business for a short time, it can only do so on the conditions laid down in paragraph (b).  It must then, not merely carry on its life business, but it must find some other company to amalgamate with to carry on that life business.  Then, having found that company, it must still find a third company to take over its general and accident business.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the necessity for this complicated provision.  I could understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;I will not allow a company to carry on a composite business which it had previously carried on; it must elect between carrying on life and industrial business and general and accident insurance.&rdquo;  There is no power in this Bill to enable an Irish company carrying on a composite business to elect. It can only carry on life and industrial business.  As far as I have been able to ascertain from a perusal of Section 12, an existing Irish company carrying on a composite business cannot elect to drop life and industrial business and carry on general business. It must drop its general business or amalgamate its life business with another company, and then find a third company to take over its general business.</P>
    <P>I am quite unable to understand what is the significance of these proposals, what is the meaning of them. Why must an existing composite office, <Col N="1575" /> in order to get rid of, or to get more value for its general business have to amalgamate itself with another company in order to carry on its life business in getting rid of its general business?  I cannot see the point of that.  I do not know what is the meaning of it, nor do I appreciate what the Minister thinks will emerge from these complicated provisions.  As a practical proposition, I should say it would be an entirely impossible achievement, and the net result of Section 12 (4) (b), so far as its effect on an Irish composite office, if passed into law as it stands, will be that each of the Irish composite offices will be obliged to drop its general business. They will not be able to sell that business to either of the two existing general offices in the Free State at present because, obviously, neither the Hibernian Insurance Company nor the Insurance Corporation of Ireland will pay anything for an asset which they can ultimately get for nothing by simply sitting down and waiting and doing nothing.</P>
    <P>What is to become of the policyholders between the period when the Bill becomes law and the expiration of their policies?  The company has no funds.  It cannot carry on business; it cannot collect premiums, but, nevertheless, policies exist on which liabilities to a very considerable extent may accrue.  Who is to pay these policyholders? Who is to indemnify them against the risk covered by the policies?  Suppose I have a policy with an Irish company at present indemnifying me over a period of 12 months against my liability under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and this Bill becomes law, say, next month.  I have paid one single premium covering me for 12 months.  A workman in my employment meets with an accident in September, as a result of which he is incapacitated for life.  Who is going to indemnify me against that liability? The Company with which I am insured cannot do so because they will be put out of business by this Bill when it becomes law.  There is no company ready and willing to take over that liability, and, as I understand it, the <Col N="1576" /> effect of Section 12 (4) (b) on policyholders will or may be disastrous. Those are matters that I certainly would like the Minister to clear up. As I say, I propose to leave over the general question of partitioning business until we come to deal with the matter as a whole on the section, but assuming for the moment that this sub-section (4) (b) is going to be passed into law, I should like the Minister to direct his attention to the points I have raised and on which I am anxious to obtain information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disposed to agree with Deputy Costello that it is desirable that we should discuss the principle of the division of business on the section rather than on this amendment, although the amendment has more direct relation to it.  My feeling, however, as to the wisdom of that course is based on the old adage that hard cases make bad law.  I think that the case made by Deputy Bourke is a case which might appeal to Deputies, although not directed against the principle, because it is based on the inconvenience or difficulties that may be created for particular organisations by the application of the principle to them in present circumstances.  I think that we should not fail to enact what is in my opinion a good principle, and a good provision to have in our insurance legislation, merely because it is going to create certain immediate difficulties.  Those difficulties can be got over, and when the initial period has passed the operation of the principle will be such as to result in a considerable improvement in the general machinery for the conduct of insurance business here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello raised certain points arising from the phraseology used in paragraph (b) of sub-section (4).  I agree, and in fact I stated here upon another stage, that the phraseology of the section may require to be recast.  It may require to be revised apart altogether from any additional provisions that may be inserted in the Bill, but, if the development to which I referred on the previous amendment should take more definite shape, some further amendment of the paragraph may be necessary in any case.  It is <Col N="1577" /> the intention to provide that if a Saorstát insurance company, doing life or industrial business, and in a position that its solvency cannot be questioned, desires to continue to do life business, there should be no power to interfere with it.  When saying that, I stress at the same time my point of view that the amalgamation of existing life and industrial assurance businesses, particularly industrial assurance businesses, is desirable, and the whole trend of Government policy and of the legislation enacted here should be in that direction.  We are not, however, taking any powers to compel foreign companies to participate in any scheme of amalgamation, nor should we in these circumstances have power to compel an Irish company to participate in a scheme of amalgamation, unless there is in the circumstances of that company something which makes it desirable to do so.</P>
    <P>There is this, however, in the provisions of the Bill, relating to the Saorstát and foreign companies to which Deputy Costello refers; as the Bill stands, a Saorstát composite office can, if it desires to do so, continue its life business and must dispose of its general business, whereas a foreign composite office can dispose of its life business and continue to carry on general business.  The reason why the Bill is framed in that manner is because in the case of the Saorstát companies it seems that the general branch business, if divorced from the life branch, would not be supported by adequate resources to justify the granting of licences to the separate companies.  I anticipate, however, that the companies may put forward proposals or a plan for some mutual arrangement for continuing their general branch business in a manner which will offer sufficient safeguards to the insuring public. As I have indicated, I am prepared in those circumstances to effect the necessary amendment to the measure on the next Stage.</P>
    <P>There is also, of course, the point to which some Deputy referred last night, that a Saorstát composite company can only transfer its general business to another Saorstát company, whereas a foreign company can transfer to a <Col N="1578" /> foreign company.  The sole reason why the Bill is framed in that manner is because it is designed to develop national insurance business, and it would be against that object to allow the transfer of the general business of any Saorstát composite office to a foreign company.  In reply, therefore, to the points made by Deputy Costello, I admit at once that the wording of the section may have to be revised when the next Stage of the Bill is reached.  It is not intended to prevent a Saorstát company continuing in life business where the circumstances of the company are such that there can be no public grounds for preventing it from doing so.  It is proposed that a Saorstát composite office can only dispose of its general business.  It can dispose of that general business not merely to some existing Saorstát company, but also to a new company to be established in accordance with the provisions of the Bill, or, as I have indicated earlier, to a new company to be established for the purpose, which would be facilitated by an amendment to the Bill which I am prepared to entertain.  In relation to the foreign companies, a wider discretion is given &mdash;foreign composite companies are not subject to the restriction that they must dispose of their business to Saorstát companies.  It might be difficult to arrange for that under the circumstances; nor do I think that it is necessary, bearing in mind that the Bill is designed by another method to increase the amount of Irish insurance business handled by Saorstát offices, and that we are relying upon that alternative method rather than on any direct transfer such as might be suggested, and is, in fact, suggested in some of the amendments moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that the principle which is dealt with in this amendment can be appropriately discussed in discussing the section as a whole, at the same time I feel that this amendment is directed towards removing from the Bill the provision which is the most objectionable from the point of view of the Saorstát companies. If the amendment were carried, it would kill the whole principle of partition.  I think there can be no <Col N="1579" /> question that it is extremely hard lines on those Saorstát composite offices which, for the last 12 or 15 years, have built up their businesses on both legs, as Deputy Bourke called it yesterday, and which were carrying on both businesses on a sound basis, their accounts being kept separate, and both sides of their business being kept financially sound.  Taking their general business from such companies, undoubtedly, will place many of them in a position that will make it extremely difficult for them to carry on their life business. Their agents throughout the country have been carrying on both ends of the business, and while their time was mostly devoted to collecting industrial premiums or looking out for ordinary branch business, at the same time it was part of their duty to canvass, where they saw an opening, for life or general business as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that, undoubtedly, the effect of this proposal will be to render a good many of those people redundant and I am afraid that it will also have the effect, in spite of the proposal in the Bill that there can only be a transfer of the business to Saorstát companies, that eventually a considerable amount of the business will be transferred to foreign companies. At the actual moment of transfer, perhaps, it will be possible to carry the business over to either one or more Saorstát companies, if those companies accept the liabilities during the current year of insurance; but when that year has expired, if, for instance, as a result of the transfer the employe or the resident inspector of one or more composite offices finds himself redundant and out of a job, he will be snapped up, or may be snapped up, by one of the foreign companies.  Anyone who knows anything of insurance business, especially of our fire and general insurance business, knows that it is to a large extent a very personal business and that the resident inspectors in the various counties have very great influence with the persons who insure; that mostly persons who are insuring against fire or against other contingencies of that kind are, to a great extent, indifferent as to what company <Col N="1580" /> covers their risk.  There may be some, of course, who would be very insistent that their business should be done with Saorstát companies, but I should say that, for the most part, persons would be quite willing to go along with the particular inspector with whom they had been doing their business all the time and that if he came along and canvassed them and said: &ldquo;These people have fired me,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I have lost my job with the company as a result of the Insurance Act of 1935, and I am now doing business with another company&mdash;a foreign company&mdash;and will you continue to do your business through me?&rdquo;&mdash;if such inspectors came along in that way, I have no doubt that they could influence 75 per cent. of the premium incomes they were accustomed to collect and that they could influence it in whatever direction they wished.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these companies have spent considerable sums in building up their fire and general business. There has been a great deal of enthusiasm, during years past, put into the making of that business, and they are now to jettison it without any provision whatever for compensating them for the work they have put into it and for the money they have spent in creating it.  I see no provision in the Bill dealing with that question.  This amendment should be pressed to a division, personally, because I think that the provision in the Bill&mdash;I refer to Section 12, sub-section (4), paragraph (b)&mdash;is probably the most objectionable provision in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has justified his refusal to listen to the appeals made to him by Deputy Bourke by reference to the old adage that hard cases make bad law.  I think the Minister misapplied that adage, because here we are making the law and I think that Deputy Bourke's point is that we should make bad law in order to create hard cases. However, as we will have to consider this general principle on the section, I do not propose to go into it at the moment beyond indicating this: that I have not yet heard from the Minister any reason whatever justifying this <Col N="1581" /> principle of partition either in reference to Irish companies or in reference to British companies.  I approach the proposals in this Bill with the knowledge that the Minister has a difficult problem to meet and solve.  I approach those considerations with rather an open mind&mdash;prepared to be convinced, if the Minister can put up sufficient reasons justifying the principle of the partitioning of business that is enshrined in Section 12 of this Bill in reference to both sets of companies carrying on business.  However, until such reasons have been given to me, justifying the conclusion that this is the best way of meeting that problem which exists in this country, and in the absence. of any reasons up to date, I agree that we must vote against the proposals contained in sub-section (4) of Section 12 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I hope I am not unduly optimistic in inferring from the Minister's remarks that he himself does not like the provisions of paragraph (b) of sub-section (4).  As I explained when I was speaking, I find them, from the point of view of phraseology alone, almost incomprehensible and, from the point of view of principle, entirely beyond my comprehension.  The Minister stated he anticipates that proposals may be put to him by the Irish companies to carry out a plan for the transfer of their existing insurance business to another company to be formed under this Bill.  If his anticipations are realised that will be all to the good, but anybody who has had any experience of the amalgamation of business knows of the almost insuperable difficulties that he in the way of carrying out successful amalgamations.  It takes no great imagination to see what tremendous difficulties there are in the way of staffs, in the way of carrying the burden of existing liabilities, and providing for the continuance of the good-will of each of the amalgamated concerns in the new concern.  A host of other matters will fall to be met with before any such plan as the Minister anticipates will be brought to a successful achievement.  Personally, I hope the Minister's optimism is <Col N="1582" /> justified.  Of course, he is a most optimistic Minister in every respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think some sort of Coueism could hardly bring about what is proposed.  I press the Minister between this and the next Stage to reconsider Section 12, not merely in the light of its phraseology but in the light of the principle involved.  I cannot see why any existing Irish composite office should not be allowed to carry on that business for a period specified in the Bill if necessary, which would enable that company to transfer the general business to some other company and to realise some tangible asset in return for the goodwill which will be transferred.  The proposal, if it stands, will benefit two companies. All they have to do under the Bill as it stands is to sit down and the business will fall into their laps.  I do not say that that principle is enshrined in paragraph (c).  If so, I should strongly object to it.  The existing companies have something in the nature of good-will of their general business, which ought to be realisable as a saleable asset.  The Minister, in paragraph (b) of Section 12 (4), is taking something away from these composite offices. That may not be his intention, but certainly that is the result of the proposal in paragraph (b).  On the Report Stage, the Minister ought to make provision to enable these companies to carry on their business pending sale or transfer to another company.  They ought not to be in the position of being obliged to get rid of an asset, which ought to be a saleable asset. The goodwill ought to be worth something to them, and they ought to be able to realise on it, because their business is very seriously interfered with by the Bill.  One other point I should like to refer to.  It came rather as a surprise to hear the Minister stating that he was anxious to see numerous other Irish companies being formed to carry on general accident business.  So far as I was concerned, that was certainly something in the nature of a startling statement to come from the Minister.  I would have <Col N="1583" /> thought that we had at present, between British, foreign, and Irish companies, sufficient people to prey upon this country.  If we are going to have let loose the numerous other Irish companies that the Minister wishes to see started under the Bill, I do not know what is going to happen in the way of cut-throat competition. It may be that it would be good for the ordinary person who wishes to insure his life, his motor-car, or his servants, but I doubt that very much.  I should like to know what is the reason underlying the Minister's tremendous desire to see numerous other Irish companies formed to carry on general accident business.  We have plenty of accidents in this country, but I do not see that we have a sufficient population to support numerous Irish companies, the existing Irish companies, numerous British companies, as well as foreign companies.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to enlighten us as to his reason for making the extraordinary statement he made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement had the same effect on me as it had on Deputy Costello, that of letting loose a number of new companies on the people.  I would not like to see an increased number of companies here.  I would like to see a number of the companies we have carrying on insurance business more efficiently, and getting a greater number of people to cover their potential liabilities by way of insurance, because it seems to me that in that respect we are a long way behind other countries.  What we want is not a greater number of new companies, but to be sure that the companies operating here will be able to meet their liabilities when they arise.  As far as I am concerned my position on the amendment is this: I am prepared to go as far as possible with the Minister to ensure that the money set aside to meet the claims of life and industrial policy holders is not going to be taken for any other purpose.  As far as the Minister's intention is concerned I think it is a sound one, but I am not satisfied that the only solution of the problem to be tackled is the proposals in Section 12.  Does the <Col N="1584" /> Minister contend that he has not been able to devise any measure short of forcing the companies to divide their business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that it was more or less agreed that we would discuss the general principle on the section?  At present we are confining ourselves to the phraseology of sub-section 4 and Deputy Bourke's amendment. I did not deal with the general principle at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was intimated that before we deal with the general principle of the section a division will be taken on the amendment.  That seems to me to alter the position.  I do not see how we could divide on the amendment without discussing the general principle.  Deputy Lynch stated that if the amendment was carried it would remove most of the objections to Section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It would only terminate this provision in so far as it relates to Saorstát companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that that is the real trouble with most people as far as it relates to Saorstát companies.  I am in favour of the Minister's intention so far as it relates to all companies, whether foreign or Irish.  Anyone who gives it thought realises that there is danger in the present position.  I am not at all satisfied that, in order to safeguard the policy holders from that danger, it is necessary to insist on the companies dividing up their business.  Deputy Lynch stated quite rightly that, so far as the Irish companies, or any companies similarly situated are concerned, it is going to throw a great burden and great overhead expenses on companies in their infancy if they are compelled to carry on without fire and general business.  The Minister knows quite well that in the case of Irish or any other companies starting, for the first 20 years their expenses are very much higher than the expenses of companies that have been in existence for a longer period.  It is known to the Minister and to Deputies that the fire and general insurance business has <Col N="1585" /> been of great assistance to Irish companies. I doubt if the Irish companies would be able to carry on if the Minister's present intention was given effect to, because it means a loss of their fire and general insurance business, and means more than that&mdash;an increase in the expense ratio.  It means also that you are going to kill the confidence of the people of this country in Irish companies.  The people will be very slow to effect either life or industrial insurance with them.</P>
      <P>Whilst I am saying that, I want to make it clear that if the Minister can prove to the House that, in order to safeguard fully the interests of policy holders, nothing short of what is contained in the Bill will suffice, then as between the companies and the policy holders I am with him.  I am not at all satisfied, however, that the Minister cannot find safeguards sufficient for the policy-holders' interests without forcing the position that has been forced in the Bill.  The Minister has talked about this only having certain immediate effects on the company and as if these difficulties would disappear in a year or two.  He knows that this is not so. There will be certain very lasting effects, certain very definite effects as far as a number of the companies are concerned but, as I say, if this is the only solution we have, and we have to take this step in order to safeguard the policy holder, then let us take it.  I am not, however, prepared to go as far as the Minister suggests until such time as he has informed the House that nothing short of what is contained in the Bill will provide adequate safeguards for policy holders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no way of preventing the use of life policy-holders' funds for general branch purposes otherwise than by effective separation of the classes of insurance as proposed in the Bill.  In any event, if the Bill contains that principle at all, it should apply to all classes of insurance companies, both Saorstát companies and foreign companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly <Col N="1586" /> contemplate a position in which you would have a separation of businesses forced on the foreign companies and permitted, as this amendment is designed to permit it, in the case of a Saorstát company.  On the other question raised by Deputy Costello, I may say that the aim of the Bill is to ensure that a much greater proportion of the general business arising hereafter will be done by the Saorstát companies. We believe it will be effective to that end.  Because of that, it is clear that additional Saorstát companies will be required to handle it.  The existing companies could not handle more than a small proportion of the total of general insurance business arising here.  In any event, in relation to that class of business, the existence of a number of separate units, provided each of the units is sufficiently strong, is an advantage and not a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very questionable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I do not think anybody who has interested himself in this matter will take another point of view.  In relation to general insurance business, there are advantages in having a number of separate units, provided each of the units is in itself adequately capitalised and is possessed of sufficient resources to put its stability and security beyond question.  I do not quite know what Deputy Costello meant by the existing insurance companies preying on the public, because he used that phrase in a sentence in which he also referred to cut-throat competition.  When he suggests that the Companies Association may sit around a table and say &ldquo;Let us prey,&rdquo; does he mean that they are going to increase the cost of insurance?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the usual sense in which that phrase is used.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (4) (b), line 26, after the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; and at the end of paragraph (b), line 30, after the word &ldquo;company&rdquo; to add the following words and figures:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or for a period of three years to enable such company to form a subsidiary company for the purpose of transferring the said other assurance business of such company to such subsidiary company&mdash;such subsidiary company to have a nominal capital of not less than £100,000 with minimum paid-up capital of £35,000.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>From what the Minister has said, this amendment should commend itself to him.  He said he was anxious that an Irish company should be formed which would take over the business that the composite offices would be forced, under paragraph (b), to transfer to some other Saorstát company.  I am not tied down to the amendment as it stands in the sense that this provides room for each company to form a subsidiary company of its own.  But I think that a period of three years should be allowed the companies to enable them to come together and to see whether they could not, between them, form a new company which would take over the business that they have been carrying on for a number of years and the good-will of which they have got.  This would enable them to take over the fire and general business of the Saorstát's companies that will be affected by this section.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister has already said, this amendment should commend itself to him.  I understand that the Minister would be prepared in the formation of such a company to consider a smaller nominal and a smaller paid-up capital than is provided for elsewhere in the Bill.  This amendment suggests a nominal capital of £100,000 and a paid-up capital of £35,000.  Those figures would appear to me to be sufficient to meet the case.  The important thing would be to give the companies a three years' period to enable them to come together and see whether such a company could not be established. The staffs of the composite offices would be less likely to lose their employment than they are as the Bill stands at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy quoted me as saying that I was anxious that a new company would be formed to take over the business of Saorstát offices.  I do not think I used the word &ldquo;anxious.&rdquo;  I intimated that if there was a desire to do so and if a scheme were formulated which was sound in every other respect, but did not provide for the minimum capital stated in the Bill, that I am prepared to consider an amendment which would meet the position.  That fact was conveyed to the interested companies some time ago and no doubt they have had the matter under consideration since.  I do not think I could agree to the proposal that the time during which the composite companies should be allowed to carry on business should be extended to a period of three years.  While the time was not actually specified in the Bill, I had a much shorter period in mind than three years.  Neither would I be prepared to say that a paid-up capital of £35,000 would be sufficient. I think that amount would be regarded as inadequate.  But, of course, in say- <Col N="1591" /> ing that I have in mind a company that would propose to do all classes or most of the classes of general business to which the Bill refers.  A company proposing to do only certain of these classes or even one class of them might be adequately capitalised by £35,000. Therefore, my opinion upon that is subject to certain qualifications.  The Bill aims at securing the transfer of the nonlife business of the Saorstát composite companies to an existing Saorstát company or to a new Saorstát company with sufficient capital resources to justify the undertaking of it.  That purpose would be defeated if the amendment were accepted.  On the two questions, therefore, raised by the amendment my position is that I would regard the period of three years as too long. In any event I think it is better to leave the period indeterminate as the Bill provides.</P>
      <P>As to the question of paid-up capital, in the ordinary cases £35,000 would be insufficient in relation to a company formed to take over the general business of the existing composite offices. On the question of the introduction of an amendment which would provide for granting a licence to such a company even though its paid-up capital was less than the £100,000 which the Bill provides in the case of new companies, I would like to reserve my opinion as to what that paid-up capital would be until I have precise information as to the class of business proposed to be done and the effect on the position of the company of the arrangements made with existing composite offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he communicated at some stage with the interested offices his readiness to amend this Bill in such a way as to enable the composite offices to float, under less stringent capital terms than the Bill proposes, a new company for the purpose of taking over their business. To whom did the Minister communicate that willingness on his part? I never heard of it.  I was interested in the proposals made to his Department between the period of the Committee Stage of the Bill and the present stage of the measure.  I never heard of <Col N="1592" /> any proposal by which the Minister would assist the Irish insurance companies in this matter.  I would be very grateful if he would let the House know to whom he communicated his readiness to agree to a scheme of that kind.  Deputy Lynch's amendment is intended to facilitate the existing compauies to divest themselves of their business.  Why is it under Section 12 (4) that the Saorstát company is required to divest itself of its general business to a Saorstát company, whereas under Section 12 (7) an extern company is free to divest itself of its general business either to a Saorstát company or to an extern company? When the time comes for disposing of the general business, the difficulty will be to get a price for it.  If the company has been making profits in the past, the wider the market the better chance there will be of getting a good price. Why are Saorstát companies constrained to sell in a restricted market, while the extern companies are free to sell to any licensed insurance company in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this question during the discussion on the amendment relating to that matter. The reason that a transfer of the general business of a Saorstát company can only be made to a Saorstát company is that the business at present is carried on by a Saorstát company, and the object of the Bill is to develop such business in the Saorstát.  In these circumstances it would be against the object of the Bill to allow the transfer of a Saorstát business to a foreign company or companies.  The same consideration obviously did not apply in the case of existing foreign companies at present doing a composite business here.  In my opinion, it is not desirable to require those companies to dispose of their general business to Saorstát companies, because Saorstát companies might not be in a position to take over such a business. In any event, there is this other difference between the provisions made in the Bill for dealing with the Saorstát and foreign companies, that the Saorstát companies must dispose of their general business.  The foreign company may dispose of either branch of <Col N="1593" /> its business.  That matter was fully referred to by me when discussing the previous amendment; on the other question raised by Deputy Dillon, I may say that the communication to which he refers was addressed to the Saorstát companies that were interested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all the Saorstát companies were interested in the matter to the extent that they were acting together.  I have no reason to believe that any such communication as the Minister states was issued from his Department reached certain companies with the affairs of which I am familiar.  I would be glad if the Minister would satisfy himself that that information, which he says he had communicated, reached all the Irish insurance companies who are presumably interested in this information, or whether it was addressed to a selected few.  I have no doubt, if the latter assumption is true, the Minister will call for an accounting from the person who made a communication like that to one or two companies, and withheld it from the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the correspondence which followed the original letter, I am quite satisfied that all the Saorstát companies are aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will look into the matter.  I am sure he will agree with me that a communication of that kind should have gone to all the companies. It is obviously undesirable that individual ones would have such notice while others are left without it.  I see the reasons that have actuated the Minister in restricting the Irish companies to selling their business to Irish companies and giving foreign companies free play.  But surely it is inflicting an altogether unfair burden on the existing Irish companies to ask them to co-operate so far as that with the Government's policy.  For instance, you have five Irish companies who have this class of business to dispose of.  You have the Hibernian Insurance Company, which might take it from them, and you have the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which might take it from them.  You <Col N="1594" /> have then the possibility of these five companies or a group of them forming a new insurance corporation to handle the fire and general insurance business. They are restricted to two potential purchasers and they have to take what the Hibernian or the Corporation will give them, or go without.</P>
      <P>Suppose one of these companies, which is at present a composite company, is notified by the Minister after the passage of the Bill that it is insolvent as to its life business, it must dispose of its fire or general business immediately, if it has kept separate funds, and I take it under the terms of the Bill it would still be allowed to dispose of the fire and general business provided it was solvent.  That would mean it would have to dispose of it immediately, but in a very restricted market of that kind they would have simply to give it away. Suppose the Minister feels that no matter what considerations are advanced he must insist on the disposal of the business to a Saorstát company, can he not get out of the difficulty by saying that any person acquiring the business must acquire it on an actuarial valuation?  In the case of fire and general business it would not be necessary to have an actuarial valuation; all you would need is an ordinary valuation of what the business is worth and you might provide a board of assessors before whom the matter could be brought, and it could be transferred on that valuation.  The Minister could say that an Irish company might either sell its business or bring it before the board of assessors, have it valued and transferred at the valuation.  Unless some such right is given, and unless the selling company is given some power of exacting the value of its business, I feel that Irish companies will be obliged to jettison their fire and general business, because they will be unable to get the market price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot represent the position as being one in which this composite office will be suddenly notified that they have to-dispose of their general business.  They are aware now of the provisions of the <Col N="1595" /> Bill&mdash;they have been for some time. In fact, the Irish composite offices, which are three in number, have had discussions with me and with officers of the Department, and they are already giving consideration to these provisions in the Bill.  There are alternative courses open to them.  Each of them can dispose of its general business to an existing Saorstát company. They can arrange for the formation of new companies that will be qualified for a licence, and I have intimated my willingness in relation to them and their existing business to accept an amendment to the Bill which will permit of a new company being formed to take over the business without conforming to the requirements as to minimum capital which is set out here.</P>
      <P>As to the companies being aware of that fact, I discussed it with representatives of the companies concerned as well as sending communications to confirm what I have stated.  I am quite certain they are fully informed on that point.  It is not impossible before the Bill comes into operation, or certainly before the withdrawal of the temporary licence is effected, that these companies will have made satisfactory arrangements to deal with the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not quite correct as to the alternative courses open to Irish insurance companies. He stated one of the courses open to the company was to transfer their general business to an existing Irish company.  They cannot do that under paragraph (b) of Section 4 unless at the same time they amalgamate their life business with another company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy that the phraseology of that paragraph may require revision.  I do not wish to be put in the position of having, in relation to an Irish company, of the solvency of which there can be no question, greater powers in that respect than I would have in relation to a foreign company doing the same class of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Minister's <Col N="1596" /> intention is to secure by an appropriate amendment that one of the courses open to Irish composite offices is to transfer existing general business to an existing Irish company without the necessity for amalgamation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Again I want to qualify my statement, because I am anxious to secure an arrangement in relation to these matters which may enable the intention of the Government to be fulfilled while at the same time meeting quite reasonable objections which the companies have to put forward.  In relation to this class of business, particularly industrial assurance business, I think amalgamation is a good thing for everybody concerned, the companies, the insured persons and the public.  I would like to see that amalgamation effected.  My statement that a number of sound units is desirable applied only to fire and general business.  In relation to industrial assurance business, I think we might take the reverse position and say that one company, properly organised, would be the proper arrangement.  We are not taking powers under this Bill to create that position compulsorily, but I hope that as a result of forces that will be set in motion consequent on the passage of the Bill, the tendency will be in that direction and we may get voluntary co-operation in effecting amalgamation, even in relation to a solvent Irish company.  I would not care to be in a position to use compulsory powers where such compulsory powers did not exist in relation to foreign companies doing the same class of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister says makes me rather uneasy.  It is very easy to say that things are going to be put in motion which will tend towards amalgamation and the survival of only one company for industrial assurance because the Minister is of opinion that industrial assurance can best be effected for the populace as a whole through one company. That sounds harmless.  But suppose you have a perfectly sound company doing a sound business on the most conservative lines and it finds itself, <Col N="1597" /> in due course, confronted by the amalgamation of a number of other companies who have got themselves into deep water through resorting to practices which a solvent company will never resort to, and which, as a result of resorting to such practices, have spread themselves a bit further afield. Suppose these unsound companies come together with assistance from the Minister who avows his intention of promoting amalgamation, a situation may arise in which you have a number of unsound companies amalgamated into one supported by funds supplied by the Minister, going out on a campaign of strong competition against a comparatively small company whose only crime was that it maintained itself solvent at the expense of the expansion that it could have purchased by making itself insolvent.  That alarms me.  I feel that, if the Minister is going to make up his mind to use State pressure to enforce amalgamation, he ought to use legislative pressure to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that it is desirable at all to force any solvent company into amalgamation against its will.  I do not think that State influence or State pressure should be used towards that end.  The Minister says now that he hopes to set in motion a series of forces that will promote amalgamation.  We all know that if the Department of Industry and Commerce, supported by the Department of Finance and the Industrial Credit Corporation, put their minds down to it they can make the position of an independent company operating exclusively in Saorstát Eireann virtually impossible.  I would much sooner that they would come out into the open, announce their intentions and allow substantial justice to be put into this Bill rather than that they should adopt a vague policy of imposing amalgamation on companies through indirect pressure.  I would ask the Minister to elaborate what he meant when he said that forces would be set in motion which will tend <Col N="1598" /> towards amalgamation.  Will he say what are those forces, and how he proposes to influence development in that direction?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say any more about it.  So far as this Bill is concerned, we are not taking power to compel the amalgamation of all companies that are doing industrial insurance business here.  At some stage that may come, but there is no proposal at the moment to legislate for it. At the same time, I think that it will become more generally realised that that is the desirable arrangement.  All the experience of larger scale units in operation, perhaps the example of other countries and other factors will, I think, operate to create a position in which there will be a more general realisation, both amongst interested parties and the general public, of the desirability of unification, or at any rate a much greater degree of unification than now exists in industrial insurance business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad if the Minister's anticipations were realised, and that the existing composite offices were able to put up a plan to him which would be acceptable to him and also to the companies.  But we have to envisage the difficulty which must exist before such a plan can come to fruition, and realise that it may never come to fruition.  Under the Bill the composite office is to drop its general business. What I want to know from the Minister is, what is to become of the policy holders whose policies are unexpired at the time this Bill comes into operation? An office has been carrying on <Col N="1599" /> business for some years, and it cannot suddenly drop down on one section of its business.</P>

      <P>But it cannot carry on business if it has no funds.  It has staffs perhaps with whom it has contracts extending over a period of five years or more&mdash;specialised staffs brought into the concerns some years ago whose contracts are still in operation. Surely, some provision ought to be made to deal with matters of that kind.  It is not sufficient, nor is it just, that companies should be left there holding a non-existent business with no assets, or very little assets, and with perhaps heavy contingent liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Time, I suggest, is a very poor substitute for cash or for a business, or for the value of goodwill, and that is what is being destroyed here.  The value of the goodwill in this business is being completely destroyed, and nothing is being left to the companies but liabilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully that if we were to step in and say to a company doing any class of business&mdash;I am not thinking now of insurance business only &mdash;that it may not, after a certain date in the future, continue to do that business, certain difficulties would immediately be created.  My justification for doing it in this case is the desirability of effecting a change.  I think the advantages to be secured by effecting the change outweigh the disadvantages and that, as a change will probably become necessary in any event, at some stage, it is better to effect it now than later.  At any rate, the difficulties and inconvenience caused to Saorstát companies will be less now than they may be in the future.  Nevertheless, we think we are putting these Saorstát companies in a position in which they can get out of the situation without loss, by arranging for the transfer of this business to existing companies, or to a new company, as the case may be, and the carrying on by the company <Col N="1601" /> of the retained business which may become, and should become, more valuable in the future.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear, without being unduly sticky on this point, that while I mention the point of the staffs, I am certainly not looking after the interests of persons with fantastic contracts or contracts made with a view to this particular legislation.  What I am looking after is the interest of the policy holders or even the interest of, say, an injured workman.  Suppose there is a man in the employment of a person who has a policy with company A.  The person who has that policy may not be a mark for the amount of the liability that is covered.  The liability is instituted, say, last year, but, by reason of the seriousness of the accident, will last for the rest of that workman's life. This company A is going out of business so far as that accident business is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not released as a legal proposition, but I am speaking of it as a practical proposition, <Col N="1603" /> and, as a practical proposition, it should have against that liability a certain reserve fund sufficient to cover it.  How can the Minister be sure of that?  Has he considered that aspect of the case in connection with these proposals?  I agree that if the company had power to sell its goodwill&mdash;call it that for want of a better name&mdash;freely, the situation from the point of view not merely of policy holders but persons who have obligations against, or rights enforceable against, the policy holders would be that their interests would be protected. Take the instance of a workman who has met with an accident arising in the course of his employment. His real security for his compensation is not his employer but his insurance company, looked at as a practical proposition.  If, suddenly, the insurance company, which is the source of his compensation and the real security for it, is interfered with in its business&mdash;it may be true to say that as a legal proposition the liability is still there and it may also be true to say that there ought to be sufficient funds to meet it&mdash;as a practical proposition, I rather fancy that that man's security is very seriously prejudiced, if not completely jeopardised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put another point to the Minister.  I recognise that you cannot legislate for exceptions, but surely we are not working around to the position that a solvent company in this country is an exception?  It does not seem to me to be any defence for doing companies substantial injustice in this matter of assigning to say that certain ones of them have oppressive and unusual contracts with their officers, because, if there are such, and there may be, there are others that have no such contracts and who should be put under no such penalty.  I do not know whether the Minister has touched on this point.  Most of these companies who engage in fire and accident business are tariff companies and have tariff contracts with the tariff groups in Great Britain.  Some of them are not tariff companies and have been constrained to do their reinsurance through Lloyds.  None of them, <Col N="1604" /> and I do not suppose any insurance company in the world, could meet its fire claims out of its own funds.  All of them lay off a considerable part of their liability by way of reinsurance. Is any provision being made to ensure that the tariff agreements which certain of the companies have will be carried over to any new amalgamation that may be set up under this Bill, and, if such an arrangement is not made, how is that difficulty going to be overcome?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Suppose, at the date of amalgamation, there are a number of claims current, all those claims having been covered through the tariff agreement with the group of companies in Great Britain who are within the tariff ring.  The companies purport to assign to the new amalgamated company their risks and assets.  They must be in a position to assign only their risks qualified by the tariff reinsurance they enjoy, but the companies who have made a tariff contract with one of the amalgamated companies cannot be compelled to consent to the assignment of that tariff contract to the amalgamated company.</P>

On 1st July, he amalgamates, and, in the process of amalgamating, he assigns to the amalgamated company all the risks and assets current.  Every risk he assigns carries with it a tariff reinsurance and the tariff ring in England says &ldquo;We will not consent to the assignment of our reinsurance contract to the amalgamated company.&rdquo; What is going to happen?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, Section 21 (2), line 34, to insert after the word &ldquo;duties&rdquo; the words &ldquo;unless the Minister otherwise directs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage the point was made by Deputy Rowlette that if the wording of sub-section (2) of Section 21 remained as in the Bill there would be a possibility of conflict of opinion, and consequent conflict in administration, between the medical superintendent officer of health and the resident medical superintendent.  Sub-section (2) reads:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> The resident medical superintendent shall be responsible to the hospital board for the internal administration of every fever hospital and every convalescent home managed and controlled by the hospital board and shall in the performance of his duties observe and carry out any directions given by the medical superintendent officer of health of the county borough of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It would be necessary, I think, to discuss amendments Nos. 1 and 2 together for the sake of clarity.  Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert after the word &ldquo;duties&rdquo; the words &ldquo;unless the Minister otherwise directs.&rdquo;  Amendment No. 2 deletes the words &ldquo;observe and carry out any directions given&rdquo; and substitutes the words &ldquo;adopt and give effect to any recommendations made.&rdquo; Amendment No. 1 provides that in the event of any difference of opinion between the medical superintendent officer of health and the resident medical superintendent, appeal might be made to the Minister and the resident medical superintendent would not be under statutory obligation to carry out the recommendations of the medical superintendent officer of health if the Minister otherwise directed.  I think these two amendments fully meet the case made by Deputy Rowlette.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill I think that in regard to the section providing for further telephonic development it would be helpful to advert, for a moment, to some suggestions made from time to time on the Minister's Estimates, with a view to the development of telephone communication in the country.  I suggested, some time ago, that when further development was going to be undertaken, the general question relating to telephones and amenities should be considered from two points of view.  At present, as a result of the slow growth of telephone amenities, one frequently finds that a trunk call in rural Ireland involves resorting to a very intricate circuit.  If one is telephoning from <Col N="1608" /> Ballaghaderreen to a place like Ballyhaunis, one may find oneself going round all the way to Mullingar.  I do not say you do, but two towns geographically closely connected may be only telephonically connected by a very involved circuit which might mean considerable delay.  I suggested to the Minister once that it might be possible to arrange telephones on a county basis and to provide that you could get communication with any other town in any given county through a county exchange.  It occurred to me that if such a plan could be developed it would greatly expedite trunk communication all over the country because one can well imagine several lines connected in, say, the county town of Roscommon with the City of Dublin and every call from anywhere in Roscommon finding its way to the central exchange in Roscommon town which would have communication with the rest of the country.  It occurred to me, also, that if the telephone system were developed on these lines, it would be easier to revise the scale of charges on lines more readily comprehensive to the public mind.  That does not arise directly out of this motion, but it is one of the reasons why development along the lines I suggest may commend itself to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister may remember that I suggested that a call within a county should be threepence; a call within a province 6d; and a call within the country 1/-.  Flatteringly enough, I discovered that the Post Office in Great Britain shortly afterwards, for the purpose of night calls, in any case, adopted a scheme somewhat analogous to that which I outlined.  I am suggesting that the Minister should follow the plan I suggest and not in any way follow any example set by the British Post Office&mdash;a thing I know he would be very reluctant to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister's view as to whether it would not greatly expedite trunk calls to organise the telephone on a county basis.  I am bound to say in that connection that the trunk service in rural Ireland at present is highly unsatisfactory.  It is the exception rather than the rule to <Col N="1609" /> get a trunk call from the province of Connaught to the City of Dublin in less than half-an-hour and, in this day and age, I think that is primitive.  The Minister will remember that I mentioned this matter to him before, and he then stated as the minimum standard of excellence that 15 minutes should elapse from the time the call originated until it was connected with the City of Dublin, except in the remotest areas.  Since that day I have never got a trunk call from Ballaghadereen, in any case, within 15 minutes. You cannot lay the blame on the sub-post office in Ballaghadereen because I telephone as frequently from Dublin to Ballaghadereen as from Ballaghadereen to Dublin, and I have never got a call either way within 15 minutes. I think that is a matter deserving investigation.</P>
    <P>I imagine that this matter would also arise on the section.  I suspect that in the Central Post Office in Dublin adequate staff is not being maintained for the purpose of trunk calls for which one dials 31 or 36.  It may be that we might waste money further developing certain Departments which were really proving unsatisfactory for the want of staff rather than for the want of equipment.  We all know that when waiting for someone to answer a telephone the time passes slowly and exaggeration is bound to creep in when describing the length of time we have been kept waiting to make a call. I have now made it a practice to count the buzzes.  I infer that there is a standard space of time between each buzz, which I estimate to be about three seconds.  I take it that no reasonable citizen calling up the exchange for the purpose of getting in touch with the supervisor or the trunk operator should be kept longer than 25 seconds from the time the telephone begins to ring.  I have recently been kept while the bell rang 28 times.  I have dialled &ldquo;0&rdquo;&mdash;I am now speaking of the Dublin Central Exchange&mdash;and I have been kept an unconscionable time, so long that I abandoned &ldquo;0&rdquo; and went over to 31.  I was kept there a very long time.  I think 31 is the number which calls the supervisor.  I was told by the supervisor that a good many complaints had been received <Col N="1610" /> that morning about undue delay.  The conversation began by my being a little irate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was kept a long time waiting.  But with the usual tact of telephone supervisors my representations were sympathetically heard, and then we both became sympathetic to one another.  I admire the tact of the ladies who function as supervisors in the Dublin Central Exchange.  We exchanged sympathetic condolences and she assured me that the reason was that they were rushed.  I do not think they ought to be rushed.  I admit that if you provide adequate staff there are periods during the day when one finds that this staff have not got enough to do.  But I do not think you can help that in a public service such as the Post Office or telephone service. If reasonable provision is going to be made for the peak periods of work you must reconcile yourself to the fact that during certain periods of the day the staff will not be fully occupied.  I do not think a public service should be run on the principle that an average staff should be kept because the inconvenience that accrues during rush periods to persons who urgently want to establish communication with neighbours is out of all proportion to any economy effected by keeping the staff below the point of efficiency at which it ought to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SydneyBMinch" hpid="Mr. Minch Mr. Minch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Minch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that we are all agreed that the advances made recently towards reduction of costs and extra facilities are encouraging for the future of the telephone system.  There are one or two point, however, which I should like to put before the Minister. I suggest to him that he should investigate the possibility of the closing hour in certain places, which is at present 8 p.m., being brought into line with the 10 p.m. closing hour in other country towns.  I am sure his advisers and chief officers will know what I mean without my elaborating a whole lot of local grievances and annoyances. The fact remains that you can ring up a certain town or small village up to 8 p.m., but you cannot do it after that hour, whereas you can get another <Col N="1611" /> town a short distance away up to 10 p.m.  There should be some uniformity as far as the closing down hour is concerned and let it be 10 p.m. wherever possible.</P>
      <P>The other point has reference to the cost of extensions to telephones in business premises.  I have heard complaints from business men that it is quite an expensive procedure.  The cost is out of all proportion to the facility provided.  A friend of mine wanted to get an extension of about 32 yards from one part of an office to another.  He was charged an extra rental of something like £3 10s., which at 3½ per cent. represented an outlay of £100.  That is the way he looked upon it.  I want to direct the attention of the Minister to these matters, which are very essential to the general public.  They arise every day.  They may appear to be very simple matters, but they cause great inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention and obtain some information upon.  I understood from the Minister's speech on the Second Reading that it was proposed to extend the automatic telephone to the provinces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What areas has the Minister in mind?  Does he intend to give Deputy Dillon one in Ballaghadereen, or is the intention in the matter of the extension of the automatic service to be limited, say, to Cork, Limerick and, perhaps, Waterford? Has the Minister examined that question with a view to ascertaining the practicability of extending the automatic telephone services, on the basis on which they exist in Dublin, to such limited centres of telephone traffic as Cork, Limerick and Waterford? I gather from the Minister <Col N="1612" /> that when he used the term &ldquo;extension of automatic telephones&rdquo; he was not thinking of the extension of the system as in operation in Dublin.  I should like to get some information from the Minister as to whether he contemplates the installation of the automatic system, as in operation in Dublin, in areas throughout the country, and if so, what areas.  Deputy Dillon has made reference to natural irritability when he has not got attention the moment he wants attention. Of course telephone operators, if they knew Deputy Dillon well, would make a certain allowance in that respect for the Deputy's characteristics, but I should like to assure the Deputy that so far as the staff operating the telephone exchanges are concerned they work, particularly during the peak periods of the day, under extremely high pressure.  When the peak periods are in existence it is an extremely difficult task for those girls to cope with the volume of traffic that comes in and that must be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that I think he could do more to provide staff for the peak periods of traffic than he has done up to the moment.  I do not know whether the Minister has paid any official visit to the telephone exchange in Dublin, or whether he has any experience of seeing telephonists operate the telephone service which he controls.  If he has not yet paid an official visit to the Crown Alley or Ship Street or Merrion Street Exchange, I suggest to the Minister that before the Report Stage of this Bill he should pay an official visit to those exchanges, and there observe the conditions under which his employees work.  I think the Minister will have no hesitation in realising that they work at extremely high pressure, and that he ought to endeavour to relieve that pressure as much as possible.  I know of no more irritating and nerve-racking operation than that of operating telephone exchanges, and dealing with a large number of calls, all of which demand almost instantaneous attention.  The efforts of the operators to deal with telephone traffic during the peak periods of the day impose a very considerable <Col N="1613" /> strain upon them.  I think the Minister could ascertain from persons who are in close touch with telephone operators that the strain which they endure has a serious effect on the health of many of the girls, and collapses of telephone operators are not an unknown occurrence so far as Dublin telephone exchanges are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now embarking upon a scheme of further telephone development, and I hope that that development will be accompanied by a greater appreciation of the difficulties under which telephone operators work.  A recognition that their burden ought to be lightened as much as possible will, I think, help to ensure that the further telephone development will be accompanied by an efficient service to the public and tolerably decent conditions so far as the operating staffs are concerned.  At all events, the Minister is now, by reason of the introduction of new telephone charges, likely to create a telephone traffic formerly unknown in this country.  I think the telephone traffic following the introduction of the new telephone charges is going to be unprecedentedly heavy. In Great Britain, two years ago, provision was made for reduced telephone charges and reduced telegraph charges, and everybody who was in touch with the position there in that respect knows that it was accompanied by colossal delays, and by a very heavy breakdown of staff arrangements.  I am afraid the same thing is likely to happen here unless adequate provision is made for sufficiently augmenting the staff.  I hope that the Minister, before the new telephone rates come into operation, will instruct his officials to ensure that the arrangement is given a fair chance, and that the introduction of the new telephone charges is not going to be the signal for widespread public complaint at the delay in dealing with telephone calls.  The Minister ought to make sure that adequate staff is provided for the anticipated increase in telephone traffic which will follow the introduction of the new rates.  If he instructs his officials to ascertain the position which followed the introduction of the new rates in Great Britain, I think he will find <Col N="1614" /> there a warning of the danger of being niggardly in the matter of providing sufficient staff.</P>
    <P>I notice, Sir, that this Bill is to enable the Minister to borrow more money for telephone development, and I want to suggest to the Minister, now that he is developing to a greater extent the telephone services of the country, that some of the people who operate those telephone services might well receive from the Minister a much more generous recognition of their services than they get at present.  I do not know if the Minister ever heard of a grade in the Post Office known as night and Sunday telephone attendant? Possibly, the Minister has not.  He has only a shadowy idea of what kind of person that is, and of what kind of function he performs.  I should like to tell the Minister that that gentleman often performs 22 hours' continuous work in the matter of telephone duties. He works from Saturday evening until Monday morning almost, with the exception of a short period of one and a half hours off to attend to his religious duties on Sunday morning.  For that onerous work he is paid an unusually low rate&mdash;unusually low having regard to the Minister's general standards in the matter of payment.  The low rate of wages paid to those night telephone attendants for the long hours of duty which they perform is something which I think ought to be remedied.  I hope, now that the Minister is proceeding along the line of telephone development, he will look into the conditions under which those night telephone attendants work, and the rates at which they are paid.  He ought to ensure, so far as he can do so, that those people will be paid a decent rate of wages for the responsible services which they give.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister, on the Post Office Estimate, announcing that he was going to give reductions of £22 10s. to telephone subscribers.  Many of those persons would not get £22 10s. for their year's work for the Minister. I suggest to him, now that he is in this generous mood of handing out £22 10s. in the form of reductions to telephone subscribers, that he should look into the conditions under which <Col N="1615" /> many of his employees are working. In respect of the telephone service which is now the subject of discussion I hope the Minister will find it possible to improve the rates which are paid in this case.  If he does that, then the telephone development in the future will, I think, be under happier auspices than telephone development in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get some idea from the Minister as to how much of this money which he is asking the House to vote is going to be spent upon the development of telephone services in the country, as distinct from the cities, because so far as the greater part of the country is concerned there has been no noticeable improvement in that service for the last 10 or 12 years. So far as the country districts are concerned, and so far as a great number of fairly large towns are concerned, the telephone services cease at 7 o'clock in the evening.  Unless through the courtesy of the Gárdaí, the telephones become useless from 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening until 9 or 10 o'clock on the following morning.  It seems to me that the Minister cannot congratulate himself upon the development of the telephone service merely by substituting the automatic system in Dublin for the old system, while down the country there is no advance whatever from the position we were in 10 or 12 years ago.  As a matter of fact, so far as the country towns are concerned they are very much worse off to-day than they were 15 years ago, because at that time in many of those towns there was a night service which does not operate now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do want to suggest to the House, that if we are here voting the sum of £500,000, we ought to get an undertaking from the Minister that that money will be spent, or a considerable portion of it, at any rate, on improving the telephone service in the country generally, and that it is not going to be confined merely to improving the fairly good services already obtaining in the cities and large towns.  I am sure there are other Deputies in this <Col N="1616" /> House, representing the rural areas and the towns and villages, who have had complaints made to them, as I have had complaints made to me, about this matter, and particularly about the closing down of the telephone service at seven or eight o'clock in the afternoon in these rural areas. As I have already said, if it were not for the courtesy of the Guards, people in these districts would be cut off from any kind of telephonic communication from that time in the evening until the following morning.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also if the Minister is going to use this money for the purpose of getting a more general and extended use of the telephone in the districts where it is not now being used, and in getting a greater number of subscribers.  So far as a great part of the country is concerned, the only thing they know about the telephone is that there may be a telephone call, if it is attached to the local post office, or that there may not be, and I think that in parts of this country it would be no exaggeration to say that you might travel 10, 15, or even 20 miles of the country without finding any kind of telephonic communication at all. It seems to me that the system is tending to become lop-sided, so to speak, and that the Post Office authorities are concentrating on Dublin and Cork and other big cities and not making the advance that should be made through the country generally and in the towns and villages.  From that point of view we are very backward as compared with other countries.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister is making a good start in trying to popularise the service by reducing the charges because, in country districts particularly, where the use of the telephone would not be heavy, and where there would not be a great number of calls, but where it is necessary at the same time to have a telephone service, the fairly heavy charges that obtained hitherto did not appeal to the people in these districts and it was certainly not any inducement to them to instal telephone services. I should like to get from the Minister, however, an assurance that he will do what he can in the Department to see that the country generally <Col N="1617" /> will get the benefit of whatever advantages are going to be offered as a result of the spending of this money which we are now asked to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that while there is, I understand, telephonic communication all over the island of Achill, there is no connection between Achill Island and Malaranny. This question has been before the Minister's Department for some time, and I have been written to about that particular matter quite recently.  Now that telephonic connections are being extended in many places, I should like the Minister to reconsider this question of the connection between Achill Island and the Malaranny district.  It is not a long distance&mdash;it is only about seven miles&mdash;and at this season of the year it is considered very important by the people of the locality, owing to the tourist traffic there, that there should be means of telephonic communication. As I say, I have been written to quite recently on the matter, and I would be anxious that the Minister should reconsider this question and try to have connection made between the two places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with the point made by Deputy Kilroy. This question of extending communication to outlying districts is one that we are always being asked to consider, but it must be remembered that the Post Office is compelled to run on commercial lines, and unless the Government generally is prepared to subsidise these services, we cannot do it.  I myself can tell Deputy Kilroy, that I am doing all I can to try to get an extension in places like Malaranny, but, so far, I have not succeeded.  However, there are a few outlying districts for which I hope I shall succeed in getting the consent of the Minister for Finance, who, after all, is responsible for all the finance of the country, and who will insist that we run our Department within certain financial limits.  That is the question that has to be borne in mind.  I cannot promise anything, right now, to Deputy Kilroy except to say that the case he mentioned is a special case, and that there are other special cases like it, in connection <Col N="1618" /> with the islands round the coast, where the cost would certainly be prohibitive from the Post Office point of view.  It is possible that the Government may do something and then our Department may get the credit of it, but as a Department we cannot do it with the financial resources at our disposal.  I can say, however, that the islands are certainly being considered, and that Achill will probably come in for consideration. Anyway, I can assure the Deputy that it has not been lost sight of.</P>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey asked how much of the money raised by this Bill is to be devoted to country districts.  Well, we expect that about one-third of it will be so used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, about one-third.  It must be remembered that the demand for the telephone, so far, has been mainly in the cities, and that we have to meet the demand.  It is in Dublin and Cork, and the big cities generally, that the chief demand exists, and, naturally, as Deputy Morrissey says, development seems to be becoming lopsided, but the reason for that is that the effective demand for the telephone service is in the cities, and we have to meet that demand.  I hope that, as a result of the reduction in charges, the country districts will become more telephone-minded and that the demand will be there in future.  If that should happen, we will, of course, try to meet the demand, but the fact is that there has not been a demand&mdash;that is, a demand that we could meet economically.  As things are at present, it could only be done at a prohibitive cost to the Department, or at a figure that people would not be prepared to pay.  However, now that the telephone charges are reduced, we hope that there will be a demand all over the country and that we will be able to make plans to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey also mentioned the shutting down of exchanges in the country districts at 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening, and Deputy Minch also spoke about the same thing.  On the Second Reading of the Bill, I said that <Col N="1619" /> we hoped to get authority to keep these offices in the country districts open until 10 o'clock at night in order to give the country people the benefit of the 1/- rate.  I expect that Finance will agree to that.  That is what we intend to do, and if there is a big use made of the added service, then we may further extend it.  At any rate, it will be some advantage to get the two extra hours, which will enable the country people to take advantage of the 1/- rate after 8 o'clock.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about the pressure on the operators.  Well, I know there is great pressure on them, but I hope the Deputy will not be complaining when we have all the telephones completely automatic.  That will certainly relieve the pressure, but at the same time it will probably cause some unemployment, and it is very hard to have it both ways.  A lot of the trouble is due to the rush hours. I suppose that whenever there is a rush people will have to try to be a little patient.  I think it was Deputy Dillon who spoke about counting 28 or 30 buzzes.  Was it 28 or 30?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I admit that one would want to be very patient to be able to count up to 28.  At any rate, it would probably occur during a rush hour, and perhaps it would be rather good practice to test one's patience by keeping on counting them that way for a while.  I hope when we get Crown Alley working automatic that even the Deputy will not have reason to complain.  The money for that purpose is provided under this Bill, and when the exchange becomes automatic there will not be anything like the delay that there is at present.  It must be understood that at rush hours people will have to wait sometimes.  On the whole, and judging by what was said on the Second Reading debate, there has not been much complaint.  Deputy Dillon seems to be unfortunate, as he seems to make calls at the wrong time.</P>

      <P>It may have been an exceptionally bad morning.  There are rush periods when it is impossible to get on, especially in the centre of the city.  It is hard to get on right away and then people get impatient.  We hope to have the work under way, because an order has been made for Crown Alley to be turned into an automatic exchange, and there will then be no cause for complaint as far as Dublin is concerned.  Deputy Norton asked for information about extending the automatic system throughout the country.  I take it that he was referring to the possibility of having a continuous night service in villages or small towns.  I said that that was in the distance and that when a rural automatic service is developed in other countries we will take advantage of it, I suppose in years to come.  At present we are not in a position to say when that will be&mdash;probably in some years.  Cork is the only place that we have in mind for an extension on the lines of the Dublin automatic system.  We are not quite certain how soon we will extend that system to Cork, but it is in view.  I am very hopeful that in a reasonably short time country districts will get greater telephone facilities, especially as the cheap rates are going to create a demand.  Deputy Dillon spoke about having county exchanges.  That would upset the whole organisation of telephone distribution, and we do not think the cost of such an upset is warranted at present.  The question was examined when Deputy Dillon mentioned it.  Of course, the time taken is longer if you have to get a round-about connection such as the Deputy mentioned from Ballyhaunis to Ballaghadereen.  It would not pay, however, to have direct communication.</P>

      <P>Yes; but even that would be too much of an upset for the telephone organisation.  It is different in England, as it is easier to do it there because of the big centres. The amount of telephone work at present in the country districts is very limited and would not justify a big overhaul of our system.  Even Deputy <Col N="1621" /> Dillon will admit that.  I am satisfied that, as a result of the reduction in charges, there will be a big increase in the use of the telephone throughout the country, and when that happens, whatever Government is in power will have to deal with the situation.  We have made a good start, and I think that very little more could be done at present, seeing that the service was a losing one and is only now starting to pay.</P>

      <P>In regard to the roundabout routes can the Minister do anything to improve the position, as sometimes, particularly in the middle of the day, it takes two hours to get a call 90 or 100 miles distant from the city.  There are certain periods at which if a call is put through, say between 8 and 10 o'clock, it will take two hours to get through. Surely the Minister agrees that that should be looked into.  It is when <Col N="1622" /> the business houses and the offices are being opened that it is difficult to get through.  It is a common thing for a call to take two or two and a half hours.</P>

      <Col N="1623" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in saying that the records show that certain things are true and telling us if we have any complaints to make them. When we have complaints the Minister tells us we are wrong.  He cannot have it both ways.  The proper place to make complaints is in Dáil Eireann, and it gets nowhere for the Minister to tell us we are wrong.  I told the Minister that of the calls I have made between the City of Dublin and County Roscommon in the last 12 months, not more than 2 per cent. got through in 15 minutes.  The Minister can find out my telephone numbers in the City of Dublin and in Ballaghadereen and he can proceed to check complaints.  That is the plain fact.  The difference between the Minister and myself is that I have personal knowledge of making trunk calls from rural Ireland, frequently four or five times in the week, and to get a trunk call over a distance of 100 miles in 15 minutes is practically unknown in my experience, except between 7.30 and 8 o'clock in the evening.  If he has received information of any other character, then I say that the high officials of his Department are not getting full and frank disclosures from the sub-postmasters, and that further investigations should be made.  If he is going to give the cheap rates a real chance in rural Ireland he ought to extend the use of the telephone at least until 11 o'clock at night.  He is afraid of 10 o'clock.  I would prefer midnight, but if he makes it 11 o'clock I will accept that.  I ask him to seek sanction for an experimental period of one year until 11 o'clock, having forewarned the House that if a satisfactory increase is not evident at the end of the year, he will be obliged to go back to 10 o'clock.  I have not the slightest doubt that if he extends it up to 11 o'clock at night, he will provide a really comprehensive service, sufficient for all ordinary needs and for everything else except emergency calls for which the Civic Guard barrack is available.  The third point is that while I recognise <Col N="1624" /> he cannot aspire to giving us as satisfactory a rural service as is available in the U.S.A. or Great Britain, I think he could do something now that would cover the emergencies of every rural area&mdash;that is, stipulate that every Civic Guard barrack must have a telephone. If he makes that stipulation, he will in certain cases have to make uneconomic extensions.  I think he ought to do that in the same way as an uneconomic water supply or sewerage scheme is undertaken.  The telephone, under modern conditions, is an essential part of rural equipment, bearing in mind that 40 years ago doctors and emergency services were always kept within a horse-drive distance of any centre from which they might be called. To-day, many of these services are designed on a motor basis and it may be quite impossible to reach the service you want without a very long journey. For instance, doctors who used to live in the centre of their dispensary districts now live in the neighbouring town.  They make the case&mdash;with a great deal of force, I think&mdash;that they are on the telephone there and that they could not be on the telephone if they were living in a rural area.  They point out that a telephone call from a Civic Guard barrack will bring them out in a motor car more quickly than if they were living two or three miles out in the country and a messenger had to cycle to their houses.  Unless there is a telephone in every Civic Guard barrack, that situation will not be met. Even if a telephone be installed in every Civic Guard barrack, we shall not have reached perfection.  However, I hope the infection from which the President is suffering with regard to Seanads has not spread to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to telephones.  In this imperfect life, we cannot hope for perfection.  We cannot get a perfect Seanad.  Neither can we get a perfect telephone system. The best we can hope for is to bring it as near perfection as the means at our disposal permits.  If we had a telephone in every Civic Guard barrack now, we should have gone a long way towards meeting all the legitimate claims that can be made on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in this regard, at all events.</P>

      <P>We cannot settle this dispute as regards time.  I suppose I have to accept Deputy Dillon's word but that looks like turning down the word of the people from whom I have my information.  But I suppose I cannot have it both ways.  When we have new trunks, I do not think we shall have any more disputes as to the time occupied in getting through trunk calls.  As regards the Civic Guard barracks, I think most of them are equipped with telephones but a number of barracks in the country have not had telephones installed yet.  As regards Deputy Morrissey's complaint, I am thinking of getting two maps hung up in a convenient place to show the telephone position in 1922 and the telephone position to-day.  That will show Deputy Morrissey the advance made in the last 15 years.  There has been an extraordinary change in that period and the country is almost entirely covered by the telephone. There are isolated spots uncovered but it is hardly fair to expect the Post Office which, as I have frequently pointed out, has to be run on commercial lines, to supply telephones to all Civic Guard barracks.</P>
      <P>As Acting-Minister for Justice, I should have an interest in that matter, too.  It is more a question for the Department of Justice than for the Post Office.  The Post Office is under very stringent regulations so far as these matters are concerned.  They are not allowed to put telephones into places where they will not pay.  Any Civic Guard station which is prepared to pay the cost of a telephone will get it but the Post Office has to work on that basis.  It would be better to raise that question on some other Bill than this.  I agree that, as soon as possible, the Government should try to make it possible for a telephone to be installed in every doctor's house and in every Civic Guard barracks.  That, however, will cost money and we have to get authority for expenditure on these things.  I cannot give any promise in connection with that matter now.</P>

As regards the 11 o'clock suggestion, I think we shall proceed the other way and, if it is shown that there is a big demand up to 10 o'clock, I shall see what can be done as regards an extension to 11 o'clock.  I think that is the fairest way to deal with the matter.  We shall, I expect, get authority up to 10 o'clock but I shall not ask for authority beyond 10 o'clock at present.  If the telephone is fully availed of up to 10 o'clock, I shall have some justification for approaching the Department of Finance for an extension up to 11 o'clock.  If the extension to 11 o'clock works out satisfactorily, we can arrange then to go on to midnight.</P>

I hope that, in a few months, we shall have the pleasure of seeing Deputy Ruttledge restored to his customary place. Meanwhile, the Minister, in his capacity as Minister for Justice, might address himself, demanding that the telephone be extended to Civic Guard barracks.  He might then remonstrate vigorously with himself as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and explain that the thing could not be considered. Then he could come together in both capacities and, thus encouraged, go to the presence of the Minister for Finance to ask for the necessary money.

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the abnormal delay which occurs in installing telephones in the city? The Minister does not believe Deputy Dillon's stories about the delay in <Col N="1627" /> getting certain trunk calls through but I wonder if he would investigate the delay in the installation of telephones in the City of Dublin.  It is not a normal delay.  People who desire to instal a telephone are given a date on which it will probably be installed only to find that the date passes and that another date is fixed. I do not know whether the Department is following the characteristic of the Minister in fixing a date, passing it, fixing a new date and then passing that date.  But that does happen in connection with the installation of telephones in the city.  It is all due to the failure of the Minister to provide sufficient staff.  The Minister complains of the difficulty of getting telephones introduced in other areas.  Here, in the City of Dublin, people are anxious to instal telephones but the Minister will not employ sufficient staff to enable them to do so.  The fitting staff in connection with telephone installation is altogether inadequate.  While the Minister complains that he cannot get people to instal telephones in the rural areas, here, within the shadow of headquarters, people anxious to instal telephones cannot have them installed and all because the Minister will not employ sufficient fitting staff. A considerable number of the staff of the engineering department of the Post Office were paid off some time ago.  Numbers of them are still unemployed and the Minister should make some effort to utilise their skilled craftsmanship for the satisfaction of the public demand for telephones. That is a matter over which the Minister's Department has absolute control.  All that is needed is that the Department should set about the matter in an efficient way.  Instead of that, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs tests the patience of the public who are waiting for telephones and refuses to adopt the obvious remedy of employing more staff. There might be some streak of genuineness in the Minister's complaint that it is difficult to get the public to instal telephones if we could be assured that the Minister, having a staff available to instal telephones, <Col N="1628" /> would do so.  I think the Minister will find from his own Department that in the case of a number of applications made six weeks ago in the City of Dublin the telephones are not yet installed.  I think his Department will possibly tell him that they are not likely to be installed for another six weeks or possibly for a longer period.  The Minister might be able to get statistics in that connection and they would be extremely interesting.  I had an experience recently in that connection in which it was suggested that the telephone might not be installed for a period of six or seven weeks and even then there was a likelihood of the installation being further postponed.  I think a delay like that is inexcusable. The Minister should have no difficulty in augmenting his existing staff so as to meet the public demand for the installation of telephones as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Yes, If the company has a treaty identical with that of its precedessor in title, no serious difficulty will arise but if I am negotiating a contract of insurance for a large sum on valuable property, I shall ordinarily seek out a company whose reinsurance contract is satisfactory to me.  I shall enquire as to the nature of the reinsurance contracts which that company has.  We are all aware that there are certain companies which I shall describe as tariff companies, which have peculiarly solvent contracts. There are others which have insurance contracts with Lloyds which on examination prove to be good.  There is a third class of insurance companies which have reinsurance contracts with Lloyds or other insurance companies which are anything but good.  Suppose that I have insured my property with a company which has a reinsurance treaty with a tariff group and the tariff group does not open a new reinsurance treaty with the amalgamated company, to which the fire and accident business has been transferred, has not my fire and accident contract been fundamentally altered ?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 35:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> At the end of sub-section (5), page 12, to add a new paragraph as follows:</P>
    <P>(f)  Such company shall deposit and keep deposited with the Accountant of the Courts of Justice such sum of money as will cover all its liabilities to the policy holders of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken very drastic and far-reaching powers to control the business of Irish companies, and to secure as far as possible that the policy holders will be protected from any action on the companies' part which will not be to their advantage, but he has taken very little control over foreign companies.  I think the Minister should try to establish more control over these foreign companies than he is now providing in the Bill.  The mere fact of insisting on the same deposit in the case of a foreign company, as in the case of Irish companies, is of very little assistance in this matter. The deposits, while they form a large proportion of the funds of the native companies, form an altogether infinitesimal fraction of the amount of the liabilities of the big foreign corporations which are covering risks amounting to tens of millions of pounds.  It has been found in other countries from experience that it is necessary to insist on some control over the funds of these companies to an extent that will cover a very large proportion of the liabilities of these companies in these countries.  The United States, for example, found it necessary to insist on foreign companies doing business there investing their moneys in such a way as to give the Government some control over the activities of these companies.  I believe they insist on these companies investing their funds to the full extent of their liability.  I believe that situation was brought about as a result of the San Francisco earthquake.  A number of companies repudiated their liabilities, and even in cases where the liabilities were met, and where the companies were powerfully strong companies, it was almost impossible to meet all the liabilities.</P>
    <P>In the present state of world conditions a situation has arisen which <Col N="1633" /> makes it more necessary than ever before to take precautions of this nature, so as to secure the insured persons.  The tendency in most countries to retain capital at home is growing.  In some South-American countries, in Germany, Czecho-Slovakia and various other countries, it is illegal to export funds.  If that process continues to any great extent, even strong foreign companies might find that in the case of a very great calamity here, such as a great fire, the company, even though it was solvent, might not be able to realise its funds or investments in the foreign countries.  I think that is an aspect of the case that the Minister ought to take seriously into consideration.  It is not likely that there will be a very great calamity of that kind in this country, but one can never be sure. The main purpose of insurance is to provide against the improbable.  In the City of Dublin, during the hard frost, it was found that the water mains burst.  If a fire broke out in areas where the water mains had burst that fire would do very considerable damage before it could be brought under control.  Within a few yards of where I live, some months ago a fire broke out in a big institution and half the house was gutted.  When the fire brigade came up they found the water was not strong enough to work the hose.  Were it not for the fact that the place was near a river, which enabled the fire brigade to use the fire hose, the whole place would have been destroyed.</P>
    <P>The property insured in this country, particularly in the City of Dublin, totals a very great amount indeed.  The Minister should try to take powers to see that these companies doing business here give sufficient security or, at least, a higher proportion of security than they are giving at present for the amount of business they do.  We have no control over these foreign companies which are doing very big business here.  There is not even an Irish representative on their boards.  They are not concerned with this country to any great extent, beyond seeing what profit they can make out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment <Col N="1634" /> were inserted in the Bill it would alter the whole basis upon which business is at present carried on in this country.  The amendment, I think, is based upon some misconception as to the purpose of deposits by the insurance companies.  The primary purpose of deposits is to prevent the establishment of unsubstantial or mushroom insurance companies.  It is not to these deposits that the insured person looks for his security.  He looks for that to all the assets of the company. In the event of the company being wound up all its assets, wherever situated, would be brought into the common liquidation. Furthermore, so far as the amendment affects the life insurance companies, no life insurance company can keep within the range of court investments the funds sufficient to cover all liabilities to the policy-holders and, at the same time, to provide satisfactory terms to these policy-holders.  The companies investments must be sufficiently broad to secure a sufficient interest return.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the practice in the United States of America.  In that connection I would like to say that we have framed this Bill on the same principle as that on which the Act of 1909 was framed.  That is the principle which I described as freedom with publicity.  That freedom imposed upon the companies certain moral obligations to conduct their business on proper lines.  In America, the United States, Canada and certain countries on the Continent of Europe, the conduct of insurance business was such that rigid statutory requirements as to the basis of valuation and the limitation of investments, amongst other things, had to be imposed.  I hope that such requirements will not be necessary in the Saorstát.  On the general basis of the principle which underlies this Bill, the same principle which underlies the 1909 Act, insurance business will develop. The moral obligation to which I have referred will operate to ensure that the companies engaged in the business will carry it out on proper lines.  I think it would be a fundamental mistake at this Stage to adopt any such amendment as the Deputy proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely put down this amendment in order to make clear to the Minister the fact that there is a difference in the position as between native and foreign companies.  The Minister has absolute control in every respect over the native companies.  He has control over the directors of the companies; he has control over the policy of the companies, and he has control practically almost to a complete extent over their investments, because most of them have investments in Irish concerns.  In any case, the Minister has complete control over them. I put down this amendment to suggest to the Minister that he should see that he has control in some shape over those foreign companies or a control similar to the control he has over Irish companies.  Probably he cannot have the same control, but I am making the suggestion that he should see that he has some control over them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree we are taking very considerable powers of control on the basis on which the Bill is framed, the basis of securing the fullest possible publicity for the affairs of any licensed company; at least such publicity as is necessary to enable persons likely to do business with such company to be fully informed as to its position.  There is, however, another objection to this amendment to which I will draw the Deputy's attention.  He proposes that each company should deposit and keep deposited with the accountant of the Courts of Justice such sum as will cover all its liabilities to policy-holders in the Saorstát.  That amendment would entail setting up a standard valuation basis, and it could only be the bare minimum sufficient for solvency.  It has been our experience that the minimum in such cases would become the maximum or, at any rate, the actual, and it is rather undesirable from the point of view of the policy-holders that such a system should be adopted.  It is much better to have this publicity arrangement, under which all the assets and liabilities of the company can be made known to persons likely to do business with it. These persons will look to these assets in their relation to the general position of the company, and not to the <Col N="1636" /> amount deposited in the High Court as security for their investments.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (5) to add &ldquo;(g) provided always that such company after the date of the granting of such licence may write each year by way of new premiums not more than 90 per cent. of the new premiums which such company wrote in the year immediately preceding such year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a provision limiting the amount of premiums that foreign companies would write each year after the date of the granting of the licence.  I am afraid, from the attitude that the Minister has adopted when dealing with amendments yesterday, for instance the amendment to impose a tariff of 2½ per cent. on foreign companies operating here, and his general attitude that once we allow foreign companies to operate at all, we must not do anything to restrict their operations, there is little use in moving the amendment.  The danger I see, after this Bill becomes law, is that supposing the amalgamation takes place you have a more limited number of Saorstát companies then in operation, and there is just the danger that some other foreign offices may come along and increase the benefits to policy-holders over a period of years with a view to taking in new business, and even collecting old business from the new amalgamated offices.  These will be in their formative years; they will have to watch their tables very carefully, and they could not compete with the foreign companies if they embarked on a plan of that kind for the purpose of squeezing them out.  If a scheme of <Col N="1637" /> the kind suggested were put into operation, without in any way seriously affecting the staffs of the foreign companies here, you would, it is anticipated, after a period of about 50 years, have all this type of business confined to the Saorstát companies.  I am afraid from the Minister's general attitude towards putting any restriction on the foreign companies, there is very little use in arguing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has anticipated my objection to the amendment. It would be completely purposeless to provide for the licensing of foreign companies to do this class of insurance business, and at the same time adopt these provisions.  No company would carry on with this arrangement. It would be completely impossible for a company dealing in life or industrial insurance here to carry on, and I am quite certain no company would.

    <P>The only point is that under the original Bill that the Minister circulated to the companies, it was possible for a composite company that wanted to drop its life business and continue fire and accident business to do so.  In the interval, between the circulation of the white paper and the printing of the green paper, an amendment was made in the section which rendered it impossible for such a composite company to carry on its fire and accident business and drop its life business.  I do not know why the Minister made that change, but, in any case, I think he should revert to the conditions as they were in the original Bill, and allow the composite company, if it so desires, to carry on fire and accident, instead of its life business.</P>

But, subject to the decision of the Dáil upon that question, I do not think that we should have special provisions relating to Saorstát companies and not relating to external companies, because whatever case can be made for the division of business applied with equal force in the case of Saorstát companies as in the case of external companies.</P>

The whole provision is designed to prevent certain changes being effected as between the date on which the Bill <Col N="1640" /> was introduced and the date it becomes law.  It puts a composite company in no different position if it changes its composite nature as between the date on which the Bill was introduced and the date on which it is enacted.  As Deputy Bourke has pointed out, the words were inserted after the draft of the Bill was circulated to the companies in order to repair a defect under which certain changes could be made during the period following the circulation of the Bill and the date on which it became law, changes which, in certain circumstances, might defeat the intentions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 44:</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (9) (c).</P>
      <P>Before the year 1926, there was a very lucrative type of business to be done in this country in the shape of fire business for local authorities.  Very often it was a costly business to get, but when it was got it was very sound, and most companies were very keen on securing it.  It was unusual in this respect that the Irish companies had a better opportunity of securing it than the foreign companies.  It was really the only high-class business in this country in which the Irish companies had an advantage, and for that reason they were very anxious to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1926 a new situation arose.  Certain people in Dublin got together and conceived the idea of forming a body which would have a monopoly of the business of public bodies in Ireland.  There was one difficulty in the way, and that was that, in order to do insurance business here, it was necessary to make a deposit of £20,000.  There was no great prospect of that amount of money being forthcoming.  The people intersted in forming this new company found it was necessary, if their wishes were to be carried out, that legislation would have to be passed in the Dáil.  In order to effect their purpose they went to considerable <Col N="1641" /> trouble in the way of lobbying Deputies, in getting control of the various local authorities and of the General Council of Country Councils, and generally in making themselves very active in Government Departments. I happened to be Minister for Local Government at that particular time. I always had the interest of Irish insurance companies very much at heart.  Just at that time I was primarily concerned with the interests of public bodies which were very keen on the measure that was then being sponsored by those gentlemen.  They pointed out that the company, if formed, would be able to effect savings for the rate payers in the way of reduced premiums, and were able to quote the example of a similar company that had been set up in England.</P>
    <P>I decided that it was only right that the Oireachtas should have an opportunity of voting on their proposal. Accordingly, a Bill was introduced.  I left it to a free vote of the Dáil to decide whether they would permit this company to carry on without making a deposit of £20,000.  Some members of the House dissented from the proposal, but eventually the Bill was passed and this company came into being.  It has been in operation for the last ten years.  So far as I can gather from the inquiries that I have made, the company has not justified its existence.  It has not done any of the things that we were told originally it was going to do.  It has not reduced the premiums paid by local authorities. It has not given better security to them because the funds of this company are by no means as great as the combined funds of the Irish companies which were formerly doing the business of local authorities.  It is not keeping the same amount of business in the country either because, having very limited funds, it has to reinsure a great deal of its business outside the country.  On the other hand, I need hardly say that the effect on the other Irish companies of the loss of this business was considerable.  As I have said, this particular class of business was the only high-class business in which the Irish companies of that time had an advantage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> There is another point.  This company has not been of any assistance to the local authorities.  At the time that the various Irish companies were competing for the business of public bodies, in order to get the paying end of it which was the fire end, they were usually prepared to do another end of the business of public bodies&mdash;the fidelity guarantee end&mdash;which was by no means a paying end.  Anyhow, when this company got the fire end of the business of local authorities, it was an understood thing that it would also do the fidelity guarantee business but the company does not do that.  Hence, local authorities find it almost impossible to get cover for that particular risk.</P>
    <P>There is another consideration and it is this: that in order to get that business the Irish companies and, in cases where they were interested, foreign companies were often times prepared to extend loans to public authorities at very favourable rates of interest.  As Deputies know, an insurance company is in a much better position to extend a loan to a local authority than, say, the banks.  They look more for short-term loans because of the fact that they may have to call in their capital at short notice.  In the case of insurance companies, their risks do not mature for a number of years and, in most cases, this type of business was found to be very suitable for them.  They had good security and a decent rate of interest, and it suited them well to give loans to public authorities often times in order to get the fire business.  These Irish companies and other companies were prepared to give loans of this character on favourable terms to public authorities.  Now this particular body &mdash;the Public Bodies Mutual&mdash;is not in a position to give those loans.  I may say that the company has failed to achieve the purpose it was established to achieve.  Looking over the debate on the Second Reading of that Bill, I find that Professor Magennis was one of the strongest in denouncing it.  He used very strong language at that time.  He said: &ldquo;To my mind, it is the worst measure the Government has introduced and it is difficult to believe <Col N="1643" /> that they are serious in desiring to push it through&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And were you serious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bourke Mr. Bourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bourke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there is not a single solid argument in the name of business that could be urged in favour of it.&rdquo;  I do not think that even Professor Magennis realised at that time that that particular concern would prove the complete failure it has since proved.  There is one thing which I am sure he did not anticipate, and it is that those who were responsible for putting through that measure would, at a later stage, invest the funds, which, if they were to be used for any purpose, should have been used to relieve the burden on the ratepayers and the premiums, in an insurance corporation which was going to compete with itself for the business of public bodies.  That is the position we have reached to-day with regard to this particular company, and I feel that it is really ridiculous to have that company operating.  It was organised to provide cheap insurance for local bodies.  At the time, the tariff companies were denounced, because their rates were altogether too high, but I understand that this company is demanding the same premiums to-day.  Of course, while the competition was there, they went a little lower than the tariff rates to get the business&mdash;I believe 3/4d. lower, to be exact&mdash;but when there was no competition, their rates were as high as the tariff companies' rates and have not been reduced since.  I think it is a ridiculous situation when one finds this company, set up to cut out ordinary insurance companies, investing its money in very speculative business which is being established for the complete destruction of itself.  I think the Minister should not stand over its continuance any longer.</P>

I do not want to use against the Deputy the argument that he, as the Minister, was responsible for that Act.  I am quite certain that there are a number of Acts passed about that time the repeal of which now would be quite justified, and possibly there are a number of Bills being introduced now the repeal of which will be justified in ten years' time; but what I do say is that we should not by an amendment of this Bill nullify the provisions of that Act.  If it is seriously proposed that that Act should be repealed, I think we should have a Bill for that purpose brought before the Dáil so that it could be discussed by itself, without relation to the other many and contentious points that arise under this Bill.  The only purpose of this particular paragraph in the sub-section is to provide that, if a company complying with the provisions of the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926, applies for a licence to do the class of business it is entitled to do, the Minister shall grant the licence. We are merely providing here that it will get the licence which is now required to carry on that business, but the main concession given to that particular company&mdash;the Irish Public Bodies Mutual Assurance Company&mdash; by the Act of 1926, was an exemption from the requirement of a deposit in consideration of its confining its business to local authorities.  If there is a case now for requiring that company to make a deposit we can have that case discussed separately on a Bill to amend or repeal the Local Authorities (Mutual Assurance) Act, 1926.  I think it would be completely unfair <Col N="1645" /> and wrong merely to nullify that Act by making it impossible for the company formed under it to get a licence under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bourke introduced the Bill in 1926 when he was Minister for Local Government, and it was, as he said himself, local government considerations that occupied his mind.  There may be local government considerations which justify the continuation of the Bill now and, therefore, if its repeal is suggested, it should be considered as a local government measure, and not as a measure bearing on insurance.  So far as this Bill is concerned, we are merely continuing the provision which was considered necessary in the interest of local authorities in 1926 when that Act was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, I think, may be described as the fundamental section in this entire Bill.  It embodies really the whole principle of the Bill and purports to contain practically the entire machinery which will enable the Bill to operate on that principle.  The section itself has 11 sub-sections, and something like 20 paragraphs in addition, and it is, in my experience, at all events, one of the longest sections in any Bill I have come across.  The provisions are complex and complicated, and, in some respects, almost impossible to construe.  There is a good deal of repetition in the section and a good deal of ambiguity.  I have already dealt with the special matters affecting Saorstát Eireann companies on sub-section 4 paragraph (b), and I propose at the moment to deal only with the real fundamental principle which underlies this section.  I stated here previously to-day that I approach the consideration of the problem which the Minister has to solve with rather an open mind, and with fairly full knowledge of the difficulties of the problem and the complexities of the situation that he has to deal with.  I would be prepared to give every possible consideration to any suggestion that emerged from the Government to deal with that problem.  The Government, through their Minister, have selected one particular method, above all other methods, for dealing with the situation that confronts us here, and that method is embodied in this section.  The guiding principle of that method is the separation of the life and industrial business from, what I call, general insurance business.  It may be that the separation of the insurance business they did in the composite companies, in this country, is a desirable thing. It may be the best possible method of solving the peculiar situation that exists in this country.  I do not know. I want to be convinced of that.  I want solid, substantial, cogent reasons to <Col N="1647" /> justify the very revolutionary principle embodied in this section, and for which there exists, so far as I can ascertain, no precedent in any part of the world where insurance business is carried on.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that Canada is one of the countries where the control of insurance business by the Legislature is brought to its highest pitch. The principle embodied in this Bill is not to be found in the Statute Book of the Federal Parliament, or in any of the provincial Legislatures.  Can the Minister give any precedent for this principle embodied in Section 12? If he cannot give any precedent, can he give any reason to substantiate this very revolutionary proposal which will interfere with the normal method by which the insurance business is ruled in British companies, foreign companies and Saorstát companies. If the Minister can produce cogent reasons to justify the introduction of this proposal I, for one, am prepared to be convinced.  I approach this matter on no political grounds, with no political motive in view, and with no desire to give advantage to any particular company in this country. But I think the proposals here will undoubtedly hit the Irish companies far harder than they will hit the British or the foreign companies.  I think there can be no gainsaying that proposition.  But I want to get, irrespective of Saorstát companies or the British companies and apart from whichever of those companies will be most effected, some cogent reason to justify a principle which, in the first place, is an interference with the lawful carrying on of business by people who have carried on their business here for many years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mere interference with business by legislation in this country, or any interference at all by State action with business, requires strong ground and strong reason to justify it.  The Minister has merely stated, in reply to questions put from this side of the House, on the Second Reading Stage, and on subsequent stages, that he is convinced that this is the best method of dealing with the situation that exists in this <Col N="1648" /> country.  We may have a problem in this country that exists in no other country in the world.  I do not know; I do not think so.  But if we have, what is the necessity, and what is the justification for this proposal?  We have not heard it yet.  I heard nothing coming from the Minister except his own personal view and conviction that this is the best method of dealing with the situation.  Surely he ought to produce convicing arguments and he ought to tell us the source from which this proposal emanated. Does it come from his own advisers or from outside sources, perhaps interested sources?  I make no allegation against anyone but I want to know where this proposal emanated from and what the justification is.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows the difficulties of the Minister, and I appreciate his difficulties, in connection with certain matters in this country.  I do not think this proposal will in any way minimise these difficulties.  Some of the other proposals may enable these difficulties to be met, and, perhaps, surmounted; but I cannot see any justification for interfering on the lines set forth in Section 12 of the Bill, either in the case of foreign or British or Irish companies.  The Minister says that the effect will be to throw more business in the way of the Irish companies.  I cannot follow that argument.  I cannot see how any benefit will accrue to any of them from this proposal.  I can see nothing but distrust emerge if this proposal is put into operation.  I see nothing but injury to the business of existing companies in this country, some of whom are endeavouring to carry on their business on strict lines and are in a fair degree of solvency up to the present.  There are many companies in this country to which that description may apply and I think it is merely interfering with the business they have built up in composite offices, as they are called, and interference along lines for which there is no justification and for which there is no precedent.</P>
    <P>This is State interference <i>in excelsis</i>, and can cause nothing but dislocation to business, loss of profit to shareholders <Col N="1649" /> and the throwing away of good-will in business built up in a considerable number of years, and which will lead to the disemployment and unemployment of large numbers of their staffs.  I await with interest the Minister's justification of Section 12 of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all sympathise with the Minister's idea in reference to this section.  I take it he thinks that the policy holders should be protected. Everybody, on all sides of the House, would rather agree with that principle.  But when we come to arguing that in practice we meet with great divergence of views.  There is an aspect in this matter of the partition of the insurance companies, which I think is one of the main provisions of the Bill, that has not been raised before.  I would suggest to the Minister that while his intentions are excellent he is not proceeding on sound lines to carry them out.  If the House will bear with me for a few minutes I would ask them to look at what has brought this about.  We are all conversant with the difficulties of Irish manufacturers in this country. They have to produce goods to compete with more favoured methods of manufacture, whether in costs or otherwise, from other sources.  Now the insurance companies operating in this country are not very different from manufacturers in this respect.  They have to take business at rates that are largely fixed by world conditions and operate these with Irish costs.  That is the fundamental fact that has produced the state of affairs that we are considering here to-day.  While I suppose there are isolated cases of mismanagement, or cases where the management of the business has not been all it should be, I take it that, in the main, the results brought about to-day have been achieved by the companies doing their best under the existing circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the remedy that the Minister suggests?  He has discovered, as is well known to experts in the insurance business, that certain companies were not all that they ought to be from the financial point of view.  How <Col N="1650" /> does he proceed to alter that?  His main idea is partition.  There is one matter about this partition that I think there can be no controversy about, namely, that it will raise the cost of operating insurance companies in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>How will it raise the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it will decrease their turnover without their being able to make a corresponding percentage reduction in their expenses. I think there can be absolutely no question about that.  The Minister seems at one time to be anxious that the insurance companies should effect savings by economies with redundant staff, and then again to-day he says that he would welcome the formation of small subsidiary companies to take over the general business of certain insurance companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but I understood the Minister to say that. Anyway, it is contemplated that insurance companies will be formed to take over risks that cannot be placed&mdash;that will be, so to speak, floating about the market when these amalgamations take place.  The Minister will correct me if I misinterpreted him when I understood him to say that the more of these companies that were formed the better, that, the keener the competition, the better would be the position for the Irish person who had insurance business to place.  I do not think that that at all follows, because if you have an increased number of companies operating here with a reduced turnover, it is quite possible that they may find themselves unable to carry on with the existing rates and that, in the last resort, the cure might be almost worse than the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point I stress is that the Minister apparently is prepared to sacrifice the good companies or the well-managed companies in order to save the position of the bad ones.  I think that position could be compared with, say, the Minister for Justice, if <Col N="1651" /> his attention was called to an increase of cases of robbery with violence in the city, making a rule that the citizens should only go out in twos and threes.  I think the Minister is proceeding to penalise the companies that ought to be regarded by him in the best light.  The companies that have managed their business well are, apparently, going to be put to extra expense and, presumably, have their turnover reduced.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this that the Minister has not dwelt upon was referred to by Deputy Bourke when he said that if the Minister did not feel he had sufficient powers to deal with insurance companies, whose funds were not in the state that they ought to be, he ought to take those powers.  That is the line upon which the Minister ought to proceed.  If there is any danger of the policy-holders' position being jeopardised, the Minister ought to have recourse to Government action and act quite sternly with these people, and, I think, they will get very little sympathy from the general public if they have got themselves into a position in which the Minister had to interfere.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to this fact, that where companies are amalgamated under this section, it will not mean that the two companies which are amalgamated will then be perfectly solvent.  It might result in the position of a perfectly sound company being somewhat jeopardised by the business brought in. I should like to urge upon the Minister that far better results could be achieved by interfering with companies which are not in a perfectly sound position.  He could then put them under observation or on some sort of probation, and make them get themselves on to something approaching a sound position.  Because I apprehend that we may be approaching a stage in which the Minister, having amalgamated a whole lot of insurance companies, may either find that an increasing number of companies deserve drastic Government action, or that an increase in the insurance premiums charged in this country may be inevitable. <Col N="1652" /> That is an aspect that possibly he has not sufficiently considered. While I would regard that as a desirable thing if the policy-holder's position was jeopardised, still some people might think that the cure was almost worse than the disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, before dealing with the questions addressed to me by Deputy Costello, to say that this proposal to separate the classes of insurance business, and to confine companies to doing one class or another, is not the central provision in the Bill.  If that proposal were extracted from the Bill entirely, it would still be a consistent measure, and one, in my opinion, well worth passing. Neither is that proposal introduced here, because of any doubts that may have arisen as to the solvency of insurance companies doing business here; it is not introduced as a solution of any problems associated with the solvency of those companies.  It is introduced as a desirable provision, which is, in our opinion, well worth having embodied in the law relating to insurance, irrespective of the present condition of insurance companies operating here, and one which might effectively be utilised in the circumstances of almost any country.  It is not a revolutionary provision.  It is, in fact, embodied in the law of a number of countries at the present time.  The idea which gave rise to it is not in any sense a new one.  The idea that has always been in the minds of the Government legislating in respect of insurance matters for a long period of time past is that policy-holders in life and industrial branches should be afforded the full security of the separate funds created by the assets which their premiums have brought into being, and that there should be no possibility of the life and industrial funds being used to make good the losses or cover the expenses arising on general business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference between life and industrial assurance and general assurance.  Life and industrial assurance contracts are of a long-term character.  The persons making those contracts with the companies make payments now in consideration of benefits which they hope to receive or which their relatives may hope to <Col N="1653" /> receive a considerable period of time ahead, and those contracts are to be contrasted with general insurance contracts which cover a short period of risk only.  The idea of protecting the life and industrial policy-holders in a composite company against the funds which are their security being used to cover losses or meet expenses arising on general business has always been in the minds of persons framing legislation to deal with insurance.  In fact, many provisions in the existing law relating to insurance were framed for that purpose.  There are two ideas as to how that problem can be approached, and how life and industrial policy-holders can be protected. The first is by securing an effective division of the assets within the company doing both classes of business.  It was considered by the framers of the 1909 Act that Section 3 of that measure secured that the funds of life policy-holders could not be used for any other purpose than the life policy-holders' interests.  That particular section did not work out as was contemplated, and it is certainly not the case now that that section operates in that manner.</P>
    <P>There are still people who think that it is possible to devise some system of ensuring that completely separate funds can be maintained, but, in my opinion, and in the opinion of a number of people who have given their expert consideration to this matter, it is not possible. In the course of my introductory speech on the Second Reading I referred to the Report of the British Departmental Committee, which was published in 1927&mdash;the Committee known as the Clausen Committee.  They put forward, in a draft Bill which they prepared, a set of proposals for securing this effective division of assets, but they did not claim that they had provided a complete solution of the difficulties which they saw.  I quoted from their report as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Committee cannot hope that on such an intricate and difficult subject matter their work would prove to be flawless.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is our opinion, and the opinion of many people who have given consideration to this matter, that there is no <Col N="1654" /> effective way of securing that life policy-holders' funds will not be used for general branch purposes otherwise than by a separation of classes of insurance as is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is using two words as if they meant the same thing&mdash;&ldquo;funds&rdquo; and &ldquo;assets&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not entirely, I agree, but I am using the two phrases in a colloquial sense and not in a legal sense.  I am pointing to the fact that there are created, out of the premiums paid by life policy-holders, certain assets which are the security of those policy-holders, and from which they can hope to receive the benefits which they have bought.  It is our intention, and in fact it has always been the purpose of insurance legislation, to provide that those funds cannot be used to make good the losses arising upon other classes of business.  It must be remembered that under the present state of the law the basis of valuation is fixed by the directors of the company, and the State has no power to reject the valuation, although the basis of it may be grossly inadequate.  It is possible for the directors of the company to fix the surplus they want to bring out and to adjust the valuation basis so that it will, in fact, bring out that surplus.  Having brought out the surplus they can use it to make good the losses on general business, or to pay dividends, but on the winding up &mdash;if there should be a winding up&mdash;of the life funds, thus depleted, the losses would be shown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the only way in which we can effectively prevent life funds being used for general branch purposes is to effect the separation of those businesses in the manner which the Bill proposes.  It is true that it may be argued that the operation of both classes of business by one company may effect a slight reduction in overhead expenses.  Such a reduction in overhead expenses is a good thing, but <Col N="1655" /> it is not, I think, an argument for the maintenance of a system which enables or might enable life funds to be used for purposes quite foreign to those for which they were set up.  It is I think, also incorrect to say that this part of the provisions of the Bill will hit Saorstát companies harder than other companies doing business here.  There are certain Saorstát offices doing composite business.  There are a number of foreign offices doing composite business, and the effect of this provision upon one class will be similar to the effect on another class. In any event, we think it is a provision which should be adopted, and we should not fail to adopt it because it may involve certain difficulties at the present time.  These difficulties will pass, and when they pass the improved position of the persons doing life insurance business with both Saorstát companies operating here and foreign companies operating here will be well worth the trouble involved.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is necessary to deal with the matter further at this stage.  I have given the general considerations which operated in the minds of the Government and which induced them to put in these proposals in the Bill.  It is true that we considered carefully, not whether the proposals were good proposals in themselves, but whether the benefits which their enactment would involve were sufficient to outweigh the difficulties and problems which they would create for the companies concerned.  We had to consider that.  I think there was no question in the minds of any member of the Executive Council, or of anybody who came to the consideration of this problem, that the provisions in themselves were desirable.  If there were no such thing as insurance business here and we were legislating for something which was going to arise in the future, I do not think anybody would question the desirability of having this separation of classes of business.  The only argument that can be advanced against it is the fact that certain companies are now carrying on composite businesses and that they are going to be placed in a difficulty by the change in the law affecting them. <Col N="1656" /> That is a problem, but, on balance, we decided that the advantages well outweighed the disadvantages, and that is particularly so when the number of Saorstát companies operating here is small and when their operations are not extensive.  Most of the composite companies operating here at present are foreign companies, and for many of them the problems created will be much greater, in so far as they are operating in other territories than this and, if they continue to operate here, they will have to make special arrangements governing their business in this country which would not be applicable to the circumstances of their business elsewhere.  It is not improbable that a number of these foreign offices will not continue to do business here in consequence of this provision, but I do not think we need be unduly concerned in relation to them.  In so far as they are concerned, they must do business in this State, if they wish to do it, in conformity with the laws that this Dáil enacts.  Our primary concern, undoubtedly, must be our own companies, and so far as they are affected our concern, undoubtedly, must be to ensure that the reorganisation, which is going to be inevitable in any event, is effected with the least possible inconvenience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, the Minister has announced one good principle&mdash;that the policy-holders in life and industrial assurance business should be afforded the full security of the separate funds of these businesses, and that there should be no possibility of life and ordinary industrial funds being used to cover loss on other parts &mdash;an excellent principle, and one that has been acted on in many countries, and the Minister can fortify himself by reference to a number of countries if he founds on that principle and no other.  But then he went on to speak about assets.  I would point out to the Minister that in the later report of 1934 of the Committee of Industrial Assurance, this phrase occurs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In connection, moreover, with this subject, the point arises that, while the law requires separate funds to be maintained for ordinary and industrial life business, respectively, and for certain other classes of business, it does not require the assets to be separated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then, in the last report that I have of the Industrial Assurance Commissioner, which is for the 31st December, 1934, there is a summary on page 66.  There is a balance sheet showing various figures, and we have the figures for funds and liabilities advanced here in one column, and when I come to assets I find a separate figure amounting to £64,000,000.  There is clearly a distinction made there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the Minister, unfortunately, did not advert to that distinction in time.  The point that the Minister has to substantiate in regard to this section, if he stands by the section at all, is not the first principle to which I have referred&mdash; on that there would be general agreement&mdash;that there should be no possibility of funds in the one type of business, life or industrial, being used for other classes of business.  The Minister, however, must go a step further and, either from his own imagination or from his own reason, give us arguments, or else get them from some other countries, forcing us to accept the proposal of the partitioning of businesses as being good for either those people who have policies in life or industrial businesses or policy-holders in the other types of business.  That is the pivotal point of Section 12.  Deputy Costello has referred to the number of sub-sections and paragraphs, but the net point is very clear.  The Minister has decided that it is going to make for better business in some way to separate life and industrial business on the one hand and every other class of business on the other.  Why is that being done?</P>
      <P>I want to hear an argument for that.  I think there was argument by way of reference and that the Minister said that people who have thought of it for themselves have felt that a division of the assets&mdash;I do not know whether he meant a real division of the funds, or whether that is the division in other countries&mdash;cannot be achieved except by a division of business in a way in which a particular company will not be allowed to engage.  Let us take two classes of business (a) ordinary life and industrial insurance, and (b) everything else.  The Minister says that other people think that that is the proper solution of the problem.  I want to know if we cannot get an answer in so many words as to what other countries have done this.</P>

I suggest that the scheme in this Bill is to be found rarely.  I have not been able to discover it and I have not the resources that the Department has.  The Minister ought to tell us precisely where this thing is done and why, and the result of the separate companies which had to be formed out of the scattered remnants.  Then we would have a picture on which to make a comparison.  If the Minister reads his speech he will find that there is nothing much on the important issues in the way of argument to counter. The Minister has not given any scheme.  He said that the generality of people believed this is the way to do this.  I suggest that common experience with regard to insurance all over the world does not back the Minister in his suggestion.  The Minister told us that Section 12 was not the kernel of this Bill.  I am surprised to hear that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Unemployment Assistance (Second Employment Period) Order, 1936, presented to Dáil Eireann, pursuant to Section 7 (3) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, on the 26th day of May, 1936, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this motion is to ask the Dáil to annul the Unemployment Assistance (Second Employment Period) Order, 1936, which was made by the Minister under Section 7 (3) of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933. By virtue of the power conferred upon him under the Act, the Minister is authorised to make orders, the object of which is to deprive large sections of people of unemployment assistance benefit during a portion of the year, and by the manner in which the powers of the Act in that respect are operated, it is not necessary for the Minister to come to the House to justify orders he makes.  It is said the Minister is in the specially privileged position to issue an order and to lay it on the Table of the House, and is not called upon to justify the deprivation of benefit which will be widespread if the order becomes effective.  I would prefer the position, whereby we might have from the Minister at the outset a statement as to his justification for the issue of an order of this kind. Instead we are put into the unfavourable position that the Minister makes the order, and it is only by a motion of this kind that it is possible to extract from him the reasons&mdash;even then it is not possible to do so&mdash;which justify the issue of an order of this kind.  I should like to call the attention of the House to the increasing audacity of the Minister in respect of the issue of the Employment Period Orders.  In 1935 the Minister issued a Second Employment Period Order, which deprived single men, or widowers, who had no dependents, residing in non-urbanised areas, of unemployment <Col N="1662" /> assistance benefit from 17th July to 1st October.  The deprivation of benefit of a large section of persons under that Employment Period Order resulted in the saving to the State of a very substantial sum of money.  This year, however, the Minister is not satisfied to allow the Employment Period Order to run the gamut of last year, but he comes to the House with a different Order, the object of which is to deprive similar persons of unemployment assistance benefit, during the period June 3rd until October 27th. In 1936 the currency of the Minister's order is six weeks earlier and runs four weeks later.  Single persons and widowers without dependents living in non-urbanised areas will this year by the Minister's order be deprived of unemployment assistance benefit for a period of ten weeks longer than last year.</P>
    <P>We ought to have from the Minister some justification for an Order of that kind.  The issue of the Order requires justification, but its extension for a period of ten weeks longer than it operated last year requires some extraordinary justification on the part of the Minister.  I confess that I am unable to understand on what ground the Minister seeks to justify an Order of this kind.  If any possible ground could be put forward by the Minister it would probably be that there is a greater volume of work in rural areas, and that consequently it is justifiable to deprive persons mentioned in the Order of unemployment assistance benefit during a period which has been extended by ten weeks, this year.  Is that the fact?  Does the Minister really believe that there is a greater volume of work available in rural areas for single men and widowers without dependents?  If the Minister is going to put forward that extraordinary contention in support of this Order, I would like to know if it refers to the country as a whole or to particular parts, and on what grounds that contention is based?  So far as I can judge the position from very close contact with rural areas, I can see nothing to justify the Minister in assuming that there will be employment available this year for the very large number <Col N="1663" /> of persons who will be deprived of unemployment assistance benefit during the currency of the Order.  In any case, I know of nothing which justifies the Minister assuming that not only will there be a large volume of employment available, but that it will be available for ten weeks longer than last year.  If the Minister wants to put forward that audacious justification of this Order I would like to hear him attempting to explain or justify it, either by reference to the country as a whole or to particular areas.</P>
    <P>I should like individual Deputies of the House to tell us what grounds they have for believing that in rural areas &mdash;and in many cases that often means fairly large-sized towns&mdash;there is going to be an abundance of work available from the 3rd June until 27th October sufficient to absorb all the persons whom the Minister is going to deprive of benefit by this Order.  If that large volume of employment is available at present&mdash;and the Order is operative as from to-day&mdash;it is rather striking that the figures of the unemployed registered at the employment exchanges do not appear to bear out the assumption underlying this Order, namely that an abundance of employment is available. The Minister knows that until he introduced his Employment Period Order in respect of persons with holdings of land having each a valuation of £4 or over, there were 143,000 persons registered at the unemployment exchanges.  I have no hesitation in saying that that number is still there, less the number whom the Minister deprived of unemployment assistance benefit by his First Employment Period Order.  Yet the Minister seems to assume now that there is going to be an abundance of employment available between 3rd June and 27th October, sufficient to take off the register of the employment exchanges and to put into employment a large number of persons who will be guillotined in the matter of receiving unemployment assistance benefit under the terms of this Order.</P>
    <P>I complained in the debate on the last Order, and in the course of discussions on Estimates for the Minister's Department in this House, that <Col N="1664" /> these Employment Period Orders were issued by the Minister without any inquiry having previously been undertaken to justify the issue of these Orders.  I still doubt, and express my doubts here, whether the Minister has made any detailed inquiry, either on a national scale or in reference to particular areas, which would justify him in believing that there is going to be an abundance of work available in rural areas to absorb persons deprived of unemployment assistance benefit.  I think the Order is issued merely to deprive persons of unemployment assistance benefit.  I think it could be more aptly described, not as an Employment Period Order, but as an Economy Order, because its only purpose is to save money for the Exchequer.  It is obvious, as I think the Minister will probably be compelled to acknowledge, that, prior to the issue of the Order, he has made no detailed inquiry in any area to justify the issue, either there or elsewhere, of an Order of this kind.  The only purpose therefore of the issue of an Order of this character is to deprive single persons and widowers without dependents of unemployment assistance benefit for the longest period that the Minister dares to inflict upon them.  This Employment Order, if it stood alone, would be bad, but it is linked now with the Employment Period Order affecting smallholders with a valuation of £4 or over.  Even these two Employment Period Orders do not stand by themselves.  Recently we had painful evidence of the adoption in the Minister's Department of the practice of disqualifying persons from receiving unemployment assistance benefit on the plea that they were not genuinely seeking work.  In my own constituency and in other constituencies a substantial number of persons have been deprived of unemployment assistance benefit on the plea that they are not available for, and are not genuinely seeking, work.</P>
    <P>Many of these persons have been told that their unemployment assistance benefit would be suspended but that they would have an opportunity of appealing to a court of referees. They are invited to go to the court of referees and present their case.  Many <Col N="1665" /> of these people are penniless, many of them do not possess even a bicycle, but they are invited to go to a court of referees which in some cases sits 30 miles away from their homes.  In their absence, they, of course, are unable to defend themselves, and the court presumes to pass judgment on the question as to whether they are available for work and whether they are genuinely seeking work.  I think figures which can be obtained in the Minister's own Department, possibly figures obtainable as a result of instructions issued by the Minister himself, will show that a large number of persons who were genuinely entitled to benefit have, for some time, been denied that benefit merely by the Department saying in a general way, as I believe in some instances, that persons are not available for work and are not genuinely seeking work.  We had deputations of persons, who interviewed members of this House, declaring that, in the case of Dublin, these persons were expected to produce letters from employers to show that they were genuinely seeking work, as if it were possible for unemployed persons, personally unknown to employers, to get an employer to sit down and write a letter for the information of the Minister's Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is what the tyrant always says if anybody questions his authority.  That is what the dictator always says, that Parliament is quite unnecessary.  That is the kind of impetuosity the Minister should guard against.  I do not think that the motion is unnecessary.  Thousands of people will be affected by it.  I was saying that, apart from the two Employment Period Orders, the Minister, by Departmental practice, not content with depriving the persons who will be subject to this Order of unemployment assistance, is depriving a large number of persons genuinely entitled to unemployment assistance benefit of the benefits to which they are clearly entitled under the Act.  He is doing this on the faked plea that they are not available for work and are not genuinely seeking work. Although the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed to provide for the payment of benefit to persons who complied with certain statutory requirements, we find that, by the issue of Employment Period Orders, the Minister is depriving large numbers of them of that benefit for periods never contemplated when the Bill was passing through the House.  On top of that, by the unsympathetic manner in which the Act is being administered in certain cases, the Minister is depriving other persons of the benefits to which they are properly entitled.  It may be said that these people have a remedy against the Minister, but their title to unemployment assistance depends on the judgment of the Minister's officials. <Col N="1667" /> If these people had statutory rights and money to enforce their rights, a very different story might be told.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, and I do not propose to refer to it further.  Between Employment Period Orders and unsympathetic Departmental practice, there seems to be a conspiracy to deprive as many persons as possible of unemployment assistance benefit.  That conspiracy is fortified by two Employment Period Orders of the character the House has been treated to this year.  I hope in these circumstances the House will see its way to annul the Order which the Minister has laid on the Table of the House.  I suggest that if this were not purely an economy measure, if this Order were not issued purely for the purpose of saving money to the Exchequer, the Minister could ensure that persons receiving unemployment assistance benefit would be made work during the period that work is available.  I do not know of any persons who want to draw the miserable rate of unemployment assistance benefit at the employment exchanges in preference to working for decent rates of wages.  We had the extraordinary case quoted by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement, but these unemployed men would all prefer work at decent rates of wages to trekking miles for the small rate of benefit they receive at the employment exchanges.  These people do not want anything in the form of a State grant at the employment exchanges; they prefer work. They prefer regular employment, but because of the inability of the Minister to provide them with that regular employment it is necessary to pass legislation to provide them with some fragmentary means of subsistence during periods of involuntary idleness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that this vast mass of work is to be available in rural areas between the 3rd June and 27th October, the Minister need have no hesitation in pointing out the existence of the work to those affected by this Order and saying: &ldquo;There is the work and there is the rate of wages, which is a fair rate.  Take that work.&rdquo; Knowing that the work is there and that these people have been called to that work, he can in such cases automatically <Col N="1669" /> withdraw the unemployment assistance.  That is a simple means of testing whether this work is available or not.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the work is not there.  He knows that there is no work available for these people on the scale contemplated in this Order.  Knowing that the work is not there, and cannot be found for this large number of persons in the period mentioned, the Minister proceeds by a blanket motion to say that everybody who is single or a widower without dependents will be deprived of benefit during the currency of the Order.  All that is done without any inquiry being made by the Minister as to whether or not employment is, in fact, available to those persons.</P>
    <P>I think that this Order is most unfair.  There is no justification whatever for making an Order of this kind and the Minister, in his public speeches, has not attempted to justify the making of an Order of this kind. It is easy to say to unemployed persons who are defenceless against a powerful Government Department that this Order is going to be made and that the State will save money by it. I suggest, however, that it is a most unfair way of interpreting the Act and of treating these people, who are in such bad circumstances at the present time.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it would be much preferable, even at the cost of the Order running on for a day or two, to have this matter properly ventilated and, if necessary, taken up again on Friday or this day week.  Deputy Norton has raised a point to which the Minister could give an answer very easily if the answer is available to him.  As Deputy Norton has pointed out, unmarried men and widowers without dependents in certain areas were deemed to be able to find employment for 11 <Col N="1670" /> weeks in the summer period of last year.  This year, they are deemed to be able to find employment for 21 weeks.  Available employment, so far as rural Ireland is concerned, has so increased that the period can be doubled.  Will the Minister tell us of one area in Ireland where this amazing outbreak of employment has taken place?</P>

      <P>Yes, and pilfered from other people.  Will the Minister tell us if the employment that is now general has broken out suddenly? How did it come that, up to the 3rd June, it was not supposed that there was employment available for all these people, and on the 3rd June, suddenly, all unmarried men and widowers without dependents can find employment?  That is an amazing situation between the 2nd and 3rd of June.  I should like to be referred to some place where I could find the inhabitants rejoicing over the fact that a bleak prospect on the 2nd of June had been transformed into a bright daylight prosperity on the 3rd of June.  Can the Minister tell us, or can he by statistics show that there was a gradual approach to this sudden employment or was there any great drop in the number of people registering other than the drop that could be explained by the First Employment Period Order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will probably get statistical information on this because I stressed the words other than that which can be explained by the first Order.  That surely is a phenomenon worth noting.  I read in a paper about people who set out in other countries under the slogan: <Col N="1671" />&ldquo;Unemployment can be conquered,&rdquo; and in those places we have articles written by a subsidised Press in which it is pointed out that it is being cured, and we have men there with their eyes glued upon maps into which they are sticking pins showing where the unemployment is being reduced.  The Minister has gone far better than that.  He deems there is employment, and behold, employment is there.  Since the creation there has been nothing like it.  That is the situation to which Deputy Norton has, in cold, calculated language, referred to this evening.  He found himself amazed at some of the Minister's pronouncements.  The Minister said that the whole question of unemployment in Ireland was concerned with a mere matter of 40,000 men.  On a later occasion he told us when his Turf Bill was through the House he would have 50,000 additional men employed at turf-cutting.  There we are to have part of his promise about recalling the exiles realised. That, of course, is in the region of promises.  The Minister wipes out unemployment in that way by promising to alter the whole problem surrounding the 40,000 unemployed.  How many did he wipe out in the first Order?  I remember the time when the Minister himself and the members of his Party were vociferous about the cases of individuals which were raised here and were found to have in the particular circumstances employment on the farms.  The Minister, when in opposition, was loth to believe that a man with a few acres of land had employment on that land at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred rather lightly and casually to one matter. The Deputy ought to have realised by this time that there is no longer, if there ever was, any sincere feeling for unemployed people in this country. There is no longer any such feeling in the hearts of the present Government. There has been a gradual approach in this matter.  The Minister showed the new tendency about unemployment. His attitude was shared by one of his colleagues in the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party, who shouted out here that the unemployed people of <Col N="1672" /> Galway were too lazy to work.  Then the Minister for Finance, in a sonorous speech, rendered that in a different key, when he said that a number of people refused to take up work because they thought it was too far for them to travel to it, and he went on to say that an incident like the one he mentioned showed that there were numbers of people receiving aid from the Unemployment Fund who did not deserve to be on it.  The Minister knows well that so far from work being available, the unemployed are vainly trying to get work.  The Minister's own statistics with regard to rural Ireland paint an entirely different picture.  The statistics show that in 1934, as far as rural Ireland was concerned, there was no increase in the case of those who were working for hire on the farms.  But there was an increase in the case of people who were working on their own farms.</P>
    <P>In 1935, even the numbers of the farmers and their families working on the land had gone down.  So far as labourers were concerned, temporary employment on the land was down by 600, so far as those working for hire were concerned; but the number of farmers and their families working on the land was up by 2,400.</P>
    <P>These statistics show that for some period of the year&mdash;a quarter of the year&mdash;there was employment available for 2,400 at bad wages.  We have the position now, according to the Minister, that from the 3rd of June to the 27th of October all married men without dependents and all widowers without dependents are able to find work. The whole thing is beyond a miracle. I wonder if this thing is going to develop.  The Minister himself some weeks ago when asked a question about the point that Deputy Norton has referred to, the &ldquo;unemployable&rdquo; classes in the country, admitted that the numbers were a very small percentage of those who were down as unemployed.  There certainly was not 2 per cent. of the unemployed who would not take work if it were available. The Minister himself at that time backed up that calculation, but at a later stage we had the Fianna Fáil back bencher from Galway saying that <Col N="1673" /> the people there were too lazy to work. The Minister himself agrees that the number of the unemployable is a very small fraction of those who were signing up.  But the Minister suddenly makes conditions better.  He does not bring that about gradually by saying that he will make more stringent regulations. But suddenly he says work is available and all those seeking for work are told that they are able to get employment for 21 weeks on the land. Deputy Norton asks what work is available this year that was not available last year.  This year people are deemed to be able to get work for 21 weeks as against 11 weeks in last year. That certainly is a matter that demands more than an Order.  It demands tar barrels around the country.  If the Minister can give any indication that there is in the country work that will occupy the people this year for 21 weeks as against 11 weeks last year he deserves a triumphant procession with tar barrels, banners and bands throughout the country. Deputy Norton says that this Order is purely an economy measure.  Of course this Employment Period Order is an economy measure.  The Minister in his heart is not relying on the unemployed getting work in this country.  He knows that there is a flight to England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no figures that I could quote at the moment but I know that from various areas in the country there have been many thousands going to England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>How many?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many thousands. Men, not ounces of gold or anything like that.  So much is this the case that they are attracting attention at the other side, and when attention is directed to them we get the answer that they are still British subjects and are entitled to get work there.  We do know that emigration to England, the building trades and the numbers that are rammed into Arbour Hill are three factors in the keeping down of the unemployment figures in Ireland.  I <Col N="1674" /> should have added the out-officers of the Civil Service, the semi-detached branches that are now so numerous. Outside these three classes can the Minister point to any concrete definite case where employment is now offering where it was not before?  Is Deputy Norton right in saying that instructions are issued to people in the Minister's Department to decide cases under the Unemployment Assistance Act?  I do not remember that such instructions were given during my time.  But if Deputy Norton thinks it is done or if the Minister will agree that it is permissible to have it done I can imagine his saying in a period like this that there ought to be more rigorous inquiry as to whether people are looking for work.  It might be that in that way a few thousands would be removed from the register and put to work that was available for them.  In 1935 at the expense of 600 permanent employed workers on the land there was a net gain for a quarter of the year of 1800.  There could be little said against a more rigorous examination, but the Minister must realise that it is a different thing saying that from the 3rd of June employment is to be found until the 27th of October for these people on the land.  Then after the 27th October the bleak prospect happens again and there is no employment for these people.  I think there must be great sympathy with Deputy Norton at the moment when he says that it is no longer a question of attempting to get work.  It is simply a case of saying on the part of the Minister: &ldquo;I am making a declaration that work is to be got.  I have nothing to do with getting it.  You are to secure work and for 21 weeks you are to be treated as if you are actually at work.  We assume that there is work there for you.&rdquo;  That is certainly one way of dealing with unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister alluded to the £2,500,000 scheme.  That matter was mentioned on the occasion of the Budget and the Minister tells us now that the problem of securing employment is concerned with 40,000 people.  The Minister in the same week tells us that the turf business will give employment to 50,000 people.  Now, according to the Minister <Col N="1675" /> there are 40,000 needing employment and there is a prospect of 50,000 getting employment when the Turf Bill comes into operation.  Notwithstanding the glorious situation revealed by the co-relation of these two sets of figures, the Minister for Finance decides that he will rob the county councils and pilfer other portions of the Exchequer to get his £2,500,000, and that is going to be spent on the roads.  The Minister talks as if that scheme were actually in operation.  Why, it is only being turned over in the Minister's mind, and I am safe in assuming there will be no attempt to launch that scheme until such time as the Government make up their minds about an election.  I presume that means there will be no election until after 27th October.  It is the only thing one can take out of this Order.  It is a scandalous attempt to make good for the Exchequer at the expense of the people for whom the Minister's heart used at one time to bleed so much.  Nobody shouted, wept and tiraded so much as the Minister for Industry and Commerce, except the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>At this moment, when the Minister for Education decided that he would rub the salt into the wound exposed last year by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, we get this proposal.  Last year, the Parliamentary Secretary said the workers would pay through taxation of the necessities of life.  The Minister for Education rolled over that phrase and said of course they would pay and the reason necessities were taxed this year was to bring home taxation to them. The Minister's statistics show that nominal wages are down, as far as the farmers are concerned, by £750,000. Real wages in town and country are down.  References have been made to a variety of schemes.  What are the schemes doing?  They are spreading unemployment.  This is an attempt to get the spread of unemployment over a bigger number of people.  The one thing in which there is any salvation is the building industry.  We hear of all the houses that are being built by Seán T. with my money and other people's money.  If it was not for the <Col N="1676" /> housing programme there would be an extra 25,000 unemployed on the Minister's hands.  His tariff proposals have been worth nothing.  He has a big set-off confronting him by the people who are being thrown out of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into these matters at this stage.  If Deputies wish they may intervene and <Col N="1678" /> then these particular facts can be recorded for their benefit if they want them.  I have indicated that there are 25,000 in insurable occupations and the building industry is responsible for 20,000.  My assumption is&mdash;and I grant the Minister that there is not just the same solid foundation beneath my feet here&mdash;that the Minister, when he called the Press into conference in October, 1934, told the truth, because there he laid all his calculations on so many people directly employed proportionate to a certain number of houses built or in course of completion.  If I take the number in 1934 and 1935 and the early part of this year, there are at least 20,000 who have found employment through the building industry.  The Minister told us that at least 3,000 got extra employment through relief works. We hear then the calculation made by the President, whose mathematics are not as subject to suspicion as his facts sometimes are, that there are at least another 1,000 engaged in the beet industry.  Then there are 1,000 whom you can scatter amongst all the tarriffed industries.  I believe more have gone into the tariffed industries than 1,000 and, therefore, some people must have been put out of insurable occupations.</P>

      <P>I will refer the Minister to insurable occupations where people used to have employment and where they are now no longer employed to the same extent. The Minister gets 20,000 extra in building and 3,000 in relief works. Then he has 1,000 at a cost of nearly £1,000,000 in the beet sugar factories and he has 1,000 to throw around over all the other factories.  At an expenditure, borne by the taxpayers, of £3,000,000 he has 9,000 in agricultural employment.  He has lost 600 permanent labourers and gained 2,400 temporary workers for a quarter of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of all that, the Minister tells us that there is occupation available for 21 weeks where last year it was available only for 11.  Now that is so amazing that it ought to be capable of answer in this way: the Minister should simply read out a list of places, and I am sure Deputy Norton would be gratified to hear of, say, a dozen places in the country in which two men are employed now where <Col N="1680" /> only one was employed before June dawned.  The whole Order is the greatest nonsense.  It is not founded on reality, and it is an attempt simply to side-track the whole problem.  I confess that as every one of these movements occurs&mdash;extra impositions loaded on to the working classes of the country with the utterances that come from the benches opposite with regard to people being too lazy to work or finding the walk to work too far&mdash;that more and more do I get sympathy with the representatives of the Labour people in the House although I think they have brought part of this on themselves.  It is no great help to have to say that now. It is certainly nothing that should be visited on the people outside.  As I said before, it is not merely cruel but cynical to attempt to pass over at this moment an Order of this kind when there is so much unemployment in the country.  I suggest to the House that the Order should be rejected at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We know now where Deputy McGilligan stands in the matter, even if we are surprised a bit by the knowledge.  A motion has been moved by Deputy Norton that an Employment Period Order made under the Unemployment Assistance Act should be annulled, and the reason we are told why the Order should be annulled is because people living in rural areas affected by that Order should be entitled to continue to draw unemployment assistance during the period covered by the Order.  I am rather surprised that the Party opposite put up Deputy McGilligan to make their case on this.  Some show of consistency might have been maintained if Deputy Morrissey had made the case.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was passed in 1934, and before 1934 there was no provision, other than the poor law, for those in rural areas who were unable to get employment or who, for any reason, were unable to maintain themselves&mdash;no provision of any kind. Deputy McGilligan is now indignant because the unemployment assistance provisions which commenced to operate in 1934 are being temporarily suspended <Col N="1681" /> in respect of certain classes for a certain part of the year.  When the Unemployment Assistance Act was being considered by the Government, we deliberated for a long time as to whether or not it should be made applicable to rural areas at all, because of the obvious difficulties of operating a scheme of that kind in rural areas amongst people, most of whom live long distances from any employment exchange or branch office, who could not be kept under supervision as regards their personal circumstances to the same extent as persons living in towns.  It was decided, nevertheless, to extend the provision of the Act to rural areas and to include within its scope certain classes of landholders residing in those areas, and there is no other country in Europe which has made such wide provision for dealing with distress resulting from temporary unemployment.</P>
      <P>When we had made that decision there followed a consequential decision. It was decided then, in order to get over the particular difficulty of operating the unemployment assistance scheme in rural areas, to provide for a cessation of its operation during certain periods of the year. The difficulty in rural areas is this: that during periods of the year there is considerable difficulty in determining whether a particular individual can be regarded as employed or not. We have got upon the list of persons receiving unemployment assistance a large number of landholders&mdash;persons who are the registered owners of land. These persons are not in a position to get from that land an adequate livelihood.  They do not get a return for their work on that land sufficient to keep them going all the year round, and so at certain periods of the year they are available for work and seek work&mdash;work of other kinds such as work on the roads or work of a similar nature, whenever it is available to them.  These persons are, no doubt, willing to take that work at any time that it offers, even at certain periods of the year during which they should be employed on their own land either in putting in the crops or in harvesting the crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> The same applies in respect to a large number of single men.  The great majority of this class who have registered are the sons of landholders, residing with their fathers and on their fathers' farms, and during certain periods of the year they are, or should be, employed working on their fathers' lands.  They certainly cannot be regarded as unemployed and available for employment elsewhere when there is work to be done on that land.  Therefore, we provide in the Act for this arrangement under which Employment Period Orders can be made in respect of certain classes of people at certain times of the year. When such Orders are made these people at these periods are not entitled to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>That provision in the Unemployment Assistance Act was adopted by the Dáil, and no strong opposition was advanced from any quarter of the House to its enactment.  Now, we made such an Order last year.  I have stated already that we contemplated, when framing that Act, excluding rural areas from the scope of its operation for certain periods of the year, and excluding them entirely.  We have not done so.  We have made Orders affecting all the classes in rural areas which might reasonably be expected to be employed at these periods of the year. We have excluded only two classes&mdash; one, for a fairly long period, and that is the actual owners of land the poor law valuation of which exceeds £4, and, secondly, the class affected by this Order, single men without dependents during the period for which the Order has been made.  All other classes in rural areas, if qualified under the Act, are still entitled to draw unemployment assistance.  Now, we made a similar Order last year.  It was an Order for a shorter period, and I think Deputies will admit that it is fair to consider the justification for this Order in the light of our experience of last year. Was there any evidence that the making of the Employment Period Order of last year caused hardship?  Was there any evidence that, in fact, people who were excluded from unemployment assistance could not get work?</P>

These 41,000 people who, we had been told, were left destitute as a result of the Order, did not bother to register for employment at the exchanges.  There was a decrease in the number of able-bodied persons who got outdoor relief from the boards of assistance, and we know from direct evidence that these people were either employed on the farms upon which they live, or got employment during that period, and, on the basis of those figures, I think we are justified in renewing the Order this year, and renewing it for a longer period.

      <P>There is this sum of £2,500,000.  All these people know this: that every penny of that money is to be spent upon wages; that every penny of it is going to some person who is registered at the employment exchanges.  Persons to be employed under the various funds voted by this House will be found recorded in the labour exchanges, and those who registered at the various exchanges will get employment.  Yet we are told these people do not register.  I do not believe it.  I believe they do register and are maintaining their registration. It costs them nothing.  There is no trouble involved in registering.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked: is there any evidence that the employment situation has improved. There is plenty of evidence of it.  On the 24th February, 1936, the total number on the register was 141,886.  On the last date for which figures are available, namely, the 18th May last, that figure had fallen to 110,817, showing a reduction of 31,000 odd for that period. Why do not Deputies tell me that reduction is due to the first Employment Period Order?  They will not do that because they know how it has worked.</P>

      <P>We have had various statements made in another House, which until recently was associated with the government of this country, and we have had statements made at various meetings throughout the country on the Unemployment Assistance Act.  The operative portions of the Unemployment Assistance Act have <Col N="1691" /> been subjected to criticism, in so far as workers were alleged to be unwilling to accept employment when it offered from farmers in particular districts, and that there was difficulty in securing workers, and that persons who did get work nevertheless succeeded in continuing to draw unemployment assistance.  I have had very searching investigations carried out by officers of my Department, specially instructed in the work, and no evidence of widespread abuse of the kind mentioned has been brought to light.  Nevertheless, in dealing with agricultural workers the officers of my Department are not so favourably placed as they would be in relation to urban and city workers, because the greater number of these rural workers live long distances from the employment exchanges, and the great majority of them are never even seen by the local officers of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the Guards?  Do they not see them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the fact that the relationship between farmers and labourers in rural areas is of a much more intimate nature than the relationship that exists between employers and workers in the towns and cities.  Farmers do not apply to the local exchanges, when there are vacancies to be filled, to the same extent that other employers do.  They do not notify the Department that someone has refused employment, or in many other ways act in a manner which facilitates the Department in deciding the eligibility of persons receiving employment assistance to the same extent as employers do in urban areas. On that account it is considered desirable that the powers conferred by the Unemployment Act should be operated to the extent we propose in these Orders.  We might have gone a lot further; we might have been quite justified if we proceeded to suspend the operations of the Act in rural areas in the spring and harvesting period.  It is only a very limited class that has been made the subject of the Orders at all.  And in respect of the <Col N="1692" /> two classes concerned, no hardship is going to be caused.  No hardship was caused last year and none will be caused this year.</P>
      <P>I do not want to follow Deputy McGilligan into the peculiar calculations he made in regard to the total number of persons in employment.  The Deputy's figures were so inaccurate that no conclusion drawn from them could possibly be correct.  I do not know how the Deputy made his calculations of the number of persons employed weekly in relation to the total contribution to the unemployment fund last year, as compared with 1931. The Deputy will find if he makes another investigation that the total number of insured contributors employed each week was 36,000 greater in 1935 than in 1931.  That is not the number of persons put into employment, but it is the average increase in the weekly number employed.  The average number of persons put into new employment in that period must necessarily have been larger, but taking the average for each week we get 36,000.  That figure can be divided into its constituent parts.  A very considerable part of that is due to increased employment in industry. Some part of it is due to the increased employment in house building, but the bulk of it must be attributed to increased employment in industry.  Side by side with that there is an increase of 13,000 in occupations not insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Act.  The number of persons employed weekly in these other industries increased by 13,000, showing that the increase in the average number of people employed each week in 1935 as compared with 1931 is 45,000.  But in giving that figure I am deducting 3,000 odd, which may be attributable to increased employment in demestic service, which cannot be due to any measures adopted in relation to industry or agriculture and designed to promote employment in those occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been often told by Deputies that we are putting as many people out of employment as we are putting into employment.  I have been trying to track down the justification for that <Col N="1693" /> assertion by having most elaborate statistical inquiries made by the officers of my Department.  I have got for each quarter the returns of the numbers of persons employed in every possible occupation to try to find out where these people could have been employed that we were told had lost their employment.  I have not found it yet. I invited Deputy McGilligan by way of interjection during his speech to tell me the class of work that these people lost, and he did not do so.  I invite Deputy Morrissey, if he speaks on this debate, to tell us the class of work that they lost.  I do not know what it is. Here and there a business may have gone bankrupt; here and there a factory may have closed down; here and there a factory may have decreased production; but in each occupation the total employment has not diminished, except through seasonal or temporary causes, and the total employment has increased by a weekly average figure of 46,000.  That is not bad, having regard to the circumstances which operated in this country during that period and the efforts of the Party opposite to obstruct the various plans to provide employment.</P>

      <P>Lest there may be any misapprehension about or misunderstanding of my observations, I have written down what I intend to say.  On last Thursday there appeared over my name a question relative to an alleged Budget leakage.  This query did not correspond with the original question, which was revised and re-revised and emasculated to the form in which it was passed eventually.</P>

      <P>On a point of order; the Deputy has said that the question on the Order Paper was not in the form in which it was originally submitted.  Does the Deputy allege that I, as Minister for Finance, had any responsibility in that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>None; I will say that at once.  The answer to my question, as I expected, was in the negative.  I asked then a supplementary question, which the Dr. Syntax who is in charge of the Ministry of Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He is a language purist and an expert on literary matters; he caretakes the well of English undefiled, and he is also a Colossus that doth bestride this narrow State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Official Report of the question; to my untutored and bucolic mind it is flawless. I challenge the Minister here and now to point to any mistake in the verbiage of it.  However, it may have been calculated to make the Minister &ldquo;stare and gasp.&rdquo;  I put the question in no hostile or partisan spirit, but to allay suspicious and remove doubts which had been raised in the public mind by certain statements in the Press, which I intend, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to read to the House in a few moments.</P>

      <P>It might not be amiss to make that matter clear now.  Deputies must take responsibility for the statements and allegations they make in the House.  The House cannot be asked to pronounce on the opinions of newspapers or of people outside the House.  The Deputy may not read comments made by any newspaper on the case which he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I will take the journalist's case as my own.  I take full responsibility for it.  He wrote: &ldquo;Mr. Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking in the Dáil on Tuesday, stated in reference to a report...&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy put a certain question to the Minister in Thursday last.  The purpose of raising the matter on the adjournment is to further elucidate the case.  If the Deputy has any further argument to advance on the question of the possibility of the leakage of information prior to the Budget he must make his own case and not merely quote what some outsider has said.  The Minister cannot be held responsible for opinions expressed in articles in the Press.  Deputies are entitled to quote from speeches made by Ministers, inside or outside the House or from official documents or reports of commissions, but the House cannot be asked to debate what newspapers say or allege.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if a Deputy raises a matter in this House, and in support of that matter desires to quote from a newspaper, is he not entitled to do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has stated that he purposes to read a whole article from a newspaper.  He is not entitled to make his case thus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit, with all respect to your ruling, that there are precedents for it?  Matters have been raised in this House and Deputies have quoted from newspapers in support of the matters which they raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I presume, wants to substanitate his case, and he cannot substantiate it on the opinion and comment of a journalist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May he not bring certain quotations before this House in support of the case he himself is making?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so.  The Deputy, however, has stated that he <Col N="1701" /> intends to read in full a newspaper article; that is more than quoting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With all respect, it is quite a common occurrence in this House for members of the House to quote the opinions of other parties in support of the particular statements which they themselves are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite a different matter.  The Deputy has raised a question as to whether there was a leakage or not, and, instead of making a case, wants to give an outside opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If a Deputy who&mdash;in pursuance of information which he has received&mdash;raises a question in this House is not satisfied with the answer given by the Minister responsible, and decides to have it further elucidated on the adjournment, is he not entitled to quote in support of that matter the information upon which his question was based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is putting a completely different question. A Deputy is entitled to quote to support his argument but not to read as his case an article from a newspaper. He may of course refer to relevant points, but may not quote the whole article as his own case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am submitting, Sir, that the Deputy is simply making quotations from an article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself has stated the contrary, and he should be the best authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to convey, A Chinn Comhairle, is that a responsible gentleman, a well-known journalist&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not a member of this House, but, as Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, quotations from newspaper reports have been cited here hundreds of times not only by the Opposition but by Ministers, and why on this occasion I am shut down I cannot tell.  I am sure the Minister for Finance and the other members of <Col N="1702" /> the Executive Council would like to have this matter thoroughly investigated, and by shutting down discussion of it they simply raise further suspicion in the public mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that the Deputy has not so far demanded an investigation?  He has put down a question which has been answered fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not demanding an inquiry because I expect that the Minister will clarify the matter so fully that there will be no need for an inquiry or investigation.  It is with that object I put down the question. If I am shut down now&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be able to select and put the relevant questions himself.  Without directly reading the newspaper he should surely be able to put the salient relevant points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant question is this: did the Empire Services Limited, London, a Press agency, convey to Irish newspapers the day before the Budget information that substantial tariffs were going to be put on certain component parts of refrigerators? Furthermore, was that communication marked &ldquo;confidential,&rdquo; and were the editors requested not to publish it until after the Budget proposals had been put into print?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to point out, Sir, that Deputy Burke did not put these questions on the Order Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same evening, did Mr. Oswald Jamison, who belongs to a firm here in Dublin, state in London, not only that a tariff or extra duty would be put on these component parts of refrigerators, but that it actually had been put on them?  Is there any truth in these statements? Is it all a fiction on behalf of Sir Basil Clarke, a well-known man in the old I.R.A. days, or is there any truth in the allegations that these tariffs were going to be put on and that these people knew of that fact beforehand? Is there any truth in Mr. Jamison's <Col N="1703" /> statement that the tariff had been put on, and, if so, how did this information get out?  It may have been a matter of intelligent anticipation, or it may have been that they were promised substantial protection if they erected a factory here in Dublin, but it is a curious thing that these facts should have been communicated to an English company and published in London in an interview with this Mr. Jamison the night before the Budget was introduced. I am only asking the Minister is there any truth in that statement? If he says there is not, of course, I shall accept his word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult, Sir, to appreciate what the Deputy, who has detained the House here to-night, is trying to get at.  He himself has indicated to-night that he does not think there is anything in the statements which have appeared in a certain newspaper, and certainly, in the question which he put down and which has given rise to this debate, he gave no person any reason to believe that he attached anything more than the most casual importance to these statements.  The question which Deputy J.M. Burke put down on the Order Paper was: &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance whether any information was conveyed, officially, by his Department to any firm, before the introduction of the Budget, regarding a possible increase of Customs duty on refrigerating apparatus.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I might intervene to point out to the Minister that, as Deputy Burke has stated, the question on the Order Paper was not the question originally drafted by him. The Chair has, on more than one occasion, cut out references to newspapers and named persons in questions in the Dáil, and the Chair so acted on this occasion.  Accordingly, the absence of such references is not Deputy Burke's fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And, Sir, I presume that it was not due to the Minister for Finance either?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1704" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, Sir, I only have to deal with the question on the Order Paper, and that question admitted only of a simple answer &mdash;either &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I told the Deputy that the answer was in the negative.  Moreover I have had made the most searching investigation possible, so far as my Department is concerned, into the matter, and I am satisfied that no information was conveyed to any unauthorised person&mdash; whether the person referred to in these newspaper articles or otherwise&mdash;that a tariff upon refrigerator components would certainly be imposed in the Budget.  Any person who takes the trouble to read the articles which have given rise to all this pother to-night, will see that the person who wrote the articles did not take them seriously himself.  Furthermore they will see that the communication which was received from this news service in London was in these terms:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will probably find that duties on certain components of refrigerators are substantially increased in the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir.  I do not want to go further into this matter, but I suggest, with all respect, that if the Minister is going to be allowed to read certain parts of these articles and letters, in view of what has gone before in regard to Deputy Burke, I do not see what is the use in going on with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The portion of the letter to which the Minister has referred was quoted in the House by Deputy Anthony and is on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And, Sir, in so far as Deputy Burke's speech here to-night is concerned, it is relevant, because what Deputy Burke has alleged is that the statement was that certain &ldquo;substantial tariffs were going to be put on component parts of refrigerators.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote down the words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The words in the letter were &ldquo;had been imposed,&rdquo; if the Minister insists on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I do not know whether I should be within the rules of the House if I repeat the statement which is here in quotation marks in the article in the newspaper on which the Deputy has relied.  The words there are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will probably find that duties on certain components of refrigerators are substantially increased in the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the facts so far as I can put them before the House. A certain person, interested in the assembling of refrigerators in this country, applies for a tariff.  He gets no information as to what the result of his application is going to be beyond this: that if a tariff is granted it will be imposed in the Budget.  That is what he is told.  What does this rather astute gentleman do?  He goes off to London; he gives an interview on the 11th&mdash;the day before the introduction of the Budget&mdash;to a certain editorial service there, because he is anxious to get support and publicity for the industry he has established. In the interview he refers to duties which he feels may be imposed on refrigerator components.  In order to give that interview it was not necessary for him to have any information.  He need only take a long shot.  If the long shot comes off and duties are imposed, <Col N="1706" /> he will get very valuable publicity on the very morning following the introduction of the Budget. For here is an interview with a person who is interested in this new industry.  It gets splash headings amongst the comments on the Budget, adverse and favourable. It appears in all the newspapers.  That is the whole explanation of this story: that an astute gentleman with a good publicity sense, who happened to be in London on the 11th May, gave the interview which was dated 12th May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Dated 11th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Sent out on the 11th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  It was sent out on the 11th May with a covering letter that it would probably be found, as it might be, that ponent parts of refrigerators would be substantially increased in the Budget. There is this about it, that if it was found, as it probably might be, that there was a duty imposed on refrigerator components, then this interview would be good news.  It would be hot stuff.  It could be published, as I said, with splash headings, and the gentleman who took the long shot would get free publicity.  That is the whole story and nothing more.  I have nothing to add to the answer that was given to Deputy Burke on the 20th May, that so far as my Department, or any other Department of the Government, is concerned, I am satisfied that no information was conveyed, either officially or unofficially, to any person that a duty on refrigerator components would be imposed in the Budget.</P>
