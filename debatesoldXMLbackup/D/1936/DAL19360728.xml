      <P>For the purposes of home assistance, the term &ldquo;person eligible for assistance&rdquo; means a poor person who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide for himself or his dependents the necessities of life.  It rests with the local authority concerned to determine in the case of each individual applicant whether he comes within this definition. No special instructions have been issued to the local authorities in the matter, as they are already well aware of their duties.  The only communication addressed to local authorities in regard to the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, was the circular <Col N="2007" /> letter of the 17th January, 1936, drawing attention to the provisions of Section 54 of the Act.</P>

      <P>Ex-Corporal Thomas Doyle made application for a disability pension on the 17th June, 1934, under the terms of the Army Pensions Acts.  He attributed his disability, pulmonary tuberculosis, to service in the forces in the years 1931 and 1933.  No action could, however, be taken on the claim.  There is no provision in the Army Pensions Acts under which a claim for disablement attributable to disease contracted subsequent to the 30th September, 1924, could be considered, and in the circumstances I regret it is not possible to take any action on the claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to further correlate the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in relation to milk with recent milk legislation and to amend and clarify certain provisions of these Acts.  Thus, Section 2 confers the powers of a sampling officer under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts on a sampling officer of a sanitary authority for the purposes of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935. Inasmuch as the sanitary authorities are charged with the duty of securing the purity and wholesomeness of the milk supply, it is desirable that the powers possessed by sampling officers under the Milk and Dairies Act, to take and submit samples of milk for bacteriological examination, should be extended to include the taking of samples for analysis as to chemical content under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Section 3 enables the Minister to prescribe the manner of sampling and the amount of the sample.  The purpose of this section is to ensure uniformity in the operations of sampling officers which has already been achieved in connection with samples taken under the Milk and Dairies Act.  It will be appreciated <Col N="2013" /> that the result of an analysis of milk depends to a considerable extent on the method of sampling, and it has been brought to the notice of my Department that serious discrepancies have been found in the results obtained by public analysts and the State chemist, due largely, it is felt, to a lack of uniformity in sampling.  It is essential, therefore, to ensure proper administration that uniformity of procedure in the collection of samples should be achieved.  The effect of Section 4 is to rectify an error in Section 2 of the Act of 1935. The remaining sections are purely technical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary when regulations under the Milk and Dairies Act passed last year will be circulated to local sanitary authorities?  There is a Milk Bill, as he is aware, before the House which interlocks with the Milk and Dairies Act of last year, and that Act should obviously be in operation before the present Milk Bill becomes an Act.  The Milk and Dairies Act was rushed through last year as a matter of very urgent importance.  It is a year old now and the regulations prescribed under it have not yet been circulated to the sanitary authorities. Could he tell the House when these regulations will be ready?  They are only in draft at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much whether any uneasiness that the policy of the Government as regards <Col N="2015" /> land, and the various statements which have been made by Ministers again and again, and especially by the present Minister, on the question of the tenure of land, will be in any way allayed by the statement made here last week by the Minister.  I occasionally see a complaint made that we on this side are trying to raise a scare in the breasts of the farmers of the country as to their tenure of their property.  Surely it is clear that, if there is any such scare, the causes that are altogether responsible for it are the policy of the Government and the statements of Ministers.  Could anything be better calculated to cause uneasiness than the general policy of the Government with regard to land and the statements of Ministers which must be borne in mind when considering that policy?  How can any farmer in the country feel any security about his property when he reads the statements of the various Ministers, and particularly those of the present Minister for Lands?  And when we see additional powers given to the Land Commission under this Bill, we really must interpret those powers in the light of the very alarming statements which time and again have been made by the Minister. Unless a very great social evil is proved, unless something threatening the whole welfare of the nation is shown to exist, there ought to be some security for the ordinary farmers as regards the holding of their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it will be acknowledged on every side of the House that that particular class has been sufficiently hard hit in recent years, and especially in the last couple of years, and that they should not be made more uneasy by the new powers that are taken by a Government Department under this Bill.  Was there anything in the speech of the Minister last week to allay these fears?  Again we had repeated a hint that was given more than once by Ministers, that unless farmers worked their land &ldquo;properly,&rdquo; in other words, unless they happened to be quick enough to fall in with the policy of the Government of the day in agricultural matters, then they are going to be given no guarantee, so far as the <Col N="2016" /> holding of their land is concerned. Boiled down, that is the policy of the Government, and of the Minister, on this question for the last couple of years.  Is it to be contended that that means security of tenure in any sense? Unless farmers can change their whole agricultural economy with every general election, they are not to be guaranteed possession of their land.  What the present Minister may consider to be the proper use of land, a future Minister may consider to be very improper or very uneconomic.  Is the ordinary farmer, no matter what size holding he has, to be the plaything of Party politics in this way?  Is it not obvious that his whole security is gone when powers of this kind are taken?  Powers of this kind claimed in this section, no matter how limited, and no matter what respect we may have for the Land Commission, must be related to the general policy of the Minister.</P>
    <P>When this policy was first started, the country was given to understand that it was &ldquo;ranchers&rdquo; that were going to be dealt with.  The cry of &ldquo;Split up the ranches&rdquo; was supposed to justify that policy.  But, as in other countries, so here also, that was only the beginning.  In other countries it was found advisable to start with the large-size farms, but ultimately the property of all farmers was put in jeopardy and destroyed.  Faced with such developments elsewhere, surely it ought to be the aim of our Government here not to weaken the sense of security but to strengthen it.  However, we seem to be doing the very opposite, and with very little justification.</P>
    <P>I can imagine in a time of great crisis political and social developments of such a character as might justify serious interference with property, and even property of this kind, but it cannot be alleged that such a crisis exists.  It is only with great hesitation that a step of this kind should be contemplated. But the Government Benches willingly&mdash;I was going to say blindly&mdash; plunge into an abyss.  Do Ministers imagine that the headline they are setting up will not be copied?  Does anybody imagine that the demand for land in some localities will not be so great that pressure will not be <Col N="2017" /> brought to bear on successive Ministers to interfere with the ordinary rights of farmers?  After all, when buying out his land the farmer believed&mdash;and it was the fact&mdash;that he was purchasing a right to the land.  The land does not belong to the State.</P>
    <P>I have seen various statements of different Ministers from the time they took office up to the present, and in these I notice underlying and inspiring a great deal of their policy the belief that the land belongs to the State.  It does not.  It is the property of private individuals, with the State having certain rights over that property, as it has rights over various other classes of property, but it has no more right to deprive a man of his land than to deprive him of any other property.  When farmers purchased the rights of the landlords the land was to belong to them, but now we see one invasion of their rights after another.  If there have been invasions of these rights before, that is all the more reason why we should hesitate further to pursue that line of policy. Everything should be done in the present state of agriculture to add to the sense of security; not to take away from that sense in any way. And yet this is what is happening, because it is obvious that the farmer will regard this as a further step, which may be followed to a further conclusion afterwards, towards depriving him of his right to his farm.  No one can suggest that the right of the farmer in his land depends on his ability to accept the changed policies of successive Ministers.  No one can suggest that any such claim makes for security of tenure.  The evils that spring from insecurity should be avoided.  Apart altogether from the question of the right and injustice involved, even if there are individual cases in which we may register a gain by the exercise of powers, of which we have an example in this section, that is more than offset by the general unsoundness of this policy and the sense of insecurity that is raised amongst the farming community.</P>

      <P>When speaking last week, the Minister said that land when properly worked would not be interfered with.  The last speaker has dealt with the question whether the proper use of land would be in conformity or out of conformity with the wishes of the Minister for the time being.  I wonder if the Minister would consider land properly worked which was broken lea four years ago, and has produced a wheat crop ever since.  Is that proper husbandry?  I think some of that land has been so worked by prominent supporters of the Minister's Party, that having &ldquo;run it out,&rdquo; I understand it is now up for sale for division amongst landless men.  I presume such a farm would be properly worked in the opinion of the Minister.</P>

      <P>It will grow weeds next year.  It is not fit to grow decent weeds, but it is good enough to give a fair price for, and to divide up amongst people who are subsidised; people brought from other places who will get 30/- a week for a year, and will further waste the land.  The Minister should consider whether it is not time there was a beginning in a common-sense way.  If a man has not security in land, he is not going to care for it.  The greatest loss this country suffered in the last three or four years was caused by people who are dragging all the fertility out of the soil.  There has been a greater loss in that way than there was for 30 years before, because the fertility of the soil had increased enormously owing to the judicious use of artificial manures, synchronising with security of tenure and with land purchase, as a result of which there was a feeling amongst farmers that whatever they invested in their land was a reserve for themselves and for their descendants.  What incentive will this policy of seven years' tenant-at-will offer to farmers to increase the fertility of their land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man cannot buy a farm and set about farming it as a farm should be worked according to his ideas and temperament.  He will not go into it with any intention of improving it because he knows that if he goes in <Col N="2019" /> and makes a success of his farming business, the land can be taken from him.  The nursing that he would do of the soil to increase its fertility gives him no security on the farm. The super-landlord, the Land Commission, can claim it just as the old landlords could claim a farm 60 or 70 years ago.  If this matter is not dealt with in a proper way, it may result in destroying the whole fertility of the country.  It will destroy good farming. If the Minister has studied the history of farming in other countries I am sure he will know that you can never raise agriculture to the highest level by creating uniformity in the size of farms for the simple reason that individuals are not uniform in themselves.  They have not been created in a uniform mould.  You will get a good farmer who cannot be successful on any farm of less than 300 acres and who would die of starvation if you put him into a smaller farm. On the other hand, you will get a man who may be a success on a ten or 20 acre farm but if you put him on 100 acres he will soon be in the Bankruptcy Court.  It all depends on the industry, the outlook and the ability of the individual concerned.  If a man is of a particularly industrious turn of mind, you might as well put him into prison or shoot him as to put him on a small holding.  Give him a decent-sized farm to allow him sufficient scope for his abilities.  He will require that, just as a man going into business wants sufficient scope for his ability in that business.</P>
    <P>It is time that these arm-chair farmers who call themselves statesmen on the Government Benches should recognise that farming is a business and that if a man has not scope to develop his farm, if he is not using his land properly, the fault probably lies with the Minister for Agriculture who is not competent enough to devise a policy to enable that man to work his land properly and profitably.  Do not think that a man is wasting his land merely for the pleasure of wasting it.  That land represents capital and no one outside a lunatic asylum wants to waste capital.  The few <Col N="2020" /> farmers here and there, who deliberately allow their land to go to waste are not worth the consideration of this House.  If we are going to have agriculture properly developed all over the country there must be security of tenure.  I admit that even the Land Act of 1923 broke down that principle to some extent, but that is no reason why the gap should be widened every time a Land Bill goes through the House.  It is time that that gap was repaired and that our people should be given a chance of developing in agriculture, instead of nursing wastrels and subsidising incompetence as we are doing at the present time.</P>
    <P>Where you have competent farmers, they are an asset and a treasure to the country and you should give them that security that will encourage them to use their land to the best advantage.  Do not make conacre men of farmers.  Do not compel them to work their land in such a way that they will extract all the fertility they can from it in one year or two years.  Encourage them to work it in such a way that the land will preserve its fertility and that they can hand it over to their children in a better condition, if possible, than they found it.  Good farming produces more than a crop; it enhances the fertility of the soil. That is an asset to the country and nobody is more entitled to such assets than those who have created them.  I submit it is the farmers of this country who have created these assets in land.  The landlords did not create them.  They gave a farmer an old waste piece of land and it was the farmer who by his industry created fertility in the soil. The people who are in possession of these lands at present are the descendants of those to whom that land was given in the first instance or else they have paid the full value of the land to those who created that fertility in the first instance. They have therefore a right to be left in undisturbed possession.  I hope there will be a division on this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>On every occasion on which the opportunity arises, I <Col N="2021" /> shall be in opposition to anything which aims at limiting the security of the farmer in his land.  In recent years we have had evidence enough of the effect of legislation on the value of land.  We had a case quoted here on the last day by Deputy Holohan in which a farm purchased in 1935 for £1,900 was sought to be acquired by the Land Commission at £600.  That is evidence enough of what will happen under this Bill, this further amendment of the 1933 Act. I am one of the few Deputies in this House who have a familiar recollection of the land war, of the sacrifices, the sufferings, the hopes, the failures and the ultimate victory of the people who fought that war.  I for one believed when that war ended that for a very definite period at least the security of the farmers would be unchallenged, and certainly that a native Parliament, which the people in those days only dreamt of as something good to come, would not interfere with that security.  One would have expected that, if there was any change made in the security of the tenant-farmer under a native Parliament, it would be for the better and that if possible an effort would be made to make him more secure than he was before, to help him to be a real honest-to-God farmer, a man who, as Deputy Belton said, worked his land every day, that he would be fostered rather than retarded in his operations by whatever section of the community happened to be in control of the Ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would like to ask why the farmer is singled out for this victimisation. Why not apply a clause of this kind to other sections of the community?  If there was any evidence that farmers had organised to exploit the rest of the community, there might be some semblance of an excuse for the persecution to which they have been subjected. There is no such evidence; the farmers have never exploited the community. If the farmer was able to make a bare subsistence in years past, he was lucky. Farmers never became millionaires, and I do not think any Minister on the Front Bench can point the finger of <Col N="2022" /> scorn at farmers and say that they have profiteered to the extent of becoming millionaires.  Other sections of the community, who have had very small beginnings, have expanded their businesses until they eventually became millionaires.  The farmer alone amongst the people has always had to be the hewer of wood and the drawer of water for the rest of the community. Not alone is he not to be allowed to expand his business, but he is going to be retarded in the enjoyment of his possession and in his occupation. Deputy Dillon, when speaking here on the last day, threw out an olive branch to the Minister.  He suggested that at least some semblance of security might be guaranteed to the farmer, and that we might possibly arrange between us &mdash;I think he used the word &ldquo;us,&rdquo; but I would not be a party to such an agreement&mdash;that some limited form of security should be offered to the farmer by providing that there should be some definite amount of land that would be left untouched or without any threat of touching.</P>
    <P>When the Land Bill of 1933 was going through the House, and when everything else failed, I brought forward an amendment to the effect that a man should be left in security with a certain quantity of land&mdash;say from 100 acres to 250 statute acres.  The Minister refused to consider that amendment. I do not know that it was a very good amendment, but it was, at least, an attempt to make wretched conditions a little better.  I do not see why there should be any discrimination between large and small tenants.  If the man who purchased his land has paid his annuities and other commitments, and has not exploited anybody, why should he be disturbed any more than a citizen engaged in any other occupation?  The object of the previous Land Acts was to settle people on the land.  The land war was fought with that object, and for years, even though some of us who are farmers did not put by any great amount of money or become millionaires, nevertheless, we existed in a hand-to-mouth sort of way, and were comparatively happy in that our occupation took up most of our time, and we had little opportunity to indulge in <Col N="2023" /> any of the luxuries available to other members of the community.  We were, as I said, moderately happy and content. One wave of the Minister's hand has disturbed all that.  Hither and thither, there is a feeling of insecurity on the part of the farmer, as great as when the land war was first launched.</P>
    <P>I do not see any possibility of amending this Bill so as to make it acceptable to the bulk of the farmers. I do not think that there is a Farmer-Deputy on the Government Benches who would deny that there is, as a result of the introduction of this measure and the 1933 Act, a tremendous feeling of insecurity amongst farmers, both big and small.  One thing you have definitely succeeded in doing&mdash;you have smashed the value of land.  I proposed an amendment to this section which I suppose the Government would not have accepted even if the House had accepted it.  They would find a way out.  My proposal was that, if the Land Commission were forced to resume land, they would give a certain value for it.  The Minister argued that they were paying a just price. Deputy Holohan gave an example of this &ldquo;just price&rdquo; when he instanced a farm which was bought for £1,900 a very short time before and for which the Land Commission offered £600. That constitutes a refutation of the Minister's contention that the Land Commission is paying a fair price for resumed land.  You cannot ensure a fair price for resumed land unless there is some approach to public values.  I proposed a few days ago that the Government should purchase in the open market.  The Minister objects to that policy.  He did not state what his objection in principle was, but he suggested that it would be dangerous for a Government to enter into bargains in that way.  The Minister's objection appeared to be based on the fear of &ldquo;puffers.&rdquo;  He seemed to think that it would be impossible to buy land at a fair price because of the presence at the auctions of &ldquo;puffers.&rdquo;  I replied that every section of the community had to protect themselves against &ldquo;puffers&rdquo; and that the Land Commission could do <Col N="2024" /> the same.  If the Land Commission bid a fair amount for the land and did not purchase it, it would have the same effect.  I do not see any reason why the value of land should be inflated because of the Land Commission competing for it.  No farmer is going to give more than the value of land just because the Land Commission is bidding for it.  If there were any attempt to &ldquo;puff,&rdquo; the land could be left to the &ldquo;puffer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I pointed out, too, that instead of taking land from people who did not want to part with it, the Land Commission could, in this way, obtain land which was being offered for sale. I see no reason why, if land is being offered voluntarily, the Land Commission should step in and take land compulsorily from some other person who is working it.  It will always be necessary, if the agitation for land division continues, to divide some lands, and I can see no means of obtaining the land, if we are not to have perpetual confiscation of purchased lands, other than the purchase of lands voluntarily offered.  If we do not adopt some such system, we are going to have no fixity of tenure for any farmer, large or small.</P>
    <P>On the last day, some Deputy said that before he passed away from this particular section, he would like to say a few words.  I should like to say a few words before passing away in a different sense.  I am now getting into hoary, old age and, before passing away, I should like to see some settlement of this land question.  I should like to see a real settlement effected by an Irish Parliament which would give farmers real security and which would banish their fears, a settlement which would make the victory won in the first land war a reality and which would give farmers confidence in their own Ministers and their own Government. I regret to say that, in recent years, instead of having increased confidence in their own Ministry, they have less confidence in them than they had in the British Ministry in the past.  The British Ministry was, at least in that respect, fair.  Once a man purchased his land, there was <Col N="2025" /> no attempt to take the benefit of his purchase from him.</P>
    <P>We have debated this section and other sections in and out.  Perhaps there has been a good deal of repetition, but if this matter cropped up every year for the next 25 years or every month of every year for the next 25 years or every day of every month of every year for the next 25 years or every hour of every day of every month of every year for the next 25 years, and if I happened to be here, I would get up and make my protest on this section even if I had to repeat every word I said ten minutes before.  This section must be resisted by the farming community and it will be resisted by them.  If the powers taken in this Bill are put into effect, I challenge the Minister to deny that there will be a revival of the land war&mdash; perhaps a more dangerous was than the land war which was fought here 45 or 50 years ago.  Some Deputies do not remember that war but many of the older Deputies, like myself, have a vivid recollection of it.</P>

In column 1992 at the opening of the first paragraph in that column I am reported as saying: &ldquo;I heartily agree with the suggestion of Deputy Dillon,&rdquo; and so on.  What I did say was: &ldquo;I hardly agree with the suggestion of Deputy Dillon to fix a limit to the size of a farm, and let that limit remain.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add one word in support of what Deputy Davin said on the last occasion on this section. I was not lucky enough to be present during the debate, but I thought that the Minister treated Deputy Davin's observations rather too cavalierly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I opposed the 1933 Land Bill pretty vigorously on the Second Reading, but when we reached the Final Stage I expressed the opinion that the concessions which the Minister had made to us in the course of the Committee Stage were so important and <Col N="2026" /> on the whole so satisfactory that I could hardly bring myself to oppose the Bill at all on its Final Stage, except for the kind of speeches that we had heard from Deputy Corry and other Deputies in this House, and from many people down the country, as to the spirit in which, in fact, the Land Bill was going to be worked.  I think, on the whole, the apprehensions aroused by speeches of that sort have been falsified, and that the Act has not been so administered as to create justifiable doubts in the minds of the farmers of this country about fixity of tenure. But, in so far as alarm has been created about fixity of tenure, I think it has been due to the activities of the Fianna Fáil clubs.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he has no legal authority to stop the Fianna Fáil clubs from indulging in that sort of activity, and he equates them with individuals like Deputy Davin and Deputy Dillon, and says that every man has the right to express a view as to what lands are to be divided and how they are to be divided.  I think it is very misleading to compare a great political organisation such as the Fianna Fáil organisation with individuals. The Minister may have no power by law to restrain the organisation from its activities, but he and others of his colleagues who are in fact at the head of that organisation certainly can make a change within the organisation if they choose to do so. Everybody knows that in all parts of the country the Fianna Fáil clubs do make a speciality of this acquisition and division of land.  They have bombarded the Land Commission unceasingly with the most unnecessary and voluminous correspondence, and these clubs do hold out to all and sundry in the countryside that the way for them to get possession of land that is likely to be going is to take an active part in the doings of the Fianna Fáil clubs.  I suggest, in all seriousness and in no controversial spirit, that that is frightfully undesirable and that it does tend to make the people throughout the country think of the land question as a Party question, and to think of it as being operated in the spirit of the spoils system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> I do not believe for a moment that the Land Commission are operating it in any such spirit but in so far as people down the country have a <i>prima facie</i> reason for thinking that that is the case that <i>prima facie</i> reason is due to the activities of the Fianna Fáil clubs, and I would urge upon the Minister that he and his colleagues should discourage these clubs from preparing, as they do, those elaborate schemes of land division and working out in advance what they want each of their members should get and creating the impression all around the countryside that they have the whip hand of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The only other word I have to say is that in my opinion Deputy Dillon and some of those on the opposite benches have gone too far in what they have said about security of tenure.  I wonder if they would extend the principle that they advocate to owners of town property and whether they would advocate that anyone who owns property in a town, property below a certain figure, say of £2,000, should be given absolute security of tenure and allowed to do what he liked with it, no matter what sort of slum conditions were created thereby?</P>

      <P>I am only mentioning that by way of illustration, Sir. I suggest that the public interest should come first.  I suggest that there is no reason why even a very small holder should have complete liberty to waste and ruin his land.  I do not think it is a good thing that Government officials should constantly be poking in their noses and interfering. I take the individualistic view that in 99 cases out of 100 the man who is working his own farm is the best judge of how to work it.  But I do not think that we should lay it down as a principle of the Legislature for all time that no matter how badly the land is being misused we are debarred from interfering with the person who is so <Col N="2028" /> misusing it provided that that person has something below a certain fixed amount of land.  I do not myself see the sense of these limits.  I think that the important thing with regard to land is that it should be well used and, above all, that it should give the amount of employment that it should reasonably be expected to give.  If a man has got 10,000 or 20,000 acres or 50,000 acres I personally see nothing wrong and nothing undesirable in that, provided that the land so held is giving better employment than it could give in any other way, creating a larger amount of human wealth and human happiness than it would if held in a different way.  I think these are the kind of motives that should guide us rather than setting up some fixed limit and saying that the man who has got more than that amount should be chivied around as much as we could chivy him and that the man who has got less than that amount of land could use his land in any way he liked and yet be entitled to hold it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be grateful to Deputy MacDermot for the efforts he has made to shift the blame from the shoulders of the Land Commission to the Fianna Fáil clubs in the country.  In the course of the debates on the Land Commission Estimate here I drew attention to the fact that small farmers throughout the country have been served with notices that their land would be taken from them and that inspectors have been sent on their lands to report on their suitability or otherwise for resumption by the Land Commission.  I gave instances of cases where small farmers have been served with such notices.  I wonder were these notices served on the small farmers on the promptings of the Sinn Fein clubs?  I wonder if notices were served on Wexford farmers on the promptings of the Sinn Fein clubs of the County Wexford?  I have known cases myself of small farmers who owned altogether about 30 acres of land, divided into two holdings, one holding on which the farmer resides, and an outlying holding of, let us say, 20 or 25 acres.  These <Col N="2029" /> farmers have been served with notices that it is proposed to send an inspector to report on the suitability of the outlying farm for acquisition. These notices are still hanging over the heads of these unfortunate tenants.  That is true not only of one county, but of every county.  I ask the Minister whether, in such circumstances, with such a notice hanging over the heads of these farmers, they would take the same interest in the development of their holdings as they otherwise would?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or their neighbours. Does the Minister not realise, when notices of that kind are broadcast throughout the country that it does interfere with essential security; that it does interfere with the proper, normal development of such holdings and prevents the farmers from putting money into the development of these holdings for the purpose of increasing their productivity? I mentioned the Wexford cases.  I wonder does Deputy MacDermot suggest that the notices in these cases were served on the Wexford tenants on the promptings of the local Fianna Fáil clubs?  If one is to judge by what has happened as a result of the actions of local Fianna Fáil clubs, one is forced to the conclusion that they certainly do influence, and influence very largely, Land Commission administration, because in very many cases where local Fianna Fáil clubs have been active and have been pressing the Land Commission to acquire lands in various districts, the tenants of these lands have been served subsequently with notice that it is proposed to send inspectors for the purpose of reporting whether they are suitable for acquisition or otherwise.  As I say, these notices are still hanging over the heads of these unfortunate tenants and, to that extent at all events, the Land Commission has succeeded in creating a general feeling of insecurity and prevented the normal and proper development of the holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> The Minister, in replying to Deputy Bennett's amendment on Friday last, made this rather extraordinary statement: &ldquo;The fact is that this section gives very much more security to the people who purchased under the 1923 Land Act than they got under that Act.&rdquo;  I wonder did the Minister mean that statement seriously, or is it merely an effort to camouflage the real meaning and intention of the section.  I ask the Minister in what sense he can argue that the tenants whose holdings were vested under the 1923 Act are more secure under this Bill than they were hitherto?  Does not this section remove every security which vested tenants have?  Is not the real intention of the section to acquire, if necessary, every holding that has been vested under the 1923 Act?  As I mentioned on Friday, there is no question whatever about it that it was mentioned, I think by the Minister himself, on the Second Stage of the Land Act of 1923, that that Act was intended to be the last stage in the final settlement of the land question in this country.</P>
    <P>I also asked the Minister on Friday how far he intends to go in the direction of acquiring land.  It was pointed out away back in 1927 that, even assuming every available acre of land in this country was acquired for the purpose of relieving congestion, still the Government would not be able to deal with more than approximately 40 or 45 per cent. of the congests, without even providing one sod of land for the landless men.  So that, no matter what the Minister does in the direction of land acquisition, he will still not be able to do very much more than touch the fringe of the problem of congestion and probably he must look in other directions for the purpose of dealing with that problem of congestion about which he is so much concerned.  After all, if the agricultural industry is to be developed to its fullest capacity, it is absolutely essential that the farmers should enjoy security in the possession of their holdings.  If agriculture is to remain the primary industry of the country, then it is absolutely necessary that the farmers should be guaranteed security in the possession of their holdings.  No matter <Col N="2031" /> what the Minister does in the way of land acquisition, a stage will come, and probably come very much sooner than the Minister imagines, when he will be obliged to call a halt or take the consequences.  What Deputy Bennett has said is perfectly true: if the Minister continues on the present lines of land legislation and goes on in every Bill to take further powers for acquiring additional land, then it is inevitable that at some stage or other there will be another land war much more intense and bitter than any of the previous land wars have been.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather strange that the only speech that has been made so far in support of the Minister's proposal in this Bill came from probably the most uninformed and the most detached source from which it could possibly have emanated.  Deputy MacDermot, in the course of the argument which he put forward to help the Minister in this respect, made reference to two or three parallels, if I might say so.  He referred to slum property of the value of £2,000.  Who ever heard of slum property of the value of £2,000? When one speaks of slum property, one speaks of houses which have a negligible value.  Very few persons, if any, own 20 or 30 of these houses.  Nobody wants them to be left in the possession of them.  They are breaking the law almost by being in possession of them, if they are in an insanitary condition.  There is no parallel whatever with the case of a man working his own land with the help of his family or by giving employment. He has family associations with that property extending over generations probably.  In the other case, the man goes into the market and buys one of these old houses or half a dozen of them for a song.  There is no comparison between these two cases.  The second instance he gave was of a man who misuses his land. Who has ever heard of a farmer misusing his land?  To what extent can he retain possession of it and pay annuities and rates and misuse his land?  The thing is nonsensical.  Deputy Belton has had some experience of <Col N="2032" /> agriculture, and even he smiles at that.</P>

In the first place, the man who grows wheat will probably find himself patted on the back by the Minister or the Land Commission, and therefore he is secure.  What Deputy MacDermot has succeeded in proving is that the man who misuses his land will not be touched by the Land Commission because he is following out the Government policy. These cases are merely small debating points, and show a lack of the solid information which a Deputy ought to have before he stands up and supports this section.</P>

    <P>In order to get the support of the House for this section we ought to be satisfied on two or three headings. The first is that persons who are working their land and who need it for themselves and their families will not be interfered with and that, if they are, they will be paid a proper price for it.  It is no solution of this or of any other problem to throw a family, <Col N="2033" /> practically speaking, out of possession of its holding on to the roadside, and then to be able to boast that you put two or three other persons in on that land.  As regards those who will succeed a man deprived of his property in that way, we have got no guarantee that they will succeed on the land.  If we examine some of the cases in which this very necessary and useful work, as it has been described, is being done, we will find that the cost of doing it is prohibitive.  Would the Minister tell us what has been the cost per holding of the scheme carried out in the district of Athboy, County Meath?  It is not unreasonable to ask for that information.  I am told that the cost in the case of each family is very close on four figures.  Compare that with the cost of housing a family in the City of Dublin.  That is done at a quarter of the cost of putting a family on one of these holdings in the County Meath, while it has to be remembered that a family housed in the City of Dublin has to make a refund of the sum spent on housing it.  I am told that the cost of housing a family on one of those holdings in the County Meath is close on £1,000. These are splendid experiments to be able to show, but anyone, I think, will admit that it is impossible to carry them out on a wholesale scale.  The number of persons who, under one of those schemes, can be transplanted from one part of the country to another is negligible, and it is bound to be negligible if the cost for each family is going to be £1,000.</P>
    <P>The next question that arises is: what is the real land problem in this country?  Unquestionably it is congestion. This particular section is not confined to the acquisition of land for the purpose of making uneconomic holdings economic.  While we are increasing the number of holdings throughout the country and putting new people on the land, we are leaving untouched that festering sore&mdash;the uneconomic holdings.  If all these experiments have been carried out at the expense of those in the occupation of land for generations, and if their land has been acquired and that they are not being paid a price for it, <Col N="2034" /> then obviously we are doing an injustice to those people.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this section to give very drastic powers to the Land Commission. We have had examples already of cases in which the machinery of the Land Commission can be moved by persons whose only interest is political. In cases of that sort the insecurity that is likely to be felt by practically every landholder will prevent him putting his heart and soul into his work.  It is to be noted also that, at the moment that these extraordinary powers are being taken, farmers are able to make less out of their land than at any time in the memory of anyone whose means of livelihood is the land.  Will the Minister give us the average price that the Land Commission have paid for holdings that they have resumed, or intend to resume, over any period, and let us see whether or not it is a fair price?  Will he also assure us in respect of those persons who go to the courts&mdash;the Appeal Tribunal in the one case and the Supreme Court in the other&mdash;and get a decision in their favour&mdash;we on this side have no personal interest in any of them&mdash;that they, at any rate, will be secure even if it be only to vindicate the decision of the courts; or, alternatively, will the case be made on equitable grounds in respect of those particular persons that their lands are going to be acquired for the relief of congestion, and that they are not going to be given, as they have been given in certain parts of the country, to persons to whom the Land Acts were never intended to apply?  These, I submit, are not unreasonable questions to ask the Minister.  This is a very serious section, perhaps the most serious that has ever been put before any Parliament in connection with land.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that the people who are in occupation of land will have security in their holdings.  The Land Commission is not the institution which is entitled, in the first place, to acquire all the land that it considers is necessary, and to be the judge as to whether or not that land should be acquired. There you have two different problems. On the one hand you have the distribution of land.  I submit that it ought to <Col N="2035" /> be in the hands of other people to decide between the individual and the community as to whether or not that land should be acquired.</P>

      <P>If the opening observations of Deputy Cosgrave meant anything at all they meant that the misuse of agricultural land was something that could not occur.  Now I suggest that is a proposition which will not bear one moment's examination, and no assumption by him of a superiority of knowledge on these questions will prevent me from repeating that in many parts of the country you can see land that has been grossly misused, and in many cases that misuse has not been by large owners but by very small owners.  I do not care if a man has inherited land from a whole line of ancestors.  If I had a piece of land that had been in my family for a thousand years I am not such a Tory as to consider that I had thereby acquired the right to do anything that I wished with that bit of land irrespective of the interests of the community.  The very difficulties which Deputy Roddy has referred to: the difficulty that the amount of such a commodity of land is limited, and the difficulty that there is so much congestion to be provided for, forbid us to adopt any such extravagant notion as to what the proper rights of property are as would be implied by the remarks of Deputy Cosgrave, so far as land is concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to me as a supporter of this section.  In point of fact I spoke neither for nor against the section.</P>

      <P>I am waiting with interest to see what the Minister may have to say in his reply with regard to the special subject of the Fianna Fáil clubs that has interested Deputy Davin and myself.  What I did was to develop a little further what seemed to me to be the extremely important point that Deputy Davin made.  I also called attention to what seemed to me to be the unwise lengths to which some speakers in the Opposition have gone <Col N="2036" /> in the course of this debate.  Deputy Dillon, for example, said that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the fixed intention of the Fine Gael Party, when they become the Government of this country, to restore to the tenant-purchasers of this country the fixity of tenure which Fianna Fáil has now taken from them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And he then goes on:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to devise a method of tenure which will say &lsquo;Provided you own no more land than the maximum figure determined by the Legislature of this country, whether you are a landlord on your demesne, a farmer on your farm, or a tenant purchaser on your little holding, you are absolutely immovable by any force in this State unless and until you express your willingness to go&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reference is Dáil Debates, July 24, 1936, col. 1977.  That principle seems to me to be unsustainable and, if it is to be taken literally, the effect will be to put an end to land purchase in the country.</P>

      <P>Quite&mdash;or the misuse. I should like to suggest again that the farmer is really the best judge of how to use his farm.  Deputy MacDermot said he saw many farms in the country that are not being properly worked, in his view.  Any farmer who neglects his land for a definite period will finish himself; it does not need any Ministry to give him the <i>coup de grace.</i>  Any man who deliberately does what Deputy MacDermot suggests is being done with land, will not last long on the land.  If anybody takes the trouble <Col N="2037" /> to look back over the records of the last half century he will find that it is the men who worked hard and did their utmost to get what they could out of the land, who worked it through hard times, lean times, good times and bad times, who were the successful men. Those who neglected their farms went out of business very quickly and were obliged to sell out for what they could get.  These are the farms that the Minister might buy, and then he could pass them on to those who will work them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that in the course of this debate Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Roddy were rather talking with, so to speak, their tongues in their cheeks.  They know perfectly well that under the Act of 1933 a man's security is greater than it was in 1923 if he were living on a holding that was subject to vesting under that Act. Deputy Cosgrave talked about people having solid information before they rose to speak.  He was President when the late Deputy Hogan introduced the Land Act of 1923.  Under that Act his Government took power to retain all the holdings that came under it and to resume them and, in exercising their powers of resumption, the Land Commission &ldquo;shall have regard to the necessity of relieving congestion, the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country, and the manner in which the holdings have been used.&rdquo; If the Land Commission under the 1923 Land Act were to have regard to the manner in which the holdings have been used, surely it is lacking information of that that has made Deputy Cosgrave say what he said here to-day in regard to the use or the misuse of land.  He seemed to have absolutely no knowledge of the 1923 Act, or otherwise he is running away from the principles the late Deputy Hogan stood for in that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third alternative is that he simply does not care what he says as long as it is effective for the moment; so long as it is suitable <Col N="2038" /> for the moment it will do all right. There are certain members in this House who should set an example and who should not endeavour to create scares.  They are men who know what the responsibility of Government means.  I think it would not be asking too much of ex-Ministers and ex-Parliamentary Secretaries, like Deputy Roddy, not to attempt to create a scare with regard to something so important from the national point of view as the whole land question, in order to suit themselves for the time being.  Such Deputies should not make a debating point that may be effective for the moment, for the hour, for the week or for the month in regard to a question like that if it is not based on fact or on some sort of principle.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I have been frightfully disappointed with Deputy Roddy during the course of this debate.  He again mentioned the case about the Wexford farmers for the purpose of creating a scare.  He has already been fully informed that it was a mistake on the part of a lady typist in the office.  For the purpose of creating a scare he wants to turn the mistake of a young girl in an office into Government policy.  That is a bit too thick.  If the members opposite have any self-respect they should keep away from that type of stuff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave and others fulminated that a man should be absolutely immovable in his land; Deputy O'Sullivan said that a man should have security in his land unless a very great social evil is proved. Another phrase of his was that the land belongs to the individual, with the State having certain rights of interference.  Those were the real truths of the matter that hopped out from Deputy O'Sullivan's statements when he tried to create a scare about security.  What are the facts about this particular section?  It is related to Section 33 of 1933 and it gives a <Col N="2039" /> man security in his holding except the land is needed for the relief of congestion in the immediate neigh bourhood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of anybody who has bought out under the Acts, if the Land Commission comes along and wants to acquire his land he can quote that section.  He can bring the matter to the attention of the Land Commissioners and show that, having regard to the amount of food supply in the country and the amount of unemployment, he is working his land properly.  The point I want to come to is this: that when that was done it was done after a long debate here, in which Deputy MacDermot and <Col N="2040" /> others took part in 1933.  We inserted that section to give increased security to a man in proportion to his improvements. The better he worked his land the more security he had.  The more employment he gave and the more foodstuffs he produced, having regard to the interests of the country, the more secure he was in his holding.  I say that that is the best possible security, because that is a security in conformity with the national interests. If we act upon any other principle in our legislation, somebody will come along and smash it when it is in the national interests to smash it.  You will never get any generation that is prepared to see its wealth or its security endangered simply because Deputy Belton or Deputy Cosgrave wanted to have something in the Land Bill that would prevent the community from exercising its rights in regard to land.</P>

I think we <Col N="2043" /> have debated this section quite long enough.  On Friday last I pointed out at length what is involved in it.  It gives the Land Commission no more power than they sought in 1933.  It is confirming the powers that they sought to obtain then.  We acted under the 1933 Land Act for several years, and it was only quite recently that the Land Commission's activities under this particular clause which we are amending were held up.

As a matter of fact, I have never put down a question in this House since I came here in 1922 unless I was satisfied that the matter dealt with in the question had been dragging on for a long period, and I was unable to get any information. I thought and I think that the only way to get proper information, after a lengthy period of correspondence, is to put down a question to the Minister responsible.  I have been in the habit of doing that only in cases where I could not get satisfactory replies otherwise, and I shall continue to follow out that practice, whether the Minister likes it or not, so long as I remain a member of this House.  I would act in the same manner concerning every other Department of State.  That is what I was sent here for.  I have taken the precaution, ever since I was elected a Deputy for my constituency, of always conveying in writing to every Department of State any complaints or requests that I have had to make and I have never gone to a Minister either of the last Government or of this Government&mdash;I do <Col N="2044" /> not chase Ministers around this House or around Government Buildings on matters of administration, attempting to waste their time&mdash;without having previously submitted my case in writing to the Department of State or the Minister concerned. I think that that is only acting in accordance with my rights and in accordance with businesslike procedure, and I can assure the Minister again that I am not going to ask for any special privileges either from the Minister himself or from any of his colleagues, any more than I asked for special privileges from any of the Ministers in the last Government.</P>
      <P>I am not going to take up the time of the House by going into what Deputy MacDermot has said with regard to this particular section.  I have intervened in the debate again on this section because of the attitude adopted by Deputy Belton.  Deputy Belton is opposing the inclusion of this section in this Bill because, in his opinion, it is likely to destroy the security of land for loan purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the main argument put forward by Deputy Belton in his speech here on Friday last.  I want to remind Deputy Belton&mdash;and I think he knows something of the constituency that I represent in this House&mdash;that after the passing of the 1923 Act there were very few farmers, either small farmers or large farmers, who were in a position to go into a bank and get a loan on the security of land.  I have come across many farmers in my constituency who, if they had the working capital, would work their land better, not only in their own interest but in the national interest.  When the Minister talks about farmers working the land in the national interest as well as in the interest of the occupiers of the land, I suggest that he should make further inquiries as to the difficulties in which hard-working farmers find themselves, in their efforts to produce more on their land, as a result of their failure to get cheap money.  I know of cases of some of the best workmen&mdash;ploughmen <Col N="2045" /> and herds and other employees of estates that were divided in my area &mdash;who got holdings under the Act of 1923 and subsequent Acts, both from the previous Government and the present Government, who were unable to work their land to proper advantage simply because they could not get cheap money either from the banks or the Agricultural Credit Corporation or anybody else.  If the Minister wants men to work their lands better in the national interest as well as in their own interest, he will have to devise some better machinery than the machinery already provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or the banks of this country, to enable them to do so.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister for Lands paid a visit to Germany a year or two ago.  I should like to know from the Minister whether or not, during the course of that visit, he made inquiries as to the conditions under which small landholders or small farmers are enabled to work their land in that country and in other countries. I know of no country where people are being given land and where they have to face the same kind of proposition as we have to face in this country.  I know of a very big estate in my constituency that was divided by the late Government and where a number of small-holders there, who got portions of land and who were entitled to get <Col N="2046" /> portions of that land, had that land sublet to a grazier within a couple of years after they got the land&mdash;the explanation being that they were unable to work the land themselves because they had not the working capital to do so.  I had a letter recently from a constituent of mine&mdash;a hard-working man&mdash;who got a portion of land on an estate in the County of Laoighis and who applied to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for a loan because, as he informed me, he was unable to pay his annuity or his rates without a loan.  Loans at 6 per cent. per annum on the annuity basis are not the kind of thing to enable a man to work his land either in the national interest or in his own interest.</P>

      <P>I could give the Deputy a lesson in farming, just as I could give him a lesson in winning elections &mdash;up-to-date.  There is no use in talking about the water that went under the bridges 10 or 15 years ago.  It is how the trick is done to-day that counts.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the national interest, and who will be protected, and how will they know when they are working their land in the national interest?  The best way to demonstrate to people how they are working the land in the national interest is when the national interest is brought into line with the individual interest of the farmer on the farm.  That is the national interest.  Any man who goes into business is not thinking of humanity in general but of how he will <Col N="2048" /> balance his own business accounts, and I repeat that it is the function of the Minister for Agriculture to formulate such an agricultural policy as will induce the farmer to follow that line of policy, because then he will be following it in his own interest and that will coincide with the national interest. The Minister for Agriculture who cannot do that is a failure.  I disagree with the Minister in his statement that one-tenth of the farmers of this country misuse their land.  That is absurd. Nobody misuses property which he is in a position to handle properly.  Any apparent misuse of land there is in this country is due to some exceptional cause, and it is not necessary to destroy a great principle because one or two people here or there are foolish about their property.  I agree with the Minister that this is not the first violation of this principle, but I think he will agree with me that this is widening the breach in this principle, and that is what I am against.  The sooner the Minister tries to close up that breach, the better it will be for the country, because the security of a man in his holding is the greatest inducement he has to improve that holding and to farm it in a proper and husbandlike manner.</P>

      <P>I would not again intervene in this debate were it not for a remark which fell from the Minister in the speech he made a moment ago.  The Minister was definitely asked by Deputy Cosgrave whether in fact there was any interference by the Government with the work of the Land Commission.  We know precisely the statutory position of the Land Commission.  We know that so far as the purchase of holdings, the decision as to what holdings are to be purchased, and the division of holdings are concerned, these are reserved services, and that the Government have nothing to do with the way that work is being carried out.  We ask is that a fact.  Is the law being strictly obeyed?  That is what we want to know, because if the law is being strictly obeyed I should like to know why members of the Executive Council go round the country declaring that the law is not being obeyed.  I propose <Col N="2049" /> to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, July 27th, a speech made last Sunday by Dr. Ryan, Minister for Agriculture, in Loughrea.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to what the Minister said about the administration of the Land Commission for the safeguarding of tenants.  What the Minister said, as reported here, is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He claimed that in 1935 they had divided five times as much land as Fine Gael had in their best year, and he believed that at the rate at which they were going, they would divide all the land available in a short number of years and put the best people upon it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is a definite statement by a member of the Executive Council that it is the Executive Council that is purchasing land; that it is the Executive Council that is dividing land and putting the best people upon it.  I think we have a fair idea of what is meant by &ldquo;the best people.&rdquo;  The Minister, however, in this House says that the law is being strictly obeyed and he says that the Government are not interfering with the distribution of land, with the acquisition of land or with putting the best people or any other people upon the land.  You cannot have it both ways.  One or the other thing is true.  Either the statement which the Minister made in the House to-day is correct, or the statement which the Minister for Agriculture made in Loughrea is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, it seemed to me, was rather hedging in his answer to the question put by Deputy Cosgrave, but let us have it clear and definite.  Let us know whether the Government are interfering with the acquisition and division of land or not.  If they are, they are breaking the law; if they are not, what is the meaning of a member of the Executive Council going around the country and stating definitely in Loughrea that they are interfering and taking credit for the breaking up and dividing of land when there is no <Col N="2050" /> credit on God's earth due to them, they being mere strangers to the transaction and having nothing on earth to do with it?  The entire credit, praise or blame lies with the Land Commission. If the action is creditable, the credit is the Land Commission's; if the action is blameworthy, the blame must attach to the Land Commission. The Minister for Agriculture, however, tells us that quite the opposite is the case, and that the Government are taking credit for a thing with which they have as little to do as any Deputy in the House.  The law is administered under the 1933 Act and Deputy Davin has as much to do with deciding what land is to be acquired, what land is to be divided, and who is to be put upon the land, as the Minister for Lands has.  Let us know definitely from the Minister whether that statement by the Minister for Agriculture is justified in fact or whether the statement made repeatedly here, and more or less made in this discussion by the Minister himself, is correct.</P>

      <P>With a certain amount of hesitation before the final march is taken.  The Minister spoke again of scares.  Let him read over his own past statements, statements not of a Deputy going to become a Minister, but statements of, I presume, a responsible Minister, and ask himself whether there is anything more calculated to create scares than those statements coming from his own mouth.  It was not with the Land Commission he <Col N="2051" /> threatened the people who did not work the land properly; it was they, the Government, who would take the land from the people if they did not work it properly.  What is more calculated to create a scare, more calculated to create uneasiness, than an irresponsible&mdash;and that is the best that can be said about it&mdash;statement of that kind coming from a man in the position of the Minister?  I admit that at the time he was not Minister for Lands; he is now, but I do not see in that respect any change of view on his part.  He quoted the Act of 1923 and suggested that this is working out the same principle. Even if it were&mdash;and here I agree with Deputy Belton&mdash;if an inroad had been made into farmers' security it is no reason for widening the breach now.  On the contrary, I think every effort ought to be made by the Government to do the opposite.  It ought to be clear that the purpose of the various Land Purchase Acts was to make the farmers the owners of their lands, and so make them secure in that ownership.  That was the primary purpose of them all and the Act of 1923, like all the others, did that.  Once land was vested there was that security of ownership and any degree of insecurity or any sense of insecurity that might have been caused by certain provisions of that Act was limited strictly to a short period of operation.  But here is a gate open to insecurity, not for one year but for all future years.  Of course any future Minister can find quite as good a justification for land confiscation as the Minister here to-day if such a future Minister wants to pursue a policy of such confiscation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacDermot said that if there were 100 farmers who worked their land well and one who worked it badly that was no reason why that farmer who worked it badly should be left in possession of his land.  It is a very good reason because of the damage you do to the other 100 by interfering with that one man, and that holds whether we take the proportion of one in a 100 of Deputy <Col N="2052" /> MacDermot or one in ten of the Minister when he said that nine-tenths of the land were being well and properly worked.  If in order to try to prevent a few abuses you interfere with the security or sense of responsibility of farmers in general with the conviction that the farm belongs to them and is their very own nothing you do with the one-hundredth or the one-tenth can justify or repair the damage which you are going to do to the other ninety-nine-hundredths or nine-tenths.  That is what the Minister does not seem to realise, that even if he can make a case for interfering with one-tenth he is violating a principle in reference to the whole land of Ireland, and he is doing a very great damage to farming, and a damage that must altogether outweigh the good that in a few cases he could possibly hope to get from this section.  Once the farmer was vested the Land Act of 1923 made the land the property of the individual.  I do not know if the Minister agrees with me in this or not, as he took good care not to indicate his views; but the land does not belong to the State but is the land of the individual.  I do not think the Minister admits that.  That is what the Minister is interfering with. He has made no case and has shown no justification for an extension of the powers he is claiming.  Anyone who listened to the Minister's contribution to the debate should ask himself whether there was any case made by the Minister in favour of the extended powers he now seeks. This is damaging to a principle which ought to be sacred, even though in individual cases it might be thought better to have power to violate it. If that line of policy is pursued to violate sound principles because of individual abuses, the ground is being cut from under sound policy and there can be no sound Government. I fear that not merely in this case but in other things the Government is pursuing such an evil course.  They think they are justified in violating a principle that is sound, and that experience has shown to be sound, by bringing forward one or two cases for which they hope the violation <Col N="2053" /> will be a remedy.  No principle and no Government could last by a continuation of such policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the scarcity of land as if that were a justification for the line he proposes to take or for the powers he is asking for the Land Commission under the section. Therein lies the danger of his policy&mdash; the scarcity of land and the corresponding land hunger.  It is all very well for Deputy Davin and Deputy MacDermot to protest against the action of Fianna Fáil clubs and the pressure they bring to bear on the Land Commission.  But as long as you adopt the policy outlined here and in the Act of 1933 these abuses&mdash; grave and unsettling though they be&mdash; must exist.  How do you expect Fianna Fáil clubs to behave otherwise? Human nature will have to be, and Irish human nature particularly, changed very fundamentally if men are not to scramble for any land that can be divided.  As long as there is this extended power of confiscation there will be increasing pressure brought to bear upon Ministers and the Land Commission year after year and Parliament after Parliament to make use of these powers.  But notwithstanding what has been pointed out the Minister chooses to ignore these obvious dangers; anything he has stated, instead of allaying any fears we had, has only tended to increase and to multiply these fears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister read out a clause of the 1923 Act when replying, but he omitted to make any reference to this section.  We know the Act that was passed in 1923, because at that time we happen to have been employed on it while the Minister was otherwise engaged.  In sub-section (2) there is a reference to persons or bodies to whom land can be granted, and to whom, in the opinion of the Land Commission, an advance may be made.  If the Minister were to eliminate that clause and to put in persons who have been evicted tenants one might reasonably have less suspicions with regard to this section, but when we get no statement from the Minister as to the reasons for the change which he intends to bring about in the Act of 1923, naturally we <Col N="2054" /> have a right to ask what it means.  If he likes, the Minister can claim that even the Minister for Lands is not breaking the law.  If, in practice, the law is not strictly adhered to he can make that claim.  We asked questions and we are entitled to an answer.  It is not an unreasonable request.  If the Minister is unreasonably thin-skinned, and if the same thing happens in the case of Deputy MacDermot&mdash;I suppose this House has to put up with both of them&mdash;that is their misfortune, but it will not prevent us raising any question that we consider right or proper. As to this prima-donna attitude of assumed indignation, the Minister is quite welcome to that, but it does not give a satisfactory answer to questions. The Minister is paid by this State for answering for legislation introduced. He answers also as head of a Department. He happens to take up a line that was taken up by other Ministers and endeavours to put us in the dock. We had our period of office and we answered for our policy during that period.  We are not in office now, and there is no use bringing up this Act or that Act or past policy for the purpose of objecting to criticism.  We are tired of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister has anything to say for this section we are prepared to listen.  We have heard nothing about the section, and we are not satisfied there is a case for taking a man out of a holding he has worked, and which has been in the occupation of his family, simply to transfer it to some other person or body that, in the opinion of the Land Commission, ought to get it. When speaking on this power of the State some years ago, Deputy O'Donovan, in dealing with the breaking up of land in County Meath and County Kildare, which had produced fat stock, pointed out the injury that was being done to small farmers who were being deprived of one of the competitors for their store cattle.  Now we are in the position that we have practically buyers only in the English market, whereas formerly there were two competitors. There is the further case in connection with tillage, of which we hear so much and see so little, that those who did most tillage were engaged in fattening <Col N="2055" /> live stock.  Owing to the policy of the Minister that trade is practically gone. That is the result of the so-called national policy of the Minister.  It is humbug and nonsense to talk of the Government having to interfere with every man and with practically every business in order to improve it.  We were asked 12 months ago what the previous Government had done for bloodstock during their ten years of office.  Nothing, because nothing need be done for it.  We did not interfere with it.  We did not do it any damage. It progressed and developed and brought money to the country then.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Government were going to set up a Commission. That is the common policy, to have a Commission to interfere with and to improve everything.  Anything the Government interfered with they damaged, and, in my experience, that entails greater cost on the people who, unfortunately, have to pay.</P>

      <P>The Minister made my mind clear on one point, that the farmer is actually secure in his land as long as he can make the case that there is no congestion in the district, that he is working his land in a proper manner, that it is being worked in the national interest, and that he is giving a proper amount of employment in accordance with the Minister's standard of what that should be.  If he fails on one of these grounds, the Minister can fall back on another.  If the man relies on the congestion point and can prove his case, the Land Commission can say: &ldquo;You are not working your land in the way we think it ought to be worked.&rdquo; Again, if they fail on that plea, they can fall back on some other of the conditions. I leave it to the House whether that will make for stable conditions, whether or not any Minister could not find a loophole within these <Col N="2056" /> four conditions for taking land off any man he wishes.</P>

      <P>It does not appear to me that this section is necessary to enable the Land Commission to speed up the acquisition and division of land, and I should like to be satisfied that it is absolutely necessary before I could vote for it.  I do not know whether the Minister will accuse me of creating scares, but I think, speaking as a Deputy representing a county composed mostly of ex-farmers, men who work hard to make the best of their land, the least they can expect is security.  All this talk about scares is all very well, but if the Minister will go back a few years he will find that he created some scares himself.  As Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, we, as representatives of the people, are entitled to ask any questions so long as these questions are relevant to the debate.  We make no apology for asking these questions.  I cannot see why the farming community should be made cinderellas or cockshots for every Tom, Dick and Harry throughout the country, or some person who occupies a position in the local Fianna Fáil club, some useless type of individual who desires power through this section and through political influence to take the land of certain farmers in the country.  I cannot see why farmers should not be entitled to as much security as any other section in the community.  Some rather flippant references have been made to this matter by Deputy MacDermot and Deputy Davin.  It strikes me that the sooner they join the ranks of the advanced Socialists in this country the better for themselves, because we will then know where they stand.  Is a farmer not as much entitled to security in his holding as, say, a tenant who builds a house and secures an advance to finance the building of it under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act? What is the difference?  Men who are thrifty and who want to establish homes of their own apply through the various councils and corporations for loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  These loans are repaid by them over a period of 20 to 35 years, much in the same way as the <Col N="2057" /> farmer has been repaying in annuities the purchase price of his holding.  I cannot understand why anyone in this country should say to a man who has not too big a family: &ldquo;You have a small family and I have nine or ten. I give you notice now to clear out of your house in order to relieve the congestion in my family.&rdquo;  Where are you going to draw the line?  I think a very wrong principle is enshrined in this Bill, especially when one considers the standard of morality that prevails in this and many other countries at present.  We know the mentality that prevails in this country owing to the type of speeches that are being made at cross-roads by members of Fianna Fáil and, I am sorry to say, also by members of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>They will not hesitate to say anything if they think that by saying it they will advance their own prospects.  I should like to warn the Minister and the Government that they are embarking on a very dangerous policy by the introduction of this section.  As Deputy Dillon stated, there are men in this country who fought for their land&mdash;some of them died for their land&mdash;and they are to be found here still.  They will not carry on the fight from behind a stone wall like some members of the Fianna Fáil Party: they will do it in a manly, open way.  We make no apology to the Minister for opposing this section, and no talk about creating scares will make us withdraw that opposition.  The Minister cannot accuse me of creating scares; I am out for honest and straight dealing between man and man. I, for one, will not agree to any section that will endanger fixity of tenure so long enjoyed by the farmers of this country, and which was fought for by the leaders of the people 40 or 50 years ago.  It is all very well for the Minister to state: &ldquo;I have no intention of doing this, that or any other thing.&rdquo; If he has not, why seek the power? Why not leave the law as it stands at the moment?  Is the machinery which the Land Commission at present commands not sufficient to enable it to <Col N="2058" /> carry out its duties?  As far as I can learn, the Land Commission is very efficient at the present time and is doing its duty very well in the acquisition and division of estates for the last nine or ten years.  It is doing its duty in a way which meets with the approval of all decent people, but of course there are certain elements who think the Land Commission is not going fast enough and who want to confiscate the property of their neighbours. That is a dangerous proposal and one which the Government should be very slow to adopt.</P>
      <P>I say, as representing a county which, as the Minister knows, has given very little trouble on this whole question, that the farmers of that county want to be left alone.  They want to feel secure so long as they are able to pay their annuities and rates, and no man has a right to take their holdings from them.  All this talk about using land in the national interest has a very nice sound.  It is frequently used by men who to my own knowledge were never able to do an honest day's work or earn an honest penny in their lives.  They talk about national interests! That is a fine phrase, but it is a very dangerous one at present.  I would warn the Government to be very careful in using the powers which they seek in this Bill. It must be admitted that the farmers of this country are the most hardworking section of the community, men who have to be up early and late at night, eking out a livelihood under very unfavourable conditions.  The least they should get is fixity of tenure in their little holdings.  I certainly say that we, members of the Opposition, are quite entitled to ask every question we think is relevant to this section in the interests of the people we represent, people whose interests we are supposed to protect in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do deprecate the attitude taken up by the Minister&mdash;that sort of sneering attitude, as much as to say: &ldquo;Sit down and do not annoy us&rdquo;.  We are here to look after the business of the people who sent us here and it would be well if the Minister and those associated with him would take heed of what we, Deputies in Opposition, have <Col N="2059" /> got to say.  I am not one of those who believe in saying things for the mere sake of saying them or who believe in making use of words to wound or hurt anybody.  However, knowing the condition of affairs at the moment, I think it would be very unwise for the Government to proceed with this section&mdash;a section which, in my humble opinion, has created a great deal of alarm amongst many decent members of the farming community.  Those men <Col N="2060" /> are not confined to supporters of the Opposition.  Many farmers in the ranks of Fianna Fáil are just as much alarmed about this section as farmers in the opposite camp.  There is general alarm regarding this Bill in so far as it affects fixity of tenure and I hope the Government will hasten very slowly in connection with the exceptional powers they are taking for the acquisition and division of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister what is the object of this section.  I have always held that Ireland had a great potential asset in its shooting rights, which are not being developed now at all.  I should like to know if the Minister, in passing this section, is considering the question of the development of Ireland's fishing and shooting rights.  It seems to me to be rather the other way.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1923 Act the Minister had power to vest the sporting rights in the tenants.  In this section the Minister is taking power to vest the sporting rights similarly in the tenants.  There are many estates in the country in which the sporting rights <Col N="2061" /> are very valuable, but if they are divided up amongst a big number of tenants they will become valueless in the course of time.  The Government, like its predecessor in office, is doing its utmost to develop the tourist traffic in this country.  One of the amenities which has appealed so much to people who visit Ireland is the very fine fishing and shooting there is in the country.  Now, if the Minister vests the sporting rights in the tenants he will find in a very short time that these sporting rights will be of no value at all.  I understand that in England it is quite customary in many counties for a number of farmers to co-operate for the purpose of developing the sporting rights in their holdings, and they lease these sporting rights for very large sums of money to people who can afford to indulge in sport.  If the same thing were done in this country it would be the means of attracting large numbers of people and adding substantially to the income of the farmers and others. I agree that where the Land Commission is satisfied that the sporting rights should vest in the tenants they should so vest.  Nevertheless there is danger that the power which the Land Commission is seeking in this section may be exercised indiscriminately and, as a result, very valuable sporting properties may be destroyed in the course of time.</P>
      <P>I notice that the draftsman does not agree with the Minister about the meaning of the words &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; because he has substituted for these words the words &ldquo;that it would be for the benefit of the country&rdquo;.  The section now reads in effect that the sporting rights on or over such land should be acquired by the Land Commission and be vested in the proprietor of the said lands for the benefit of the country, if the lay commissioners are of opinion that that was desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I want to say that I feel in much the same position about this section as does Deputy Roddy.  While one cannot offer any great objection to vesting sporting rights in the tenants, still one can see the danger, so far as sporting rights generally in the country <Col N="2062" /> are concerned, if certain estates hitherto exempted are interfered with. A good many people are aware of the value of the Irish sporting rights if they are properly developed.  The mountain ranges, particularly, would be of immense benefit and would bring in national revenue if properly administered as they ought to be.  Under previous Acts, the Land Commission themselves came into possession of certain lands on which were valuable sporting rights.  I for one think it would be better if that were continued. Deputy Roddy referred, a moment ago, to the practice in England of the tenants uniting and stocking a large estate with game.  The same sort of thing might be done in this country. If a number of mountain holders would organise for the development of a mountain range, and stock it with game, they could make it into such a very valuable property as has been developed elsewhere.  The mountain could be made a more valuable property in that way, perhaps, than in any other way.  That is to say, if turned into a shooting tract, it could be leased for a very valuable sum.  In addition to that, there are the benefits that it would bring people to the country.  I think it would be all to the good if the Land Commission took over certain lands and held the sporting rights themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think that when the Land Commission take over estates on which are shooting rights, they would set an example to the farmers of the country by making an effort to develop the sporting rights of these lands.  There is no doubt that this development would add considerably to the value of these lands.  I suggest that the Land Commission should, as an experiment at least, take up one or two estates and develop them to the fullest extent.  They are in a position to do so, for they could put in experts to develop these sporting rights and spend money on their development. In that way they would prove to everybody possessing similar sporting rights that there was money in such an enterprise.  I do think that the Land Commission would be well advised to take up and hold the sporting rights which they do possess.  We sometimes <Col N="2063" /> see advertisements in the Press from the Land Commission offering shooting rights.  I know these shooting rights are not at present as developed as they ought to be by such a body as the Land Commission.  I am sure if the Land Commission came to this House to ask for money to develop mountain land as an example to the countryside, they would get the money to develop the land in a manner that would be an asset to the country. Such development would also bring money to the country; wealthy people would come here for their fishing and shooting just as they go to Scotland and other countries now.  That is all I have to say on this question.  I do hope my suggestion will be accepted by the Minister.  In this way the Land Commission would be able to demonstrate to the small holders the value of properly developing shooting property.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note the objection of certain Opposition Deputies to the vesting of sporting rights in the tenants.  This section gives the Land Commission power, whenever they think it right, to acquire sporting rights and sell them to the occupiers of land.  Now, Deputy Bennett objects to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the best procedure.  If we want the sporting rights developed, that development will have to be done by the men who own the land co-operating to do so under the direction of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Justice, or some other Minister who may be appointed for that purpose.  Certainly the Land Commission is not the ideal department for organising these cooperatives. The Land Commission find that they cannot operate or work the sporting rights vested in them under the 1923 Act, and wherever they can get tenants to pay the Land Commission what they paid for them they are prepared to vest them in the tenants. <Col N="2064" /> When all is said and done, I think it is the best procedure.  It can be followed by the organising of sporting co-operatives, who will take steps to enhance the value of the shooting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with one thing the Minister said, that the Land Commission is not the Department under which the development of shooting should be put.  I am inclined to think that the Land Commission is the very best Department for developing shooting.  The Minister, no doubt, recollects that I introduced a Game Bill some years ago which I had great hopes would lead to a great extension of game in this country, but I do not think it has had the good effect which I had hoped it would have.  But I considered the matter, and I came to the conclusion that the one Department in the State that could not run or develop a shooting was the Department of Justice, because it has no outside staff at all. The Department of Justice simply could not touch shooting.  I think the Land Commission would be the best Department for the purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Land Commission has spent money already for the purpose of stocking certain areas with game.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that it is still within the province of the Land Commission to spend money for such a purpose. I do not object to the vesting of the sporting rights in the tenants, and I made that clear in my speech, but I want this safeguard, that the Land Commission should be satisfied first of all when the sporting rights are so vested that they will be preserved or developed by the tenants, especially on estates where such rights are of real value.  There are many estates where the sporting rights are of real value and where they are a real attraction to visitors.  In these circumstances, I hold it is the duty of the Land Commission to see that such sporting rights are safeguarded and developed to the utmost possible extent. I submit that it is the duty of the Land Commission to see, where sporting rights are vested in the tenants, that these tenants do co-operate for the purpose of developing and preserving <Col N="2065" /> those sporting rights, just as is being done in England by bodies of farmers in various counties, by developing the sporting rights to the utmost possible extent and letting those sporting rights afterwards for the season to wealthy people who can pay for the privilege of indulging in such sport.  After all, it is possible by the proper utilisation of our sporting rights to reap quite a big income and it is possible also, for the farmers who take the trouble to co-operate for such a purpose, to add very substantially to the income which they normally derive from the management and cultivation of their farms.</P>

    <P>(b)  no regard shall be had to.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment which I propose to amend on the Report Stage. It is designed to prevent a landlord objecting to the purchase of land on account of an old contract if he has, in fact, acquiesced in a breach of that contract.  Where the holding was a residential holding, and by the terms of the lease has been set as a residential holding, if, in fact, it has been used as a farm with the landlord's knowledge and consent, we do not want the actual words of the lease to prevent the tenant from getting the benefit of the Land Purchase Acts.</P>

I meant to say some very strong things upon it, because it is the very worst form of retrospection and, at the same time, it is putting a premium upon a man doing what he undertakes not to do&mdash;breaking a covenant. The Minister's statement has shown that, at any rate, he is not sticking very firmly to the amendment and, therefore, the best course for me to adopt will be to keep quiet until such time as I see the revised form.

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that this section introduces a new principle, in that if there is any holding subject to any of the exceptions mentioned in the previous section which prevents the land vesting in the Land Commission, then the Land Commission may, if they deem it so expedient, divide the holding into separate holdings and apportion the rent accordingly.  In one sense this section appears to me to be an impossible section.  Take a case such as this.  If a house or a mansion stands on an area of land of about 30 acres, then the Land Commission have power under the section to separate the house from the land and by doing so they are inflicting serious injury on the owner of the property because the value of the house is considerably lessened by the fact that it is so separated from the land. Then again the property may comprise a fishery in addition to land and, under this section, the Land Commission will have power to separate the land from the fishery and, to that extent, of course they will depreciate the value of both.</P>
      <P>I do not quite know why this section is being introduced, because it appears to me that, under existing legislation, the Minister had adequate powers to deal with the matter which he is apparently attempting to deal with in this section.  I hold furthermore, because of the power he is seeking to give the Land Commission under this section, that there certainly should be a right of appeal beyond the Appeal Tribunal.  As I have said, this is introducing a new principle altogether, a principle which has not appeared in any legislation up to the present, so far as I can ascertain. I would be glad to hear the Minister's explanation of the section, and the reason for introducing it in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that where a man was working land as an ordinary farmer, and where he was the tenant of a superior landlord, it was the intention under the Land Acts to enable him to purchase out his holding and to make repayments in the form of an annuity.  Where the Land Commission are satisfied that a man is living on a small residential holding, with a large portion of land attached to it, they are taking power to allow in that portion of the holding that is being used in accordance with ordinary methods of husbandry, and to give the tenant the benefits of the Land Acts.  I think that, in this particular case, the landlord has no real right to object if the tenant is using this land in the way that neighbouring farmers are using theirs.  The section is designed to enable a division to be made between the residential part of the holding and the agricultural part, and, further, to enable the Land Commission to give the benefit of being able to purchase to the tenant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <P>Surely there cannot be a residential holding of any size, part of which is not agricultural. Suppose I let a house with a garden of, say, one acre, attached to it.  That is agricultural, because the garden is being used as an ordinary garden.  Are we, for instance, going to have people all around the suburbs of Dublin purchasing the gardens and not remaining on in the houses?  What is proposed in this section seems to me to be a rather novel and strange procedure.  Suppose there is a house in Ailesbury Road with an acre of a garden attached to it, and that the garden is being tilled in the ordinary way.  Can a person come along and get a price put on the garden and become the fee simple owner of it although he only remains as tenant in the house for quite a short period? Suppose I let my house with a couple of acres of a garden attached to it? The fee simple of that garden may be acquired by the person to whom I have let the house.  When the period of the letting is up, I am to have the house surrendered to me without the garden and without any of its amenities.</P>

In the case of a mansion standing on 30 acres of land, power is being taken under this section to separate the land from the house.  Because, in the opinion of the lay commissioners, the 30 acres of land are being tilled and worked according to the ordinary methods of husbandry, they are to have the power to segregate that land from the house.  Surely the Minister realises that in doing that he is inflicting injury on the owner of the house.  He is reducing its capital value and reducing considerably its saleable value.  It seems to me that this section can be applied to a number of other houses all over the country, even houses on <Col N="2070" /> estates that have been already acquired by the Land Commission.  As the Minister knows, it was customary in the past to leave a certain acreage of land with these houses for the purpose of making them saleable propositions.  Under this section the Minister will have power to segregate the land from the house, and to apportion one rent on the land and another on the house, with the result that it will be quite impossible for the owner to dispose of the house, because in order to make it a saleable proposition it would be necessary to have some land going with it.  It seems to me that this is a section that will lend itself to grave abuses.  It will inflict serious hardship on owners of property all over the country.  I do not believe in giving the Land Commission discretion in this matter.  I am sure that, in introducing this section, the Land Commission must have some particular case in mind.  Like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I would like to have some particulars of it from the Minister, so that we may get to know what the real intention of the Land Commission is in bringing forward this section.</P>

      <P>I have endeavoured to explain as clearly as I could the purpose of this section.  It is designed in the interests of certain tenants who up to this have been deprived of the benefits of the Land Purchase Acts, because the land which they hold and have been working in the ordinary agricultural manner, has been held in conjunction with, say, a large residence or with some incorporeal hereditament like fisheries or sporting rights.  The Land Commission want to be able to segregate the two, and to be able to give the tenant the benefit of purchase in regard to the land that he holds and works in the ordinary normal way as agricultural land.</P>

      <P>On one particular holding that the Land Commission dealt with there was a residence which had been let at £100 a year.  The rest of it was used as a normal agricultural farm.  The Land Commission wanted to allow in the agricultural portion the owner was living on.  There was another case, where there was a holding of 200 acres, of which 50 acres was let with a large house on it.  The remaining 150 acres were being used by the tenant as an ordinary agricultural farm.  They wanted to allow in that portion.  The Deputy will remember that in 1933 we took power to let in ordinary residential holdings that were being used as farms.  This section is taking power to make a segregation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 57:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2072" /> Before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whenever on any such application it appears to the Land Commission that the lands are not in the bona fide occupation of the applicant and are not being used by him as an ordinary farmer by reason of the fact that a mortgagee or court has appointed a receiver over the lands and over the rents and profits thereof the Land Commission may grant such application notwithstanding the fact that the applicant is not in bona fide occupation and is not using the lands as an ordinary farmer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to bring within the scope of the Land Acts the class of person who is excluded at the moment and excluded really to his own misfortune.  I refer now to persons who were fee farm grantees or lessees on long leases and who, in the ordinary course of events, would come within the provisions of Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931.  They are excluded because they are not in a position to comply with the conditions set out.  For instance, they are not in bona fide occupation and they are not working the farms in ordinary manner of husbandry because they have been put out of possession.  They have fallen on evil days and have mortgaged their lands.  The banks have gone into possession or a receiver has been appointed.  They are, therefore, not in occupation, and they are not working the land.  The receiver probably sets the land and, as far as I can see, neither the receiver nor the bank nor the fee farm grantee or lessee can make application.</P>
    <P>It appears to be rather hard lines on a man who has fallen into misfortune. He sees all his better-off neighbours who, perhaps, got grants from the same head landlord, deriving benefits under the Land Acts.  He sees the fee farm grantees beside him receiving substantial reductions of the amounts they are paying.  The type of man I am referring to is one who, up to the time the bank went into possession or the receiver was appointed, was working the farm as a farmer.  Being now out of occupation, he is not working the farm.  It is a bad situation both for the <Col N="2073" /> bank and the man himself.  The bank people are in the position that if they set the holding, whatever they get by way of rent will all be eaten up in paying the old fee farm rent or the rent reserved by the lease; whereas if they could bring the land within the terms of the Land Acts they would have such reduction as perhaps might leave something over from the grazing rent to pay off the mortgage eventually or contribute in some way to pay it off.</P>
    <P>The bank and the fee farm grantee or lessee would stand to gain if they could be brought within the terms of the Land Acts.  A great deal could be said for the making of provision to meet this type of case.  It seems inequitable that a man, merely because he has fallen on evil days, should be precluded from benefit.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Haslett, I move amendment No. 60:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (j), in page 20, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A holding of untenanted land held under fee farm grant, or lease for lives, or years renewable for ever, or a lease for a term of years of which <Col N="2074" /> 60 or more were unexpired at the date of the passing of the Land Act, 1923, and which is and was during the whole of the five years next before the institution of proceedings in relation thereto under the Land Purchase Acts substantially agricultural and pastoral, and worked in accordance with the ordinary methods of husbandry, shall not be excluded from the provisions of the Land Act, 1923, and of Acts amending and extending that Act, in virtue of which lands are vested in the Land Commission as tenanted lands on the appointed day by reason only that the said parcel is or is held in connection with a demesne, home farm, park or garden.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are many cases to which this amendment will apply. I think the Minister is familiar with the case Deputy Haslett would put up. I understand there are certain cases in which the landowner, having sold his land to his tenants, retains for his own use certain lands which were subject to rents on long leases.  Because these are adjacent to his demesne and are worked in conjunction with it, he cannot enjoy the benefits the Land Acts give.  The intention of the amendment is that such land held under long lease should get benefits similar to those given to the ordinary farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 61:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 42, page 20, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Every attempted sub-division or sub-letting of a holding in contravention of Section 3 of the Land Act, 1927, shall be void as against all persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The prohibition contained in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the <Col N="2075" /> Land Act, 1927, against letting a holding or parcel to which that sub-section applies without the consent of the Land Commission shall extend to the letting of a part of any such holding or parcel without the consent of the Land Commission, and the provisions of the said sub-section avoiding an attempted letting and empowering the Land Commission to cause the holding or parcel to be sold shall extend and apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>This new section is one that was suggested by the late Deputy Hogan in the last communication that was got from him in connection with the Land Bill.  It seeks to cover certain cases of sub-letting and to bring land purchased before the 1923 Act into line with what was done under the 1923 Act in regard to the prohibiting of sub-division. The position with regard to land purchased prior to 1923 was that sub-division was prohibited pending the redemption of the annuities and whereas the whole of the lands were prevented from being sub-divided, portion of them could be sub-divided. We want to bring the different aspects into line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear as to the meaning of this section. I think it means that drainage maintenance charges are to come under the purchase money of any lands.  If that is so I have some objection to it.  I think that would not be fair, where drainage charges were incurred with the idea of having a gradual benefit extending over a number of years, and where it was not anticipated that they would have to be paid within a year or two, but that there would be a gradual payment over 25 or 30 years.  The benefits would not be immediate either; they also would extend over a number of years.  In that case if a man's land were taken from him under the compulsory powers of the Act, it would not be fair to mulct him in the full value of the maintenance charge out of the purchase money.  It <Col N="2076" /> would not, to my mind, be fair to mulct him in regard to a charge for benefits which would continue over a number of years after the land was taken from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not designed to make the owner pay for ordinary drainage maintenance charges for the upkeep of a drainage system, but is meant to deal with the repayment of old capital sums which were spent and which are really portion of the improvement of the lands.  It has always been the practice of the Land Commission to make a resumed owner redeem those old charges in the same way as they made him redeem the land annuity; as a matter of fact they are portion of the annuity that he has paid on his land.  It is not intended that the resumed owner is to redeem the ordinary maintenance rate that is put on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister says that the ordinary maintenance charge is not included, but I should like to know whether this section includes charges made under the Act of 1924, giving power to go in under old Drainage Acts to do reconstruction work?  Would that be included in this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Acts of 1886 and 1924 would be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>From my own observation I know of lands which were redrained under the 1924 Act.  Work which was tantamount to a new drainage system was carried out, and maintenance charges were afterwards assessed.  That, to my mind, is in practically the same position as a new drainage system.  The work was done under the powers of the old Drainage Act of 1886.  There is even a worse aspect of the matter here.  In the case of a new drainage scheme a man goes in with his eyes open; he has power to object to it or not, as the case may be.  But in regard to this section, when this drainage was done he had not even that power.  The authorities stepped in and did the work without giving him the opportunity of saying &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay.&rdquo;  I think it would be unfair in that case to mulct him for the whole expenses of redraining, <Col N="2077" /> the benefits of which will run on for the next 20 or 25 years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinRoddy" hpid="Mr. Roddy Mr. Roddy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roddy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether clear about the meaning of this section, but to a certain extent I agree with Deputy Bennett that it does seem unfair on the face of it to mulct a tenant in the full amount of the drainage maintenance rate.  It seems to me that, in equity, the landlord should be mulcted in a proportion of it out of the purchase money, because he derived a benefit, and it is probable that the tenant paid him a certain rent for whatever drainage work was done on a particular estate.  In those circumstances, I think it is altogether unfair that the tenant should have to redeem the full amount of the maintenance rate when he may be getting a benefit only for a year or two or three years.  The landlord may have derived the major benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two subsections, (a) and (b).  In the case of land which vested in the Land Commission under Section 24 of the 1923 Act, under sub-section (a) the landlord has to redeem those old charges.  If it is a resumption case, under sub-section (b) the tenant has to do it. This has always been the practice of the Land Commission, but a question which recently arose made it necessary to introduce this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wanted to make clear is that there seems to be a different position in regard to two drainage systems.  In my own county we had several drainage systems within the last few years, and the maintenance and other charges will probably go on for 35 years.  I understand from the Minister that this section does not apply to those ordinary drainage systems, but it does apply to the renewal of old drainages under the 1924 Act. There were three or four such cases in my county, and the tenants concerned did not know anything about the drainage until it had taken place. <Col N="2078" /> They were given no opportunity of objecting to it.  The authorities just stepped in and reconstructed an old drainage system, the cost involved being just as much as would be incurred in the case of a new drainage system.  There was a little bit of objection to the charges afterwards, but they had to pay them, and they will run on for a great number of years.  There may be a lot of other cases of the same nature all over the State, and it may be that one of those holdings will be resumed.  To my mind it would be just as unfair to make a tenant pay, out of his purchase money, the cost of that drainage system as it would be of any other.  Deputy Roddy talked about the landlord.  Unfortunately, in those particular cases there is no landlord, or in the future there will be very few landlords, and it will be the tenant himself who will suffer under this particular clause.  I want to point out that to my mind it is unfair that one drainage system should be exempt while another is not.</P>

      <P>I am taking particular exception to the very limited provision <Col N="2081" /> which has been made under Section 4 of this Bill, and also to the failure of the Parliamentary Secretary, or whoever else is responsible for the way in which the section is inserted, to make adequate provision.  It states here in Section 4 that the maximum is limited to £150.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill makes provision for the payment of gratuities, and the maximum gratuity is limited to £150. I presume, Sir, that I am entitled to deal with that when dealing with part of the Bill or the Bill as a whole.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary give the House and those who are concerned in this matter some information as to the minimum gratuity which is likely to be paid to the persons who will be concerned under the terms either of that section or of the Bill?  I am informed that the Connaught Rangers who mutinied, or those who will become entitled under this Bill to gratuities, were, at the time of their service in the British Army, in receipt of pay at the rate of 25/- a week, a weekly allowance of 15/- for rations, 9/- for dependants' allowances, 5/- for clothes, and an additional gratuity, after having a service of four years, amounting to about £50. I am reliably informed that some of these people would have received in all, during the period in which it is now proposed to pay them a maximum of £150, not less than £350 if they had served in the British Army for four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also desire to inform the Parliamentary Secretary that privates belonging to British regiments who were interned in Germany during the European War received their full pay when they were released, and also received liberation gratuities, and in no case was the compensation of those who were imprisoned in Germany anything like the maximum contained in this Bill.  I have a personal interest in a couple of the persons who are likely to receive compensation under the terms of this Bill.  One is a man who was sentenced to penal servitude. His wife died a short time ago <Col N="2082" /> and left him with six orphans.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary give us any information of what is likely to happen under this Bill and what is the amount of compensation that such a person will receive?  We are giving a good deal of absolute discretion, under Section 4 of this Bill, to the Parliamentary Secretary to fix the minimum which will be paid, and he himself is asking for authority to fix this mean maximum which cannot compare with any other measure of the same kind for persons who suffered similar sacrifices and took similar risks.  What is the persons who suffered similar sacrifices minimum gratuity which it is proposed to pay under the terms of this Bill; or is it proposed to pay the maximum to all those who have qualified for gratuities under Section 4?  I hold that we are entitled to get more information from the Parliamentary Secretary on that point, and I particularly hope that he will give us some example of what is likely to happen.</P>

I can only say that we are treating the Connaught Rangers in this respect in a no less generous manner than we are treating the I.R.A. proper.  We do not intend to exceed the pensions given in the cases of the I.R.A. in any way, because we believe that it is an equitable arrangement that the allowances made to the Connaught Rangers in respect of a pension would be as favourable as they would be had they continued in the service of the British Army.  We are satisfied on that point, and we are satisfied also that the credentials of the number of people who will benefit under this Bill have been carefully examined.  We have very carefully examined their credentials and we are satisfied that every genuine claimant will receive benefit under this Bill.</P>

All that was incumbent on him was to keep within a certain time limit.

If it did not appear to the Department or to the Minister running this Bill that he had made destruction according to the Act, the Minister had to bring him to court, and then the decision lay with some judicial person as to whether destruction, in the proper sense and application of this measure, had taken place.  The Minister now wants to ease himself in regard to these matters and to say: &ldquo;I order you to destroy by a specified method&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The net point between us is that it is clear that people want to give somebody authority to order the destruction of weeds that are called noxious.  I understand this Bill met with general approval.  Power is given to the Minister to prescribe what are noxious weeds and, once he so prescribes, the growth, whatever it is, stands as a noxious weed.  It then comes to the serving of notice for their destruction. As the Bill stands, if a person does not destroy within a certain time he may be prosecuted.  That is surely a secure position for the Ministry to have.  They have the power to prescribe what is a noxious weed and then to serve a notice saying &ldquo;Get that destroyed,&rdquo; whatever the term may mean, inside a certain period.  At the end of the period, if there has not been what they think is destruction under the terms of the Act, they can prosecute. That is the position as it was, and I think it is a sound, good and very secure position.  The Government want to go a bit further and to order not merely destruction, but destruction in a specified way, and that is the way which they will prescribe by private notice to the individual.  The House will have no say in that order.  Is there not something to be said for a court, and for leaving other people to decide whether a prosecution lies or not, and whether, in fact, an order has been obeyed achieving destruction? It is not worth having a fight about, but I do not see any reason for it.  Is it being pressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can foresee a considerable amount of trouble on a court being asked whether the weeds were destroyed or not.  After all, they must be destroyed within a certain time.  As far as I can recollect, weeds are always destroyed by pulling or cutting.  A person might say that he sprayed, which might have the effect of reducing vitality for the time being, but there could be a long argument as <Col N="2088" /> to whether the weeds were destroyed or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister consulted with the Minister for Local Government and Public Health about this Bill, or does he think this an opportune time to bring it in, seeing that an Act was passed at the instance of that Minister last year and is still hung up?  The regulations prescribed <Col N="2089" /> under last year's Act have not been issued.  If the Act was essential in the interests of public health, why was it not enforced and the appointed day fixed?  Why has it not come into operation before this Bill is passed?  As the Minister is aware, various grades of milk are being put on the market, some excellent, some fairly good, and some not fit for human consumption.  The Minister in this Bill has not taken the trouble to define &ldquo;milk&rdquo; as it is defined in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain.  Even the orders issued to local sanitary authorities by the Government are not being generally carried out, and local authorities that took precautions or incurred the expense of building up machinery in order to have good milk produced are getting no more consideration than those that did not do so.  I believe I am right in saying that there are only three sanitary authorities in the Free State that have built up that organisation, the City of Dublin, the County Dublin, and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  I am a member of two of these bodies.  There is not another county health district in the Free State with a whole-time veterinary officer outside County Dublin.  The report of the reorganisation commission for milk set up by the British Ministry of Agriculture, published in 1933, states, on page 146, &ldquo;the appointment of a whole-time chief veterinary inspector by the council of each county and county borough is the irreducible minimum.&rdquo; That is backed up by the report of the medical officer of health for County Dublin, the medical officer of health of the City of Dublin, the chief veterinary officer of the City of Dublin, the chief veterinary officer of the County of Dublin, and the veterinary officer of Dun Laoghaire Borough.  Speaking for the county health district of County Dublin, the cost to the ratepayers of the organisation alone, including a whole-time veterinary officer, four part-time veterinary officers as well as dairy and other inspectors, is about £3,000. The organisation of the production of milk in County Dublin is such that nobody can sell milk without being registered.  When a man or woman registers, then the dairy premises are open to inspection and a great many <Col N="2090" /> regulations have to be complied with. These regulations are so exhaustive and so searching that under regulations of the Milk and Dairies Act of last year which are in draft, and which I have seen, we would not have to make one new regulation in County Dublin. We are carrying out the Dairies and Cowsheds Order, the Bovine and Tuberculosis Order, the Meat Order, and the Infectious Diseases of Animals Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not only created machinery to do all those things but they have not been done in any other county health district in the country.  The machinery that we have already set up, therefore, is good enough to administer the Milk and Dairies Act of last year.  I know that because I have compared an advance copy of the regulations with the regulations we have at the present time.  In the County and City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire we produce milk for consumption. On the commercial end of it, we produce milk particularly for the City of Dublin.  I have stated that the cost of the administrative machinery set up in the county alone&mdash; I have not asked for figures for the city or for Dun Laoghaire&mdash;is £3,000. That has to be raised on the rates but that is a small portion of the cost of clean milk production in the County of Dublin because, as I have already stated, the purveyors of milk must register, and the producers of milk for sale must register and then our inspection starts.  There must be proper dairies; there must be proper cow-sheds built, to a specification of a high standard, with smooth walls, concreted up to a certain height.  The sheds must be of a certain cubic content.  There must be proper ventilation.  The manure must be taken away, once the sheds are cleaned, a certain distance. Pigs must be segregated from cows. There must be proper drainage and a proper water supply.  A wash basin and towel must be provided.  It is an offence for a milker to milk two cows in succession without washing his hands in between.  All this is done to produce clean milk.  We are doing it in the areas I have mentioned but the Government that has imposed these conditions on the producers of milk in <Col N="2091" /> those areas has failed to see that its own Orders are carried out in any other part of the country.  I challenge the Minister when he is replying to contradict that statement.  He is Minister for Agriculture and I challenge him to say that in any other county area, except the county area of Dublin, is there a whole-time chief veterinary officer.  I gave him an authority here that a whole-time veterinary inspector is the irreducible minimum in having these Orders carried out.</P>
    <P>The milk brought into Dublin from a distance, as a very large quantity of milk is, has to be pasteurised, and here is what the same authority says on page 147 of this on pasteurisation:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Pasteurisation is not, and never can be, a substitute for clean production and the same care should, therefore, be exercised in the production of milk that is to be heat-treated as is required to be observed in the production of milk that is to be consumed in its raw condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What steps has the Minister taken to have milk of a uniform standard produced and sold in the City of Dublin? Why should we in County Dublin and in the City of Dublin be compelled by Government Orders to produce milk of a certain standard when the Government does not see that every other county is producing milk of a similar standard?  If we must produce milk of that standard, what is the object? Is it to sell it to the children of Dublin?  If milk of the standard which we are compelled by Government Orders to produce is necessary to the health of young and old in the City of Dublin, why does the Minister allow milk of a lower standard to come in? Does not this Bill, as far as it goes to define milk, define milk of a much inferior standard?</P>
    <P>I shall give another illuminating authority on this matter.  We hear very often that the North must come into the Free State.  Now, here is the standard the North has set for milk. It is set out in &ldquo;Leaflet No. 77, Government of Northern Ireland, Ministry for Agriculture, Milk and Milk Products Act (Northern Ireland), <Col N="2092" /> 1934, Licensing of milk producers and milk suppliers.&rdquo;  They have graded their milk into four grades.  One is Grade A, under which &ldquo;cows have to be tuberculin tested by the double intradermal test at six monthly intervals by a veterinary officer of the Ministry.&rdquo;  We do that in County Dublin, but it is not the Ministry's officer who does it but the board of health officer or the county council officer.  Milk standards under that Grade A are: &ldquo;maximum number of organisms per cubic centimetre, 100,000. Milk to be cooled on the farm and either bottled in sterilised bottles with green caps, clearly marked Grade A or sent to distributors in sealed sterilised churns similarly marked, must be sold to consumers in bottles marked Grade A.&rdquo;  Grade B&mdash;&ldquo;Cows to be clinically examined periodically by a veterinary officer of the Ministry and certified to be normal and healthy. Maximum number of organisms allowed, 300,000 per cubic centimetre. Milk to be cooled on the farm to at least 60 degrees and either bottled in sterilised bottles with brown caps marked Grade B or sent to distributor in sealed sterilised churns similarly marked, must be sold to consumers in bottles marked Grade B.&rdquo;  We produce milk of that grade too.  As regards Grade C, the cows are to be clinically examined periodically by a veterinary officer and certified to be normal and healthy.  There are no bacterial standards but the milk is to be subjected to a test for cleanliness at intervals. Milk may be distributed to consumers in the ordinary way from churns and cans, but they must be clearly marked with the designation C in red letters.  If distributed in bottles, the bottles to be sterilised; caps to be red in colour and marked Grade C.  Except for minor details, we produce milk of that grade in County Dublin.  That is the lowest grade which is allowed to be sold in the County or City of Dublin by Dublin milk producers.  Why does the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government and Public Health allow milk of a lower grade to be sold?  Grade D is described as &ldquo;Milk not sold under a Grade A, <Col N="2093" /> Grade B or Grade C licence.  Grade D milk cannot be sold for consumption as liquid milk and must be disposed of on the farm or sold for manufacturing purposes.  This will usually mean sale to a creamery.&rdquo;  Milk which must be sold in the North only for manufacturing purposes is being dumped into the City of Dublin&mdash;milk that would not be allowed to be sold for human consumption in the Six Counties or in England.  Here is an Order from the Ministry of Agriculture in Belfast.  The date is the 29th July, 1935:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Milk and Milk Products Act (Northern Ireland), 1934:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir, I am directed by the Minister of Agriculture to refer to sub-section (6) of Section 1 of the above-mentioned Act, which provides that milk shall not be sold or offered or exposed for sale for the purpose of human consumption unless it is milk of Grade A, Grade B or Grade C, and I am to state that a query has recently been addressed to the Ministry upon the question whether milk sold for use in the manufacture of foodstuffs for human consumption, i.e., ices, icecream, bread, confectionery, etc., and for use in cooking generally is for the purposes of this provision to be regarded as being sold for human consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The effect of the Order is that the milk that is sold freely for human consumption in its raw liquid state in the City of Dublin will not be allowed to be sold for the making of icecream or bread or confectionery in the Six Counties or in England.  Though I can speak with the authority of the veterinary services of the County Dublin, the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, that is not the point I want to feature.  We have a Ministry of Public Health and it is the job of that Ministry to look after the public health.</P>
    <P>I want to put the commercial and business view.  We have carried out these Orders at considerable expense and we are producing the article. After we have been made to produce an article of a certain standard, the market for which we produce that article is going to be glutted with an <Col N="2094" /> inferior article&mdash;an article that, according to all the information we have at the present time, is unfit for human consumption.  Is it not time that our Ministers sat up and took notice?  I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to-day when regulations would be ready, circulated and put into operation under the Milk and Dairies Act of last year. I reminded him that there was a Milk Bill going through here.  He said he knew nothing about that.  I wonder if it is possible that the Minister for Agriculture brought in this Bill without knowing that the Minister for Local Government had put through that other Bill last year?  That Bill is still hung up, for what reason I do not know.  Does the Minister not realise that one measure hangs on the other and is he not aware that the people who have been producing milk for consumption in the City of Dublin, and who, for years, have been subject to very stringent regulations are being put out of business, not because they are inefficient but because they have been producing an article of a standard higher than that which their competitors were asked to produce?  I suppose we shall be told by the Minister that the Dairies and Cowsheds Act, the Tuberculosis Order and other Orders are in force in other counties.  I know of a case in which a veterinary officer was offered £50 to do the job in a large section of a county.  He would not take the job on those conditions because he said he could not do the work properly.</P>
    <P>In many counties, the work is being done in a slipshod way.  We are paying £600 a year and travelling expenses to a full-time officer.  For what?  The rates have to pay that sum and the producers have to raise their sheds to a certain standard.  When all that is done, their milk is classed only with milk produced without supervision, with the logical result that the production of milk in the areas I have mentioned is going down.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  No interest in the County of Dublin looks upon the milk market here as a preserve of the producers in either the city or <Col N="2095" /> county.  We do no care where the milk is produced.  We recognise that Dublin is the capital of Ireland and not merely the capital of County Dublin and that all Ireland should have a share in its market.  What we want is simple justice, from the commercial point of view, and what would be in the interest of the public health &mdash; that no milk should be allowed to come into the City of Dublin that is not produced under as good hygienic conditions as the milk we are required to produce under the Orders of the Government.</P>
    <P>A large quantity of milk comes in here from creameries.  That milk is produced by suppliers to the creameries and is pasteurised at the creameries.  But there is no supervision over the production of the milk.  Even the Milk and Dairies Act of last year did not provide for that.  I do not want to go into that matter now because I would be infringing the rules of your order, Sir, if I did.  I only want to advert to that fact.  The Minister has not taken that into account in this Bill. The sheds in which the cows are housed, the conditions under which the milking is carried on, the conditions in which the cans are cleaned, sterilised and stored are subject to no supervision.</P>
    <P>I have here an order that came before the County Dublin Board of Health yesterday.  We held a meeting to consider the report of the chief veterinary officer.  We had before us the case of two milk producers in the County Dublin.  Our veterinary officer went in and inspected the herds.  These are comparatively small producers, comparatively poor men.  One of them had a cow for which he paid £16 10s. 0d., a year ago.  The other man had a cow for which he paid £15, less than a year ago.  Our veterinary inspector tested these cows.  They reacted to the test and he ordered their destruction. One man got £3 15s. 0d. for his cow and the other man got only 30/-. The man producing milk in the City or County of Dublin goes up to the market, buys cows, drives them into his land or into his yard.  Such a <Col N="2096" /> man will find that the veterinary inspector will be after these cattle very soon.  It is for that he is paid. He tests these cows and if they are found suffering from tuberculosis they are destroyed.  There is a valuation made of the animals and what the owners get is a quarter of their valuation or 30/- whichever is the greater.  For all intents and purposes they get nothing.  They lose the animal.  If the suppliers of milk to the creameries buy cows there is nobody to examine them.  The owners do not incur that risk.  They do not run the danger of the loss through the veterinary inspection.  Veterinary examination and supervision of milk production in the City and County of Dublin have been imposed by our Government.  But why does not our Government see that these orders are carried out in other places as well as in the City and County of Dublin? Deputies may take it that the orders are not carried out extravagantly in the County of Dublin area.  They are only carried out up to the standard to satisfy the Ministries concerned.  Why should the Ministry of Local Government and Public Health and the Ministry of Agriculture allow milk into the City of Dublin that is not certified to be of as good a standard and produced under equally clean conditions as the milk produced in the City and County of Dublin?  The Minister asks us to vote money.  I suppose Dublin City and County will have to put up its whack of that money to enable the people who produce milk in a primitive fashion to dump that milk into Dublin and compete with our milk which is produced in an up-to-date condition.  Apart altogether from the public health point of view that is not reasonable or equitable.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand at this time of day why any county or city should be saddled with the expenses of a county medical officer of health and all that follows in the train of a county medical officer of health if, as was stated to-day at a meeting of the Dublin Board of Health by our medical officer, we are permitting an article to be sold for human consumption that really may be little better than poison. <Col N="2097" /> Our veterinary officer mentioned that milk produced under dirty conditions and pasteurised is only camouflaged dirt.  Under this Bill the Minister permits that.  He is going to fix a maximum price for milk for consumption in the City of Dublin, but he is making no distinction in the price charged for milk fit for human consumption and milk that is admitted could not be fit for human consumption according to the standards set in Northern Ireland.  I have amendments. I do not want to suggest what the Minister should put in the Bill.  But I do say that it certainly is not equitable that people who produce a good article of food should be treated in the same way as regards price as those who do not.</P>
    <P>Our medical officer stated that milk is the best and the most complete food for the human.  He added, what we must all realise, that it is also the most complete food for the germs.  In order that milk should be kept a complete healthy, wholesome food for the human we must protect it against the germ. The important thing is that the Minister is not taking precautions to protect that complete human food from the germs and that he allows that unprotected food to be dumped into the City of Dublin and sold as a good article of food.  This City of Dublin has been for years building up an organisation to improve its milk supply and the quality of its milk.  Yet in the case of milk produced outside its own area the inspectors of the City and County of Dublin have not the right of entry to the place where the milk is produced in order to supervise the conditions under which it is produced.  Nobody but a national authority could properly supervise that.</P>
    <P>My case is that the national authority, as represented by the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, is endeavouring to undo the good work that has been done for generations, by successive Dublin Corporations, towards providing the City of Dublin with a wholesome milk supply. The Government is now permitting milk not produced under proper conditions and graded as unfit for human consumption to be dumped here. <Col N="2098" /> Some of this milk is unfit to make ices or to be used in making bread. But it is allowed in here to supplant an article that is produced in the City and County of Dublin under standard and up-to-date conditions.  The Ministers are failing in their duty in permitting this.  They are doing an injustice to the babies&mdash;the weakest section of the community.  It is time, before irreparable damage is done, that the Ministers should sit up, take notice and take the necessary precautions that all the milk supplied to the citizens of Dublin will be produced under conditions at least as good as the conditions under which milk is produced in the City and County of Dublin.</P>

This is a Bill to regulate the distribution of milk.  The other is a matter for the Minister for Local Government.  He has, of course, the necessary machinery which will be put into force.  I stood up in order to ensure it would not be generally accepted that the only place you can get a clean, pure, healthy, sound glass of milk is within the County Dublin. I think the general impression all over the country is that in the City of Dublin you are more likely to get milk that is not whole milk than you are in other parts of the country where the milk is altogether better than the milk in the city.  I do not know whose fault that is, but I think Deputies are well aware of the fact that the milk that is sold here, no matter in what way it is sold, is not anything like as rich in fats anyway as the milk that can be got down the country.  I think that is generally accepted.  I know that I am out of order as far as that is concerned, because it is purely a matter for the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on the last day said that the levy to be based on each gallon of milk would amount to about ¼d.  Assuming that the price of milk was 1/- a gallon, ¼d. does not appear a very large sum, but it amounts to something over 2 per cent. on the gross turnover.  The Minister knows sufficient about business to know that that is a pretty considerable impost.  If, on the other hand, the price of the milk sold was only 8d. per gallon, it would amount to a shade over 3 per cent.  That is all on the basis that not more than ¼d. is going to be charged as a levy.  I put it to the Minister on the last day that it would be better that this should be taken over as a State service.  The Minister did not agree with that.  He says this is a question of price.  He is regulating the price for certain people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton makes a good point when he askes that quality should be taken into consideration in connection with the matter.  When we are going to provide for the price to such an unusual extent that, I think, the Minister on the last day said it would cost about £10,000 per annum, surely the people have a right to have some money spent in ensuring quality for them.  While Deputy O'Reilly may be correct in regard to some of the milk in Dublin not being of good quality, nevertheless I can inform him of more than one dairy in Dublin that sells milk which he will not beat even in his great county.  I think it is unwise for us to be talking about a standard of excellence when the only person to speak on behalf of it is the exponent for a particular district.  Our aim ought to be to get quality.  Here in this Bill people are assured of a price. That is the purpose of the Bill.  To my mind, it is the most expensive machinery that could have been adopted to secure that purpose.  But, assuming that you have succeeded in doing it, the price is assured before the quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider in connection with this matter of milk whether he should not take over, or suggest to the Minister for Local Government that he should take over, the running of the Milk and Dairies Bill as well.  This division of functions <Col N="2101" /> amongst Ministers, particularly in a matter of this sort, where it leads to expense, is inadvisable.  Even though the question of public health is one which concerns the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Agriculture might suggest that, in so far as the supply of an essential and necessary article of diet such as this is concerned, it would be better if the administration of all Acts in connection with that was his particular responsibility.  The trend of legislation since this Government came into power has been to increase the cost of practically every public service.  Not only are the services increasing, but they are extending, and they are extending without any regard to the cost entailed.</P>
    <P>In this case the amount seems a small one, but is there any man in business in Dublin who, at the present moment, could stand a tax of 2 per cent., possibly 3 per cent., and maybe 4 per cent., on his gross turnover?  It would amount to a commercial revolution if it were imposed.  The Minister may answer by saying that this will ensure a price to them.  Who is to pay that? The consumer in the long run. Apparently the consumer, being an unorganised individual, has no means of asserting his authority unless by a revolution or something of that sort. The only method that is left to the people is to take the earliest opportunity of changing those who are responsible for adding to the cost of government, the cost of administration and increasing taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy O'Reilly say whether they have complete machinery for veterinary inspection in his county?  I made it quite clear that we do not want a monopoly. What we do want is that any milk that is allowed to compete with the milk we are selling must be produced under similar conditions of cleanliness, inspection, etc., as required by the Government.  I repeat that there is not a single county which has a whole-time chief veterinary inspector except the County Dublin.  We could not do the work with a part-time inspector, because it would be against human nature to expect a part-time veterinary <Col N="2102" /> officer, who had to make his living by getting jobs from myself and others, to come and inspect our milk and prosecute us, if necessary, for a breach of the regulations.  The reason we have a chief veterinary inspector is because he is independent, as he has not to earn his living amongst the people.</P>

      <P>If we are discussing a Clean Milk Bill I might be inclined to reply to many things Deputy Belton said, but I do not propose to waste time in replying to them, especially as there was a Clean Milk Bill before the Dáil already to-day, and the Deputy had an opportunity of talking then on this matter.  Surely the Deputy ought to see the distinction between dealing with milk from the public health point of view and dealing with milk from the economic point of view.  They are two distinct aspects of the situation.  The Minister for Local Government dealt with it from a public health point of view.  I am attempting to deal with it from the economic point of view.  The Deputy, in his 35 minutes' speech, demonstrated that he could not see the difference between the two aspects. He mixed them up hopelessly.  Even if the County Dublin does produce cleaner milk than other counties, what objection can producers in the County Dublin have to getting a better price for their milk?  Surely it is not going to harm them if the price they receive goes up from 4d. to 9d. a gallon.  The producers in the County Dublin will be better off to that extent as well as the producers in the Counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy thinks that we ought to define milk in this Bill.  The position is that whatever milk may be allowed into the City of Dublin under the public health laws is the milk that this Bill will be dealing with as regards price.  I think it would only create hopeless confusion if we were to bring into this Bill the definitions that we already have under our clean milk <Col N="2103" /> legislation, or if we were to bring in the definition that Deputy Belton appears to advocate.  With regard to the question raised by Deputy Cosgrave, this Money Resolution does not deal with the levy, but rather with whatever moneys may be voted by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The levy has already been dealt with.  The House has already passed the Financial Resolution on which the levy was fully discussed. This Money Resolution covers the money that may have to be voted eventually by the Dáil to meet whatever expenses there may be.  The expenses will, I think, be very small. The principal expenses in connection with this Resolution will be paid through the board and, therefore, out of the levy.  The expenses of the Department of Agriculture will be very small.  There will be some part-time supervision by a few officials of the Department.  The expense that that will involve will be small so far as this House is concerned.  Deputy Cosgrave made another point about the cost of administration in these matters.  I think we should regard this type of legislation as very different from other legislation in connection with which large sums of money have to be voted annually, say, for public health purposes, and borne out of the Central Fund.  Here is a case where we are trying to organise a trade. Under this legislation the trade will be enabled to organise itself.  It is quite conceivable that if the producers could organise themselves they would have done so without any legislation at all. We all know the difficulties that farmers have in organising themselves. If they have too much milk some of them are inclined to cut prices in order to get more of their milk taken by retailers and wholesalers.  In that way the price of the milk goes down and down.  We know from experience that farmers have found it impossible to organise themselves.  They tried to do so several times, but the agreements arrived at only lasted for a <Col N="2104" /> short time.  Under this legislation we are now giving them an opportunity to organise themselves so that they may be able to get an economic price for their milk.  They have not been getting that during the last few years.</P>
      <P>Looking at it from that point of view, I think we should give farmers an opportunity of organising amongst themselves in order to get that better price.  Therefore, I say that the cost of the organisation as well as the cost of running it should be borne out of the industry itself.  It is possible that the levy may be very small.  If it were only to meet the cost of administration, I think it would be much less than a farthing a gallon.  But then the board may decide to embark on a scheme of using a certain part of the surplus milk, or it may embark on a scheme of advertising in order to get that surplus used.  I think it is much better that the board should feel that, whatever the cost of all that may be, it should be within its own province to raise the necessary funds.  It should feel that if it is going to embark on these schemes it will have to pay for them.  It is very much better, I think, to leave the position that way than to adopt Deputy Cosgrave's suggestion which would mean that in order to embark on schemes of that kind the board would have to be going to the Minister for Agriculture, and through him to the Minister for Finance, looking for increased grants to deal with such matters.  As I have said, this is entirely a trading matter, and the cost should be borne by the milk suppliers themselves.  The sum of money that this House will be asked to vote in connection with this legislation will be very small.</P>

    <P>The object of the amendment is to delay the coming into force of this Bill until the Milk and Dairies Act of last year is put into operation.  Sections 20 and 30 of that Act give power to the Minister for Local Government, with the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, to make at any time an order declaring that a particular sub-section shall cease to be in force after a specified date.  The sub-section that can be suspended is the one which provides, in effect, for the registration of all milk producers.  It was only a small section of milk producers who were exempted under these two sections, and they were suppliers of milk to creameries.  All other producers had to be registered. That Act was passed a year ago and it is strange that it has not yet come into force.  The Minister for Agriculture is now proposing to regulate the sale of milk commercially.  In winding up the debate on the Money Resolution, the Minister said that it was a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to deal with milk from the health standpoint, and for himself, as Minister for Agriculture, to deal with it from the commercial or economic standpoint.  He said that I did not seem to see the difference between the two.  I see it quite well; I see that the Minister is only trying to sidetrack the issue.  He is now proposing in this Bill to arrange for the sale of milk from the economic standpoint, but prior to his attempting that, a year before he attempted it and a year before he introduced this Bill, the public health authority, as represented in this House, put a Bill through regulating the production and the handling of milk from the health standpoint. Why has that measure been held up? All that this amendment asks is that this Bill should take its place in the order of importance and in accordance <Col N="2106" /> with the chronological order of events.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government and Public Health put a Bill through the House a year before the Minister for Agriculture found it necessary to introduce this Bill.  All this amendment asks is that this measure should not come into force until the Act passed through the House at the instance of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health be first put into operation.  According to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and his advisers, milk of a proper standard will be marketed.  Let the Minister for Agriculture then regulate the marketing of that if he is so advised.  Let him not regulate the marketing of an article that, in effect, the public health authority has condemned.  In the Act to which I have referred, milk might be condemned that could be sold under this Bill.  My advice to the Minister is to get the quality first and then organise its sale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is desirable that the clean milk legislation should be put into operation as soon as possible.  I have been assured by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health that every attempt has been made to bring that Act into operation, but that the framing of the regulations has given a great deal of trouble.  The Minister hopes to have the greater part of the Act in operation before the winter.  I think the Deputy will agree that if there had been no clean milk legislation, this problem in regard to prices is a pressing problem, and unless we were prepared to allow conditions to continue such as we had a few weeks ago of milk coming in at 5d. and 4½d. a gallon, then some regulation of supply and price is essential.  The two measures, as the Deputy has agreed with me, are entirely separate measures.  I think he will further agree with me that if this measure were in operation it would enable the producers to comply with the other Act better than if they were getting lower prices.  They will be able to make the necessary changes in their cowsheds, and, if they go in for a higher grade <Col N="2107" /> of milk, it will enable them to substitute healthier cows for some of the cows they have in stock.</P>
      <P>Seeing that the clean milk legislation is coming into operation very soon, the Deputy ought not to press this amendment, because it is possible that we might be operating this measure three or four weeks before the other one comes into operation.  I think it is better that we should go ahead with this Bill, because it would be advisable to have it in force when new contracts are being made.  If the clean milk legislation comes into operation three or four weeks later, then no milk will be coming into the city under the contracts unless it is clean milk.</P>

      <P>I would like to accommodate the Minister, but I was given a mandate to press this amendment. When this becomes an Act, the Minister will have to make many regulations. He will have to do a lot of organising.  The regulations under the Milk and Dairies Act are pretty well advanced; I daresay the Minister has seen them.  Perhaps they may be finished.  They may not have got final approval yet for printing, but if they are not at that stage they are just on that stage.  Knowing the delay that the Minister will have under this Bill, I see no insuperable obstacle in the way of the Milk and Dairies Act of last year&mdash;considering the position of the regulations under that Act&mdash;working well ahead of this measure unless there is some reason that does not appear on the surface for holding it back.  I think the Minister will agree that the framing of the regulations has got to such a stage in the case of the Milk and Dairies Act that even if it were a race now he would hardly catch up to the Minister for Local Government in getting his legislation into operation before the Milk and Dairies Act.  I am not impressed by the Minister's argument.  I have a feeling&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that there is some reason for pushing this through before the Milk and Dairies Act.  If there is not, then the Milk and Dairies Act should be in operation long before the Minister will be ready to put this measure into force.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether this matter was definitely before the House on the Second Reading, but I find remarks made on the Second Reading very pertinent to it.  One Deputy confined himself to talking about the undesirable conditions under which milk was produced in the country and marketed in Dublin. He referred to milk being hawked around the city, having been produced under undesirable conditions.  He said that, as regards the milk that came into Dublin, nobody could tell where it came from.  It arrived here by motor car, train or lorry, and it was impossible to indicate its place of origin.  That was the keynote of Deputy O'Reilly's speech.  I wonder is the Deputy going to support Deputy Belton's attitude now?</P>

He did refer to the unwholesome and undesirable conditions under which milk consumed in Dublin was produced and sold here.  The whole tenor of Deputy O'Reilly's speech was that he apparently thought that the boards to be established under this would look after the quality or would secure a higher quality of milk.  He has apparently misread the Bill.  His mind was wholly running on Deputy Belton's lines.  He was in favour of preserving quality. That was Deputy Belton's argument.</P>

      <P>In the County Meath it is a very serious matter for them to consider the production of milk under the provisions of this Act.  In County Dublin there is no regulation we have to make under that Act that we have not in force already and that should not be in force in County Meath if they had done their work.  The Deputy will give in reply what I said on the Financial Resolution, that they had an organisation in County Meath the same as they had in County Dublin.  Now they are hesitating to put it up because the milk would not pay them.  How is it going to pay the Dublin producers, who have an organisation there already?  If the Deputy buys a cow, no inspector will go into his yard, apply the tuberculin test, and order her destruction if she reacts.  But that has to be done here, whereas the Deputy can go on milking the old tuberculin cow and dumping the milk in here to Dublin.</P>

      <P>Remember, the Minister is opening up a market here, and it has cost thousands of pounds to the citizens of Dublin in building up machinery to ensure milk of a certain standard for the City of Dublin.  The Minister now proposes under this Bill to guarantee to outsiders a price in that market for milk of a standard inferior to what the public health authorities of the City of Dublin require to be produced.  Will the Minister deny that?  All that is asked in this amendment is that the guaranteed price and the guaranteed market be not regulated in the City of Dublin until this Milk and Dairies Act to provide for the production of milk of a good standard for sale in the City of Dublin be first put into operation.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's direct objection to that.  He is trying to sidetrack it.  He has to draft those regulations and it will be a big job.  The others are in draft.  The Minister for Local Government should be able to beat him in the competition to see who would first have his Act in operation.  Unless there is some reason for delaying the operation of that Act indefinitely, why should it not come into operation before the Milk Bill now before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Belton's amendment.  I think everybody here in the City or County of Dublin is desirous that milk of the best standard should be supplied. Whether the members of the community belong to the very poorest <Col N="2113" /> or the very richest sections they all drink milk, and I think possibly the very poorest are the most helpless and the most in need of regulations.  If there was anything that made in favour of Deputy Belton's amendment, it was what Deputy O'Reilly said, because apparently, according to his statement, there are a number of farmers, or milk producers anyway, in the adjoining counties who are hesitating whether they can afford to go in for the production of the class of milk that is contemplated when the Milk and Dairies Act is in full force. That brings us to another phase of this problem.  I suppose milk production is only the same as a whole lot of other things that are produced.  Now, the people who produce the best class of article very often have to compete in price with an article produced under the very worst possible conditions. I should like to protest against that, and I should like to suggest that, as a reward for the production of an article up to a standard, the easiest and simplest way would be to keep out the article that was not up to that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are faced with a glut of milk in the Dublin market.  If we had a scarcity, I suppose the Minister would say to us: &ldquo;Oh, well now, of course the people must get milk, and there is little enough coming in, and if I stop any milk coming in there will be no milk for certain sections of the community to drink.&rdquo;  Now, I think that, surely, when there is a glut of milk, now is the time to put stringent regulations in force; and it must be remembered that that will have its reactions in many ways.  Presumably, it will have some effect on the health of the population.  It will enhance our reputation as a tourist centre, and it will show the people who are not producing milk up to that standard that they have got to put their house in order.  I do not know what Deputy O'Reilly envisaged as the problem in front of the farmer producing milk in Meath who said: &ldquo;I do not know whether I can afford to go in for these regulations.&rdquo;  I suppose, then, that man would send his milk to the creamery to be made into butter.  Is <Col N="2114" /> that the position?  Whatever is done, however, I should like to see these regulations enforced and, as I said before, whether you regard it as a reward for producing milk of the highest grade, or from the point of view of the health of the community or the enhancement of our reputation as a tourist centre and for supplying food to the population equal to any other centre in the British Isles, I should like to support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to understand Deputy O'Reilly.  Speaking on the Second Reading of this Bill, he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This question of legislation first cropped up, as many members will remember, on the occasion when a Bill was introduced by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to achieve something that was very necessary&mdash;to ensure a supply of clean milk for the people of the city.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear that the Deputy, at any rate, understood the purpose of the Act to which Deputy Belton's amendment refers&mdash;the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935.  Deputy O'Reilly then continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Act is not now entirely in operation, but, at any rate, it imposed on the suppliers of milk to the City of Dublin a rather heavy expenditure in so far as they were compelled to put their cowsheds and other appurtenances in order.  That is going to cost them a good deal of money.  The only statement I made on that occasion was to request the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to ask the Minister for Agriculture what steps he intended to take to ensure that the purchasers were going to get a better price for their milk in order to meet the increased costs which would naturally ensue from the operation of the Bill then going through the House.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then continued on to talk about nobody having any control and how necessary it was to ensure the purity of the milk sold here.  I asked him a moment ago did he think he represented the people of his constituency correctly when he stated here boldly in this House that some of his <Col N="2115" /> constituents were considering whether it was not better to sell dirty milk&mdash; that was the tenor of his remarks&mdash;at whatever price they could get for it, rather than have two Acts run in harness together, at any rate as far as the regulations are concerned, after the passage of these Bills through the House.  I refer to the Milk and Dairies Act and to this Bill.  The Deputy must understand that the Bill has, as part of its title, the regulation of supply and price.  I think that the supply matter is only a preamble to the price matter. The Bill we are discussing is entirely concerned with price, and the other Bill, which Deputy Belton suggests should run in harness with this Bill, is the one that deals with purity and quality.  Evidently, Deputy O'Reilly wants, now that Dublin has dropped the old alliterative damnation of the &ldquo;dear and dirty Dublin&rdquo; slogan, that Meath should take it up.  Meath, according to the Deputy, is apparently the place where the people have not yet made up their minds whether they can afford to sell clean milk.  Supposing the Deputy has that mentality and that some of his constituents&mdash;misrepresented by him, I suggest&mdash;have that mentality, would not Deputy Belton's amendment be a better one?</P>
    <P>Under the Bill we are considering, the board, when established, will have to consider the regulation of maximum and minimum prices for milk.  Should they do that before they have in front of them the expenditure necessary in order to run the Milk and Dairies Act, or should they do it before that expense is put upon the producer?  Surely it is better to have those boards contemplate an article produced under good conditions and sold as pure milk rather than have them associate a price in connection with an article which is not governed by the Milk and Dairies Act.  If ever there was a reasonable amendment, this is it.  It asks that, before we start to regulate the price, we should see that what Deputy O'Reilly so forcefully pleaded for on the Second Reading is attended to: namely, the warranty for purity.  Once that is established, the matter could be much better dealt with.  I suggest, however, that there is a much more <Col N="2116" /> cynical point behind Deputy O'Reilly's speech&mdash;one that perhaps he has not discovered himself, but which I propose to disclose.  This Bill is, mainly, to deal with the situation of the supply of milk to the City of Dublin.  Now, County Meath supplies milk to Dublin, and County Dublin supplies milk under certain conditions.  I suggest that the price that may be fixed may possibly have some relation to the conditions in County Dublin and County Meath, and that, until some regulations are made, people in County Meath will continue to get as good a price for less pure milk than County Dublin producers&mdash;a price based upon milk as produced under present County Dublin conditions.  If so, I say that that is a scandalous thing and one that the Government should prevent.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Belton's amendment does suggest the logical order in which these different enactments should be put in force.  The Bill before us at present proposes to establish a machinery to regulate the milk supply, but it proposes to establish such machinery without any reference to the quality of the milk or to the effect of that milk on health.  It seems to me that that is illogical in view of the fact that we have on the Statute Book an Act passed last year which has not yet been put into force, an Act which deals with the quality of the milk sold and with its effect upon health.  Now we are asked to set up a machinery to provide a market for milk without any reference to the quality of the milk.  In itself, that is illogical, but it seems to me, too, that it will create very considerable difficulty for the milk producers.  They are asked to assist, if this Bill is enacted and goes into force before the other Bill, in forming machinery to sell milk, while they are still in ignorance of the conditions under which that milk must be produced.  The farmer is put in this curious dilemma, that he is asked to join in this market, to produce milk <Col N="2117" /> and possibly to increase his equipment for producing milk, in entire ignorance of the conditions that will be imposed upon him when the Act of last year comes into force.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Minister is so anxious to put this Bill into force rapidly.  He is not asked in Deputy Belton's amendment to delay it.  All that is asked is that the other Act which is ripe for being put into force&mdash;and the regulations must be ripe for being put into force&mdash;should be put into force first, and his Bill should follow immediately, if it is ready.  He is not asked to delay the enactment of the Bill; he is not asked to delay it in any of its stages.  He is asked to ensure that the other Act is put into force first.  I think that is entirely reasonable and logical, and a safeguard to the consumer, and also to the farmer producer.  If the Minister accepted this amendment, the mere fact of his accepting it would probably hurry the Department in charge of the other Act in getting their regulations ready without further loss of time.  I am not suggesting that they have delayed in the matter.  I am sure they are working on them, but it would become a more urgent matter to get their regulations complete and to put the Act into force at once.  I hope the Minister will consider this amendment.  It does not at all interfere with the machinery he proposes.  It merely asks that what are going to be the permanent conditions in regard to the production of milk should be understood by the public and by the consumer and in force as law before he establishes this machinery.</P>

      <P>I do not think any Deputy here is so innocent as to believe that this amendment can be anything but a delaying amendment.  The Milk and Dairies Act which went through last year will come into operation as soon as the Department of Local Government can possibly bring it into operation. As I stated already, they found considerable difficulty in framing these regulations, because they have so many interests to deal with and there are so many obstacles to be got over in trying to get clean milk for the consumers here in the city and elsewhere, and, at <Col N="2118" /> the same time, in inflicting the minimum amount of hardship on those engaged in the milk trade, whether they are producers, retailers or wholesalers. I have not the slightest doubt that that Act will come into operation in the shortest possible time.  This amendment means that if, by any chance, I was in a position to bring this Bill into operation before the Milk and Dairies Act comes into operation, I should have to wait.  If I am not ready sooner, it does not make any difference&mdash;the other Bill comes in first and this Bill comes in afterwards. Suppose, however, there is some unforeseen delay in putting the Milk and Dairies Act into operation, a delay which every Deputy will agree was unavoidable, are we then to be in the position that the people must accept unsatisfactory prices for their milk during that delay?</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Belton will have to admit that, taking even the most favourable view of his amendment from the supplier's point of view, there is a possibility of a delay in the amendment. It is not going to achieve anything so far as I can see, because I do not see how the threat of this amendment, or the fact that it is accepted by this House, can hurry the Minister for Local Government or the officials of his Department any more in framing these regulations.  Deputy Belton ought to realise that the fact that I accept an amendment here is not going to get them to hurry in the slightest, because they have assured me already that they are going as fast as they can and will bring the Bill into operation at the earliest possible moment.  I cannot get any more from them.  If I go back to them and say &ldquo;I cannot get this Bill to operate until you operate first,&rdquo; they will naturally say &ldquo;We are doing our best.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You are going to place an obligation on my constituents by legislation fixing an increased price for their milk which, according to the Act of this House, passed last year, is unfit for human consumption, and I would be false to my constituents if I were a party to making them pay an increased price for such an article.  According to the medical advice which they are paying for&mdash;I am now quoting the medical officers for the City and County of Dublin&mdash;milk which is not produced under proper conditions is more a poison than a food.  We here in Dublin are paying for that advice.  Are we going to take it?  The Minister for Local Government passed this Act through a year ago.  What has the whole Department been doing for 12 months that they are not able to draft and to put into force the regulations to implement this Act?  Were they playing fast and loose with this House when they came here with their Bill and said it was a matter of urgent necessity for the health of the people in the country?  They have not been able to implement it in a year.  The Minister asks whether if, by any chance, he gets this Act through, he is <Col N="2120" /> to hold it up owing to something unforeseen happening with regard to the Milk and Dairies Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can tell the Minister that the regulations are in draft.  I read them to-day.  He has not started to draft regulations and will not do so until he gets this Bill.  What is delaying the Department of Local Government? Has there been deliberate delay? What is holding up the other Act?  The first essential in buying food, if it is only a pound of butter, is not price but quality.  Bad butter and bad milk are dear at any price.  The other Act gives quality, and this Bill comes along with price.  If Deputy O'Reilly or the representative of any other constituency wants to have a good price paid for a good article, if the article is not being produced it should not be sold in the market.  I will go to Meath and say that.  I will even go to Duleek to say it, where the milk organisation was started and where it burst up because they were not able to redeem the promises they made.  If we are serious about legislation and about the health of the people, let us look to quality first.  Farmers will produce milk of that standard if they are paid to do it.  Deputy Dockrell made a good point when he said that we have a surplus of milk produced under the stringent conditions that I enumerated. There is a glut here because the good milk is being crushed out by milk produced without supervision.  As Deputy Dockrell said, now is the time to make a start.  If the Minister will not accept this amendment, will he bring in one on the Report Stage so that no producer can be registered for the sale of milk unless production is supervised at the source?  If the Minister does that I will withdraw this amendment.  The City of Dublin has for a generation paid the price to get milk of a certain standard for consumption, and I will not be a party to fixing an increased price for that milk if the people are not to get an article of the standard that the health authorities in the city say should be sold for consumption.  If the Minister will not bring in an amendment so that milk will be supervised at the source, or if he wants to fix a high <Col N="2121" /> price for dirty milk&mdash;because that is what it amounts to&mdash;he should know that while it would not be accepted for human consumption or for the making of bread or pastries in Belfast, the citizens of Dublin are forced to pay an increased price for it.</P>

      <P>From the answer given, the section will only catch a person who fails to be registered in accordance with whatever regulations happen to be in force.  If there are no regulations there is no prohibition of registration.  That does not carry it further.  We have advanced somewhere in this matter.  Apparently there is agreement in the House that the general principle of a Bill dealing with prices which we are discussing is a desirable one.  I gathered from the fact that the Minister concentrated his whole argument on the point of delay, as well as from the eloquent silence of Deputy O'Reilly, that the House is more or less in agreement that quality should be attended to before a price is fixed.  Put in that way, we would get some agreement. The House would not connive at a price being paid for milk produced under conditions which were quite clearly condemned by it when it passed the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935.  We are completely concerned with the point of delay.  The Minister told us that there had been great delay in framing regulations.  He gave as another excuse that regulations are difficult to frame, because one had to consider all the interests that might be prejudiced.  If the Minister had been a member of another Government that was any way concerned during its career with hardship that might be caused to anyone by such regulations, we might take that excuse.  We would <Col N="2122" /> be more credulous about doing so when we consider the record of the Government, and particularly the Minister for Agriculture, who had from time to time drawn up regulations after regulations, bundles of them, and changed them when it was found that the first draft brought hardship on certain people.  They were amended and reamended without the slightest scruple, conscience or shame. I would have thought that if any Government Department had been made perfect in the framing of regulations through practice it would be the present Department of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must misunderstand the position.  These regulations are not made by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Department for Local Government and the Department of Agriculture are joined up in the making of regulations, and I suppose the experts do not consider the price of milk without having some touch with quality and other aspects of departmental work.  The Minister stands before us in this House as the champion of clean and good milk, of substantial good food in the form of milk.  Personally, he tried to inaugurate a movement in favour of drinking more milk&mdash;it was not to drink dirty milk.  There is considerable practice in the drafting of regulations, but other than two or three vague phrases of the Minister, no one has explained the reason for the delay in regard to the regulations and the difficulty that prevents the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935 being made operative. Probably the Minister's best point was that by passing the present Bill the Act of 1935 would be hurried up.  He did not say where the stimulus would be.  The Minister reacted very quickly to certain conditions that became very clear to him in and around the City of Dublin quite recently and this Bill emerged.  Let us think of the farmer producer who he says must get a better price under this Bill.  Let the Minister consider the producers who might have got a better price if the Minister had brought in regulations for the Act passed on the 14th June <Col N="2123" /> last year.  Let him divert all that very potent sway exercised upon him with regard to this measure on the Minister for Local Government, and this House will undoubtedly give a very definite stimulus to the bringing in of these very long-delayed regulations.  The Minister tried to raise the bogey of political viewpoints with regard to the Bill.  I do not mind facing up to that particular bogey&mdash;Deputy Belton said that he counts it as nothing&mdash;if we have these two measures running together, if the farmer producers see that this House almost unanimously has agreed to the fixing of a better price for the producers of milk, and if the farmer producers know, as they must have realised, that from the 13th June last year this House almost unanimously agreed that a better standard with regard to the purity of a particular foodstuff, was required.  If these farmer producers generally have got to look round to see where is the delay, are they going to think of this House debating this measure here, or will they not ask what has happened to prevent the coming into operation of the regulations which should have been made under the Act passed in June, 1935?  If there is any blame for delay, the blame will not be put on this House and deservedly will not be put on this House.  It will be put on the Department of Local Government which got an Act passed in June of last year and has not yet produced the regulations under it or has not given to the House any explanation of why these regulations have not been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton asked whether a particular change in the amendment would make it more acceptable.  I wish to suggest another change.  I think that the Minister might have made this point, that as long as any sanitary authority had failed to enforce the provisions of the 1935 Act, the Minister could not apply this Prices Act to that part of the Saorstát. That would be clearly undesirable. Would the Minister accept that change in the amendment, that the Act would only come into operation in regard to any area where the sanitary authority <Col N="2124" /> had accepted the 1935 Act?  That would then mean that there were two Departments brought into association in this matter.  The Department of Local Government would have to get whatever regulations are required under the 1935 Act put into operation in whole or in part and then the provisions of this Bill would only accrue in favour of people who lived in an area where the sanitary authorities were acting under that 1935 Act.  It is quite clear that it should not be left to the consent of some sanitary authority to hold up the entirety of this Prices Regulation Bill.  Certainly, we ought to see that the two measures should run together, that there will be a better price given, but only when we find that the people benefiting by that price are desirous of meeting this House in regard to the other measure by taking steps to provide for supplies of pure milk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the price to be fixed?  Is it the cost of production of clean, good milk that will regulate the fixed prices?  If it is, what right have those people who are not producing good, clean milk to get a good clean milk price?  If it is not that, will the price be regulated according to the supply of milk, and what sort of milk will be reckoned in the supply?  Will it be good, bad and indifferent milk? The sale area of the City of Dublin may have included in it part of the area of a sanitary authority which has not adopted the Milk and Dairies Act of 1935.  Then that area is going to be paid for an article that it is not producing while the people who are paying for that superior article are not getting it.  I cannot see with any equity, with any sense of justice at all, how this Prices Bill can be administered in an area where provision has not already been made for the production in that area of milk of a certain standard.  If the Prices Bill that is now before us does not take into account milk of the standard that the authorities in this <Col N="2125" /> sale area say that we require for the health of our people, then obviously a terrible injustice is being done to the city.  What are we, the ratepayers in the city and county, paying medical officers, sanitary officers and veterinary officers for?  Their advice is that we should have milk of a certain grade, and the Minister is going to fix a price on the basis of a milk supply of an inferior grade.  The Minister will not insist on the Act which was passed last year being put into force.  He will not insist, as Deputy McGilligan suggested, on its being run in double harness with this Bill.  He will not accept Deputy McGilligan's suggestion to circumscribe my amendment so that the benefit of the price fixing will not be available to producers in any sanitary district which has not adopted the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Act of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point the Minister has endeavoured to make in his own defence is to accuse me of delaying the passage of this Bill in putting down this amendment.  That might be good enough for a public platform, but it is not good enough for this House and the Minister is not going to get away with it.  Deputy McGilligan made the case quite clear, that the Local Government Department have got their Act for the past 13 months.  If it has not been put into operation it is not the fault of the Minister for Agriculture, nor is it the fault of this House.  It is the fault of the Department which failed to deliver the goods within a year.  The Minister for Agriculture in seeking the passage of this Bill is afraid that he may be ready to put it into operation before the Milk and Dairies Act passed 13 <Col N="2126" /> months ago.  I would suggest to the Minister that he is conscious of some reason which is holding up the Milk and Dairies Act.  What is the reason? I think the House ought to know.  The Minister for Local Government or his Parliamentary Secretary came into this House and said: &ldquo;We want good milk; we must have pure food in the shape of pure milk for the people of this country.&rdquo;  They came before the House with all that flourish of trumpets, saying that the Government were looking after the health of the people by insisting on the production of good milk and the sale of good milk.  Now they have hung up the Act for over a year.  Now, the Minister for Agriculture is afraid he will beat them in the race.  He will not even take an amendment limiting the scope of my amendment.  At bottom, I think there is something dishonest about the whole business.  Because of some afterthought, the Government want to delay the putting into operation of the Milk and Dairies Act of last year.  In other words, because of some afterthought, they do not want to see that good, clean milk is sold here and paid for at an economic price.  The Minister cannot tell us for what article he wants an economic price.  Is it for clean milk or dirty milk?  His lieutenant, Deputy O'Reilly, said they were considering down in Meath whether it would pay them to produce clean milk at the fixed price.  I am speaking for people who want clean milk.  Their expert advisers say you must have clean milk at any price.  The Minister wants to force dirty milk on them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister think fit to introduce a provision establishing in precise terms that this Bill will not have any effect whatever on <Col N="2129" /> anything done under the 1928 Act?  I suggest there are possibilities of very serious reactions arising from things done under the 1928 Act, and I gather that it is not the intention of the Minister that should happen.  The Creameries Act of 1928 ought to run by itself, and any conditions established under that Act should continue and be of full force and effect and should not be in any way marred by this.</P>

      <P>The matters of which I am thinking would come in under the later sections.  They would not come under the definition of milk. They might interfere with the licences granted under the Creameries Act of 1928, and the freedom given under that Act might be very definitely cut down by the activities of the board; in fact, by the very wording of this particular measure.  The Minister's viewpoint is clear that the Act of 1928 is one thing and should be allowed to run along on its own.  There should be no adverse repercussions by this Bill on that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment to the Minister's amendment.  I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 21, to insert the word &ldquo;human&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;consumption&rdquo; and in line 22 to delete all words after the word &ldquo;milk&rdquo; to the end of line 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister defines by implication that the milk that he proposes to deal with in this Bill is milk that in up-to-date places, and even under the Milk and Dairies Act, is not fit for human consumption; because even where the regulations are more stringent than they are here and more stringent than is contemplated in the Milk and Dairies Act, milk not allowed to be sold for human consumption as liquid milk is allowed to be sold to the creameries to manufacture butter. The Minister here standardises an article the price of which he proposes to regulate in this Bill, as milk of the <Col N="2130" /> type that is offered to creameries for the making of butter.  There is no supervision under that.  There is no place in these islands where such milk is allowed to be sold for human consumption as liquid milk.  I think the Minister has hit on a very unhappy definition of milk.  The definition that I suggest in the amendment, though it may not be specific enough, is a safer definition than the one the Minister proposes.  Quite clearly he visualises milk as supplied to creameries; that is the milk the price of which he is prepared to regulate when &ldquo;sold for human consumption.&rdquo; There is no inspection of the herd. There is no inspection of the dairies where the milk cans may be stored. There is no inspection whatever at the source of production.  Health authorities are not so much concerned for that inspection at the source of production when milk is intended for the manufacture of butter, but no health authority in those islands, except the Free State, will permit that milk to be sold for human consumption as liquid milk. The latest measure of the Free State Government is this Bill proposing to regulate the standard minimum price that the citizens of Dublin should pay for dirty milk.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not exactly see that Deputy Belton gets his point by this amendment.  The amendment would exclude from the Bill all milk sold for the manufacture of butter and cream. That would be the effect of the amendment the Deputy is proposing.  Let us take a wholesaler or a retailer who buys a certain quantity of milk.  The Deputy knows he sometimes has to churn part of that milk or he buys some of that milk for conversion into cream or perhaps ice cream.  He would be excluded from the Bill. That is, he could pay any price he liked for milk if he intended to use it for butter, cream, ice cream or cheese.  I think the Deputy will see that it would lead to confusion and make the task of the board practically impossible, because if a wholesaler were detected in paying less than the minimum to a certain farmer he might make the <Col N="2131" /> plea that he did not intend to use that particular milk for human consumption, but for cheese or buttermaking, as he might, perhaps, be making butter or cheese as a side line or to use up his surplus milk.  From the point of view of the administration of the board, if for no other reason, I think it would be impossible.</P>

      <P>The primary object of distributors is to buy milk for distribution and sale as liquid milk, and they must pay the standard price fixed for liquid milk.  No distributor is going to buy milk and make butter of it, because if he can sell it as liquid milk it would pay him better.  It is his trade to buy it and sell it as liquid milk.  Heretofore distributors had to churn, but in future, because of the dump for the milk&mdash;I call it that without any disrespect for the Bill&mdash; there will be no inducement to distributors to churn any milk or manufacture it into any other article.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 2 now runs: that for the purposes of the Act &ldquo;milk dealt with at premises registered in any of the registers kept under the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, shall be deemed to have been produced at such premises.&rdquo; What is the purpose of that particular definition?  Secondly, &ldquo;the owner of such premises shall be deemed to be the producer of any milk dealt with thereat.&rdquo;  These two sub-sections have reference to premises registered in any of the registers established under the 1924 Act.  I presume that is kept entirely distinct and apart from creameries in relation to which licences are granted under the 1928 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It only refers to premises registered under the 1924 Act, and, as the other was a later Act, I thought if it was intended to include registration under the 1928 Act that the two Acts would be joined together. The third point has reference to sub-section (c): &ldquo;Where any milk is sold <Col N="2133" /> or purchased such milk shall be deemed to have been sold at the place where the purchaser carries on business.&rdquo; That has no relation to registered premises, so far as the wording goes, but it is tied up in a sub-section the first two-lettered paragraphs of which have reference to registered premises. I want to know is letter paragraph (c) supposed to refer also to sale or purchase at premises, or has it anything to do with premises?</P>
      <P>Then there is this further question. Suppose you have a man who collects milk from a variety of places and who has a main sales establishment in Dublin.  Is any milk he purchases elsewhere in the country and diverts up to his Dublin sales premises and sells from there deemed to have been sold at the place where he carries on his main business?  I notice that on the Second Reading there was talk about what is described as the home counties. Supposing a man has premises somewhere on the outskirts of one of the home counties, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and he also has premises outside the home area, and that he buys some there; that he has been in the habit of transferring that to premises inside the area, and that finally it arrives in Dublin for sale in Dublin where his main place of business is.  Will the milk bought outside the home counties be deemed to have been bought in Dublin under this?  I think that is the meaning of letter paragraph (c).  Whether it is intended or not I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under some section later on in this Bill&mdash;I cannot quote the section for a moment&mdash;orders will be made with regard to the area.  No milk can be collected outside that area unless the person had previously been supplying milk to the city or town, as the case may be.  So that under that section, of course, he could not collect milk even through a subsidiary any way he wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Section 31. It seems to me that that is in conflict a little bit with the widest meaning&mdash; whether the proper meaning or not&mdash; given to letter paragraph (c).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take my example. A man has business premises in Dublin, but he purchases milk, say, in Wicklow and he purchases milk somewhere south of Wicklow.  Now, this definition says that where &ldquo;any milk is sold or purchased, such milk should be deemed to have been sold or purchased at the place where the purchaser carries on business.&rdquo;  In the case of that Dublin man, his main business is undoubtedly in Dublin.  Now, he has purchased milk in Wicklow.  Wicklow may be inside the joint district.  Therefore that would not matter, but he may have been in the habit of collecting milk outside the home counties.  Therefore I think that the definition, as drafted, would mean that any milk he purchases anywhere will be deemed to have been sold or purchased where the business is.  It would have been sold in Dublin, no matter where purchased, and that may conflict with Section 31.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so, but perhaps it may be as well to look into it to see if it does conflict with Section 31.  The Deputy asked me about paragraphs (a) and (b).  These refer to creameries.  There are certain creameries, for instance, supplying the City of Dublin.  They are supplying it <Col N="2135" /> to a greater extent, perhaps, in towns that this Act may apply to.  It is considered that it would not be fair to exclude those creameries from the business that they have built up. Therefore they would come under the clause in Section 31.  There is a later clause in that section which says that those who have been supplying milk for the last 15 months from outside the registration district would be entitled to continue to supply.  The creameries would come under that category.  We have, therefore, to get a definition with regard to who is the supplier in that case.  We say that the supplier is the creamery.  We do not go back to the farmer who supplies the creamery. The creamery would be regarded as the producer, and, therefore, all the regulations that apply to a producer and supplier would apply to the creamery as if that creamery were a farmer-producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 31 has this meaning.  Certain people are to be allowed to apply to the board for a joint district to be registered in the register of producers in relation to that district.  Now, who is to be allowed to apply?  &ldquo;A person who produces or proposes to produce milk on premises situate in a production district.&rdquo;  That is clear enough, but you go on to enlarge that, and you say &ldquo;A person who produces milk on premises situate outside such production district,&rdquo; and who, during the period of 12 or 15 months, has been supplying.  He is to be deemed to be a producer inside the area.  That is what it comes to.  As I read paragraph (a) of sub-section (2), that is hardly necessary.  There is another type of case which will certainly enlarge the production district, although there may not be many examples of it.  Supposing that the home counties are going to be scheduled as the joint district for Dublin, and I think that is the intention, there may be a creamery somewhere to the south of Wicklow which may be drawing supplies from across the border into the neighbouring county.  Under the definition, anything that is dealt with in that creamery from the southern extremities of that county <Col N="2136" /> will be deemed to have been produced in the creamery whether, in fact, it was produced there or not.  I do not see the necessity for sub-section (1), paragraph (b) of Section 35.  A person is deemed to be registered in a production district if he has been producing milk outside a production area and has been selling it inside for 12 of the 15 months laid down in the section.</P>

      <P>On the section, I gather that the purpose of one or two of these amendments put in by the Minister is to have a different specification for the retailer and the wholesaler in different areas, if he thinks that is necessary.  I gather also that the explanation so far is that your definition of a retailer in Dublin might miss a particular type of person or might include a fair number of people whom you would not desire to include, thinking of that term in relation to the country, and <i>vice versa.</i>  I suppose there is some case for that.  The section, even without the amendments, gives the Minister power by order to define a sale district and a production district and, if he likes, to declare that these two areas are to be a joint district for sale and supply.  In sub-section (2), the Minister at any time may revoke or amend a joint district order.  He may in particular alter by addition or subtraction or both an area which is a sale district.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether he can envisage this in operation?  Is it intended that districts will be arranged with county limits, or will there be breaking up of counties for the purpose of arranging production, sale or joint districts?  I gathered that the divisions would be county groupings in the main. The Minister takes power to declare an area that might be any fraction or portion of a county, and he can apparently subtract even less than a bit of a county, less than a well-recognised portion of a county.  There must have been some objective before the Minister prior to this matter being considered.  Has the Minister any idea yet with regard to Dublin as to what is going to be the joint district for sale or production?  Is it not going to be the home counties?</P>

      <P>Why has this peculiarly wide power of amendment been put in?  It may be a safeguard, but has the Minister thought of any possible eventuality?  Is it in his mind <Col N="2140" /> that one might have to add areas bordering on the home counties, or even fractions of areas bordering on the home counties?  He has made provision to enable sales, as they used to be, to be continued where the producers or sellers might find themselves outside an actual area.  Is this power of varying the area taken deliberately with the intention of adding in some fractions of towns of other counties, or is it an emergency clause with no special objective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, as regards what the Deputy says about adding and subtracting, the position would be very clear if we only had to deal with Dublin, but suppose we take the town of Cobh, possibly we might take part of County Cork as the supply area.  It is possible to visualise the division of a county when defining an area.  With regard to adding or subtracting, afterwards, I must confess I cannot see at the moment any particular case where it would be necessary, but I think on the whole it might be well to have those powers.  If, for instance, a town thought it had not been allowed a sufficient area, we might have to add a bit to it.  I think there should be power to add or subtract in certain eventualities.</P>

      <P>There is one other omission and I do not know whether it was deliberate or accidental.  Sub-section (2) of Section 15 is a sort of disqualification section which I think is taken from the ordinary regulations in company law as to when a director ceases to hold that position, and it covers everything except the contingency that is always guarded against &mdash;that of a person becoming insane. Apparently the milk board will knock off a person who will become bankrupt, or who is convicted of an offence, or who goes out of the country or who gets out of business, but if he goes mad he can continue.  There is a temporary substitute section later, which may be intended to meet it, but that covers only illness, and will throw on the Minister the invidious task of making up his mind when a person has become temporarily deranged, although a court has not found him to be a person of unsound mind.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 21, I should like to ask a few questions. This is, of course, in familar form. It appears I think in the Bacon Act and has, I understand, come to be known throughout that trade as the official secrets clause in that particular Act.  Here it recurs.  It has a very innocent purpose and a quite desirable aim.  It prevents a member or officer of a board from disclosing any information in relation to the business of any other person, if that information has been obtained by him in his capacity as such member or officer, and it imposes a penalty for that disclosure which is declared to be an offence. Sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Nothing in sub-section (1) of this section shall apply to the disclosure of any information for the purposes of any legal proceedings (whether civil or criminal) taken or proposed to be taken under this part of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a prosecution recently in either Drogheda or Dundalk in connection with some offence under one of those Bacon Acts, and an Order which the Minister establishes in a particular way under this Act, established in a similar way under that Act, was relied upon as the foundation of the offence.  But when the Order was questioned, the official from the Pigs and Bacon Board who was sent down to prosecute refused to produce the Order on the ground that although he was running the prosecution under it and on foot of it he was prohibited by Section 21 from making any revelation. Of course, the point was taken immediately that there is a special exception under sub-section (3), and that nothing in sub-section (1) applies to the disclosure of information for the purpose of legal proceedings.  Notwithstanding that, the official, acting no doubt on Ministerial instructions, <Col N="2147" /> or possibly on legal advice, refused to disclose the Order, and the prosecution was dismissed.  A case has been stated and will come up for argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; it was on the instructions of the board.  But they relied upon a similar section in the Pigs and Bacon Act.  We have got accustomed to a certain amount of bureaucracy, but surely it does seem to push the thing too far to allow this position to occur, that a producer in the country may be brought up for say, producing or selling too much bacon, which was the offence charged against this particular man.  Proof of the offence is founded upon Orders establishing the production for the country as a whole, and that particular trader's individual fraction of it.  There would be no offence unless those two Orders were proved, and the official produced goes into the witness box and swears that such Orders were made but refuses to produce the Orders and tries to hide behind Section 21.  At any rate, he hides behind some authority and refuses to produce the Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he did not.  The prosecution failed, but a case has been stated and will come on for argument. It did appear, however, that there was a policy to have these officials produced for the purpose of giving evidence but that they could shelter themselves in this way in refusing to produce the documents themselves in the case. Obviously, there might be a discrepancy between the documents and what the official was swearing to.  One would have thought there would have been a provision in the Pigs and Bacon Act to produce the documents concerned, but this official makes the plea that the content of the Order from which, <Col N="2148" /> I think, he purported to quote, precludes him from producing it, and he refused to produce it.  I suggest that that was never intended or that, if it was intended, we should be told what is the exact position so that we may know exactly what is the high-water mark of bureaucratic conduct in the country.  Does the Minister mean this? I am sure that sub-section (3) was primarily intended to permit the production of such information by officials when the board was instituting a prosecution; but it is also possible to read sub-section (3) in this way: that no officer of the board could avail himself of the protection afforded by Section 21 if some action were taken against the board, and I hope that that is intended.</P>

Section 25 says that every board shall keep in a book, to be provided by it for the purpose, minutes of the proceedings at every meeting of such board, and all such minutes shall be signed either at the meeting to which they relate by the chairman of such board, or at the next meeting by such chairman, and when so signed shall be admitted in evidence.  Then, Section 26 goes on to speak of the provision of the seal, and it says that the seal of the board shall be authenticated by the signature of the chairman and that every document purporting to be an instrument made by a board and to be sealed with the seal of such board, <Col N="2149" /> authenticated in the manner provided by the section, shall be received in evidence and shall, until the contrary is shown, be deemed to be such order or instrument without proof of the authority or signature of the person signing the document.  These sections, again, correspond to sections in the Pigs and Bacon Act.  Section 26 is certainly in it, but I am not so sure about Section 25.  However, I think it is.</P>

      <P>I think anybody reading these sections would certainly get the view that what the board was anxious about was to produce as much information as possible that the guardianship of the signature should be authenticated and that the seal in question and the proceedings should not be subject to question.  One would think, getting that view of this matter, that the board were anxious, say, in case of prosecutions for offences, to produce evidence to enable them to say: &ldquo;There is what we did, <i>bona fide,</i> and you cannot question these matters as to whether that is the proper signature or whether that is the seal; but we want to disclose all information and only want to guard ourselves against quibbling of a particular type.&rdquo;  That has not been the practice so far as the Pigs and Bacon Board are concerned, and I hope the Minister will see that there will be a different line of conduct adopted by this board.

      <P>On the section, Sir, I should like to know what was the reason for this period, in relation to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of 15 months, with the enclosed period of 12 months and the 20 days in each of the 12 months.  Why was this period chosen?  First of all, I wonder do I understand it correctly?  I am reading it this way: That if a person can show that he supplied milk on not less than 20 days in any one month amounting to 12 months in a 15 month period, then he is to continue to sell, or at least can get registered in a particular area.  I think that is the purpose of it.  Now, the 15 months period is to be a period for the joint district, whatever it may be.  Can the Minister say when does he believe that, say, the board for the joint district of Dublin and some other area will be established?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, they bear some relation to one another.  Supposing some such circumstance operated such as this: that a man's premises had been closed down by reason, say, of a strike, or because some disease had attacked his herd, or some such reason as that, and that circumstances over which he had no control&mdash;I am talking now of a person who ordinarily <Col N="2153" /> would be enveloped by this exceptional clause&mdash;had made it impossible for him to qualify; in other words, exceptional circumstances put it out of his power to sell on 20 days in any 12 out of these 15 months: would the Minister be disposed to make an exception in such a case and would he be prepared to get more elasticity into that clause to allow him to meet exceptional circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is really a matter of trying to strike some qualification that will not be too harsh and still will not allow too many in.  The natural period that occurs to one is 12 months, but instead of taking 12 months from the time this legislation was first spoken of, we take 15 months from the time the board is set up.  It is more easy to define, and so on.  We then take 12 months out of the 15, and 20 days out of each month, but we might just as well have taken 13 months or 11 months, and 18 days or 22 days out of each month.  We have to strike some sort of qualification that would not be too difficult to fulfil but which, at the same time, would not allow too many to come under the scheme.  I do not know if it would be possible to draft an amendment to cover the case the Deputy has in mind of a person excluded for reasons not under his control.  The wording would be very important, so that people would not get in except those meant to be covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take another way of approaching it.  Suppose groups have been licensed under the 1928 Act and have normally been in the habit of sending their milk into a certain area.  They might find it impossible to comply with this 12 months out of the 15, and the 20 days out of each month equation.  Would the Minister not take into consideration the fact that a person had been registered under the 1924 Act or licensed under the 1928 Act and continue to that person his area of sale, such as it had been when the licence was given?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am possibly dealing <Col N="2154" /> with the situation which may not arise, but I think it is going to arise. Suppose you have a group or individual licensed under the 1928 Act.  That company or individual has been in the habit of selling, when selling at all, say, to Dublin, but that person is outside the home counties area and is not likely to qualify under this 12 months out of 15 provision.  Would the fact that he is licensed under the 1928 Act, envisaging a certain sale area, not be sufficient guarantee for the Minister that he was in the business properly and selling ordinarily to Dublin, even though he might not qualify under this extended clause?  I suggest there is a possibility of a clash between the old circumstances at the time the man got the licence and something that had happened in the meantime which will not allow him to qualify under this 12 months' provision, and that the other matter might be taken into consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to change the fee imposed on the producer to 5/- instead of 10/- which is a flat rate <Col N="2155" /> imposed on producers, retailers and wholesalers.  There may be some difficulty in accepting this amendment but I shall be satisfied if the Minister will look into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy realises that this fee is payable only once.  It is not a yearly fee; it is only payable on registration.  There will be a considerable amount of expense in building up this register and I think a fee of 10/- would not be unreasonable. The Deputy probably has in mind that it is unfair to charge the same registration fee to a producer as we charge to a retailer and wholesaler, but if I were forced to come round to the Deputy's point of view, I think I should have to raise the fee to the retailers and wholesalers and leave the producer's fee as it is, because there would be a considerably less income under the Deputy's amendment than is provided for here.  If there is a loss to the board in the expenses of registering, it will have to be made up afterwards by a levy.  It may, of course, be argued that that would not affect the producer so much because the levy is payable by the retailer or wholesaler where milk passes through their hands.  Therefore, it would be a distinct advantage to the producer to get his registration fee reduced from 10/- to 5/-.  I should like the Deputy not to press this amendment, or at least to give time for further consideration of it.  I am afraid, however, it would be difficult to make any change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point of importance.  I must refer back to an earlier section, Section 24, which enacts:</P>
      <P>... every question arising at a meeting of a board shall be determined by a majority of the votes of the members present and voting on the question, and in the case of an equal division of votes, the chairman of such board shall have a second or casting vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is subject to the provisions of this part of the Act.  Here, at any rate, is one thing which is reserved for the chairman of the board&mdash;the <Col N="2157" /> application for registration.  A person has to be registered if he satisfies the chairman of the board that he is entitled to make the application.  Why should it be the chairman there?  The only other place I have been able to find the chairman interfering is when it comes to the establishment of maximum wholesale prices for milk. There he gets an amazing power because there might be a majority, and a very big majority of the board, in favour of a particular price, but unless the members agree to sink their differences and become unanimous, the chairman is given the power by a later section to make the price.  The chairman in all these cases is to be appointed by the Minister.  I do not see why the chairman should be singled out as the person who has to be satisfied that an application is one which the person seeking registration is entitled to make.  In fact, I am not sure that the whole section might not be cast in another form by which a person who felt entitled to registration would be enabled to get those rights back from the court in case registration was not granted to him, but, as it is, it is undoubtedly intended that the chairman shall be given, at any rate, in the first place, a complete decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not an automatic appeal to the courts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the chairman? I would like to be sure that that is so. Even if so, why should not the first decision be with the board and not with the chairman?  Is there any special reason for this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this matter and gave a good deal of personal thought to it, and it appeared to me that it might be possible if a wholesaler wanted to register that the interests of wholesalers on the board might affect their judgment on the case, and they might say that there was no further wholesaler required. The retailers might have the same reason, and might say that they did not see any necessity for another wholesaler.  If one producer was absent, or if one producer joined <Col N="2158" /> with the wholesalers and the retailers, the application might be rejected.  I think the chairman would give a more judicial decision.  I am not keen on this, but if the Deputy further considers it, I think he will agree that the chairman will be more neutral with regard to all classes on the register. The others are interested from the business point of view, whether as producers, wholesalers or retailers, in putting off new applications, and might be influenced to a certain extent, and for that reason I confined this to the chairman.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is considerable weight in what the Minister said, but suppose the chairman is knocked out, and it comes to a person to satisfy the board this will fall back under Section 24 and the decision of the board will be made by a majority.</P>

Take a situation where business rivalry enters into the matter, that someone is going to be a wholesaler hereafter, and the wholesalers go against him, there will be other members of the board with a say, and the chairman has a casting vote.  It is not absolutely certain that when a wholesaler wants to establish a right to registration that the whole of the representatives of that particular section would go against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the further point that under sub-section (3) it might be left to the chairman and then suddenly switched on to the board. The board may refuse an application on the condition that a person was previously registered and that registration was cancelled, or that a person was previously registered for other premises and that registration was cancelled. That would be a matter for a single person to rule other than the board but by a topsy-turvy process here it is given to the board and a matter that seems proper for discussion by the board is thrown on the chairman.  That is a minor point.  I think the major point is whether or not there is any right to get over a refusal.  Sub-section (1) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2159" /> Subject to the provisions of this section a board shall, on receipt of an application for registration in any register kept by it made, under and in accordance with this Act, by a person who satisfies the chairman of such board that he is entitled to make such application, enter in such register the name and address of the applicant and particulars of the premises specified...</P>
    <P>If the Minister looks at some of the Road Transport Acts he will find that it was made obligatory on the Minister to register certain people and was left optional to register others.  As far as the obligatory people are concerned he had to do it as resort might be had to the courts.  This section does not read that way, to allow a person failing to satisfy the conditions to proceed elsewhere to get the register justified. The hurdle he has to get over is to satisfy the chairman, and if the chairman reported that he was not satisfied I doubt very much if the courts would go further with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point about evidence, the first paragraph simply deems the register to be in proper custody, and deems it to be admissible in evidence without further proof on production from proper custody.  I think that means that such records would be ordinarily produced and would be admitted to be in proper custody if in the custody of the board. Sub-section 2 says:</P>
      <P>Conclusive evidence of any entry in any register kept by a board may be given in any court or any legal proceedings by the production of a copy of such entry purporting to be certified to be a true copy by the secretary of such board, and it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such secretary or that he was in fact such secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2163" /> A similar clause appears in one of the Cereals Acts and has been used in this way, that conclusive evidence has been applied not merely to signature and the fact that the person signed as secretary, but that a copy was a true copy of what it purported to be a copy. Conclusive evidence may be given by the production of a copy of the entry purporting to be certified by the secretary of the board.  Probably the intention was to make the production of what purported to be a certified copy equivalent to the document itself, but what it goes on to say is that it is unnecessary to prove two things&mdash;the signature of the secretary or the fact that he was the secretary.</P>

      <P>I do not think it carries that.  I do not think that the Minister wants the other point, namely, that the board can get an excerpt made from the entry in the register, can get it signed by the secretary and can get that produced in court as conclusive evidence of what is in the entry.  It is surely enough to suggest that there may be no very close questioning of whether the secretary signed that or whether it is the secretary's signature.  Once that has been done, surely if the judge in his discretion thinks it is a desirable thing in a particular case to call for the book in order that he may compare the entry copied with the entry made in the book, he should be entitled to do so.</P>

      <P>On this section I want to call attention to the matter of the board.  Section 24 is subject to the provisions of this Part of the Bill.  Section 24 is in Part II of the Bill and this Section 42 is also in Part II of the Bill.  Sub-section (2) of this section states that if at a meeting of a board held for the purposes of determining prices, the members present, <Col N="2165" /> including the chairman, are not unanimous on the question of determining the prices the chairman shall decide the matter.  Now it would be bad enough if it were that the chairman could be overruled by the unanimity of the members but the unanimity must include the chairman. Why not say plainly that the chairman determines the price because that is what it comes to?  If the chairman makes up his mind on a particular price and if the rest of the members will not fall in with him, then he determines the price.  That is a very drastic power to give to the chairman. It would be bad enough if it were provided, as some people would wish, that it should take unanimity amongst the rest of the members to overrule the chairman but even unanimity amongst them will not do it.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind in giving him such powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This principle was first introduced in the fixing of a price for pigs.  In that case the chairman was excluded.  It was felt that if the factories and the producers in that particular instance were to agree as to price the chairman should be bound by that decision.  If they disagreed, the chairman had to fix the price.  I think it might be altered in this case to the same degree, that if the wholesalers, retailers and producers all agree on a certain price the chairman should be bound by that agreement so that if the section were altered to read &ldquo;excluding the chairman&rdquo; we might have gone some part of the way to meet the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 46, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to sell or offer for sale any milk contained in a bottle which bears the name or trade mark of some other person unless such milk was obtained in such bottle by such first-mentioned person direct from that other person.</P>
      <P>(2)  If any person acts in contravention of this section, such person shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to, in the case of a first offence under this section, a fine not exceeding five pounds or, in the case of a second or any subsequent offence under this section, a fine not exceeding twenty-five pounds.</P>
      <P>Under Section 51 the Minister is empowered to make an Order fixing the maximum price at which milk of a specified kind may be sold.  In any regulations made under this section, it is possible that the Minister might prescribe a price for loose milk. There might be wholesale evasion of that regulation by persons pouring such milk into bottles and selling it as bottled milk.  The amendment provides an effective way of dealing with such a practice.  There have been complaints that the bottles of certain traders are taken up by small retailers, that milk is poured into these bottles by these retailers and is being sold as the produce of the people whose names are on the bottles.  Of course that is illegal in itself but we can get at these people by this amendment also.</P>

      <P>Cornelius Murphy, 7 Commons Road, Cork, claimed an award under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, in respect of the death of his son, David, who, it was stated, had service from 1917 to 1924, and who died on the 26th April, 1927, from pulmonary tuberculosis.  The claim was referred under the terms of Section 8 of the Act to the Military Service Registration Board, who, after investigation of the claim, reported that the deceased, whose service they found to have been confined to 1922, did not contract any disease during his military service.  No award could be made, therefore, to Mr. Murphy under the terms of the Act.  As the certificate of the Registration Board is final and conclusive in accordance with the terms of sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Act, there is no power to review this claim.</P>

      <P>No claim has been received from James Feen, Glannerroe, Crookstown, County Cork, but a claim under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, was received from James Finn, Killowen, Enniskeane, County Cork, in respect of injuries sustained through a fall from a horse while on active service in May, 1921.  The claimant was examined in March, 1934, by the Army Pensions Board, who found that he was suffering from no disability.  The claim was reconsidered on appeal and the applicant was again examined by the Army Pensions Board in November, 1934, and was again found to be suffering from no disability.  The Minister was satisfied, however, that although Mr. Finn was suffering from no disability on the occasion of his medical examinations, he suffered during a substantial period from a disablement due to the injuries he received, and substantially exceeding 20 per cent., and that his case was one of special hardship.  He awarded him, accordingly, a gratuity of £75 under the terms of Section 10 (5) of the Act. In these circumstances no useful purpose could be served by reconsidering the case.</P>
