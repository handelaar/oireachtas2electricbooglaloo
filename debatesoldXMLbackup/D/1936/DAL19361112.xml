    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the long delays which have taken place and are taking place in assessing and paying compensation where orders have been made transferring licences (issued in respect of the road merchandise carrying business) under the Road Transport Act, 1933; and, if so, is he prepared to take steps to expedite the payment of compensation to those persons whose business has been compulsorily acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in some instances delays have occurred in the assessment and payment of compensation owing largely to the difficulties experienced by ex-licensees in the submission of accounts sufficiently detailed to enable a suitable offer to be made by the acquiring company. Where agreement as to the amount of compensation is not arrived at between the parties, provision is made in Section 56 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, for the appointment of an arbitrator.  All notifications of failure to agree received up to the 7th instant have been dealt with by taking the necessary steps for the appointment of arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister expedite the procedure in these cases? The transfer has taken place for almost 12 months in certain cases and no compensation has yet been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question whether he is complaining <Col N="356" /> of delays in negotiating agreements between the acquiring company and the ex-licensees or delays in the giving of awards by arbitrators appointed.  So far as I am aware there has been no delay on the part of arbitrators in determining awards. Some delays have occurred in the negotiating of agreements due to the absence of accounts and similar difficulties but, in such cases, if the ex-licensees desire it, they can proceed forthwith to have an arbitrator appointed on application to my Department.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the number of Orders made to date exempting companies or businesses from the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts; (b) the different classes of manufacture or business carried on by such companies or businesses; (c) the share capital involved in each case, and (d) the conditions, if any, attached to the granting of the exemptions.</P>

      <P>I have no power to make Orders exempting companies or businesses from the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Acts. Possibly what the Deputy desires to know is the number of new manufacture licences granted under these Acts. A register of all such licences is kept at the Office of the Department of Industry and Commerce, Lord Edward Street, Dublin, and is open to inspection by the public, and the Deputy may be able to obtain the information he requires by an inspection of the register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill) Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will define the words &ldquo;batch bread&rdquo; used by him in the recent Order fixing the price of bread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bread (Price) (No. 1) Order, 1936, dated the 2nd November, 1936, defines &ldquo;batch bread&rdquo; as bread which is not baked in containers and is sold or offered for sale in loaves of which the outside is not all crust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill) Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="358" /> if he will state why he has fixed the price of batch bread at 9½d. per 4 lb. loaf instead of 9¾d., seeing that he has fixed 47/- as the standard price of flour, which is equivalent to 6¼d. as the cost of the flour content of the 4 lb. loaf, and seeing that he has adopted 3½d. (the formula of the Food Prices Commission) to cover the costs of other ingredients, labour, fuel and overhead charges and profit, making a total of 9¾d.; and will he alter the recent Order so as to make the price of batch bread 9¾d. undelivered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fixing the maximum retail price of batch bread at 10½d. per 4 lb. loaf delivered and at 10½d. less 1d. in the case of the 4 lb. loaf purchased on a baker's premises, I adopted the general recommendation of the Prices Commission as regards variation in the price of bread following on variations in the price of flour. On the basis of this recommendation the retail price of batch bread per 4 lb. loaf sold on the baker's premises should not exceed 9½d. while the standard price of flour is less than 49/-.  It cannot be stated definitely that 47/1 as the standard price of flour is equivalent to 6¼d. as the cost of the flour content as the yield per sack of 280 lbs. in terms of 4 lb. loaves varies considerably.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to questions Nos. 5 and 6, which hang together to some degree, is the Minister in a position to say now whether his definition of batch bread includes what is known in the trade as turnover loaf?  If that information is not available now would the Minister be good enough to look into the question and let us have the information on some other occasion?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state why unemployment assistance has been withdrawn from Dominick McBride, of Meenaniller, Gweedore, County Donegal, and when his appeal against the raising of the assessment of his means by 2/- will be heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Dominick McBride is not entitled to receive unemployment assistance for the reason that the value of his means determined in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Acts exceeds by more than 1/- the rate of unemployment assistance applicable to his case.  His appeal against the weekly rate of his means was considered and determined by an appeals officer on the 15th July, 1936, and he was duly notified of this determination.</P>

      <P>There is of course an appeals committee which determines questions of interpretation of the law and to which appeals can be made with the permission of the appeals officer, but in a matter of the kind referred to in the question the final appeal lies with the appeals officer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that large areas of land are under water for the past year at Tybroughney, County Kilkenny, and at Clashmore, County Waterford, owing to breaches in the embankments of the rivers Suir and Blackwater, respectively, and if he will have steps taken to have the necessary repairs carried out as the farmers concerned are unable to bear the expense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The River Suir embankments protecting the lands of Tybroughney were breached during storms which occurred last winter.  In connection with the sale proceedings for the holdings on the estate of F.P.W. Power under the Irish Land Act, 1903, a trust fund, at present held by the public trustee and administered by local trustees, was provided to assist the tenant-purchasers in maintaining these embankments.  The interest now to credit of this fund would not be adequate to effect the repairs necessary, but the Land Commission have offered to advance to the tenant-purchasers the balance required to be repaid by means of additional annuities charged on the lands affected.  The Land Commission have not yet been informed whether it is the intention of the tenants to accept this offer.  The Land Commission have sanctioned expenditure for the repair of embankments in the Clashmore area.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I may say that I am well acquainted with the property to which this question refers, and I would <Col N="361" /> venture to suggest that, as a result of this flooding, the lands down there would be useless for years to come. The place concerned is only a couple of miles from my own place.  The whole River Suir flows in there and the place is in a desperate condition.  I think it is ridiculous that farmers should be expected to borrow money for the purpose of effecting these repairs, because the lands would be valueless for a number of years either to a greater or a lesser extent.</P>

      <P>With regard to the Agricultural Wages Bill, Sir, Deputy Dillon and other Deputies made a suggestion that if the labourer were to get a just wage, and if the farmer were to be asked only to pay what he could afford to pay, there would, naturally, be a gap, and Deputy Dillon was the first to suggest that the State might make up the difference by way of a subsidy.  Other Deputies followed Deputy Dillon with the same suggestion.  Now, in the first place, I think that Deputy Dillon has supplied, in this House and in the country also, during his many long speeches, all the arguments that could possibly be used against subsidies.  I do not think he ever loses an opportunity of condemning subsidies of all sorts, and it is hardly necessary for me to reiterate for Deputy Dillon's benefit all those arguments that are against subsidies.  In the second place, however, suppose we were to agree to that: we would have to go somewhat further and we would have to be in a position to raise the money to pay the subsidy, and that is where the difficulty usually arises in this House. <Col N="364" /> When we try to raise money for such a purpose as that, it is generally objected to by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies.  However, let me give the House an idea of the cost.  Deputy Dillon, according to his own speech, would not stand for a wage of anything less than 30/-a week for agricultural labourers.  In fact, I think he said here that that was a very inadequate wage for an agricultural labourer, and seeing that we have very many agricultural labourers&mdash;or at least a substantial number&mdash;working at under 17/- a week, and the average being 21/- a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 21/9.  Every increase of 1/- in agricultural wages by way of subsidy would cost the Exchequer £300,000, so that, by bringing that up from 21/9 to 30/-, even, would cost about £3,000,000.  I do not think that could be done, and I do not think there is any justification for this proposal. Deputy Dillon also spoke about other subsidies.  He spoke about the huge subsidy we are paying on wheat, and I think that anybody who has been following the prices of wheat, both imported and home-grown wheat, will see what little foundation there is for that charge.  As a matter of fact, since our wheat crop came on the market, the millers of our own home-grown wheat have been buying it at a certain price of about 27/6 to the farmer, plus delivery and so on, and they are not paying more than about 2/- a barrel higher than they would pay for imported wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that flour is 10/- a sack dearer here than it is across the water?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about flour.  I am talking about wheat, and I am saying that, apart from whatever the millers may be charging for flour, they are paying for wheat about 2/- a barrel more than for imported wheat, and the flour millers themselves say that the Irish wheat is as good as foreign, and they are therefore prepared&mdash;and would be prepared, I take it, under ordinary circumstances&mdash;to pay as much for Irish <Col N="365" /> wheat as for foreign wheat.  It will be seen, therefore, that the whole subsidy which we heard so much about here yesterday amounts at the very best to about 2/- a barrel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may be connected, but how can the Deputy talk about a subsidy?  If the flour millers say&mdash; which I again repeat Deputy Dillon will not agree with&mdash;that the Irish wheat is as good as foreign wheat, and that they are paying only 2/- a barrel more for that than they have to pay for foreign wheat, there can be no great subsidy on it.  What they pay for flour is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What becomes of the 10/- we are paying on flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had gone into that matter, I would probably have found that the Deputy is just as wrong on that as he is in his other statements; he is usually wrong.  He talked about beet and he talked about coolie labour &mdash;not the Cooley in County Louth, of course, but the coolie labour that is known internationally.  He talked about the horrible wages paid by the farmer in the cultivation of beet in this country.  We have the position here that our own farmers are getting as good a price for their wheat and beet as the farmers in England.  There is no economic war in England; perhaps I should rather put it this way, that the English farmer is getting a better price for his goods than the Irish farmer would get if there were no economic war.  Yet they go on growing beet and wheat, and increasing their acreage under those crops, at the price we are giving to our farmers.  They are better off than our farmers would be if there were no economic war; they must be well off, if we are to believe all we hear on the other side. They are prepared to increase their acreage of beet and wheat even though the price is no better than ours. <Col N="366" /> That shows the weight which we can place on any statement made by Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Davin asked me some questions about this Bill. He asked me, first of all, what I meant when I said that the farmers need have no apprehension about this Bill.  For some reason or other he thought that I was in a position to assure the farmers that they would not have to pay a very high wage.  What I meant&mdash;I said it as a matter of fact, I think, in the Second Reading speech&mdash;was that I was quite sure that the members of the board would have a sense of reality; that they would do justice to the labourer and at the same time not drive the farmer into bankruptcy, being sensible men; and I am quite sure that those two things are compatible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We ought to smile to please the Deputy.  I was asked also about the wages on forestry work. There has been a standard rule governing that matter, which was decided when Deputy Cosgrave's Government was in power, and the wages of foresters bear a certain relation to the agricultural wages of the district.  If we fix an agricultural wage under this Bill, it will naturally have an influence on forestry wages, wages on public works, and other things which are calculated on the agricultural wage.  In those cases there is paid a somewhat higher figure than the agricultural wage prevalent in the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also asked if the members of the committees and of the board would be paid out-of-pocket expenses. Yes; they will be paid out-of-pocket expenses.  I was asked, too, when the Act might come into operation.  I <Col N="367" /> should think that when this Bill had passed through the Dáil it would probably take about four months before it could come into operation.  There would, first of all, be the task of getting those committees and the board formed, and, from the time they are formed, it will take two months before the Order can become operative. I might say, for Deputy Brennan's information, that it will be necessary to go to the Civil Service Commissioners to get some of the staff; Deputy Brennan may be assured, therefore, that it will not be Fianna Fáil organisers who will be appointed to those posts.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Davin whether we meant to provide for labourers living in.  They are provided for under Section 17 (3).  When the board is fixing the wage, they can also fix a certain value on whatever the labourer may be getting in the line of food, lodging or anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>If a workman meets with an accident, and he is paid 12/-a week with board and lodging, or he is getting board and no lodging, the insurance companies fix the rate that will cover the whole thing.  Will this new board have any regard to this arrangement when they are compiling the value of a man's board and lodging?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the board will have regard to that.  On the other hand the insurance company will have to have regard to the fixed wage. That is how it goes.  I was asked how I proposed to select those committees. As I explained, that is a very difficult task.  There are no such organisations which can be claimed to be truly representative of either the farmers or the agricultural labourers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the beet growers, for instance, are representative of agriculture.  They are representative of the beet growers, who compose about 10 per cent. of the agricultural population.  The I.A.O.S., again, represents a certain number of farmers.  I do not know what the number might be in that case, but at any rate it is only a minority of the farmers.  The best method which I have been able to think of so far is to ask the county committees of agriculture to suggest names for a panel from which those committees and the board can be formed.  The committees will probably be fair enough as far as the farmer representatives are concerned, but I am not so sure that they will represent the agricultural labourers.  A number of those committees are formed entirely of farmers; at least I should say there are no agricultural labourers on them, although there may be others besides farmers.  On some of the committees, of course, there are representatives of agricultural labourers.  If the committees would agree to suggest the names of people who would be representative of the agricultural labourers those names would certainly be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of any organisation which can be said truly to represent the agricultural labourers.  In fact, I suppose, as Deputy Curran has just suggested, the Parties here in the Dáil are the only Parties which do represent them in any way.  If T.D.s would suggest the names, or if, better still, all the T.D.s of all Parties in the country were to recommend certain names, it would carry greater weight. That is all I can suggest at the <Col N="369" /> moment.  If any Deputy or anybody else can suggest to me a better way of getting representatives of farmers or agricultural labourers, I will be very glad to receive such a suggestion. I think Deputy Bennett, amongst others, said that were it not for the economic war there would be no great difficulty about paying a better wage to agricultural labourers.  I think that Deputies who have looked into the figures of wages paid to agricultural labourers would not have argued in that way.  Agricultural wages were coming down gradually for about three years before 1932.  As a matter of fact the figure taken in July, 1932, was 23/6.  Here are some figures as to the wages of those three years: In 1930 the wages were 24/6 a week, in 1931 these had come down to 24/3, and in 1932 the figure was 23/6.  I do not know if the economic war had any time to make any change in the wages before July, 1932.  But the fact is, at any rate, that wages were coming down before the start of the economic war, and since 1932 they have only come down by 2/6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, there could have been a good case made at that time for the fixing of the wages considering that agricultural labourers were in some cases then getting less than 17/- a week.  I know there are more labourers getting less than 17/- a week now, but at that time some of them were getting less than 17/-.  If Deputy Dillon had been here, I am sure if his attention had been drawn to it, he would have been as <Col N="370" /> eloquent as he is now in talking about the injustice of that state of things. At that time, when the farmers were well-off and when they could well afford to pay 30/- a week to the labourers, you had some of them actually paying less than 17/- a week. Yet the members of the then Government appear to have taken no notice of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, eternity.  This Bill, from the Opposition point of view, is like every Bill I brought before this House.  I do not think I ever brought in any Bill that I was not told that the Bill was due to the economic war. Deputies opposite have got out of the way of thinking things out because it is so easy for them to say: &ldquo;Only for the economic war we would be all right.&rdquo;  If they wanted to be helpful and to see that something should be done they might leave the economic war aside and not be so keen on talking politics and so refrain from doing stupid things at the expense of the agricultural labourers.  At any rate, there are now men earning less than 17/- a week and there is a necessity for this legislation.  Deputy Holohan raised the point that it will be difficult to fix a minimum wage because you have, first of all, the class under 17 years of age.  Even if you could provide for that class there is the case of good ploughmen and good cattlemen who are much more valuable to the farmer than the ordinary agricultural labourer.  The board have power to define classes, and it is possible they may define a class between 18 and 19 years of age and fix a different wage from that which they would fix for men over 19.  They may possibly fix a class for boys where the wage would be different from that fixed for the men. With regard to ploughmen and cattlemen, <Col N="371" /> they may also fix a special minimum wage for ploughmen and cattlemen, a wage that may possibly lead to difficulties.  But, remember, we have always this to fall back upon that it is only the minimum wage.  The board will fix a minimum wage and every labourer, no matter what his abilities are, will be considered to be worth at least that.  But skilled ploughmen and cattlemen will get more than the minimum wage.  No matter how many classes they define there will always be a difficulty with certain men within each class.  Some men will be better than others and they will, I presume, get a little more than the minimum wage.  It is also possible that within any class there will be men not worth the minimum wage.  It may be that these men will not get employment, but if the work has to be done they will be called upon.  Deputy Corry made a contribution to the debate in which he said that it does not matter how much the board fixes.  He said if the board fixes 50/- a week for agricultural labourers that as against that the farmers will get better prices for their beet and wheat.  There are only 30,000 beet growers in the country.  I do not know how many wheat-growers there are but I do know that the wheat-growers are a minority of the farmers. While we can fix a high price for beet and wheat because we consume them at home, we cannot fix the price in the case of butter and bacon for there we are depending on world prices.  We have no influence on raising prices abroad unless we pay huge sums as bounties on our exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to answer that.  There could be a very considerable rise in wages for certain groups and still the price of wheat would remain as it is.  That, however, is a question to be considered later. We could, as Deputy Corry says, get a better price for all these things if we were to get rid of the export <Col N="372" /> market entirely.  But that would mean putting about 31.8 per cent. of our agricultural land out of production, because 31.8 per cent. of our agricultural produce is exported.  That would mean also putting 31.8 per cent. of our agricultural population out of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry has done fairly well on the platform.  Deputy Corry, Deputy Coburn and others spoke of bringing the agricultural wage up to the level of the wage paid to the town workers.  There is no use in talking in that way, because in this matter we must take all the facts into consideration.  We want to make the agricultural labourer as well-off as the town labourer.  But that does not mean bringing his wage up to the level of the town labourer.  We must take into consideration the rent the labourer pays in the town as against the country.  We must take the price of fuel into consideration.  The town labourer has to purchase coal and turf at a fairly high cost.  The agricultural labourer can provide fuel more cheaply.  Deputies know that milk and vegetables are much cheaper in the country.  That fact, too, must be taken into consideration by the board.</P>
      <P>The board, having considered the problem of putting the agricultural labourer into as good a position as the town labourer, will, of course, give due weight to the matters I have just mentioned, and when they have done that they will have done good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> Deputy Finlay said that our agricultural labourers were the worst paid on the face of the earth.  There is no use in exaggerating conditions.  We can reproach ourselves with many things but there is no use in making things out worse than they are.  The fact is that in most European countries a lower wage is paid to agricultural labourers than the wage paid in the Saorstát.  I am not touching on the wages paid in Asia and other countries but I know that most European countries pay a lower wage to agricultural labourers than the wage paid here.  There is a number of European countries in which a better wage is paid, but the number that pays a better wage than we do is not as high as the number that pays a lesser wage.</P>

      <P>Most of the Scandinavian countries.  Deputy J. P. Kelly asked for information about the board and whether the two months waiting period was for each committee.  It is the concurrent two months.  The Deputy also asked what standard would be prescribed for agricultural wages.  All I can say is that it is a matter for the board to decide what the standard should be.  Deputy Keyes asked about the position of domestic servants.  It is laid down very definitely that any person who does domestic service as part of the ordinary work will be excluded from the Act.  If a girl does a certain amount of domestic work in the house, such as looking after fires or getting meals, and if she also does agricultural work, such as milking cows or feeding pigs, she does not come under the Act. That is not a departure from the existing legislation.  The 1917 Act which applied here, and which is still in operation in Great Britain, has the same provision and I do not think there is any reason why we should depart from that.  Deputy Brennan said this was a milk-and-water measure.  I do not know what he meant.  The Deputy often makes remarks like that about measures introduced here.  He condemns them but he does not tell us why.  He did not go so far as to point out how, if he were framing the Bill, he would make it otherwise than a milk-and-water measure.  I do not know in what way it is a milk-and-water measure.  The 1917 Act which is in operation in Great Britain is much the same as this.  I will point out where the difference is later.  I do not know how Deputy Brennan in his wisdom would frame a Bill to deal with this question and not have it a <Col N="375" /> milk-and-water one.  There is nothing very positive in such criticism.  It is negative criticism, as the Deputy has not suggested how it could be improved.  He also said that this measure was autocratic compared with the British Act.  What is the difference between the two?  Deputy Brennan said this was autocracy because if there was disagreement on the board the chairman decides.  In the British Act a majority decides.  There are four Labour representatives and four farmer representatives and if they do not agree the chairman decides.  In England if four voted one way and four another way whatever side the chairman voted with decided the matter. That is the difference between autocracy and democracy.</P>

      <P>In the alternative, if the chairman says: &ldquo;I have heard your views and here is my decision,&rdquo; that is autocracy but, if he says that he will vote with one group of four that is the essence of democracy, according to Deputy Brennan.  Deputy Cosgrave says that <Col N="376" /> there might be one reasonable farmer who would vote with the labour people, and in that case under the British Act the chairman would have to agree. Under this Bill he will not have to agree.  There is the difference.</P>

      <P>Quite fair criticism. After all, I hold this is the easiest way to work it and to get the same results. Deputy Brennan said that this was like other Bills, and that we were going to have more inspectors and more Fianna Fáil organisers.  I remember quoting an Irish proverb here before: &ldquo;Sás a dhéanta a chíonadh air,&rdquo; which means that the person who would think of that is the very person who would do it himself, if he got the chance.  Deputy MacDermot said he did not think the results hoped for by me could be achieved under this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  Deputy McGilligan, who, I suppose, knows more about law than he does about <Col N="377" /> agriculture or agricultural economics, started by saying that the chairman would have to decide in all cases, because if there was disagreement on the board, he said, the chairman would decide by voting against all.  If Deputy McGilligan had read the Bill, I do not think it would take any great training in law to see that that is an absolutely wrong interpretation, because it is laid down very definitely in Section 13 (b) (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>In case all such ordinary members pass unanimously a resolution in favour of the making of such order in terms specified in such resolution, such order shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have been duly made in such terms by the board at such meeting...</P>

He also talked about the farmers of Wexford. I deprecated last night the note that Deputy McGilligan brought into the debate.  He might very well have left these things alone, because the farmers of Wexford, whether they got part of the £11,000,000 or not, were not going to rely on Deputy McGilligan's promises at any rate, whatever promises he might make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not very clear, and we want to make a distinction between the ordinary members representing parties and the neutral members.  Deputy McGilligan also went on to speak of the wages that had been paid under this Fianna Fáil Government.  I had an opportunity of looking up the figures since.  I find that the average wage that was paid in 1936 to a labourer living in, a man who got his board and lodging, and assuming that he was working 56 hours a week, which is the usual time for agricultural labourers, that he would have been getting under this Fianna Fáil Government 2.15d. per hour.  Deputy McGilligan said the figure was 2d. per hour.  He was not very far wrong.  We would all be inclined to agree with him that it is a scandalous wage for any man to try to live on.  But what I want to draw attention to is this, that in 1931, under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, when people were not being treated as slaves or as coolies, when people were very much better off and when we had the great British market, the farmers at that time were paying their labourers 2.4d. per hour.  So that for a farthing an hour we were told that Fianna Fáil had reduced the lot of the agricultural labourer to a most pitiable condition and so on.  I do not think I could be capable of using the vituperation and venom in my language that Deputy McGilligan used when he spent half an hour telling us the state to which we had brought the country by bringing the wages of agricultural labourers down from 2.4d. per hour, which was the rate in Deputy Cosgrave's time, to 2.15d. at present.  There is no great crime in that.  What I mean is, that if it were criminal to do that, then Deputy Cosgrave was at least <Col N="379" /> guilty of a misdemeanour in leaving the rate at 2.4d. per hour.  I think I can claim that even if the agricultural labourers have had their wages reduced they have at least got compensatory advantages under this Government in the way of unemployment assistance and other benefits.  They have got increased benefits under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, under the Old Age Pensions Act, and under many other Acts passed by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>But the good labouring man that the Minister spoke of yesterday did not get any of these benefits.  For instance, he did not get anything under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may never get anything under that Act, but he may look forward to the Old Age Pensions Act and to unemployment assistance during an idle period.  I do not know why Deputy McGilligan should attack us so bitterly, seeing that if wages have come down a little we have balanced that up by all those other benefits.  If I were capable of making an attack in the same language as Deputy McGilligan used, I think I would be justified in attacking the people opposite for not doing some of these things five or six years ago. Deputy McGilligan spoke of the output for 1934.  He spoke from the same brief as Deputy Dillon and made the same mistakes, but I must admit that Deputy McGilligan used the brief a little bit more intelligently than Deputy Dillon.  It takes a great deal from the weight of the Deputy's case when we know that we who are said to be responsible for bringing the out put down to £40,000,000 in 1934 are also responsible for having brought it up by £10,000,000.  After all, a Government that can bring up the farmers' income by £5,000,000 a year in two years is not to be despised.</P>

It appears at any rate that my claim is not being contested: that this Government was responsible for increasing the income of our farmers by £10,000,000 in the two years from 1934 to 1936.  In view of that, I do not think that we deserve to be attacked as Deputy McGilligan attacked us last night.  We deserve, in fact, to be congratulated for bringing the farmers back so rapidly to a position of prosperity, and basing that prosperity on such a sound foundation that no outside country can attack us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to make certain amendments in the Vocational Education Act of 1930, amendments which have been found to be necessary in connection with the administration of that Act.  The remedying of these defects is a matter of some urgency, and, accordingly, I have brought this Bill before the Dáil to remedy the defects in question.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that a vocational education committee may, with the consent of the Minister for Education, sell or let any land which is vested in such committee.  Under Section 28 of the Principal Act, the committee has power to acquire land.  It has become apparent that it will be necessary that committees also should have power to sell or let land and the section provides that they will have this power in future.  It will be observed that the amendment under Section 2 is to be retrospective as from the passing of the original Act in 1930.  The reason is that in the interval there have been certain temporary lettings and, in fact, I think a sale has been put through by at least one vocational education committee, and the retrospective clause becomes necessary therefore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 makes provision for a certain change in the wording of Section 43 of the Principal Act.  In order to explain the meaning of the change and the object which it has in view, I think I should explain briefly the position with regard to the various schemes of vocational education committees. Under the 1930 Act, a vocational education committee must make before 15th January each year a demand on the local authority, whether it be urban, borough, or county council, as the case may be, for a contribution from the rates.  The limits of this local contribution are determined by the amount <Col N="382" /> of a rate levied on the valuation of the local area in question, as set out in the Principal Act.  Hitherto, the amounts of these local contributions have been based on the valuation figures for the incoming financial year.  As Deputies will see if they refer to the original Act, the phrase is &ldquo;commencement of the financial year,&rdquo; but in actual fact the valuation figures for the incoming financial year are not known about the 15th January, which is the date upon which the Minister's certificate permitting the local vocational education committee to make its demand upon the local authority is issued.  The valuation figures for the incoming financial year are not known until about six weeks after.  It becomes necessary, therefore, to alter the original provision, which spoke of the valuation figures at the beginning of the incoming financial year, and to substitute therefor the valuation figures for the preceding financial year.  We do not know the valuation figure at the 15th January, and by making this change we avoid error and we also place the vocational education committees in a better position to know what their income is likely to be; to know that accurately at the time they are making out their annual estimates for the next year's work.  The substance then of that section is simply that, instead of taking the valuation figures for the incoming financial year as the basis for the local contribution under the 1930 Act, we are satisfied in future to take the valuation figures for the preceding year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The preceding year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the year preceding the year in which the rate is to be levied.  For example, on January 15th next, instead of purporting to take the valuation figure for the local financial year beginning, I think, the 1st April, 1937, we shall take the valuation figures for the present year.  I do not think that this section involves any appreciable change in the finances of the local vocational education schemes. There may be a slight increase in the State grants as a result of the change, but they are not of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 makes provision for the <Col N="383" /> application in future to membership of a vocational education committee of the disqualifications which appertain to membership of local authorities in general under the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898.  There is a certain exemption from these disqualifications laid down in the Principal Act and now reaffirmed, but the application of the Schedule of Disqualifications itself was, by some oversight, omitted from the original Act and the effect of Section 4 is to apply definitely these statutory disqualifications to membership of vocational education committees in the same way as they apply to other local authorities.  These disqualifications, as Deputies know, refer to infancy, alienage, receipt of union relief, conviction for crime, contractual relationship, and bankruptcy.  Under any of these headings a person may be disqualified from being a member of a vocational education committee, as applies to other local authorities at the present time.  The only exemption is in respect of the case of persons or partners of persons who themselves receive continuation or vocational education.  That is not considered as a benefit or advantage which would disqualify them.</P>
    <P>These are the three points in the Bill.  They are not of great importance, nor do I think that they introduce any new principle which the House need have any serious anxiety about.  The Bill has been introduced to remedy certain defects which have been found in the vocational education system and which it is, as I have said, a matter of urgency that we should remove now.</P>

      <P>I should like just to remark, in connection with this Bill, that I have received a circular letter from the vocational education committee in Clonmel.  They seem to have a grievance in connection with it.  I might say that I am not an authority on vocational education matters, not being a member of the committee or anything else.  I believe, however, that certain promises or agreements, or some such things, were made by the Department of Education.  In particular, <Col N="384" /> I think it was agreed that they should purchase some hall or school in the village of Cappawhite.  For some reason or another, the Department of Education, although I understand they gave sanction in the first instance, are not now agreeable to go on with some of these commitments.  I want to bring the matter under the attention of the Minister because, so far as I understand the circular letter, which I have not by me now, a deputation is to wait on the Minister to-morrow or some time in the near future in connection with this grievance.  As I say, I am not a great authority on these matters, but when this Bill came up I thought I would just mention it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if any provision has been made in this Bill to enable vocational education committees to sell a house or other buildings existing on lands held by them.  Meath Vocational Committee recently purchased houses and other buildings, with land, for the purpose of establishing vocational schools with a rural bias.  It transpires that, after the immediate needs of the Vocational Committee are satisfied, so far as the Committee can foresee, there will be some buildings which will not be required for school purposes.  I should be glad if the Minister would state whether or not the Committee will have power under this Bill to dispose of these houses.  I should also like to know if the Vocational Committee will have power to dispose of a small portion of land on such holdings because, in this particular case, Meath Board of Health are anxious to erect new houses for workmen in that area.</P>

It may happen that some of these employer members will be required to supply goods to the committee and will be put in contractual relationship with that body.  It would be unfortunate if, by reason of having sold, say, £100 worth of machinery to the committee, a member had to resign.  I do not know whether the Minister has looked into that question or not, but I think he should.</P>

      <P>I do not think that we could provide for the exemption of a particular class of contractual relationship, as it is called.  The Deputy himself will recongnise, from his experience of local government administration, that it would be very difficult to arrange that a person who had a contract with a local authority should continue to be a member of that local authority.  No case of the kind mentioned has come to my notice, but I think that it would be impossible to arrange for this exemption.</P>

      <P>I move that this Bill be read a Second Time.  It is a minor Bill and deals only with matters of administration.  When the Saorstát was established, the Registrar of Friendly Societies and all the functions of Government Departments relating to the Registry of Friendly Societies were transferred to the Department of Finance and that was confirmed by the Ministers and Secretaries Act, which was passed in 1924.  In 1926, an Order in Council was made transferring the Registrar of Friendly Societies and the business of his office to the Department of Industry and Commerce but a number of functions under various statutes relating to the Registrar of Friendly Societies remained with the Department of Finance.  It is considered more desirable, from the point of view of effective administration, that these functions should attach to the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Registrar of Friendly Societies being on the staff of that Department.  The sole purpose of the Bill is to provide for the transfer from the Department of Finance to the Department of Industry and Commerce of these powers and functions.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister take this opportunity to define the powers of this individual in connection with societies?  For instance, would it be his duty to see that the funds of a society were kept intact, so as to be available to members, if needed?  I have in mind a large society in the country to which members have been paying in for years.  Some of the funds went wrong at head office and the branches have been held responsible, with the result that large demands are being made upon them.  These demands, if met, will mean that these branches will not be in a position to fulfil their obligations to the members who have been contributing for a number of years.  Would it be the duty of this gentleman to see that steps were taken to secure that the benefits would be there, if called upon?  The case I am fighting is an interesting and important one.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say much in regard to the nature of this Bill.  It is a Bill which it is customary to introduce at the end of the year and it proposes to continue for the coming year the measures which are set forth in the schedule.  I may say that, with four exceptions, the statutes to be continued are the same as those which appeared in Parts 1 and 2 of the Schedule of the Expiring Laws Act of last year.  The changes which have been made relate to the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, further amended by the Labourers Act of 1936 and, accordingly, this latter Act has been added to the list of Acts amending the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883.  The full list of those Acts is set out in column 4 of Part I of the schedule.</P>
      <P>The Harbours, Docks and Piers (Temporary Increase of Charges) Act of 1920 is omitted from the Bill.  This Act is repealed by Section 1 of an Act passed this year, save to the extent mentioned in that section and, in so far as it remains in force, it has been made permanent.  Section 2 of the Statutory Undertakings Act and the second schedule to that Act have been repealed by the Act which affected the Act of 1920 and the statement in the third column of Part 2 of the schedule in the draft Bill in relation to the Statutory Undertakings Act has been amended accordingly. The Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, has been added to Part 2 of the schedule of the Bill.  It is intended, pending the introduction of the permanent legislation which has been drafted to deal with the poor law position generally, to include that Act within the ambit of the present Expiring Laws Bill.  As soon as the Courts of Justice Bill, now before the Oireachtas, becomes law, it will render the further annual renewal of the Courts of Justice Act of 1929 unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Measure is in the strict sense of the term an omnibus one and if there are any points upon which the House <Col N="389" /> would require further information, if Deputies will mention them now in the course of the discussion on this stage of the Bill we can arrange that the Ministers concerned will be present on the committee Stage to give any further explanations that may be required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reasonable attitude adopted by the Minister. I quite understand it may be more convenient on the Committee Stage to have specified Ministers present. As a matter of fact, this Bill in its present form principally concerns the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is responsible for most of the Bills annually renewed. I think paragraph 7 in the schedule, which is intended to continue the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act of 1923, provides a proper occasion for inquiring of the Minister for Local Government when he is of opinion the necessity for that Act will cease.  That Act was originally passed for the purpose of restricting landlords from taking advantage of tenants who found themselves in a difficulty as a result of shortage of houses.</P>
      <P>In rural Ireland during the last few years very considerable work has been done in providing housing for the working classes, but in the City of Dublin, the City of Cork, the City of Limerick and the other big centres of population it is painfully evident to anybody interested in housing that the problem of the housing shortage, which this Act was designed to remedy in 1923, is becoming more acute instead of gradually approaching solution.  It would be very easy for the Opposition here to avail of such an occasion as this to hold up the Government to ridicule and to associate themselves with what I consider to be an entirely dishonest campaign that is at present being conducted in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I believe that the <i>Irish Press</i> is at present exploiting the difficulties of the Dublin poor for the purpose of offsetting the publicity secured by the <i>Irish Independent</i> in connection with the Christian Front.</P>

The necessity exists purely because of a housing shortage, and I want to suggest that the Government should seek the co-operation of those honestly interested in this problem to make an end to that housing shortage. I want to direct the Government's attention to the fact that I have no doubt that if they were in our position they would eagerly seize this opportunity to make as much political capital out of this situation as they could.  I do not think it is an honest or a desirable course to pursue.  Every practical person who has given attention to this slum problem knows the immense difficulties surrounding it. Every practical person knows the immense amount of political capital that can be made by exploiting the sufferings of the poor for political ends.</P>

      <P>Let us leave that aspect out of the discussion at the moment. This is a grave matter, and I will say to the Government now that the time has come for a very explicit statement to be made by the Minister for Finance as well as the Minister for Local Government as to what the real reasons are for the apparently unsatisfactory progress that has been made by housing authorities, not only in Dublin but in other cities as well. Further, I take this opportunity of offering the Government any co-operation that it is in our power to give towards remedying the housing shortage which this Rent Restrictions Act was designed to palliate.  I regard it as a very great danger to social order and to the institutions which are established in this country that a scandal of this kind should continue.  I believe the Dublin Corporation is doing all that any public body could do to deal with the problem with which they are confronted. I do not think the Government are doing all they could in the matter of explaining to the public what the real difficulties are.</P>

      <P>May I make a submission, Sir?  The Government asks us to re-enact the Rent Restrictions Act and to do so on the representation that there is an acute housing shortage and <Col N="392" /> that speculation must be prohibited. Is it not open to me to reply that the best remedy for that shortage is not to re-enact this Act, but to remedy the shortage?  If you have failed to remedy that shortage, I am entitled to call you to account, when, as a substitute for remedying that shortage, you ask us to pass the Rent Restrictions Act for another year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not going to challenge your ruling, Sir, but it does seem to me to be extremely difficult to discuss the question of whether we should pass the Rent Restrictions Act unless I am allowed to review the problem which the Act is designed to remedy.  Surely if this Act were standing alone, I would be entitled to suggest to the Government that their duty was to remedy the shortage rather than to restrict rents?  I want to make that argument now, and I am making the point that I believe the failure to remedy the shortage which is the <i>prima facie</i> justification for this Act is a failure which nobody can remedy but the Government themselves, and that whatever the difficulties are that are impeding the Government should be communicated in the fullest way to the public, lest unscrupulous persons should misrepresent those difficulties with a view to suggesting that there was some dark conspiracy somewhere to keep the people in the slums, and that the Oireachtas of this State was coldly indifferent to the trials under which these people are living.  I think it is a very necessary thing, although probably politically advantageous to nobody except those on the Government Benches, to let it be known in the country that all sides of this House, Government and Opposition, are equally anxious to take all practicable steps expeditiously to make an end of the slum problem in this and every other city in the country, and that the only reason that we allow the Rent Restrictions Act to be continued is because, acting with all the energy <Col N="393" /> available to us, we cannot abate the problem sufficiently quickly to justify the abandoning of this Act at present. I particularly want the question of the housing of city populations lifted out of the sphere of controversial politics.</P>

It should be made clear to all that it is a joint responsibility to make an end of these difficulties and a joint responsibility which all parties and all interests in the country are equally ready to share.  I think the Minister for finance, without waiting for the intervention of the Minister for Local Government, might give us some very useful information on the financial aspects of this problem on this occasion &mdash;and I suggest here that he is asking that this Act should be re-enacted because of financial difficulties of such a character as to make it impossible to deal with the problem as expeditiously as he otherwise would&mdash;and explain that if the Dublin Corporation is moving slowly it is because the difficulties with which it is confronted are for the time being very hard to surmount.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not related the Rent Restrictions Act to the present-day housing problem. The Rent Restrictions Act deals with a certain type of house, but not, in the opinion of the Chair, with the building of new houses, or the solution of the slum problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, most clearly.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would be wise to withdraw from the housing question, because he knows very little about it.  The Rent Restrictions Act was originally designed to prevent speculation in pre-war houses because there were no post-war houses and there were three potential tenants for every pre-war house.  The remedy was to build post-war houses for the tenants, and when there were more houses than tenants there would be no necessity for artificial restriction of rents.  That was the purpose of the Act.  It was said when the Bill first passed that it would only be enforced until such time as there were enough houses to go round and should then cease to exist.  I want the Minister for Finance to tell us now if the reason which Deputy Tom Kelly gives for the necessity for this Act is the true reason.  Is it purely a financial question, and, if it is, what suggestions has he got to make to the local authorities concerned for the solution of that part of their problem?  I think he can tell <Col N="395" /> us that now, and I think the Minister for Local Government should charge himself with the duty of making a full statement on the question of the housing shortage on the Committee Stage of this Bill when we come to deal with the Schedule.  I think it will serve to get this problem into proper perspective and make an end definitely to any attempt by anybody to make capital of one kind or another out of the difficulties under which the community as a whole finds itself at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it redounds to the credit of the Government that they are re-enacting this Act, and I take a different view entirely from that expressed by Deputy Dillon as to the necessity for it.  So far as we can remember, this Act was brought into operation during the days of the British in order to prevent profiteering in rent.  The Deputy speaks of the housing shortage as if there are going to be sufficient houses built to replace all the houses that existed pre-war. That is the only inference that can be drawn from his speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that any other inference can be drawn.  I suggest to Deputy Dillon, and to the House, that even if there were sufficient houses to house the people, there would still be a necessity for the Rent Restrictions Act to prevent landlords from profiteering on poor tenants.  As I have said, it redounds to the credit of the Government that they should re-enact this measure.  I should like also to ask when it is proposed to take steps to have the Labourers Act, which enables cottage tenants to purchase their homes, put into operation. This Act has been talked of for a considerable time and it has been passed now for some months, but no intimation has yet been received by the county boards of health in relation to what the intentions of the Government are in connection with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter on which I should like to have some information is the Combined Purchasing Act.  As far as one can ascertain it has been the <Col N="396" /> means of saving a good deal of money for local authorities, but what I am greatly afraid of is that the samples submitted to local authorities and the goods supplied afterwards are two entirely different things.  I think the Minister might take steps to secure that the goods supplied are of as high a standard as the samples submitted.  I have had personal experience of cases where the goods supplied were of an entirely different quality from the samples supplied originally.  I should like also to know when we may expect a report from the tribunal which has been set up to consider the relations between landlord and tenant.  For a number of years here, when Fianna Fáil was in opposition, they endeavoured themselves to secure that a Town Tenants Bill would be introduced in this House. For the last three or four years they have had an opportunity of introducing such a Bill but we seem to be as far away from it as ever.  There is an urgent necessity for a Town Tenants Bill to regulate the relations between landlord and tenant and I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that he should ask his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to endeavour to get the tribunal to send in its report as early as possible.</P>

However, the cold, sculptured hypocrisy of it was so very apparent to everybody that it is not necessary for me to deal with it beyond just saying that any serious attempt which has been made to deal with the housing problem has been made by the present Government.  If the Deputy, who was so concerned with this question of housing, had taken trouble to refer to the Schedule, he would have seen a reference there to the Labourers <Col N="397" /> (Ireland) Act of 1883, and he would have known, if he knew anything about the problem, that a great part of the work which is at present going on in Ireland in the rehousing of the working classes is carried out under two Acts passed by the Oireachtas, amending the Labourers (Ireland) Act, of 1883.  These Acts are No. 19 of 1932, the first Housing Act which really made a serious attack on the housing problem, and No. 24 of 1936 which was passed this year.  Under these Acts, as I pointed out to the Dáil in my Budget statement, this Government has made itself responsible, one way or another, for contributing practically £6,000,000 towards a solution of the slum problem.  They have contributed to the cost of house building in this State during the past three years no less a sum than £6,000,000. What has been done in the past three years stands remote and far above all comparison with what was done during the preceding ten years.  We are not here to try to make political capital out of that fact but we are not here either to permit ourselves, or to permit all that this Government has done for housing to be misrepresented and traduced by a gentleman like Deputy Dillon.  If he were speaking for a Party that had an honourable or a creditable record in regard to this problem behind it, one could listen to him with patience and one might extend some forbearance to his uncontrollable desire to talk upon all occasions upon subjects about which he knows nothing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points raised by Deputy Corish, that in relation to the Act enabling local authorities to devise and submit schemes for the purchase <Col N="398" /> of labourers' cottages is a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and I shall draw that Minister's attention to the Deputy's remarks in regard to it and also to his remarks, and the criticism which he passed, in regard to the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act.  I may say that a measure to give permanent effect to the principle of that Act is under consideration, and I have no doubt that when it comes before the Dáil any suggestions for an improvement of the existing position will be very sympathetically considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The question of the Tribunal which has been appointed to inquire into the relations at present existing between certain classes of landlords and tenants is a matter for the Minister for Justice.  I am not in a position to say how far that Tribunal has gone to complete its labours.  I know, and I am sure the Deputy has noticed from reports in the Press, that it has been sitting regularly and frequently, and that a great deal of very valuable evidence had already been submitted to it.  I share with the Deputy, and the Government does also, the desire to receive an early report from the Tribunal, and I have no doubt that the Minister for Justice is doing everything towards that end.</P>

      <P>Sir, I asked the Minister what I conceived to be a civil question.  A responsible Deputy of this House has stated in the public Press that one of the principal difficulties in remedying the housing shortage is of a purely financial character and that, without a guarantee from the Government, it is impossible to make adequate progress.  I asked the Minister would he be good enough, in view of that, to let us hear the Government's view-point on that matter. Instead of answering my question, the Minister indulged in some scurrilous abuse and then passed on to other matters.  I suggest, Sir, that that does not help parliamentary procedure. The question I asked is purely <i>bona fide.</i> The Minister has had abundant opportunity for dealing with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is necessary to confirm certain Orders which were made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act of 1932.  The Orders are set out in the Schedule of the Bill and require confirmation by the Dáil to enable them to be continued in operation.  I do not know if Deputies desire to go into any detail with regard to these Orders at this stage.  As regards the merits of the various duties set out in the Schedule, they might be more fruitfully discussed in Committee, if the Dáil desires to discuss them at all. However, for the information of the House, I shall give a brief indication of the effects of the various Orders mentioned in the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference No. 1 relates to an Order made modifying the duty on dried <Col N="401" /> eggs, including dried egg albumen. That duty was discussed previously in the House and I do not think it is necessary to say anything more about it as the principles involved are known.  Reference No. 2 relates to the Order affecting the amendment of the duty upon wallpaper, which had the effect of imposing a protective duty for the first time upon wallpaper &mdash;a small duty, which operated previously, being mainly for revenue purposes.  The duty was imposed for the purpose of affording protection to a concern which is at present establishing a factory in Kildare for the manufacture of wallpaper and the duty applies to most classes of wallpaper in common use, all of which will be produced by the new company in sufficient quantity and sufficient variety to supply the requirements of the Saorstát.  It is hoped that supplies of wallpaper from the factory will be available at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 3 relates to an Order made imposing a duty upon harness. A duty on harness has been in operation since 1931, but, when imposed in 1931, it was expressed to be operative for five years only and ceased to operate in the present year.  The duty was varied from time to time by various Finance Acts, but the overriding provision that the duty should operate for five years only continued in force and, consequently, it was necessary to make a new Order imposing the same duty as had operated prior to the making of the Order on harness, so as to continue the protection afforded to harness manufactures in the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Reference No. 4 relates to an Order made imposing a duty upon certain component parts of boots and shoes.  A factory has been established at Belturbet, in County Cavan, for the manufacture of these components, and is now in production.  The class of goods produced there are not much known amongst persons other than those engaged in the actual manufacture of boots and shoes.  They are parts which are sold only to manufactures; that is, parts which are described commonly as stiffeners, toe-puffs and shanks. They were previously imported into the <Col N="402" /> Saorstát, but their manufacture here affords an opportunity of giving employment of a substantial nature in a portion of the Saorstát where that employment will be very welcome.</P>

      <P>Reference No. 5 relates to an Order extending the duty on fire clay to certain unglazed clay manufactures. Originally, the exemptions from the duty applied to fire bricks and fire blocks, fire clay, including interiors, backs, sides, or bottoms for domestic firegrates, ranges, stoves, or mantel registers.  These exemptions were withdrawn and the duty applied to these articles which are now being manufactured in the Saorstát.  There is a factory in the County Laoighis.  Reference No. 6 relates to a modification in the revenue duty on figs and fig cake.  The purpose of this Order was to give effect to one of the terms of the Trade Agreement made between the Free State and Turkey, the full text of which will be published in the near future. The existing duty upon figs was 10/6 per cwt., with a preferential rate of 8/9. That duty has been reduced to 7/- per cwt. with a preferential rate of 5/10. Our imports of figs in 1935 amounted to 4,170 cwts. of which 3,728 cwts. were of Turkish origin.  The cost of the reduction in duty to the Exchequer is <Col N="403" /> estimated to be approximately £800. Item No.7 relates to an Order made for the purpose of amending the duty upon certain metal plates, letters and numbers, that is motor vehicle number plates, and parts thereof.  The existing duty of 33? per cent. was found to be inadequate, and was increased to 50 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> by the Order in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is more employment given in the production of toe-puffs and stiffeners than in the manufacture of number plates.  The final item, No.8, relates to the duty imposed on certain machinery used in laundries &mdash;pressing machines, washing machines and drying machines.  Those machines were previously only assembled in the Saorstát, but one of the companies engaged in the assembly of those machines has commenced their complete manufacture.  A factory for the purpose is located at Island Bridge, Co. Dublin.  The employment afforded is of a substantial nature and of a highly-skilled type.  It is a type of industry which it is desired to foster and encourage in the Saorstát.  Consequently this extension of duty on the complete machines to the parts thereof is considered desirable for the purpose of affording the necessary protection. Those duties were imposed from time to time during the course of the past six months, and all will cease to operate at some time during the next three months if not confirmed by Statute.  That is why it was necessary to introduce this Bill, which I move should now be read a Second Time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate arises out of the report of a committee of inquiry which was appointed on 20th April, 1932, to inquire into, among other things, the <Col N="405" /> desirability of granting licences to greyhound racing track companies to set up and maintain totalisators.  The committee reported that it had come to the conclusion that it was not desirable, in the public interest, to grant licences of this nature. In their report the committee also pointed out, however, that, although there was no completed contract between the Minister for Finance and the companies owning greyhound tracks in the city, it was clear that a totalisator licence was promised to this as well as to the other company, on certain specified conditions which the particular company concerned in this Estimate was prepared to accept.  The committee also considered that the company, acting on the strength of that understanding, incurred certain expenditure, and that, therefore, their case merited special consideration. This Estimate arises out of the consideration which has been given to the company on the basis of the report of the committee of inquiry, and represents the sum which has been agreed upon in settlement of the issues between the company on the one hand and the State on the other.</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night I had practically finished what I had to say.  Summed up, the Minister's reply to the motion I had put down was that unless it could be shown that a farm was not worked in a proper manner or that there was congestion in the area the tenant would not be disturbed.  As to the definition of working a farm properly or to the best advantage, it would be found that there were various interpretations of that phrase and that every successive Minister would have his own idea as to the manner in which the land should be farmed.  Any Minister could make a satisfactory case to his own mind for the resumption by the Land Commission of a farm under that heading.  As to the Minister's contention that a farm would only be resumed in a congested area, I would like to know what the Minister's definition of a congested area is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice it would work out in such a way that the Land Commission could resume a farm in any parish.  I say that because in one particular case which I mentioned in this House the farm was said to be in a congested area because there were a couple of labourers' cottages in the area and there lived there a few farmers' sons who did not have farms.  For that reason the district was labelled congested. Under those headings there <Col N="408" /> would practically be no security for farmers owning their own land.</P>
    <P>When we come to the second portion of the motion: &ldquo;that in the event of such lands being resumed... the market value without any deduction would be paid by way of compensation,&rdquo; I do not think that any Deputy will deny the fact that in cases of resumption in the last few years, practically no farmer got what could be described as the market value of his land.  The price given is only an uncertain sum that the Land Commission may fix, and out of that sum the farmer has to redeem the annuities. When the redemption value of the annuities is deducted what is left to the farmers may, in some cases, be nothing.  In nearly all cases the sum given would not represent anything approaching the market value of the land.  The Minister did not make any statement that would give encouragement to the tenant holders who feel the uncertainty of their position.  The Minister is certainly a Job's Comforter. He tells us that the farmer can feel secure.  Perhaps he can feel secure, in a sense.  Secure in his insecurity. Secure in the knowledge that he only holds his land at the will of the particular Minister for the time being.  Uncertain whether he can ever pass that land on to his children after him in the same way as he received it from his predecessors.  He has, further, consciousness of the fact that he is no longer able to borrow money on the security of his land and that he will in the future be unable to sell it at the fair market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that the Executive Council should forthwith introduce proposals for legislation to amend the Widows' and Orphan's Pensions Act, 1935, to provide pensions for all widows whose means would qualify them for pension, but are excluded by not coming within the &ldquo;contributory&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-contributory&rdquo; pension provisions of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the passing of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act of 1935 and the tabling of this motion, I am quite confident that the Minister has received an abundance of information from the thousands of applications for widows' pensions sent to his Department.  I am sure that the information is sufficiently widespread to indicate to him the amount of dissatisfaction that prevails in the country, due to the fact that such a large number of people, <Col N="411" /> through no fault of their own, are debarred from receiving pensions.  In view of the amount of information that must be in the possession of the Minister's Department on this matter, I do not intend occupying the time of the House by going into details.  There are just a few points, however, that I would like to refer to briefly.  The first refers to the non-stamping of insurance cards.  In these cases when men, who are not insured, die their widows are deprived of the pension.  In other cases, where workers are insured up to the date of their illness, if their cards are not stamped between that date and the date of their death, their widows are also refused the pension.  I could go on for a long time detailing cases of hardship of that kind, but I will content myself by saying that the Minister must have sufficient information at his disposal to convince him that amendments of the Act are absolutely necessary.  I hope that amending him the desirability of doing so as soon as possible, and I hope that amending legislation will be introduced at the earliest date.  I formally move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of our Party, I beg to move the amendment to the motion standing in our name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo; in line 3 and to insert therein the following words, &ldquo;that pensions at the rate of ten shillings per week, with proportionately increased allowances for children, will be paid under the non-contributory Part of the Act to the widows of (a) men who were insured or were deemed to have had an insurance status under the National Health Insurance Acts at any time during the five years prior to the date of their death, (b) men who at any time during the five years prior to the date of their death carried on a small business in the capacity of independent contractors, and (c) men who were small holders immediately prior to the date of their death; and that so far as concerns these beneficiaries the provisions of the Act relating to a means test shall cease to have effect.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> The members of this Party are not prepared to accept the motion standing in the name of Deputy Doyle because of the limited nature of the demand made therein.  That demand calls for the inclusion of classes which have been left out of consideration under the existing Act.  The amendment put down in the name of the Labour Party seeks to extend the scope of the present measure, and to increase the miserable pittances that are made under it, especially under the non-contributory sections.  This Party has been advocating the provision of pensions for widows and orphans since it was founded as a political Party.  Whenever we thought fit to put forward that demand, either inside or outside this House, we always had in view that the State pension so provided should be at least a living allowance.  Deputies who have any knowledge of the administration of the Act, and particularly of its non-contributory sections, must be aware that, as administered, the Act does not provide a living allowance for those who qualify for benefit under it. In answer to a question which, I addressed to the Minister in the Dáil, on the 4th inst., it was stated that the number of claims for widows' pensions received up to the 23rd of October last was 26,944, and that the number of widows' pensions sanctioned for payment up to that date was 14,198.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister, when he is replying, if he can say how many of the 26,944 applications have been rejected because of the fact that they do not come within the terms of the existing Pensions Act.  I am informed that thousands of applicants have been completely cut out of consideration of any kind.  I am sure that the Minister has available the latest figures, and I would be glad to know from him the number that come within that category.  In reply to the same question, I was told that the number of claims for orphans' pensions received up to the 23rd of October last was 890, and that the number of such claims sanctioned for payment up to that date was 349, covering 559 orphans.  In the case of orphans, I would also like to have information from the Minister as to the number of applications that have been completely <Col N="413" /> cut out because it was held they did not come under the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>The worst point of all in regard to the administration of this Act is that regarding the average rate of pension paid to the applicants who come under the non-contributory sections.  In reply to my question on the 4th of November, the Minister stated that the average weekly pension paid to a childless widow is at the rate of 4/9.  But Deputies, I think, will admit that worse still is the average pension paid to a widow with one child.  This amounts to 7/4 a week, which means that the allowance for the child is at the rate of 2/7 a week.  I hope the Minister is not going to get up in the House and stand over such a miserable, niggardly pension allowance to persons so circumstanced.  It will be pointed out by the Minister, I suppose, that the means test is responsible for reducing the average pension payment to such a low figure.  In this amendment we are calling for the complete abolition of the means test which, under this Act as under other Acts, is administered in a most niggardly manner.</P>
    <P>I have come across cases where a young officer has been appointed to carry out investigations in connection with the administration of this Act. He goes into the country and finds a widow with one or two orphans.  He discovers that she keeps a couple of dozen hens.  He calculates, from his own elastic imagination, that the hens produce so many eggs in the year, and that her income is so much from the sale of the eggs; but his calculation is based on the retail price at which eggs are sold in the local shop rather than at the price which the widow and other local people receive from the local shopkeeper when they sell their eggs to him.  In some cases this young officer puts a market value on the eggs that would flabbergast the experts on the Opposition Benches, and that would meet with the disapproval, I am sure, of even such an optimistic agriculturist as Deputy Corry.  I am sorry that the Deputy is not present to give his views to the House and to the Minister as to what his experience has been of the administration of this Act in his own area.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister, <Col N="414" /> who, I am sure, has a fairly decent personal outlook on matters of this kind, whether he stands over the average pension payments that are now being made to childless widows and to widows with one, two, three or four orphans.  I am sure that the figures given to me in the Minister's reply on the 4th November are absolutely reliable, and will not be challenged by any speaker in this debate. I have personal knowledge, and so, I am sure, have other Deputies, of cases where the payment to widows and orphans, as the case may be, under the State pensions scheme, have been found to be less than was previously given by the local authority.  If the Minister has any right to call the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act a State pension scheme, the pension payment should be fixed at a rate far and away beyond any payment previously made to such persons at the expense of the local ratepayers or by the local authority.  I do not think that any Minister or Government claiming credit for the existence or operation of a State pension scheme should boast about payments which are admitted by the local authority to be below a living standard and which require the local authority, as a result of that consideration, to supplement the State pension allowance.  I am sure that Deputies in every part of the House and representing every constituency can cite cases of that kind, and that large numbers of cases of that kind can be found in the files of the Minister's Department. I should like to know what action the Minister proposes to take to put such matters right; whether he believes the local authority should, in any case where a State pension is paid, find it necessary to supplement the State pension allowance.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister or the Department has very much knowledge about the operations of the investigating officers who report to the Revenue Commissioners, I presume, and, in turn, to the Department of Local Government, under the section dealing with the means test.  I do not know whether he would be willing to give the House any glaring cases where the means test is not working in accordance with his own wishes, or <Col N="415" /> whether there is an intention on his part to abolish the means test in the proposed amending Bill which he promised to introduce in the near future.  I think I am not wrong in saying that the Minister promised to introduce this amending Bill over six months ago, and I noticed with pleasure that he gave an assurance to the recent Ard-Fheis to bring in this Bill in the near future.  This is the place and the time to give us reliable information, and I should like to hear from the Minister whether he proposes to introduce and pass that amending Bill before the Christmas adjournment.</P>
    <P>Under the Act as it now stands, a number of cases of a most deserving nature appear to be cut out of consideration of any kind.  We have applications for pensions from the widows of tailors, blacksmiths, shoemakers, country carpenters, cattle-drovers, chimney-sweeps and carters employed by local authorities.  As far as I can ascertain, all these classes, although belonging to the wage earning class, and not being insured under the National Health Insurance Act, are out out of any kind of consideration under the law as it stands at present. I should like to hear from the Minister whether he proposes in the amending Bill to make provision for the payment of pensions to the widows and orphans of persons included in these classes, because I think the widows and orphans of tailors, blacksmiths, shoemakers, carpenters, drovers, chimney-sweeps and carters employed by county councils are entitled to as much consideration as has been given to widows in receipt of pensions under the contributory section of the Act.  I am not by any means enthusiastic about the allowance provided under the contributory section of the Act.  I think there is room for improvement there, if there is an admission by the Minister, and by Deputies who support this demand, that State pensions should be provided on the basis of a living allowance.  I hope we will hear something interesting from the Minister as to what he intends to do under the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>I daresay the Minister will justify himself by saying that we will have to wait and see, but I think that this <Col N="416" /> Party is entitled to make the case that the existing Act has not, in its administration, covered all the deserving or necessitous cases.  I hope that the amending Bill, when it becomes law, will provide State pensions at a decent living standard for all necessitous applicants.  I do not want to see anybody with £1,000 a year provided with a pension under the Act&mdash;such people can look after themselves&mdash;but I think that the Act, as it now stands, does not meet the reasonable requirements of the majority of the members of this House.  The members of this Party put forward about 50 amendments to the existing Act during the Committee Stage, but we were precluded by the rules of the House from moving these amendments, because no private Deputy has the right to move an amendment to a Money Bill of that kind which would increase the charges on the State.  I am sorry the Minister did not see fit to take the responsibility on his own shoulders of including many of the amendments put forward by the Labour Party, because if he had been wise enough to do so, he probably would not have found it necessary to promise the early introduction of an amending Bill.  I hope that the mover of the motion will accept the amendment in the name of Deputy Norton moved by me on behalf of this Party and that the Minister will see his way to meet the cases which I have cited and other cases, perhaps of a worse type, which can be cited by my colleagues on these Benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not consulted the mover of this motion about whether he accepts the amendment or not, but I certainly accept the amendment. I think the means test, as Deputy Davin has described it, is very unjustly applied in all these cases. The application of the test by the investigation officers under the Act seems to me to be exceedingly drastic. My experience is that it is much more drastic than under the Old Age Pensions Act.  I am sure Deputy Davin, like myself, has come across hundreds of cases where the net award to widows is 6d., 1/- or 2/- per week. I want to be quite frank about it and say that I would feel ashamed to be the Minister in charge of a Department which would offer a pension out of public funds to anyone of 6d. per week.  Poor women who have struggled all their lives are left with a family of children and have made sacrifices on their behalf.  These women are real heroines and, in my opinion, have a greater claim on the State than, we will say, farmers whose families are reared and provided for.  They have farms of land which provide the means of sustenance for them.  Some of these cases are rather cruel.  Just from memory let us take a few cases. Take a widow living in a cottage, not necessarily a labourer's cottage, but maybe a cottage on a farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her husband was probably a labourer on the farm, and she is now living alone.  She has a bit of a garden with a few heads of cabbage sticking in it.  She may have a few hens and sell a few eggs.  A woman of that kind had her means assessed at £25.  I should like to know on what grounds that valuation was justified. In other cases, widows have been left with four or five young children. Perhaps, the youngest child was not born at the time of the husband's death.  She has battled on and made good.  Under the pretence that we are giving that woman a pension, we offer her 6d. a week.  A woman who <Col N="418" /> has battled through that storm, who has reared four or five children without making any demands on public funds is offered 6d. a week, and then we pretend that we are doing something for her.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>In a constituency like mine, there are bound to be hundreds of these cases.  In the main, these widows are poor.  They are the widows of very small farmers who never had anything.  Perhaps, their husbands, when alive, found their means of livelihood in Scotland.  By all means, let us have an amending Bill, but let us not have an amending Bill of the type of the original Bill. If the present means test is to be applied in these cases, the pension should be increased to 10/- per week. The test applied is the same as is applied in the case of old age pensioners who are getting 10/- per week. My experience is that it is much more rigidly applied to the widows than it is to the old age pensioners.  These women were led to believe that they were going to get some assistance under the Act, and now their hopes are dashed to the ground.  In many cases, their children are reaching an age at which they are more expensive than they were previously.  Even if the older members of the family have been placed, something should be done to enable the mothers to provide trades or other occupations for the younger members.  If this House wants to pretend that it is doing anything for the widows and orphans, the maximum pension should be increased from 5/- to 10/-.  That would be merely meeting the moral obligation&mdash;if we set out to discharge it at all.  It is contemptible to award a pension of 5/-and, by a rigidly-applied means test, reduce it to a nullity.  I support, in restricted form, the original motion, and I also support the amendment.</P>

Every Deputy knows that, but Deputy McMenamin thinks that it will be a grand thing to go down to Donegal and say that the Bill was introduced after he made his speech. Deputy Davin will go down to Laoighis-Offaly&mdash;I may go there some Sunday, too&mdash;and tell the people that, but for the speeches he made, the widows and orphans would be in a terrible mess.

If a political advantage could be taken by anybody on the opposite side, we might find Deputies going into the Division Lobby against this proposal&mdash;that is, if it would serve as a political trick or some purpose of that kind.  Marvellous things take place coming up to a general election.  All these motions should have been placed in the same boat if the people concerned were honest and sincere about them.  They do not apply now at all. They were tabled at a time when conditions were entirely different.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment, as distinct from the motion, because I think that, if the motion were accepted, there would be a real danger that it would be taken as an indication that there was nothing wrong with the Pensions Act save the financial clauses.  One or two speakers who preceded me have pointed out that the Act is hopelessly bad.  It seems to be almost incapable of amendment. The amounts doled out and even the maximum capable of being achieved in the non-contributory portion are insulting when offered in the guise of a pension to anybody.  The restrictions with which the grant of pension is hedged round and barricaded render it more despicable still. I hope that the amending Bill, when it comes along, will not be confined to the alteration of the financial clauses but will deal with the matter root and branch and remove all the objectionable sections.  One item under the present legislation refers to a widow who is eligible to obtain a pension outside the insurance clauses.  That is the case of a plotholder.  The plot, however, must be under £8 value and it must have a separate and distinct valuation, apart from the residence, or she will not participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" /> The widow must have continued to reside in the same house or else she loses her qualification for this 5/-pension. I have particulars of a case from the County Limerick where an old mud cabin tumbled down on the little plot. The Board of Health built a cottage on the same plot side by side with the ruin&mdash;they could not build on top of it, obviously.  Because the lady did not continue to live in the ruin, it has been held that she is not entitled to receive a pension.  Surely, barriers of this sort were not necessary when the number of widows in the country was definitely known?  There were, approximately, 134,000 widows in the State at the time this legislation was enacted.  By reason of the fact that a certain number of them were over 70 years of age, they were ruled out.  We went further and we decided that any woman who was childless, or who had not children under the age of 14, and had not the 60 years' qualification, was also to be deprived of any benefit under the Act.  If a woman passed the age of 60 years she would become entitled to qualify.  Apparently, somebody was trying to manufacture a jig-saw puzzle and was successful in that effort.  Certainly they have succeeded in puzzling hundreds of unfortunate widows who have been looking for relief.</P>
    <P>I may say that the Act has proved not a blessing or a benefit; in many cases its effect has been quite the reverse. I know plenty of cases where widows were in receipt of home help and where they were relieved by charitable organisations such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, or who derived benefit from some other charitable sources.  In these cases, wherever State pensions have been granted, the widows have been debarred from outside help and, as a consequence, their standard of living has been considerably reduced rather than improved.  I submitted a couple of questions to the Minister from time to time, dealing with the instructions issued to local boards as to their responsibilities.  In reply, the Minister said that the local boards, and rightly so, ought to be aware of their rights and powers and functions in these matters.  But that does not alter the truth of the statement <Col N="422" /> that I have made, that once the State has come to the assistance of the widow, certain boards of health have definitely and flatly refused to give any help whatsoever because she was on the pension list.  In such cases the Government have inflicted a real and a definite hardship on those people.</P>
    <P>We have heard Deputy McMenamin speaking of pensions of 6d. and 1/-.  I know of plenty of such cases.  During the week a case was brought to my notice where the board are demanding a repayment of 13/- from a widow who was in receipt of 1/- a week.  They discovered that she had been overpaid. They want the repayment made by way of a postal order or a cheque, but the amount must be paid immediately.  I am going to prove to the Department that she did not receive anything like 13/-.  Her child was over the school-going age and was not continuing at school and she did not notify the Department about the change in sufficient time, with the result that, because the child had passed 14 years, she rendered herself in debt to the State to the extent, as the Department claim, of 13/-.  I hope to prove that she drew only 9/- up to the time they demanded the 13/- repayment.  Deputy Davin has referred to the hardships inflicted on all the working class people who did not happen to be insured.  Surely, we ought not to make any further classifications amongst people who are reduced to the poverty line and who have lost their breadwinners.  A chimney sweep is regarded as a contractor, in his own way, and when he dies his widow cannot be provided for under this Act.  The same thing applies to the case of a blacksmith; any of them who have not been stamping cards are ruled out from the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>If the amending Act promised by the Minister is to do what it is expected to do, it will be necessary not alone to increase the miserable stipend to at least 10/- a week but also to remove the very disturbing barriers placed in the way of unfortunate widows who apply for a pension.  It will be perfectly easy to devise ways and means to prevent people of affluence becoming entitled to a pension.  I am sure there are sufficient statistics at the disposal <Col N="423" /> of the Department now, as a result of the close investigation they have made into the means of people who have been claiming pensions, and they could estimate how many people, approximately, would be entitled in ordinary honesty, fairness and justice to favourable consideration.  I trust that all the information that they have already obtained will be used by the Department in a broad and generous spirit. I earnestly hope that they will speed up the consideration of claims for widows' and orphans' pensions and that the results of their efforts will be such as can really be regarded as a blessing by those unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>The first observation I want to make in what I intend to be a very brief speech is that I rather regret the movers of the motion and the amendment did not come together and give us a composite proposal, which would be the easier and the better way to deal with this whole matter.  I can see a whole lot of good in the amendment. As a matter of fact, the amendment has a stronger appeal for me and I think it amplifies considerably what was in the mind of the movers of the motion.  I rather deprecate the remarks or the comments of Deputy Donnelly who, after all, is an enlightened, educated man who must be aware that this is either a Legislative Assembly or it is not.  He must know that it is usual in all Parliaments for motions to be put down and discussed even though amending legislation to existing Acts is promised.  Is it not a help, instead of a hindrance, to a Minister to have the opinions of persons like members of the Dáil, who are in daily contact with the people, and particularly with those most affected by the legislation which we are told is in contemplation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nearly everything that could be said in relation to this matter has been said, but I want to endorse what Deputy Keyes said a few moments ago about the injustice and the hardship inflicted on large numbers of those people who were doing better when they were receiving home assistance from the local authorities.  That is a state of affairs which should not prevail <Col N="424" /> in any well-ordered community and particularly in a community in which we are told the Government are out to increase, to supplement, the social services.  In Cork City complaints are very general in relation to the operation of this Act.  I make no reflection on the administration of the Act, on the civil servants and others charged with carrying it into effect. These complaints are, however, very general.  I have endeavoured to explain, with only partial success, by the way, because of unwilling listeners, to some of those whose claims were turned down that they were turned down only in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Having given the only explanation a public representative can give on such occasions, I have often felt for those unfortunate people who were led to believe that when this Pensions Act was being enacted their conditions would be materially improved.  Reference has been made to some of those persons who are unable to secure the modest pension of 10/- a week.</P>
    <P>I had a case quite recently of the widow of a shoe repairer who was unable to obtain a pension because her husband was not an insured contributor. Deputy Keyes mentioned the case of a chimney sweep, but I had the case of a widow of a butcher in a very small way of business who also was denied a pension because her husband was not an insured contributor.  On page 38 of the majority report, signed by 11 members of the Committee of Inquiry which considered this question of widows' and orphans' pensions, the semi-final sentence read: &ldquo;The object of this inquiry will not have been achieved until all necessitous widows and orphans are in receipt of adequate pensions.&rdquo;  If and when the amending Act is introduced.  I sincerely hope that the Minister and his advisers will be able to act up to that protestation.  In addenda to the majority report, signed by two members, exception is taken by these two members to the application of the old age pension means test referred to by Deputy Keyes, and to the restriction to 6/- a week of the means exemption.</P>
    <P>These are the main objections to the Acts.  As I say, I do not want to <Col N="425" /> repeat what has already been said.  I feel, from what I know of him, that the present Minister is a very honourable political opponent, and I pay him the highest tribute for his heart being in the right place, etc., but while we can fritter away money by the half-million pounds&mdash;this is my view, but it may not be the Minister's&mdash;while we are giving pensions to everybody who said &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; to a policeman, we are told we cannot find the necessary money for this sort of legislation without inflicting tremendous hardship on some other members of the community.  That is a position I should like to put to the members of the Labour Party who proclaim that they are out to get all they can by way of social legislation.  You cannot get more out of the common pool than you put into it.  The sources of wealth of this country are not too great.  We have only so much in the common pool, and the more you take out of it for the purpose of giving pensions to everybody who said &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; to a policeman, for the purpose of increasing the personnel of your Civil Service and other such purposes the less there is to finance necessary social legislation.  I would commend that consideration to the Labour Party whenever Bills of another character come along for discussion.  We are spending 4½ million pounds on education, and we are not getting 2 million pounds' value for it.  Here is a way in which you could spend money to the advantage of the whole community, because every penny paid out by way of widows' and orphans' pensions will find its way back to the community in some shape or form, through the medium of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker.  I appeal to the Minister, when the amending legislation we are promised is introduced, to bear in mind the comments that have been made on the drawbacks of the Acts and on the hardships which some of its clauses inflict on this deserving section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T.J. Murphy Mr. T.J. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we had an opportunity of discussing widows' and orphans' pensions in this House some time ago on the Committee Stage of the measure the operation of which is now the subject of discussion, the Minister indicated that he believed it <Col N="426" /> would be necessary to amend the Acts on some future occasion, and rather hinted that that occasion would be availed of as soon as possible.  I think the Minister is now in the position of being able to lay his hands on a lot of useful information enabling him to see how such amendments ought to be made.  It is a very well-known and indisputable fact that, in administration, very many defects have been revealed in the Acts, and while one is always glad and proud of the fact that the Statute Book of an Irish Parliament bears some testimony to a realisation of the need of widows and orphans in this country, one cannot say that very much more has yet been achieved. Particulars of the cases that have come under notice as typifying the hardships of the Act have been referred to, and, in addition to the particulars that have been touched upon already, there is, in my opinion, an undoubted hardship on widows who have not reached the age of 60 years, who have not children within the prescribed age, and who are very often in needy circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the plea made in the amendment to raise the amount of pension need not be unduly stressed.  A reply to a Parliamentary Question last week elicited the fact that the average pension paid to widows was something like 4/9 and I feel sure, knowing the Minister's outlook on this and kindred matters, he realises that that is a position which cannot be defended and cannot be allowed to remain indefinitely.  Many of us who were associated for a considerable time with the demand for this reform based our main case for the reform to a large extent on the hope that the advent of a measure of pensions for widows and orphans would remove the stigma of pauperism that remained for a good many of the poor; in the other words, that the widows and orphans would be put in a position of independence in which, in the same manner as the old age pensioners, they would obtain their pensions at the post office on Friday, without any taint or stigma attaching to their actions in doing so and without any fear that the whim of a rather niggardly board of health would alter their little means standard from month to month or from quarter to quarter. <Col N="427" /> Unfortunately, in a number of cases, that hope has not materialised because I can bear testimony to the fact that boards of health, or at least one I have some association with and knowledge of, have had to supplement the allowances granted.</P>
    <P>I do not want to decry what has been done.  I say that in a great many cases the Act, for all its limitations, has been a very great boon indeed, but I think the Minister feels we must go forward in this matter, and the very large number of cases that have arisen in respect of which adverse decisions have been given ought not to be kept outside the scope of the Act very much longer.  I support without any hesitation the plea in the amendment for the raising of the pension to 10/-a week and I think that no very prolonged argument is needed to justify that claim.  I make the plea, too, that the large number of widows, the widows of artisans of the type described and other people, ought to have an opportunity given them to come within the scope of the Act and to receive its benefits in a very short time.</P>
    <P>There are also numbers of people in this rather unfortunate position: the bread-winner died some time before the Act came into force and that death followed on what was very often a prolonged period of unemployment&mdash;two or three years.  He had ceased active benefit membership of National Health Insurance.  Considerable hardship exists in such cases.  I admit that the admission of widows of tenants of labourers' cottages to the classification of such persons as smallholders in rural areas has eased the difficulties of applicants to a considerable extent, but a very large number of difficulties remain still and I would urge that the proposals contained in this amendment should prove acceptable to the Minister and should form the basis of the amending measure that he is introducing. Beyond that I do not think that anything further need be said at this stage.  I feel that the Minister possibly is sympathetic to a more generous provision in the way of widows' and orphans' pensions.  I would ask him to use every effort to remove whatever obstacles remain in the way of a more <Col N="428" /> generous recognition of the very fine principle contained in the scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make my appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position in regard to the means test.  I, like other Deputies who have spoken, have come across cases of hardship such as those which have been mentioned.  I have also come across cases where the widow, through her industry, has provided her children with a good education.  In some cases a son or a daughter may have become a teacher or may have acquired a trade or some other fairly good occupation and subsequently married. In order to remove the stigma of pauperism from their widowed mother, and rather than have her drawing money from the board of assistance, such children have tried to provide her with some weekly allowance.  I think it is grossly unfair that the Minister's Department, in assessing the means, should take into account allowances of that kind.  Surely the Minister does not expect that these married children should renege their widowed mother and say: &ldquo;We will give you no more support.  The State has provided pensions for widows, and unless you fight for your pension we are not going to support you any longer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Surely, in this Christian country about which we hear so much, we do not want that condition of affairs. That is one kind of the many mean cases I find in my constituency.  They all go to show that this abominable means test should be abolished.  It is the meanest means test that could be devised.  I hope the Minister, of whose humane outlook I, like other Deputies, have had experience, will give special consideration to the future application of the means test. I hope we shall never hear of it again. I welcome the announcement that has been made that amended legislation is to be introduced.  I believe it is long overdue, and I trust that through it the Minister will remove all the grievances about which we have to complain at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the amendment has met with such support from all sections of the House. <Col N="429" /> We have had a contribution from Deputy Donnelly as to the promises made by his Party, but he was very silent on the question of whether or not his Party would support this amendment.  He spoke of the promised new Bill and of what it would do for widows and orphans, but he did not give us any indication as to whether he would go into the Lobby with the Labour Party on this amendment.  I am certain that, as a result of the statements made here to-night, he will urge the Minister to be more courageous in the Bill that he intends to put before the House, and that he will encourage the members of his Party to give it their whole-hearted support.  We are all aware that the present Act has created discontent even in small areas. If the new Bill will remove these grievances of widows, it will be some consolation. I can give the Minister particulars of two cases that arose in one street.  In the first case, a poor man who was in constant employment, and who had hundreds of stamps to his credit, unfortunately died last October.  Another man, a neighbour of his, died last February.  The widow of the man who died in February received something like 30/- or 32/6 per week, whereas the widow of the man who died last October, receives only 6/- or 7/- a week, owing to the fact that her claim was treated as a non-contributory case, while the other widow was treated as the widow of an insured person.  These are some of the complaints that come before us as members of the board of health.  We have just as many widows in County Wicklow in receipt of home help as previous to the passing of the Act. We have to supplement the amount which they receive as pensions by 3/-or 4/- a week.  The majority of the widows are in receipt of an average of 3/- per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of widows of sailors and fishermen.  I made a special appeal, on the introduction of the existing Act, to the Minister to bring the widows of such persons under the Act.  These men work on a share system and, while they are not wealthy men, they have never been insured. A large number of widows, young <Col N="430" /> women in many cases, are left without their breadwinners and have to depend on charitable institutions or on home assistance.  They are not entitled even to a pension of 3/- or 4/- a week.  I hope that under the amending Bill, now that the Minister has had experience of the working of the Act for the last nine months, he will be more generous and that he will be encouraged to remove all these means tests which I have always opposed in this House and outside it, especially means tests which are based on valuations, valuations which exist only in the imagination of young investigation officers travelling round the country.  These young men have no experience which would qualify them to make proper valuations.  I have no complaint to make against the appeals officers who have had a good deal of experience, but I do object to these young, inexperienced men, travelling round the country making these exaggerated valuations.  They have very large districts to attend to, no doubt, but they put a very unfair value on even the smallest patch of garden.  If the values which they place on these small patches of garden are to be accepted as fair, I do not see how any farmer can complain at the present time, because the farmers must be millionaires if their holdings are valued in proportion to the value which investigation officers place upon half an acre of land.  I have come across a couple of cases where half an acrs of land was valued at £26 a year for the tenant of a labourer's cottage.  Of course, it was only in the imagination of the investigation officer that such a valuation existed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McMenamin that the Revenue Commissioners have not much consideration for these young men, and unfortunately they are tied down with regulations.  The same value is placed on the perquisites of a widow who gets 5/- a week as is placed on the perquisites of a person who receives an old age pension of 10/-.  In fact it is much easier to obtain an old age pension.  Frequently we know that farms are transferred by old people, so that they can qualify for an old age pension, and you have <Col N="431" /> not that strict administration by investigation officers as you have in connection with widows' pensions.  I am certain that the new Bill which the Minister is to bring in will be a good Bill, that is if it is brought in before the general election.  I hope it will not only be brought in before the general election, but that it will be implemented and put into operation before the election.  No Party, I am sure, as Deputy Donnelly said, will try to take political kudos out of it.  I would make a special appeal to the Minister on behalf of the widows of fishermen and sailors who, through no fault of their own, have never been insured.</P>
    <P>I hope that some of those anomalies will be removed, and that, if we are really in earnest in providing the widows and orphans of the Saorstát with a pension, we will give them a pension which will be sufficient to enable them to live without any assistance from charitable institutions or the boards of health, and that the boards of health may thus be enabled to devote their time to really necessitous cases and the care of the sick people instead of having to make inquiries in a matter of this kind.  I hope, that the widow will be able to get all she is entitled to get in this Christian State about which we have heard so much, and I trust that certain members of the various Parties who have been trying to prove, both here and on platforms outside, that they are more Christian than other people, will prove their Christian generosity by voting here in this House for a generous pension for the widows and orphans of the Saorstát&mdash;such pensions as they are entitled to from any Christian Government.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly certain that the Bill promised by the Minister to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act will be received with enthusiasm from all parts of the House. I think that the Minister himself is perfectly satisfied now that there is an absolute necessity that that Act should be amended.  I think he pointed out himself, during the debate on the Second Reading, that many steps would require to be taken before this <Col N="432" /> problem would be adequately dealt with.  If the Minister felt that way then, I am perfectly certain, in view of his experience since and the experience of his officials during the working of this Act, that he is far more satisfied now that the Act should be amended.  Members of this Party here pointed out, during the passage of the present Act through the Dáil, that it would be necessary to amend the Act and to carry out considerable amendments on it if the people for whom it was intended were to be reached.  The Act was supposed to remove the taint of pauperism from the shoulders of many a widow who had lost her breadwinner. I think it will be found, upon investigation, that that is not the case &mdash;that in a great many instances the pension given to a widow and her children has had to be augmented by a weekly allowance from the different county boards of health.  Now, I do suggest to the Minister that that should not be the case, and that it should not be necessary for a widow and her orphans to approach the county boards of health when we have an Act like this in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various Deputies have referred to people who have applied for pensions and who have been proved under the Act to have been ineligible.  There are certain people who were not insured, of course.  Their occupation, when they were alive, did not necessitate their being insured.  The dependents of these people are in a very bad way. They are dependent on the chairty of their neighbours or upon the county board of health.  I refer to such people as fishermen, carters who were contracting to do small jobs, and small cattle dealers.  I know of a few small cattle dealers in my own constituency who never were insured under the Insurance Acts, who have died recently and whose widows have made applicasion but who are not eligible in consequence of the provisions of the Act. The Minister, of course, has told us that he is bringing in a Bill to amend the Act, and I do hope that that Bill will cover the cases that have been referred to.  Now, the Minister must have expected that he would have to <Col N="433" /> deal with 58,000 widows.  That would leave 76,000 who would not be covered by the Act.  Those were the figures he gave us on the Second Reading of the Bill which is now an Act. Notwithstanding the fact that he admitted that there were 58,000 who, in his opinion, would come under the Act, I think that up to the present moment only about half of the number of applications dealt with have been let through.  I do not know whether it was the drafting of the Act that prevents these people from getting their pensions or not, but I suggest that the Minister should ask for some return relating to the numbers that have been passed through and the numbers he quoted on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The Minister, of course, is aware of the hardships that are entailed by reason of the fact that a great number of people are not entitled to draw the pension, and I feel certain&mdash;at least I earnestly hope&mdash;that when he introduces his Bill we will not have much cause for further complaint.  I am quite certain that the members of his own Party have come into contact with cases of hardship in their constituencies and that they have brought these cases to the Minister's notice, and I hope that, when he is bringing in the Bill, he will have these cases before his mind and that he will bring forward a Bill which will enable all these cases to be dealt with adequately.  I can assure the Minister of the support of this Party in any effort he makes to bring about a situation which will enable him to deal properly with the case of the widow and the fatherless child.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it would clear the air, Sir, if I state right away that I do not propose to accept either the motion in the names of Deputies Morrissey, Doyle, Rice and Reidy, or the amendment in the names of Deputies Norton, Everett and Pattison.  In reply to remarks that were made from different parts of the House about the putting down of motions of this kind, I should like to say that I have no objection in the world to seeing motions of this kind put down.  I think that the motions <Col N="434" /> concerned were down&mdash;or were sent in, anyhow&mdash;before I gave a promise in the House, in reply to a question by, I think, Deputy Davin, that I intended to introduce at an early date legislation to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act of last year. However, as Deputies Corish and Murphy have reminded the House just now, I did say, in the course of the discussion on the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill of last year, that I was certain that legislation would have to be introduced to amend the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill that was then going through the House, and that probably several amending Bills would have to be introduced into the House at different times before the Act reached anything like the state of perfection that many Deputies in the House, in the course of the discussion on that Bill, had demanded.  I knew that the Bill of last year would not satisfy everybody in the House, and perhaps would not satisfy even a great number of people in the House, but I did state then that while I myself did not regard it as entirely a satisfactory measure I looked upon it as a big step in the right direction. I looked upon it as a measure that was laying the foundation of social legislation; that was eventually going to be of great value; and that had been demanded all over the country by various individuals and societies interested in social reform for a great many years.  While the amendments which I hope to introduce at an early date will, I am satisfied, improve the windows' and orphans' legislation, and will enable thousands more widows and orphans to benefit as a result of the passing of the legislation, when it is passed, I am still certain that it will not satisfy many people in this House, and perhaps many more outside it, but again it will be a considerable step in the direction of further social benefits for a very deserving&mdash;perhaps the most deserving&mdash;class of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the motion we are asked to provide pensions for all widows whose means would qualify them for pensions. I cannot say that I intend to do that in the amending legislation.  I hope that that legislation will go to the draftsmen this week, but I cannot say when <Col N="435" /> exactly it will be introduced.  I cannot give a definite date to Deputies who asked for it, but I do hope that it will be introduced here before the present Session concludes.  As I have said, its purpose will be to make provision for the bringing into the ambit of the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme perhaps, in round numbers, an additional 5,000 widows and close on the same number of orphans; I cannot give exact figures.  The scheme which is the foundation of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions legislation is a contributory scheme.  I think that that is the right basis to work on.  It means that, in the early stages, a good many people who have not hitherto been in insurable employment and have not been contributors to National Health Insurance do not come under the scheme.  That will continue, and must continue, so long as we found our scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions on a contributory basis.  That disability must continue with regard to those people for perhaps a long time, but the number who would be concerned and who would not come within the ambit of the scheme would not be great.  There would admittedly be a certain percentage of persons of the class referred to by Deputy McMenamin and by all the Deputies on the Labour Benches who have spoken, and it is possible that so long as we continue carrying on the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme on a contributory basis there will still remain grievances and grounds for complaint on the part of people who would not come within the ambit of the scheme because they were not in insurable employment.  Up to now I have not discovered any scheme which would enable me to meet all the claims of that kind from all those different classes who have been referred to here in the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment from the Labour Party, I do not, as I say, propose to accept that either.  As my first comment upon it I may say that if we were to do what the Labour Party asks in the raising of the amount of benefit to be paid to widows&mdash;to be paid to the number of widows at present receiving benefit, without bringing in one additional <Col N="436" /> widow or orphan&mdash;the annual cost would be increased from the present £250,000 to £650,000.  That is an expenditure which I would not be prepared to ask the Minister for Finance or the Government to face at the present time, although admittedly there is not a more deserving class in the community than the class dealt with in this legislation.  When we were discussing the Bill last year&mdash;the Bill which afterwards became an Act &mdash;I said that when it came to the time for introducing amendments my desire would be to go as far as possible in bringing a larger number of widows within the ambit of the scheme.  That is the line on which I am going.  We do not propose to raise the present rates of pensions, but we will bring, roughly speaking, an additional 5,000 widows within the ambit of the scheme, and between 4,000 and 5,000 additional orphans.  Sooner or later in this House some Government&mdash; perhaps our own Government&mdash;will probably be able, when their burdens grow less than they are at present, to find the necessary money to increase the present rate of widows' and orphans' pensions.  Unquestionably the tendency of social legislation will be in that direction.  I do not know whether it will be for the Labour Party&mdash;I hope the widows and orphans will not have to wait for this increase until the Labour Party forms a Government&mdash;to get the rate of pensions raised to what I think everybody on all sides of the House would like to see the widows and orphans getting.</P>

      <P>We will do it much sooner than the Labour Party forms a Government.  If and when the Labour Party does form a Government here in this country they will insist on a means test, just as we will, for widows and orphans and other beneficiaries of that kind&mdash;old-age pensioners and others in the country. They will have to do it.  One of the Deputies on the Labour Benches&mdash;I do not remember which one&mdash;said that they did not want to see widows with <Col N="437" /> large incomes getting pensions.  If there is no means test there is nothing to stop anybody, no matter what her means is, from making application and getting the benefit of the legislation to which she would be entitled if the law did not lay down that there is a certain means test limit of income applied in the case of those seeking a pension.</P>
      <P>In the amendment which the Labour Party has put down they ask that men who are insured or who are deemed to have had insurance status under the National Health Insurance Acts at any time during the five years prior to the date of their death should be brought within the ambit of the measure.  I have in mind a Bill which will do that and which will go further. That will provide that every person who was in insurable employment at any time and died, no matter for what period he was out of insurance, his widow can claim and will get the benefit of the Act, provided that the man at no time after going out of insurance went into employment that was not insurable.  So long as he was an insured person he will be in benefit provided he did not go into employment that was non-insurable.  In that case the widow will get the benefit of the Act.  I intend to propose such a measure to the House; in cases where through unemployment or through sickness he went out of benefit he will, if the House passes such a measure, be regarded as an insured person under the Bill that I propose to bring in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of our great difficulties is the question of the small holder; I do not see a way of getting over that difficulty.  At any rate, taking them all over the country they are, relatively, a small class though they were mentioned here by many Deputies. However, judging from the figures I got from the Department as to the number of rejections, it will be seen what the numbers are.  The total number of rejections up to October was 11,024.  We will practically cut that figure in two as a result of the amending legislation which I propose to bring in.  Taking them by and large the total number of rejections will be 5,000 and, as a result of the <Col N="438" /> amending legislation, they too will be brought within the ambit of the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act.</P>
    <P>Of these 11,024 rejections, I rather think that the number of people who were of the type of the small tradesmen class referred to would number only some hundreds.  I have some figures here, but they may not be accurate, with regard to that particular class.  I say that for the reason that probably some of these people would go to the Deputies in their immediate neighbourhood and ask their advice about applying.  Probably the Deputies would inform them that they did not come within the scope of the Act, so that any figures I might now give would not be accurate and it may not be proper to quote them.  In relation to the total 11,024 rejections the number of those tradesmen, small contractors and the like would be a very small percentage of the total.  Deputies will like to know that the additional charge on the Exchequer by the amendment that I intend to bring in will be between £80,000 and £85,000. That, of course, is in addition to what it is already costing the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doyle, in opening the debate, said there was much dissatisfaction throughout the country with the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions scheme.  I suppose there would be some dissatisfaction, and possibly greater dissatisfaction, before any scheme was introduced.  When discussing this Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill last year in the House, I remember saying that I was satisfied that there would be more publicity and more dissatisfaction expressed in public after the Bill was brought in than there had been previously; that people would talk about it in a general way, but that the great majority of them had not much hope of ever seeing such a Bill being passed into law or put into concrete shape.</P>
    <P>When some people got those pensions and others did not I knew then we would hear a clamour.  Deputy Everett gave instances of two cases in his neighbourhood where, in one street, one person got 6/- a week and another person in the immediate neighbourhood <Col N="439" /> in the same street got 30/- a week.  Deputies forget that neither of these people would have got anything a year previously.  They are much better off now.  I have come across cases in Dublin where the husband met a tragic death and where the widow is now getting 30/- a week or more.  She gets that as a right because of the contributory basis of the scheme.  The widows do not have to go to any local authority hat in hand. Once a person belongs to the contributory classes she will automatically get the pension.  Where the woman has a large family she will get a fairly substantial sum per week.  There is a very big difference in that woman's position as compared with her position a year ago, when she and people like her had nothing to expect but poor law assistance.  Now they have a legal right to this pension.  This Legislature has given a right, where the widow has five or six children, to 30/-a week or more.  That is a benefit not to be sneezed at.</P>
    <P>Unquestionably there is dissatisfaction with the Act because everybody is not treated alike and because of legal difficulties of one kind or another that are essential to a scheme of this kind. Everybody cannot be treated alike. The contributory basis of this scheme is worth defending because the whole scheme is on a proper footing.  It gives those people in the future their pension as a right.  It changes the whole tone of those people's lives who have become widows, especially those with children.  It gives them a new status in life, a status which they did not have until this legislation was passed.</P>
    <P>I have been making inquiries into schemes of insurance of this kind, widows' and orphans' pensions, as well as other sorts of insurance, and I find that no scheme of special compulsory insurance of independent workers has been applied.  That is in reference to the small trading class and small contractors. No such scheme of compulsory insurance of independent workers has been applied in any country that I can discover.  There is the same difficulty in all countries where they have nothing like the scheme of national <Col N="440" /> health insurance and of social welfare for widows' and orphans' pensions that we have adopted.  No other country has yet solved that difficulty.  In Czecho-Slovakia a scheme was adopted in 1925, but, up to the present, they have not seen their way to put it into force because of the difficulties that have arisen.  While the difficulty is there these people regard it as a hardship that they cannot get pensions that they see their neighbours getting.  I suppose some time a solution will be found.  I confess I have not yet found that solution.  In addition to including people who had fallen out of national health insurance, we also propose to reduce the age of childless widows from 60 to 55.  That will bring in a considerable number.  We also propose to raise the age of children from 14 to 16, which will bring in a number of others.  There are additional smaller amendments which will make it easier for the smallholder class to get pensions.  There are other minor changes that will facilitate the operation of the Act and make it easier for some people who have failed to qualify during the operation of the Act throughtout this year.  The main amendment I propose will concern the insured classes, and the ages of childless widows, and school-going children. Deputy Everett referred to the number of widows who were in receipt of home assistance.  Before the introduction of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act there were 11,000 widows getting home assistance.  Up to October of this year 13,140 non-contributory pensions had been granted, and the number of widows getting home assistance had fallen to 7,679, 800 of whom were also in receipt of widows' pensions.</P>

There is no keener politician than the <Col N="441" /> Deputy.  It was remarkable how member after member of the Labour Party got up and spoke about the widows' and orphans' pensions.

      <P>I know how much can be got out of the general pool as well as anyone, and how hard it is to keep the pool full.  If, in present circumstances, and in the very unlikely conjuncture of the Labour Party happening to be here, I doubt if they could do any better than we have done, and are doing, for the working classes generally, and for widows and orphans in particular.  The scheme of widows' and orphans' pensions that was brought in last year was not brought in for the purpose of having something on hands when we would go to the electorate at a general election, as I made a promise then that before the year was out I would probably be introducing further amendments.  I said that more than once last year when discussing the Bill, and I have brought it on as early as I could. Whether the promise was made or not, certain amendments would have become necessary, and whatever Minister is here in 12 months or two years looking after these matters will probably find that he will have to do the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an advance all along these lines, especially so far as social legislation is concerned.  You will have changes in national health insurance, in widows' and orphans' pensions, and old age pensions.  We have already a promise from that simple man who says he is no politician, Deputy Dillon, that pensions will be given at 60.  I wonder when he made that promise did he believe that he will not be asked to perform it.  We are doing excellent work for this deserving class of the community, and it remained for our Government to do it.  Through the gentlemen now on the opposite benches were in office for ten years they made <Col N="442" /> no effort to introduce legislation of this kind for the most deserving class of the community.  That will not be denied.  We do not claim to have done everything but if we are here for ten years, as we probably will be, we can claim to have improved steadily all the time, and to have done more for this class, that everyone in this House is anxious about, so that the public purse should be at their disposal to the utmost extent.  That is what we have in mind.  That is what we are doing, general election or no general election, and that is the policy we are pursuing.</P>

That is happily all over, but I do not think the jibe should be tossed about, because it is going to draw us into a discussion of affairs that had better be forgotten. Whatever resources are at the disposal of the present Government are largely at its disposal as a result of the prudence, care and ability of the Administration before this one.</P>

      <P>I venture to say that if the Minister consulted his Minister for Finance he would be told that is true. It would be well, however, if we all departed from that aspect of the question. I agree with the Minister that the future history of this State is going to consist of steady progress in the amplification of social services.  I believe that is going to be the case in every democratic country.  I believe that if the capitalistic system is going to survive&mdash;and I hope it will&mdash;it has to be purged, in so far as it is possible <Col N="443" /> for any Government to do so, of the clear inequalities of distribution of income which did exist when the capitalistic system was in its full flower, and which still exist to a smaller or lesser degree, smoothing out all the inequalities and improving the social services which are to be paid for by the rich and enjoyed by the poor. I want to put it to the Minister that this is a case where a new social service would be immensely improved by admitting a comparatively small category of persons to its benefits.  If you start a new social service it will certainly do a great deal of good, but there is no use closing our eyes to the fact that if you have two persons in stress and poverty, living side by side, while their plight was very bad before any social service was introduced, if the effect of the new social service is to lift one from destitution and to leave the other as he was before, then the condition of that one is, in fact, very much worse than it used to be.</P>
      <P>I know of numbers of cases in rural Ireland in which, for instance, you will have a blacksmith who, to all intents and purposes, is exactly the same as a small-holder in the immediate neighbourhood. The widow of a small-holder is entitled to a non-contributory pension.  The blacksmith dies, and his wife is left in a state of complete destitution. Now, we may try to explain to her the elaborate reasons why that has been judged desirable, but it is a very poor consolation to her, and it gives rise to an entirely disproportionate amount of discontent through the whole area in which those people live.  I feel that we ought to be able to give pensions to every destitute widow in this State.  I hate getting up to advocate extravagant proposals without any regard to the difficulty of financing them.  That, in my opinion, constitutes the cheapest form of politics. I do not think that the financing difficulties of looking after these people would be insuperable, and it must be borne in mind that whether we do it through the legislation of this House, or whether it has to be done by the local authorities, somebody must look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The day has gone, thank Heaven, <Col N="444" /> in this country, and, indeed, in Great Britain when the community will tolerate the idea of anybody suffering from hunger.  Now, somebody has got to look after them.  The public purse has got to be charged with protecting them from the rigours of destitution. Once that is admitted, then I think the sooner the community faces shouldering the burden squarely and by no devious method the better it is for everybody.  I could well understand the Minister saying to us to-day that in principle he was in agreement with us, but that he preferred to postpone this matter until after the Budget so that we may see our way.  I think it is a pity that he should put the thing irretrievably on the long finger, and say that, possibly, hereafter further amendments may be introduced with a view to advancing in the direction of giving those pensions.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that the financial burden of the reform suggested in our motion would be too heavy.  I know, from living in the country, that the benefits conferred by it would be immense.  It is right, however, to bear in mind the truth of the Minister's statement, that there is no use attempting to take out of the pool more than you have put in.  The pool from which we are drawing this money is the pool of the national income, and when you draw money from the national income for the purpose of promoting social services you have got to consider a considerable number of things.  One is that, so long as you maintain the capitalist system, and I hope we shall always maintain it in this country, you have got to take the precaution that your social services will not react on the productive capacity of the nation as a whole, because if they do what is going to happen is that you are going to reduce the entire sum of the national income and make the share of everybody proportionately smaller.  I can see no danger whatsoever arising in that direction from coming to the relief of necessitous widows.  I do not want widows charged with the responsibility of rearing children to be engaged in productive industrial or other work in this country.  I think the place of a mother <Col N="445" /> is with her children rearing her family, and I think it is the duty of the State to facilitate that.  I think we ought to avoid, in so far as our resources will permit, bringing pressure to bear on a woman so circumstanced to go out and work.  I think she is doing better work for the country if she holds her family together and rears her children well.</P>

      <P>I do not know that the Deputy and I would agree in our philosophy in regard to certain other social services, but we find ourselves in agreement here, and I have no doubt that the Minister agrees with us fundamentally. The Minister has shown, and many of his colleagues have shown, considerable courage in facing problems of this kind before.  Let me assure him that, in this matter, a very grave evil exists, and that an amount of jealousy and a feeling of injustice is being fomented amongst a number of people who have quite enough to bear as a result of the adversity which they have met with already.  I would urge strongly on the Minister that, between this and the introduction of the amending Bill he told us of to-night, he should consider again whether he could not widen the scope of his amending Bill so that all necessitous or destitute widows who are going to become a charge on the national income, directly or indirectly, can be provided for.  I am convinced it would be much better, even if the sum is a substantial one, that the country should be brought face to face with the necessity of shouldering that obligation, and not have it shouldering it through the rates, through home assistance or some other devious way where the money is coming out of the same pocket but by another method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was sorry to hear that so many widows who are in receipt of pensions are still in receipt of home assistance. I would very much sooner see pensions fixed at such a figure as would make it possible for the local authorities to remove those persons' names from the home assistance books.  It has got to be remembered, both in connection <Col N="446" /> with unemployment assistance and with those widows' pensions, that boards of health, in certain circumstances, cannot remove those persons' names from the home assistance books because the home assistance officer reports that such pension or assistance as they are getting is not sufficient to keep body and soul together, and that it has got to be supplemented.  Personally, if we could examine this whole question of social services in a calm and detached way, what I would like to do would be to set an ideal goal before us, a goal which none of us would pretend is going to be reached immediately or in the near future, and formulate what we would consider to be a fair redistribution of the national income, while preserving the essential elements necessary to keep the capitalistic system working in this country: assess how far our present resources would permit us to travel on the road towards that ideal goal, and then come to Dáil Eireann and seek powers from this House to raise openly and above board the money necessary to finance those services and to allow politicians from all sides to say: &ldquo;This desire to see a fair subsistence guaranteed to every person in this State is not exceptional to any Party in the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All sides of the Oireachtas desire to see every individual in Saorstát Eireann effectively guaranteed against destitution.  The rapidity with which we can advance in that direction is conditioned by the prosperity of the country from time to time, and so soon as the national income is adequate to finance the ultimate ideal, so soon will the ideal state of affairs be established. But, in the meantime, careful consideration informs us that we can go a certain distance.  We can go it publicly, overtly asking the people to provide the money.  We are fixing them with notice now that, so soon as Dáil Eireann is of opinion that the national income will admit of some advance towards the ideal we have set ourselves, we shall ask for the additional sacrifices in order to make it. That would be my ideal approach to this whole question of social service. I believe it is a sound method and a better method than this piecemeal <Col N="447" /> attack on the general question of poverty.</P>
    <P>I think the people should be made to know that we who represent the democratic institutions in this country are determined that the resources of the State will be employed to eliminate destitution and that by using the instruments and institutions which we have, and which we are concerned to defend, we can more rapidly abolish destitution in this State and secure for the people a higher standard of living than they can ever hope to get under any &ldquo;ism,&rdquo; whether it comes from Rome or Moscow.  But I do feel, and I submit with respect to the Minister, that unless we are prepared to do that, we are simply strengthening the hands of the gentlemen who come from Rome and Moscow in order to propose their remedies for the social evils that afflict mankind.  I think the time has come for democrats and those of us who believe in individual liberty openly to meet these gentlemen and take the trouble to explain to the people that democracy and individual liberty is a better remedy for the evils that afflict mankind, and that democratic politicians have the courage adequate to face these ills and overtake them more rapidly and more certainly than dictatorships of any kind can ever hope to do, in whatever community they may be found.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not in for the whole of the explanation of the Minister's amending Bill and the different classes to whom it will apply, but I heard the Minister state most emphatically that the whole right to a pension depended on the contributory basis.  Is that contributory basis to apply to the husband alone?  Are young women who are now widows, and who were formerly contributing, to be denied widows' and orphans' pensions or are they to get them?  I have a few cases in mind.  There is one very pathetic case of a young lady who was in insurable employment for a good many years.  She got married, and her husband died rather tragically, and her case has been turned down by the Department, as her husband was not a contributor, while she herself was a <Col N="448" /> contributor for a good number of years. Does the Minister intend to provide for that particular class of case in his amending Bill?  There are not a great many such cases, but if the Bill is to be based on a contributory scheme, I think that in all justice and equity the contributions of the wife before she was married ought to entitle her to a pension.  Will the Minister answer that?</P>

I think it is a distinct hardship.  Is there any hope that the Minister will include that class of case in his amending Bill?</P>

      <P>The mover of the motion was very brief, and to the extent to which he makes a certain limited demand upon the Exchequer and upon the Minister responsible for amending the existing Act, I am in agreement with him.  The one thing that amazed me in the Minister's statement is his attitude of saying: &ldquo;You cannot take more out of the pool than is in it.&rdquo;  That is all right coming from Deputy Anthony when he wants to have a little bit of a lash at the Labour Party, but I cannot understand it coming from the Minister.  I have been in this House since 1922 and I accept my share of the responsibility for pension legislation brought in by two successive Governments. Deputy Cosgrave, when leader of the Government, brought in what was called the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, making provision for the payment of large sums of money to able-bodied men, many hundreds of whom had other means of employment and other forms of maintenance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to relate this to the Minister's remarks.  When this Government came into office, the members of this Party, who happened to hold the balance of power during 1932, were invited on a certain occasion to vote for the repeal of that measure.  On behalf of the Party, I gave a very definite assurance that we were not prepared to do so for very good reasons which were given to the responsible authorities at the time.  The Minister's Government then come along and bring in an amending Pensions Act, which is at present the cause of a good deal of discussion around the country.  This Act made provision for the payment of additional pensions to able-bodied people who have other means of livelihood. Deputy Cosgrave's Government and the Minister's Government are responsible for putting their hands down into this pool to the tune of £1,000,000 for the payment of pensions to able-bodied persons.  The Minsiter says, and some of the Opposition Deputies may say, that it is not possible to find any more money for widows' and orphans' pensions&mdash;for pensions for people who have no means of earning a decent livelihood. Did anyone ever hear such political hypocrisy in any Parliamentary institution in modern times?  We are told that we cannot put our hands into the pool and take money out if it is not there.  It is not there for destitute widows and orphans but it has been found, regardless of any consideration, for able-bodied people who have other means of livelihood.  I invite the Minister to put that issue to the people in such a way that he can receive a straightforward answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If pensions are to be found for any section of citizens, they should be found, in the first instance, for those who have no other means of livelihood and who are incapable of earning a livelihood for themselves or their dependents.  I thought that that type of policy would be accepted by the Minister.  Before the amending Bill is introduced, I hope he will reconsider his attitude. If he can justify a vote at any time <Col N="451" /> for the provision of pensions for able-bodied persons, surely he has much greater justification for putting his hand more deeply into the pool to assist a much more deserving section of the community.  There is no justification for Deputies advocating a State pension scheme and leaving the responsibility for any portion of the maintenance-allowance on the local authorities.  If we have a State pension scheme, it should so provide for widows and orphans that they would not have to fall back for maintenance on the ratepayers.  Such a scheme should be either provided by the State or by the local authorities. The Minister has shown that 800 persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions had to have those pensions supplemented by allowances from the local authorities.  Does the Minister believe that that is right, or that it should be allowed to continue? How many Deputies believe that such a state of affairs should continue?</P>
    <P>I hope we have heard the last, in discussions of this kind, about the bottom of the pool and the depth of the pool.  That sort of talk is merely hypocritical.  It is not the kind of argument the Minister would use on an election platform.  I do not care a tinker's curse when the next election comes along.  It will come along when it suits the Minister and his Party.  I did not say one word that had any bearing on the general election, nor did I advert to the Party advantage that might be taken in discussing matters of this kind.  I endeavoured to put a point of view in support of the amendment which, I thought, would be accepted by the Minister with some sympathy.  I do not mind Deputy Anthony talking about this pool.  The interest of some of the selected classes he speaks of, representing the wealthy City of Cork, blinds him.  But I am surprised at the Minister for Local Government and my colleagues are surprised. We hope he will reconsider his attitude before the amending Bill comes before this House.  The Minister rejected the suggestion to abolish the means test.  This test is the sole cause of the childless widow getting 4/9 under the non-contributory section of <Col N="452" /> the present Act.  Is the Minister prepared to do anything in the amending Bill which will increase the average payment to the childless widow under the non-contributory section of the Act?  I invite him to do something in that regard and thus prevent the childless widow from having to fall back on the local authority if she cannot secure assistance from her relatives or friends.</P>
    <P>This is not the type of scheme for which James Connolly gave his life in 1916.  He was the first man who ever stood up at a Labour Party conference in this country to advocate the provisions of pensions for widows and orphans.  If he fought for anything, he fought for something better than is provided in the existing Act.  The Minister probably knows more about his outlook than many Deputies on these benches, but I know something about his attitude on Labour matters and on matters affecting social reform. He did not give his life to have a flag floating over this building or any other useless purpose of that kind.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil is of opinion that pensions should be awarded as from April 1st, 1934, to all lay assistants and junior assistant mistresses in national schools who retired from the service of the Department between April 1st, 1922, and March 31st, 1934, and who, had the present regulations been then in force, would have been entitled to the award of a pension on their retiral.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More in sorrow than in anger do I return to this subject which has been debated in one form or another on many occasions in this House.  In order that the memory of Deputies may be refreshed on this matter, because on many matters of importance unfortunately all of us have sometimes very short memories, it will be necessary to go over some ground, and I propose to ask Deputies to listen to the circumstances which have made it necessary for this House to discuss a motion of this kind.  I want to take the mind of the House back to 1920, when, following an agreement between the British Treasury, the National Board and the Irish National Teachers Organisation, a substantially improved scale of salaries for national teachers was instituted.  On the making of that agreement there was a definite undertaking given that in the following year an improved pensions scheme would be provided, and that included in that pension scheme would be the classes who are the subject of the motion down for discussion this evening, namely, junior assistant mistresses and convent teachers.  When the time <Col N="457" /> came for the redemption of that promise in 1921, circumstances had arisen that will be within the recollection of the House, which made it impossible for that arrangement to be made.  The teachers, in this part of the country and the part of the country that has since been termed Northern Ireland, were told they would have to go to their respective Governments for the fulfilment of this promise.</P>
    <P>In 1923 the Northern Ireland Government passed an Education Act and the convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses were provided with their pension rights under that Act.  Nothing was done in this part of the country at that time and, indeed, so far as a certain limited number of convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses are concerned, nothing has been done up to the present.  We hear frequently criticisms of the Northern Government with regard to certain matters and even recently with regard to educational questions in which the majority of us in this country are concerned, because of the faith which we profess, but at least this tribute can be paid to the Northern Government, that all the convent teachers in the North of Ireland obtained justice under the Education Act of 1923.  From that period and on various occasions subsequently, agitation for the inclusion of convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses within the ambit of a pensions scheme in Saorstát Eireann, has been proceeding.  I do not think that at any time the justice of the claim was denied.  There were various difficulties or official delays from time to time and such delays or difficulties bring us along some years when the whole question of teachers' pensions came under official consideration for settlement.  In 1926 the then Minister for Education agreed to make an investigation into the state of the Pension Fund, before any new classes were taken on, and later he stated in reply to questions addressed to him by the general secretary of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, who was then a member of the House, that the delay, incurred in the making of the investigation I have referred to, would not prejudice in any way the claims of <Col N="458" /> the convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses to pensions.  The obvious meaning of that statement was that when the investigation was completed payment of pensions would be made to the persons concerned and that that would have retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>In 1933 and 1934 certain reductions were made in salaries of national teachers in this country and the question that arose round about that time took the shape of an offer from the Department to have the whole pension question settled on a certain basis. The settlement of that question involved further sacrifices from the teachers, but the settlement was made and from the 1st April, 1934, junior assistant mistresses and convent teachers were, to a certain number and a certain extent, brought within the scope of the scheme.  From the time I have mentioned as the period when the Government of Saorstát Eireann was set up, up to April, 1934, quite a number of the persons whom I have referred to had for one reason or another ceased to occupy their positions. The age limit in a number of cases, or incapacity for some reason or another, caused a certain number of teachers to drop out.  The fact that no provision has yet been made for such people is the reason for this motion this evening.</P>
    <P>Now, I want to try to give the House the most accurate information that I have as to the number of persons for whom this motion seeks to provide. From a communication which I received from the Minister on the 3rd October, 1934, it would appear that the total number of teachers then outside the scope of the scheme was 65, because the Minister in that communication states that in one class there were 49 such teachers and in another class 16.  That will enable the House to realise that, if this motion is accepted by the Minister and agreed to by the House, the amount of money necessary to finance the scheme will not be very great.  I think the most important principle involved in this matter is that of doing justice to a number of people who were definitely promised that certain concessions <Col N="459" /> would be made to them and who have not had such concessions made up to the present.  I am aware that in the cases of some of the persons concerned very considerable hardship has been their lot in recent years, and I know of some really pathetic cases concerning which I think the Minister can be quite easily convinced that there is need of the doing of tardy justice in the way of bringing them within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the number of 65 teachers, but it might very well be&mdash; and I think it is more than likely&mdash; that that number has been considerably reduced, probably through death, since that figure was made available, and I think that it would be perpetrating a very severe injustice to allow a small number of resigned teachers, in the position to which I have referred, to just dwindle away one by one without rendering them some justice.  We are met in this House, in connection with motions of this kind&mdash;motions raising a similar principle&mdash;with the argument that the cost involved would preclude the application of the principles we press.  Surely, however, that argument cannot be raised in this particular connection where the amount involved is really only a very small sum.  I base my case on the fact that, as far back as 1920, the teachers concerned were definitely promised that this would be done.  I have reminded the House that in 1926, when investigations were being made by the then Minister for Education, the then Minister stated that the prolonged nature of the investigation would not prejudice the claims of the persons concerned in any degree, and I think this House ought to endorse the principle that the teachers, who resigned for one reason or another during the period that intervened before a scheme of pensions for convent teachers and junior assistant mistresses was put into force, ought to have justice done to their claims.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any comparisons, but the members of this House are aware that, even recently, legislation was passed in this House to remove certain hardships that were inflicted on certain people in the <Col N="460" /> course of the last few years.  It is no reflection on these people to say that a great many of them&mdash;some of them, at any rate&mdash;appear to have been in possession of happy homes and considerable means.  This is a motion dealing with people who have no means and who, in many cases&mdash;in some cases that I know of personally&mdash;are living just above the poverty line.  I do not think that this House will be guilty of assenting to the continuation of an injustice that has been inflicted on such people.  They do not ask that their pensions should be made retrospective over a longer period than is provided for in this motion, and I think the demand is really a very reasonable one. One can very easily understand, over a long period of service, the hope and expectation with which all the people concerned looked forward to the advent of a pensions scheme, and I am sure the Minister and many of us in this quarter and in other quarters of the House have met some of these poor old people in recent years who have been disappointed and who are still hoping against hope that in the evening of their days&mdash;an evening that is rapidly closing in on them&mdash;something may be done for them.  It is true that in some cases they are able to obtain the old age pension, but I submit that the provision of the old age pension in their cases, after the special and meritorious service they gave for many years, is not adequately meeting the case.</P>
    <P>I feel that this is a matter on which I could talk at very much greater length and still would be able to find things that would be interesting to say.  However, I do not think that is necessary.  This case has been discussed in one form or another pretty frequently in the House, and I feel that Deputies on all sides of the House have got the facts pretty well fixed in their minds.  I would urge on and plead with the Minister, whether by way of acceptance of this motion or by any other means he thinks fit, to bring the few dozen people who are outside the scope of the scheme, within it.  The most penurious person in this country will not complain of the Minister's action in that matter, and I feel that if the <Col N="461" /> Minister does so he will be able to lay claim to doing a belated act of justice to a very deserving section in the community who are, generally speaking, in very poor circumstances and whose hearts have been sickened by the hope deferred that has centred around this whole business for a number of years.  I believe the Minister will give some indication, before this debate concludes, of his desire to have this matter closed.  It is not the kind of thing that ought to crop up here from time to time.  It is not a big financial issue, but there is the important issue raised in it of doing justice to people who have long-waited for that act of justice.  I commend the motion to the House and to the very sympathetic consideration of the Minister for Education.</P>

      <P>In rising to second the motion standing in Deputy Murphy's name, Sir, I do not think it will be necessary for me to delay the House to any great extent, because Deputy Murphy has gone very carefully over the ground, and, with a moderation in keeping with Deputy Murphy's general attitude in this House, he has not attempted to over-portray the picture one bit.  He has clearly indicated the history of this unfortunate transaction and has pointed out the hardships of those poor people who, during the years they have been out of the service, have all the time been buoyed up with the hope of the redemption of the promise made to them so many years past.  They were encouraged in that hope by seeing the realisation of the hopes of their colleagues in Northern Ireland when the Government there thought fit to redeem their promise in 1923.  Eventually they saw their colleagues on this side of the Border coming into the settlement in 1934 and surely it was not much for them to expect&mdash;in view of their sadly depleted numbers and the lesser number of years that could be expected to remain to them in accordance with life's allotted span&mdash;that the State would honourably meet their demands.  I am sure, as Deputy Murphy has stated, that the Minister must be very sympathetic towards those teachers who have given honourable <Col N="462" /> service under conditions which do not compare even with the conditions available now to teachers similarly engaged.  In the days when they were doing the best of their work, neither fully qualified teachers nor junior assistant mistresses were paid a sum by any means commensurate with the service they were giving to the nation. Having regard to the miserable pittances then paid, it is all the more deplorable that some provision should not be made for them other than waiting to qualify for the old-age pension or some similar State charity. I feel that there is not a Deputy in the House, nor anybody in the country represented by those Deputies, irrespective of Party, who would not feel heartily glad if the Minister could see his way to accept this motion, or to indicate that he will take such steps by some other means as will remove those grievances once and for all by ensuring that those people will get this little pension.  I would appeal to the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to this motion, and to try to place those people on an equitable footing in the closing stages of their lives.</P>

      <P>I should like to add a word or two in an appeal to the Minister to accept the position as put to him in a very reasonable way by Deputy Murphy.  I think it would be to the credit of the Minister to recognise the agreement that was entered into some years ago, and to do what has already been done by the Government of Northern Ireland.  The people referred to in Deputy Murphy's motion <Col N="463" /> spent the best years of their lives working here for a low standard of remuneration.  As pointed out by Deputy Murphy, one would expect that they would have received better treatment from a native Government. The liability that the Minister is asked to accept is only of a temporary nature.  In a few years' time the necessity for the payment will have disappeared.  The charge on the Exchequer will be comparatively small; one might say small, without using the word &ldquo;comparatively.&rdquo;  I do suggest to the Minister that he ought to take his courage in his hands, and deal sympathetically with this matter.  After all he will be doing only what to my mind he is in honour bound to do in view of the fact that an agreement was entered into some years ago, and, as I said before, has already been honoured by the Government of Northern Ireland.  One would expect that the Government here would honour an agreement of that kind before it was honoured by the Government of Northern Ireland.  I confidently recommend to the Minister the case made by Deputy Murphy, and I hope for an acceptance of the position as outlined by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot accept this motion.  In saying that, I hope Deputies will realise that I am quite anxious that every reasonable effort should be made to meet the cases of hardship which arise in connection with pension schemes.  But the House has to bear in mind that a pension scheme dates from a particular date in a particular year, and all the persons who are in the appropriate service on that date come under the pension scheme.  If we are to go back beyond that date and make the scheme retrospective in respect of persons who had left the service before the date on which the pension scheme came into operation, where are we going to stop? In this motion the suggestion is that we should go back to 1922.  If we are to go back to 1922, or to any other year before 1934, then obviously we would have to do the same thing for <Col N="464" /> the persons who came in under the scheme in 1934, if they had service during the years before 1934 which Deputy Murphy now seeks to bring in retrospectively under the pension scheme. A pension scheme is not a perfect instrument.  We have had several examples in connection with the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme where the scheme had to be amended or was to meet hard cases even though these hard cases were few in number.</P>
      <P>In this particular case a very important principle is being raised which must have very serious financial consequences. The motion, if it were to be accepted by the House and by the Government, simply means that, in effect, we are scrapping the pension scheme that we introduced in 1934 and the duty is being cast upon us of bringing in another scheme which will give pensions to a class of persons who had left the service.  In the first place that would require legislation.  The Minister for Education would have to be empowered by new legislation because he has not power under existing legislation to bring in now under the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme persons who were not included when the scheme was brought into operation.  I think, however, that the House will recognise that this principle of retrospectively bringing into a scheme persons who were not in it at first is a very dangerous principle.  Apart from the financial consequences and the fact that other persons in connection with the same scheme would demand further benefit, it obviously raises the whole question of ante-dating such schemes for persons in special circumstances or for persons who may have suffered special hardships.  We have to recognise in connection with any scheme that certain persons will have to be omitted because they have not sufficient length of service.  You will always have excluded from pensions schemes persons who did not have sufficient service, or persons who left the service previously or who for some other reason did not fulfil the requirements of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to this class <Col N="465" /> is that when we introduced the superannuation scheme in 1934 we met the teachers' representatives and they asked us to consider these persons.  The Minister for Finance and myself went into the question at the time; we could not see how we could reasonably be expected to do what was asked or how, in fact, it was practicable to bring in under the scheme persons who had already left the service.  Besides, the number was small.  At any rate, we went into the question in 1934 and examined it because we had given a promise to the teachers that we would do so.  We came to a decision on it then and we cannot now change our attitude about bringing in a number of unknown persons about whom we had very little information&mdash;persons who had left the service.  We found that we could not take upon ourselves the responsibility of bringing them into the scheme.  The position would be different if we had only a certain number of persons, or a certain class, about whom we had full information.  We found we were not able to cover the case of these particular teachers at that time and we decided that, unfortunately, they would have to be excluded.</P>
    <P>The House will see from the wording of the motion some of the difficulties that would arise, administratively, if we were to take up this work of granting pensions to teachers who had left the service long ago.  Deputy Murphy asserts that it would be quite easy to accomplish this, for the Government, he says, knows all those teachers who retired from the service of the Department between the 1st April, 1922, and the 31st March, 1934, and who, were the present regulation in force, would be entitled to be awarded pensions. Anybody who has any experience of pension schemes will know that with the most benevolent administration there would be very considerable difficulty, as has happened in another connection, in the Department in ascertaining who were or who were not, in fact, incapacitated at some date in the past.  How are we going to decide at this juncture as to Mary Smith, who resigned from the service in 1924, 1926, 1928 or 1930, the nature of her <Col N="466" /> incapacity, or whether if the scheme could be ante-dated in this fashion, she could legitimately be brought into it on that ground?</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy has given certain figures.  If there were 65 genuine cases in respect of which it was clear that they were exactly on a par with those who came into the scheme in 1934, I would say that he had made a reasonably good case.  But that is not the position.  The position is that the great majority of these 65 persons resigned before the age of 60.  Presumably, they had resigned on the grounds of incapacity or disability.  We have no means of knowing who these persons were or whether they are alive or dead; and we do not know what the nature of their incapacity was.  But we know that, at any rate, they were insured as contributors under the National Health Insurance Acts.  To that extent, they drew disablement benefit. They would have received, in disablement benefit, substantially the same sum as they would have got by way of pension.  The amount they would receive would on the average be the same as they would receive under the pension scheme.  Their pension would have been a small one.  However that may be, with regard to these cases, we have no information. We could get in the Education Office a list of the persons who left the service between the 1st April, 1922, and the 31st March, 1934. But we have no means of finding out their present circumstances and we certainly have no means of ascertaining the circumstances under which they left the service.</P>

      <P>Has not the Minister all the facts as to their retirement in his office?

      <P>The Deputy may challenge it if he wishes.  With regard to the teachers concerned, I pointed out that the vast majority of them retired before they were 60 years of age.  We believe that a large proportion of these had short teaching service.  As against what Deputy Breathnach has stated we believe that there is the difficulty of knowing whether they were incapacitated or not.  A number of them retired at 60 years or over.  In the case of junior assistant mistresses the number was only eight and as four of these were married women there are really only four as far as we knew over 60 years of age who, having left the service, were not entitled to pensions. With regard to lay assistants, there were only four cases of those who retired at 60 or over who may be without a pension, if still alive.  Of the eight who retired at that age four seem to have got pensions from the nuns.  These monastery teachers were paid by the nuns and they were not entitled to pensions until our scheme came in in 1934.  The position in certain cases was that they received pensions from the nuns, but whether that was the general practice or not I cannot say.  I know that in some cases <Col N="468" /> they received reasonably good pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreathnach" hpid="Cormac Breathnach Cormac Breathnach">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was that no pensions were available otherwise. At that time these teachers were paid by the nuns, and it would seem that, as the State refused to take the liability, some liability, moral, at any rate, rested upon their employers.  I believe that has been discharged in some cases.  I have no information to show whether it was discharged in all cases or not.  When the 1934 Superannuation Scheme was introduced we imposed a cut of 5 per cent. on the capitation grant given to these schools, and as part of the set-off we took over the pension liability for a class of teacher that up to that was dependent on the employers, as they then were, to grant them a pension or not.  I cannot agree, therefore, that a good case has been made out that the Government should introduce legislation to deal with this matter.  It was gone into in 1934.  Undoubtedly in a small number of cases we have not been able to get accurate information to say that they had teaching service that would enable them to be put on a par with teachers entitled under the present scheme.  In fact there are only very scanty particulars available.  The number of cases of teachers in this class who were 60 years or over, and who retired without pensions, is very small.  The latest figures I have about the junior assistant mistresses are that 11 who were 60 years or over retired between 1922 and 1934, six of whom were married women. As regards lay assistants in convent schools, there were eight, four of whom were pensioned by the nuns.  If we assume that the others are in the very bad circumstances that have been suggested, that would mean that there could not be more than nine, according to my estimation, who were 60 years or over.  The House should recognise that there will be individual cases of hardship in connection with any pension scheme.  You start from a particular date and you include all the persons who were in the service <Col N="469" /> then.  There is no means of going back to include persons who left the service before that date unless you recast the whole scheme.  The Government is not prepared to do that. We examined the question in 1934 and our information is not any more full now than it was then.  Our information is not any fuller about the cases in question than it was then.  Even if it was I do not think it is a principle the Government will be prepared to accept, that they should take the responsibility of recasting the scheme as that would amount to ante-dating the whole thing back to 1922.  In these circumstances you will have people who feel that had they remained a few years longer in the service they would have got pensions, but who unfortunately have not got them.</P>
      <P>If we are to spend the time of the Dáil trying to legislate for these special cases of hardship, all our time would be taken up with that kind of legislation.  Since I became Minister for Education I tried my best, when it seemed clear that some of these teachers through various circumstances were not as efficient as they might be, to keep them on, knowing that if the teachers' pensions fund question were settled there was a likelihood that they would be brought under the scheme.  We brought in 2,500 in all.  That is forgotten. They were never under the pension scheme before, and in addition we gave them two-thirds of their back service.  We cannot be blamed if there are still a few hard cases.  I did my best to get any cases brought under my notice, even though they were not satisfactory from our point of view, kept on in the service.  That was the most I could do until such time as there was a pension scheme under which they could get pensions.</P>

      <P>I think there will be general agreement that the Minister's statement has been extremely disappointing.  One wonders at the line of reasoning adopted by the Minister in this connection, because his arguments, in view of certain comparisons and analogies, are not convincing. The Minister sees something particularly odious in making any <Col N="470" /> retrospective provision here.  When discussing military service pensions did we not make retrospective provision? I do not grudge doing so.  Some men I remember were fortunate enough to get very substantial arrears.  I do not know if the Minister was in the House when we were discussing a Bill to provide pensions for certain Dáil Court judges who, at most, had one or two years' service, and one of whom was so well off that he was able to refuse a pension.  The House settled the pensions for the officials concerned there with one, two or three years' service, but we are told that there is something particularly wrong in making a case for people, some of whom gave 20, 30 and 40 years' service to the State.</P>

      <P>I have one case that I can prove, that of a woman living in the same town as myself, who was 70 years of age.  A sympathetic inspector overlooked the fact that she should have retired previously, and she now exists on a pension of 6/-a week.  The Minister talked about legislating for particularly hard cases. That comes very strangely from the Minister, because on the question of the grievances of national school teachers he was very vocal some years ago, and very much more liberal in his declarations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is rapidly becoming more conservative, and one could not have a more conservative speech from a Tory Minister than that to which we have just listened.  The Minister says that he has no power to deal with hard cases, but should not there be power to deal with hard cases in this or in any other country?  I submit that the power of this or any other Assembly to deal with hard cases is the highest function that it has to discharge.  I make no apology whatever for coming here to make a plea for hard cases.  I have been doing that every day that I have been associated with public life in this country, and will continue to do it.  I see nothing wrong or unfair in making a case for the people that I have referred to.  The Minister spoke of this common body of teachers.  That <Col N="471" /> was an unworthy statement to make in this House.  I have rarely heard a more unworthy statement than that&mdash; this unknown and unidentified body of teachers that the Minister cannot trace. Surely, the Minister ought to give the members of this House credit for more intelligence than the making of such a statement as that would appear to warrant.</P>
    <P>There are, as Deputy Breathnach has reminded the Minister, records in his Department from which every single one of the teachers concerned in the motion can be traced.  I say, positively and definitely to the Minister, that the number involved is between 40 and 50, and that the extreme limit of the financial provision needed for them would be £1,000 a year.  That is the burden that the Government will not face.  I consider that the Minister's approach to this whole question is entirely unworthy and unfair to the <Col N="472" /> people concerned, and I feel that, no matter what decision is come to on this matter to-night, the agitation on behalf of the persons concerned must go on, and that efforts will have to be made in the future to see that justice is done to them.  To the knowledge of Deputy Breathnach and other members of the House, there is an old lady who has been haunting Deputies in connection with this particular matter. She has had 27 or 28 years' service in this City of Dublin.  Her name is well known to Deputy Breathnach and to other members of the House.  That old lady and people like her are to be told because, forsooth, they represent a few hard cases, that nothing is going to be done for them.  I refuse to accept the Minister's decision as the decision of this House, and whatever the outcome is going to be I want the House as a whole to decide it.</P>
