      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that Mr. Joseph Dardis has been in the employment of the Dublin County Council for three years and has given satisfaction to the county council; that he was in the motor office for one year, and that by order of his Department his services have been dispensed with, and the county council ordered to apply to the Appointments Commission to make a new appointment; if the Minister will state if there is any precedent for this action by the Minister, and is it now a fixed policy of his Department to direct the dismissal of Local Government officials for some unknown reason even though such officials are efficient; and if he will further state if any representations have been made to him by individuals or political clubs to have Mr. Dardis dismissed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the circumstances detailed in the first two parts of the question.  In this, as in numerous other cases, I have insisted that the practice of appointing persons to public offices without competition shall cease.  Where a clerical vacancy, other than a purely temporary one, arises in the office of a local authority, it is the practice of my Department to secure that such vacancy be filled after open competition, preferably on the result of an examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am unaware of the political views held by the gentleman in question. <Col N="954" /> They had no bearing on my decision, and no representations based on them were made to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this temporary appointment was made since he became Minister for Local Government, and is he aware that a clerk in the Dublin County Council office who held a temporary appointment since the Minister assumed office was, with the sanction of the Minister, promoted to the permanent staff?  I accept the decision come to by the Minister's Department &mdash;I must accept it&mdash;that such appointments in future shall be filled by open competitive examination.  If the Minister thinks that that is the best method, we cannot find fault with it, but does he not think that a hardship is involved in this case in which a young fellow has been in a position for three years?  Since November, 1932, he has been in two departments in the county council&mdash;for 15 months in the housing department, and after 15 months, up to the 31st January, in the motor office, filling a position which, prior to his taking it up, was filled by a permanent official.  This young fellow has given satisfaction to his immediate superior, to the secretary and to the county council, and does not the Minister think that it is a hardship, and without precedent, that that man should be fired out, and the Appointments Commissioners asked to fill the vacancy?  The Minister may be striking out on a new path, which is a very good one and to which I subscribe. But, surely, people who are already filling with competence positions of a temporary nature are entitled to fair play and promotion, and I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>This case is certainly not without precedent.  There are dozens of precedents since I became Minister for insisting, after a certain length of time when it can no longer be shown that there is urgent public necessity, that clerical positions of a temporary nature should be filled by open competitive examination.  I have made orders in numerous cases for the filling of such clerical positions by competition.  I have always <Col N="955" /> tried to have those positions filled by competitive examination and to have the post awarded to the person who came first on the list.  I have not always been met by the county councils or boards of health in that matter.  On account of the pressure they exercised, I have had in a few cases to allow them to appoint a person other than the person who came first in the examination. This, however, is no new rule. It was in existence before I became Minister.  The Department has, so far as I know, always tried to have these posts filled by competitive examination, but they have not always succeeded. In this case, I am told that the young man concerned has been continued, with the sanction of the Department for six months after six months, under pressure from the secretary of the county council and the board of health. They urged that it was necessary to have a temporary appointment, but that cannot go on for ever, and this is not the first time, even in the case of the Dublin County Council, that such procedure has been insisted upon. The rule is not a new one.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="956" /> Public Health whether the provisional committee of the Unified Society reported to him in accordance with paragraph (d) of Section 10 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, as to the possibility of establishing a suitable superannuation scheme for the benefit of officers and other employees of the society, and, if so, whether he will publish details of the scheme to the employees concerned before giving it his approval.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the rules of the Unified Society which were approved more than a year ago contain provision for the nomination of the chairman of the society by the Minister; that the rules clearly contemplate that this provision shall apply after the provisional committee is replaced by the committee of management provided for in Section 4 of the Act of 1933 and if he will state the statutory authority under which the rule in question was approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 4 (1) of the society's rules embodies the provisions of Section 4 (3) (a) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933, under which the chairman of the provisional committee is nominated by the Minister. The rule specifically states that this provision is limited to the period up to the appointed day and it does not, therefore, apply after the provisional committee is replaced by the new committee of management.  The rule was approved under Section 10 (c) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Tadhg O Murchadha Tadhg O Murchadha">
      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether his attention has been directed to the provisions of rule 18 (2) of the rules of the Unified Society under which a person applying for arbitration is required to give notice in writing to the secretary within four weeks of the date on which he is notified of the decision with which he is dissatisfied or within two weeks of the date on which he has been informed of the procedure for having recourse to arbitration, whichever period last expires; whether he is aware that this rule inflicts great hardship on many insured persons who are not in a position to serve notice of their intention to apply for arbitration and whether he will indicate the statutory authority under which this rule was approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Rule 18 (2) of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte provides that any person applying for arbitration shall give notice to the secretary as stated in the question.  It is also provided therein that it is open to the committee of management of the society, if circumstances in their opinion so warrant, to waive the provisions of paragraph 18 (2).  The rule is more favourable to insured persons than the corresponding rule in the great majority of the old societies and I am not aware that it inflicts any hardship on insured persons. The rules of the society were approved in pursuance of Section 10 (c) of the National Health Insurance Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Tadhg O Murchadha Tadhg O Murchadha">
      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that an insured person residing outside a county borough applying for arbitration under the Health Insurance Acts is required by the rules of the Unified Society to accept as arbitrator one person out of three names submitted to him by the society; whether he is aware that this rule enables the Unified Society to determine who shall act as arbitrator in a dispute between the society and its members and <Col N="958" /> whether he is prepared to issue instructions requiring the society to alter its rules so as to leave to the member freedom of choice in the selection of the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules of Cumann an Árachais Náisiúnta ar Shláinte provide that any member of the society applying for arbitration who is resident outside a county borough shall be supplied by the society with the names of three suitable persons, from whom the member shall select one to act as arbitrator to hear and decide the dispute.  It is further provided that no arbitrator shall be an officer of the society or be directly or indirectly interested in its funds.  I have no reason to think that these provisions are not regarded as satisfactory by insured persons, and no reason is seen for amendment of the rules in this respect.  The rules also provide that if either party to a dispute is dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitrator an appeal may be made to the Minister for his decision.</P>

      <P>Information as to the total amount levied by the British Government on Irish produce entering Great Britain and Northern Ireland is not available by calender years.  But the amount of such levies for the three financial years ending on the 31st March, 1933, 1934, and 1935, was £2,515,003, £4,555,238 and £4,694,593, while the amount of export bounties granted to Irish exporters during the same periods was £1,060,831, £2,219,735 and £3,061,000. The coal-cattle pact of 1935 provided that extra quotas, amounting to one-third of the imports in the previous year, would be granted in respect of each category of cattle coming under restriction.  There is no information available regarding the amount collected by the British Government on such cattle for a complete year from the date of the coming into operation of the pact.</P>

      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question formal annual claims in respect of withheld land annuities have not been received from the British Government, although periodical claims are received in respect of certain other moneys in dispute. The amount withheld in respect of all moneys in dispute, including items which it is assumed are covered by &ldquo;etc.&rdquo; in the Deputy's question, represents approximately £4,800,000 per annum, decreasing as charges on foot of items, such as pensions, tend in the ordinary course to diminish.</P>
      <P>I am not in charge of the United Kingdom Exchequer and I am not, therefore, in a position to state whether any amount in excess of the moneys withheld has been collected by the British Government since the coal-cattle pact, 1935, came into operation.

      <P>On the Order of Business, I want to make representations to the Government.  It is, I think, pertinent, in view of the impending disappearance of the Seanad, to point out that there has been the peculiar practice in the House of setting down 16 or 17 Bills for one day; it is well known that Ministers have no intention of taking the Second Reading of all these Bills on that day.  But Deputies do not know which of these Bills will be taken on a Wednesday until the Tuesday night previous to that Wednesday.  I would point out that it is absolutely impossible for Deputies to prepare themselves to handle the business in an intelligent way with only 12 hours' notice of that business.  The time, I think, has come when the Government should give at least one week's notice to the House of the business they intend to handle on any one day, and if they intend to change their programme a week's notice could be given.  Otherwise a great deal of business will pass through this House without receiving the considered examination which it ought to get.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 21, to delete the figures &ldquo;1941&rdquo; and substitute the figures &ldquo;1938&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was made clear on behalf of this Party, when the parent Bill was discussed here in 1926, that the Party was opposed to the Bill on the grounds that the provision for the exemption of children from school&mdash;that provision often exercised on flimsy grounds and sometimes utilised on no grounds at all &mdash;was detrimental to the education of <Col N="976" /> the children, and that it was calculated to deprive children in rural areas of the whole benefits of national school education.  It was made clear from these benches that with the knowledge that this exemption was provided for in the Act, parents of children were often disposed to allow their children to remain away from school for very flimsy reasons.  It was pointed out, too, that children, knowing that exemption was provided for in the Act, were disposed to take advantage of the provisions which automatically exempted them from school attendance.</P>
    <P>When this amending Bill was being discussed on the Second Reading Stage Deputy Keyes, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, indicated that we regarded the continuance of this exclusion clause as very objectionable to the interest of the education of the children.  He showed that it was calculated to deny the child&mdash;by reason of the subterfuge provided in this exemption clause for absence from school-the benefits which were associated with national school education.  For that reason we opposed the Second Reading of the Bill, designed as it was to continue this exclusion order.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to express the continued dissatisfaction of this Party with the continuance of this provision in the amending Act.  We seek, therefore, that the Bill should be limited in effect to 1938 instead of 1941, so that in the intervening period the matter may be further reviewed, and if it is desired to continue the matter further it can be continued further.  We seek to bring the Bill to an end in 1938 in the hope that it may not be renewed then, but if it is renewed the matter may be considered further in the light of the circumstances then existing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very strongly to support what has been said by Deputy Norton.  It is about ten years ago since we had in this House a very long debate on this matter of school attendance, and the provision was then inserted, at the request of the farmer Deputies, on the grounds that any sudden change of the kind required in the attendance of the children in the schools would be of too <Col N="977" /> revolutionary a kind to be brought into effect at once.  Many of them admitted what I and others would insist upon, namely, that a provision of this kind is likely to be one of a most damaging nature, not alone to the children who take advantage of it, but to the children attending schools and even to the teachers of those schools. I think there is nothing of a more disheartening nature to the teachers than desultory attendance on the part of the pupils, and there is nothing more calculated to disorganise teaching in the schools than such desultory attendance. A provision of this kind becoming, I was going to say, almost a permanence in our Compulsory School Attendance Act is one that I should ask Deputies to view with great concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the insistence on compulsory attendance of the children at schools would cause considerable inconvenience to farmers, and it may be that this would be a bad time to insist upon the withdrawal of this privilege of exemption altogether; it may be, too, that the year 1938 would be an unsuitable year for various reasons to compel attention to be paid to this matter.  We should then have a new House, and it may be too soon after the reassembling of that new House to ask Deputies to consider this matter.  But I would ask the Minister to consider the acceptance of a year earlier than the year mentioned in the Act.  If the Minister disapproves of the year 1938 I would ask him to accept at least the year 1939.  I would ask him to have the reconsideration of this matter brought forward and to prepare an Act on truly educational lines.  I am aware, from the vote given last week on this Bill, that I am probably speaking to many Deputies who do not sympathise with the provisions in the amendment, but I think that even farmers, no matter what their circumstances may be, will find that it is necessary for them to make every sacrifice that is within their power in order to secure as good an education as they can for their children.  That they should interfere with the proper education of their children in those very critical years <Col N="978" /> from 10 to 12 is a thing which, I think, on consideration, they would be very reluctant to do.  I think it is of the very gravest importance that this break in the child's education at that age should not be allowed to continue. Instead of the school being something which would tend to inculcate habits of regularity and persevering work in the child, with this break coming in for this period&mdash;I think it runs up to 19 weeks&mdash;it simply means that for a very considerable part of the year no proper consecutive work can be done in the school.  Instead of the child being taught regularity he is taught irregularity.  Instead of the child being confirmed in good habits it tends very much in the opposite way; it tends to confirm him in irregular habits.  I ask the Minister most earnestly to consider this matter.  I confess that I am disappointed with the action of the Government on this whole compulsory school attendance question.  I believe that there is little which is of more importance to the country at the present time than doing our best to secure, both in town and country, the very best primary education we can give to our children, not alone at the ages which are at present compulsory, but even for a longer period of years.</P>

      <P>In that sense, then, I am glad to find myself in agreement with Deputy Professor Thrift.  That will ease me from the necessity of emphasising that farmers, and the agricultural community at large, are solicitous to secure for their children the best education which can be got.  I doubt if there is any section in the country which has a deeper veneration for what is popularly known in the <Col N="979" /> country as &ldquo;learning&rdquo; than the agricultural community.  If there is any desire on the part of the agricultural community that this exemption from attending school compulsorily during certain periods of the year should continue, it is because the farmers are driven by poverty to desire that exemption.  They cannot afford to let their children go to school.  I am in entire agreement with Deputy Professor Thrift in principle.  I think it is a deplorable thing that this exemption, which was originally introduced to facilitate the transition from voluntary education to compulsory education, should now be continued, but it is being continued because the farmers of this country cannot afford to pay for the labour which they have to ask their infant children to do.  That is the only justification for its continuation.  It is a deplorable commentary on the conditions obtaining throughout rural Ireland that we should be required to conscript the infants of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to do the work necessary to make it possible for the farmers to live.  Can Deputy Donnelly assign any other reason for the continuation of this condition?  If the farmers were financially in a position to employ labour in order to do the work which it is intended that those children should do, would Deputy Donnelly stand for keeping the children at home and leaving the men unemployed?  I do not think he would, and I do not think that any member of this House would stand for it.  It is because we know that in fact it would be placing an intolerable burden on the small farmers of this country to ask them to employ labour, in existing circumstances, to do the kind of work which those children would be called upon to do, that we are reluctantly forced to assent to at least part of the proposal made by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggests that 1938 should be the final year of this concession instead of 1941.  I see Deputy Professor Thrift's point that a case may be made that a new House would be sitting, and that it would be better <Col N="980" /> that that new House should not be asked to deal with that new situation. If the year 1939 is put down there I am certainly prepared to vote for Deputy Norton's amendment, in the hope that when that time comes the conditions of this country will be such that we can fairly demand that all sections of the community, farmers, professional men and everybody else, will provide compulsory education for their children during the school attendance years.  That is all we ask, and I do not believe that there is any farmer in the country, viewing the position in that light, who will raise a word of protest against this scheme.  On the contrary, they will be delighted to see their children attending school regularly. They will be delighted to have an opportunity of commanding their children to attend, and warning their children that they are not only ordered to do so by their parents but by the law of the land as well.  Let us not, however, do something unreasonable, and that is to ask the parents to do this thing when they are not physically or economically capable of doing it.  If Deputy Norton will indicate his readiness to substitute the year 1939.  I think agreement may be got even from the Government Benches; they might be prepared to have the matter reviewed in the light of the economic condition of the country in 1939.  We must all pray that it will be something better than it is now, because, if it is not, it will not matter whether we have a Compulsory School Attendance Act or not.  There will not be any money to pay teachers, so there will be no necessity to send the children to school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Holohan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to this section which is before the House, I speak as a farmer and as a parent.  I fully realise the responsibility which rests on us, farmers, to send our children regularly to school, and to give them the best education we possibly can, but we have the other side of the question to look at just the same.  We realise that at particular seasons of the year, through lack of means to pay extra men, it is necessary to keep the children at home to do a little work. This is especially so during the spring <Col N="981" /> and harvest.  At the same time, even though that pressure is on us and we find it hard to employ labour, we fully realise our responsibility to send our children to school.  Although this concession may be included in the Bill there will be no advantage taken of it. We will send our children to school as regularly as any other section of the community.  I can assure Deputy Norton and Deputy Professor Thrift that we farmers do realise our responsibility in educating and bringing up our children just as much as the people of any other section of the community realise that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Holohan has added to this debate precisely what was required.  He represents the farming community, who are the class chiefly concerned with this amendment. The other Deputies who have spoken did not, I think, represent them to the same extent, at any rate. Deputy Holohan speaks as a farmer, and he understands their circumstances. He has emphasised, I think very properly&mdash;and I should like to re-echo what he has said&mdash;that the farmers are not likely to take undue advantage of this concession.  Had we been in a position in the Education Office to believe that the farmers had gone all out during the past ten years to take the fullest possible advantage of the concession which was given them over the period, no doubt we would still have had to introduce an amending measure of this kind, but we would have felt that there was real need to have a serious inquiry into the matter. But as I showed on the Second Reading, the farmers have not taken universal advantage not undue advantage of the concession that has been granted.  I assume that during the five years for which it is now proposed to permit the concession to continue there will be a still further decrease in the number of children who will take advantage of this concession.  I prefer on the whole, if there is a tendency to leave the children at school, that we should adopt persuasive methods, and ask the farmers to give an assurance, such as we have got from Deputy Holohan, that they will send their children to school, and keep them at <Col N="982" /> home only in cases of real necessity.  If that is the attitude of the farming community in general, I think that there is not a serious argument against this concession.  I have reason to believe, from the figures that I gave on the Second Reading, that that is their attitude, and I prefer to take advantage of any opportunities that may offer to emphasise to the farming community what the real meaning of this concession is: that it is a concession without which it is felt that hardship may result and that it is a concession through which we mean to give the farmers a certain advantage in cases of necessity.  If that is made clear to the farming community, and if it is emphasised to them that it is their paramount duty to keep their children at school regularly, I think that a great many of the arguments that have been advanced here against extending the concession for a further period of five years fall to the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Thrift was not here for the Second Reading of the Bill when we discussed this question.  It is quite true to say that originally, when the concession was given, it was in the nature of an agreement between the farmers and the Government.  The Labour Party even, I think, agreed in the end that some such concession was necessary at the time.  It might be argued that it was really a transitional arrangement, but even though that argument may be made, I think the fact that it was recognised as being a transitional arrangement does not necessarily mean that we need here and now, with the information at our disposal, drop the thing altogether. We have had sufficient experience of the working of it to show that it has worked reasonably well.  I have been advised by my staff that, from the inquiries they have made in the rural areas, it is desirable that the concession should be continued.  They are fairly well satisfied with the way it has worked.  But, in addition, it is a fact that in other countries you have the same concession.  I find in a statement that I have here before me, taken from a volume published by the Labour Office at Geneva, that a somewhat similar concession is granted in Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, <Col N="983" /> Sweden and France; and furthermore, in connection with the International Convention governing this matter, which was referred to at the time when the concession was originally given, it is specifically laid down in Article 2:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of work of vocational instruction the periods and the hours of school attendance may be so arranged as to permit the employment of children on light agricultural work, and in particular on light work connected with the harvest: provided that such employment shall not reduce the total annual period of school attendance to less than eight months.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that the concession comes within this International Convention.  I have a good deal of sympathy, of course, with the points that have been made by Deputy Thrift, that it is not advisable to have breaks, if they can possibly be avoided, in the attendance at school, and that there is a danger that there may be some disorganisation of classes. Well, we feel strongly that there is a real case of economic necessity in this matter.  Deputy Dillon has rung the changes again on the preposterous argument that this concession must be granted because farmers cannot afford to employ labour.  Deputy Dillon knows very well that there are thousands upon thousands of small farmers, who are the people chiefly concerned, who do not employ labour, and have never employed labour, and that there are thousands of migratory labourers&mdash;he knows it better than anybody else in this House&mdash;who leave East Mayo Constituency and the western seaboard, generally, and go across to England and Scotland, and that, in their absence, the work on their little holdings has to be carried on by their wives and families.  Does the Deputy pretend that that is not a consideration that we should have in view in connection with this matter? If it were only that alone: the fact that while these people are away working during the spring and harvest in England and Scotland the work has to be carried on by their families, is quite sufficient to justify the concession <Col N="984" /> apart from any other argument.  It is obviously a matter of real necessity that their families should be given some facility to enable them to give a good excuse for the children remaining from school&mdash;that they are working on the land.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there were any other points raised on the amendment. Deputy Norton thinks that the reasons that have been given in favour of the concession are flimsy.  I do not agree with Deputy Norton, and, if he consults the teachers, inspectors or the members of the rural community generally, I think he will realise that there are very sound reasons indeed for it and that the parents of those children have very good reasons indeed for keeping their children at home from school: precisely the same reasons, and better reasons, I think, than certain classes for whom the Deputy would like to speak in another connection when he would probably be looking for exemption.  These people are entitled, if any class is entitled, to exemption in this matter.  I do not think that the period of two years that has been suggested could really be accepted by me.  I think that five years is not too long a period.  The two years would be altogether too short.  You might as well not amend the Act at all nor continue the concession as to continue it merely for a period of a few years.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised on this amendment issues which are really not connected with it at all.  In the course of his reply to the main point made on the amendment, the Minister has taken us again all over the question as to whether exemption should or should not be provided.  That matter is not raised on this amendment. The Minister attempts to justify his opposition to the amendment by going over all the ground that was covered on the Second Reading of the Bill, and appealing to the farmer-Deputies to stand with him on this matter.  That attitude on his part does not, I submit, carry very much conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us that a somewhat similar provision for exemption <Col N="985" /> has been made in other countries.  He mentioned a number of them.  I happen to have been in most of them and to have visited their schools.  I did not see in any of those countries schools as bad, structurally, as you can see in rural Ireland.  I should say that, from the structural point of view, the worst schools in Europe are to be found in rural Ireland.  It is extremely difficult in normal circumstances, indeed at times it is a matter of amazement, to find children going into the schools or institutions which pass for schools in this country with any degree of enthusiasm. The Minister would be well advised to take a trip to some of these countries and have a look at the buildings that are provided for the education of the school children.  If he did that, I think he would come back feeling more determined than ever to wring a few million pounds out of the Minister for Finance to enable him to replace the present hovels which pass for schools in this country.</P>

I suggest that it is not fair to dismiss the matter in a sentence by telling us <Col N="986" /> what happens elsewhere if we are not also told what the opportunities are elsewhere.  The Minister gave us one side of the picture, but did not reveal the other side of it.  He mentioned countries that give this exemption, but he did not tell us the opportunities for post-primary education that are provided in those countries.  The Minister's statement on that is entirely unconvincing unless we get all the evidence.</P>
      <P>I think that there are difficulties normally, natural difficulties and physical difficulties in getting children to school in this country, difficulties which the Legislature has had to recognise by the introduction and passage of legislation dealing with the question of compulsory attendance at school.  Children, in this or in any other country, do not go to school as a matter of virtue or as a matter of the good that might accrue to them in after life.  If they did, there would be no need to introduce legislation to provide for compulsory attendance at school.  We have to recognise that there is an aversion on the part of children to going to school and we also have to recognise that, in many instances, there is also, among many sections of the community&mdash; farmers and others&mdash;a disposition, on the part of parents, not to live up to a high standard in connection with sending their children to school in any circumstances.  I am not saying that that disposition is only to be found among farmers.  As a matter of fact, I think that the farmer does endeavour to get his children to school just as much as any other member of the community. We must recognise, however, that there is that natural reluctance on the part of the children themselves to go to school, and that, very often, there is, on the part of the parents, a disposition not to recognise a very rigid code in regard to the sending of their children to school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contention is that a provision of this kind caters to that tendency on the part of the children themselves to remain away from school, and to the disposition on the part of certain parents to encourage their children to remain away from school.  It is to <Col N="987" /> guard against that tendency that I want to close this exemption as soon as possible and to see that the children will get the maximum opportunity of absorbing the education which the State wants to provide.  I want to see the farmer's child as well equipped for the battle of life as the child of any other member of the community.  Apart from that, there are many other ways in which the alleged necessity for keeping the children away from school can be exaggerated for the purpose of manipulating the labour of these children and taking advantage of this exemption clause.  For these reasons, I think it is desirable to limit, as far as possible, the exemption provided for in this Bill and to limit the scope of the Bill.  This amendment is in no sense an attempt to injure the farming community as a farming community. The amendment is designed to bring the Bill under review in 1938, so that we can have a further review of the position in the light of circumstances then existing.  I am willing, of course, to substitute 1939, if that is thought to be preferable by any number of Deputies, for 1938.  Apparently, however the Minister is not satisfied to substitute 1939 for 1941 so as to give us an opportunity of reviewing the matter at an earlier stage.  It does seem to me, however, that there ought to be a recognition by all Parties in the House and by all sections of the community that this exclusion provision should be brought to an end as soon as possible and that the gap should be closed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister doubted whether this provision was being availed of in order to keep children away from school on flimsy grounds.  I think that the Teachers' Organisation, which the Minister will hardly say would be misinformed in this matter, and which probably knows more than any other organisation in this country about the question, will have no hesitation in telling the Minister that this section of the Act is being used in a way that was never dreamed of when the Act was introduced, and that it is being used now for the purpose of permitting children to absent themselves from school when there is no necessity for <Col N="988" /> their being absent and, furthermore, that it is being used as an excuse by dilatory parents to allow their children to remain away from school.  You have got, then, as Deputy Thrift said, a kind of licence to permit children to remain away from school, and a child who remains away from school for certain periods in that way cannot possibly be equipped for the battle of life in the same way as a child who attends school regularly.  The child who remains away from school in that way is inevitably handicapped in life, and I want to secure, not alone for the farmer's child, but for the child of every other person in the community, the maximum of regularity in attendance at school.  Moreover, I think that, at a time when teachers are likely to be dismissed for failing to keep up their averages of attendances in their schools, we ought to be particularly careful in regard to this matter.  I really think that the Minister should agree to accept the year 1938 or 1939, so as to give us an opportunity of reviewing the matter in two or three years' time, and not to allow it to go on for five years, as will happen if the amending Bill is allowed to stand as at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister did not absolutely shut the door against the year 1939, and I hope that there is still a chance that he may agree to that.  I know that the Minister has got a great deal more information than I have on the matter, but I would ask him&mdash;and I think I can carry the farmers of the country with me in this&mdash;to reconsider his attitude and to consider what happens to the school life of the children of farmers for six months in the year.  You begin in the Springtime with a holiday of ten days or a fortnight, and then this provision comes into play, principally in the period immediately following, which may mean more than four weeks' absence.  It must be remembered also that they can very often extend that period by other excuses, such as supposed sickness and things of that kind. The result of all this is that the 20 days would very often run up to 30 days, spread up to three or four months following the initial Spring vacation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="989" /> A very short time will elapse after that until the time of the summer vacation comes around.  So that there are really six months in the year during which you have this drawback in the matter of school attendance.  From the teacher's point of view, it means that he cannot bring those who do not attend school regularly up to the standard of those who do attend regularly and, apart from that, he cannot bring the children, who do attend school regularly, along as fast as they might be brought, so long as that deterrent is there.  In other words, the children who are regular in their attendance themselves do not progress in the way that might be reasonably expected during the two half-years in which they are obliged to go to school. I think that the Minister must admit that the total result is not comparable with what should be expected from compulsory attendance.  As a matter of fact, I think that the farmers themselves would willingly accept, if possible, the extra work that might be put on them in order to make up for that small amount of work&mdash;and it must be small&mdash;which they get from their children for that three or four months of the year, in order that their children might get proper education.  I believe that the effect of definite and regular attendance in school must be appreciable on the standard of education reached in the school.  I grant, of course, that the Minister knows better than I do what the result of this would be, but my information is that it is definitely producing a harmful effect on our schools, and that it is also a definite handicap to the teacher and his work.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to accept the 1939 date in order to give us a chance to consider the matter before the new House meets.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to give us the figures in regard to school attendance.  The reason I ask for this is that I have no doubt that the children of farmers have given as good attendance as the children of any other class in the community, and that the farmers themselves have not availed at all of the opportunity of taking advantage of this clause.  I am nearly sure that the <Col N="990" /> children of farmers have given as good an attendance as the children of any other class in the community, and it is for that reason that I should like the Minister to give us the attendance figures.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I am reluctant to say a word lest I stir his fury&mdash;that if we insert the figure 1939 it will place on record that the House considers this exemption arrangement to be the second-best and not the <i>optimus?</i>  The only effect of the proposal would be to bring the matter before the House again in three years' time instead of five years, with a view to deciding whether the circumstances then existing called for the strict enforcement of compulsory school attendance.  It is quite true that a very large number of farmers do not avail themselves of this privilege.  I reiterate that the farmers are a class of people who attach more importance to learning than any other class.  Of course, the primary purpose of compulsory school attendance legislation was to deal with the imprudent parent who was not solicitous to send his children to school. Compulsory school attendance legislation had no effect on the bulk of parents because they required no compulsion to make their children go to school.  You had a small minority of parents, however, who did not recognise the importance of their duty in that regard, and on them the School Attendance Act did operate.  Our object is to prevent the suspension of the operation of that Act for any class longer than can be helped.  We do not want to inflict hardship, but it is universally agreed&mdash; one Deputy believes it to be for one reason and another Deputy believes it to be for quite another reason&mdash;that <Col N="991" /> this provision should not operate for an unduly long period.  Let us find a <i>via media.</i>  Let us agree that it is not desirable that children should be expected permanently to do farm work, that for the moment it is inevitable, but that we desire to find a way out of the situation at the earliest possible moment.  Let us fix the date as 1939 with the intention of remedying the evil then if we can, or of devising some other means of dealing with it in the light of the facts then before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary again whether he has gone into the situation which exists arising out of the establishment of relief schemes?  I think I drew his attention to the fact that men were being deprived of unemployment assistance completely and were being given three days a week at work in such a way that they had no regular employment. They could not count on getting employment for three days every week, with the result that men who were in receipt of 16s. unemployment assistance and 6s. outdoor relief as able-bodied persons from the Dublin Board of Public Assistance were finding themselves in the position in which for one week they would get 28/6 for work and the next week they would get only 18/6, so that although they were working they were actually receiving less than they were getting before they had any work to do.  No doubt a certain responsibility falls, in the circumstances, on the board of public assistance to give them assistance, but in the operation of the scheme both the unemployment assistance authorities and the board of assistance authorities seem to have washed their hands of that particular class of people and the result is that a man who finds himself <Col N="995" /> drawing only 18/6 as a result of working has to crawl around the town from the unemployment assistance officers to the home assistance officers and then to some Deputy or person of influence in order to see that he will not get less for the week that he was working than he used to get before he got any work to do.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the responsibility for the confusion and the want of connection that has arisen, lies, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether he has gone into the matter and what machinery can be set up to ensure that without going around the place hunting from one person and one office to another a man who is doing work on relief schemes will find that he will not be worse off than before he had any work to do. The Parliamentary Secretary will admit that the scheme is a very bad one from the point of view of the unfortunate people concerned and from a financial point of view.  It is also frightfully bad from the administrative point of view and it can have no other result than creating unrest and dissatisfaction. It must create a certain difficulty in connection with relief schemes if the men find themselves in this unsatisfactory position.</P>

      <P>As I am sure Deputy Mulcahy will agree, the only question at issue in this measure is the desirability or otherwise of continuing to give statutory authority to the Dublin poor law authorities to afford out-door relief to able-bodied persons.  The various other issues that Deputy Mulcahy has raised about over-lapping between the unemployment and the home assistance authorities and the rotation of work provided by the Dublin authorities, are matters into which I have not had an opportunity of looking since he raised them on the Second Reading, but I will have the whole question examined.  At the same time I should think it is more a matter for the local authorities concerned than for the the Department of Local Government. However, I shall have it examined to see if the position is as the Deputy states and if anything can be done to <Col N="996" /> prevent the overlapping to which he has referred, if it is found to exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That work is being controlled by the Board of Works and the reason the workers get only two days pay in one week is because of some fetish in the Board of Works arising out of which if a worker works on a Saturday he is not paid for that particular Saturday in respect of the week in which it occurs; they insist that his pay for that day must be carried into the next week.  For instance, if a worker works on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday, instead of getting paid for the three days on a Saturday the Board of Works pay him for Thursday and Friday only and they carry Saturdays' pay into the following week.  The result is that the man gets only two days' pay and the amount is less than if he were registered at the employment exchange.  It is really a simple matter to adjust.</P>

      <P>The Minister, when dealing with this matter on the Second Reading, took exception to the type of criticism that was addressed to the implementation of any part of this Spanish agreement and he attempted to defend the position that he was taking up by objecting to what he called the sneering from Deputies on this side against a certain class of trade agreement which had been responsible, he said, for reducing the adverse trade balance of this country by approximately £4,000,000 during the last year.  The Spanish agreement, he said, was one of the agreements that had improved our trade balance to the extent of £4,000,000.  I said that this type of proposal, generally, was simply throwing sawdust in the eyes of the farmers.  The Minister tried to throw more than sawdust into the eyes of the members of the House when he claimed for this agreement that it had any part in reducing the adverse trade balance last year.  He supplied answers yesterday in the House dealing with the trade with Spain and the answers that he provided yesterday show that, so far from improving our adverse trade balance, our trade with Spain last year was responsible for adding £78,000 to the adverse trade balance of the country.  I would like to know from the Minister how he expects the House to help him to do any work to improve either commercial or general conditions in the country if he can brazenly tell the House that the agreement with Spain was responsible for an improvement in our adverse trade balance when the facts that he put before us yesterday show that our adverse trade balance increased in the case of Spain by £78,880, and that we paid £18,260 in bounties for the very doubtful privilege of increasing our adverse trade balance by that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the Minister stated that there were very good grounds for having this agreement, and for keeping to it, in that the Spanish market for eggs under present conditions was more valuable and more promising than the British market.  The Minister for Agriculture admitted yesterday that, between 1934 and 1935, the total amount of eggs imported into Great Britain had increased in value from £7,051,000 <Col N="998" /> to £7,776,000 while the export of our eggs to the British market fell from £894,000 to £711,000.  The total amount of eggs which we imported into Spain was less than one-third of the fall in the value of the eggs we imported into the British market last year, and, for the sake of an export of £51,000 worth of eggs to Spain, we paid £18,000 in bounties.  I find it very difficult to find words to describe what I think of a Ministerial attitude of that kind.  The Minister treated the House not only with contempt, but, I think, with insolence, and, unless he can do something to get some other kind of agreement with Spain, we could improve our trade balance and save some of the money which is being paid by the taxpayers of this country, by cutting out trading with Spain completely.</P>

      <P>I have often in the past had to advise Deputy Mulcahy to keep away from statistics.  I renew my advice.  They are a source of perpetual danger to him, leading him into wrong conclusions, inducing him to make foolish arguments and generally to indicate that he does not appreciate anything of importance relating to the trading position of this country or of any country.  We have imported no more in consequence of the agreement with Spain than we would have imported if that agreement had not been made.  Our imports were not increased.  The quantity of oranges which we purchased from Spain we would have purchased in any event, if not from Spain, from some other country, but we definitely have increased our exports and our exports not merely to Spain, but generally. Having increased our exports without increasing our imports, there was an improvement in our adverse trade balance.  I do not know if Deputy Mulcahy understands that yet.</P>

      <P>There are two answers to that.  One is that we bought oranges from Spain which we would not have <Col N="999" /> bought if the treaty were not made, but we would have bought them from somewhere else.  Our total import of oranges was not increased in consequence of the agreement.  Our total exports were and, therefore, the adverse trade balance was less.  There is, however, more than that in it. When I gave Deputy Mulcahy these figures, I knew he was going to fall into some error like that into which he has fallen now, and I carefully put at the end of the figures a note which I thought would prevent him from making some glaring mistake such as that he is making.  I pointed out that the figures for 1934, in so far as they related to imports into this country, were figures for goods imported from the country of consignment, whereas the figures for last year were figures for goods imported from the country of origin and that the figures could not be compared.  If Deputy Mulcahy will read again the answer to the Parliamentary Question he has before him, I think he will find that note carefully put in at the bottom of the list of figures in order to prevent him making a mistake we knew he would make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; that has got nothing to do with our total adverse trade balance.  It may have to do with the balance arising out of our trade with Spain, but I said that the Spanish trade agreement reduced our adverse trade balance, and so it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By the amount of the eggs we exported that we would not have exported if we had not made the agreement.  The second point is that the egg market in Spain is a valuable market which shows very great possibilities for the future.  It is important for us, not merely that we should avail of the opportunities in that market, but should build up a goodwill for our egg trade there.  That is what we are doing.  We did not send eggs to Great <Col N="1000" /> Britain last year in the same quantities as previous years because it paid us better to send these eggs to Spain and Germany instead.  That is good business. If the Spaniards are willing to pay us more for the eggs there is no reason why we should not sell them to the Spaniards instead of to the British. There was a very substantial increase in our egg trade with Spain last year, an increase which we hope is going to be continued in the future.</P>
      <P>A new market, a valuable market and one that offers considerable prospects of expansion, has been opened up in consequence of that agreement, and no matter what Deputy Mulcahy may try to convince himself of, in relation to these matters, everybody who has any knowledge of the subject knows that to be the case and, in fact, the recent discussion which we had on this matter on the Second Reading of this Bill was followed by a most remarkable publication of communications in the Press from people who did know something about it, pointing out all the errors made by Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Dillon during the discussion. Deputy Dillon, I notice, is absent from the House this afternoon. He is not usually absent from a discussion in the Dáil but he made such a complete <i>faux pas</i> here last week, showed his colossal ignorance of the position in respect of the trade in oranges and produced such a volume of repudiation from the people who knew something about it that his absence is easily understood.  But Deputy Mulcahy is more insistent.  No doubt he is anxious to learn, and I am anxious to teach him.</P>

We increased our exports; we did not increase our imports. Consequently, our adverse trade balance was reduced.  When saying this, I am referring to our total exports <Col N="1001" /> and imports and not merely to the particular volume of goods that passed to or from Spain.</P>

      <P>I move that, pursuant to the provisions of any Act of the present Session to authorise the refund by way of drawback of the Customs duty paid on coal and certain like substances which were in stock at the cesser of that duty, it is expedient to authorise the payment to registered importers of a drawback at the rate of 5/- the ton on all coal and on solid fuel composed wholly or mainly of coal or coal dust imported into Saorstát Eireann, which were in the ownership or possession of such registered importers on the expiration of the 24th day of January, 1936.</P>

      <P>Oh, no, but the <Col N="1002" /> equity of drawing of Money Resolution as closely as this is drawn.  The intention of this measure generally was to do justice to certain people who had incurred certain expenditure as a result of the tax of 5/- existing on coal up to the 14th February.  In connection with the taking off of that tax, the managers of the labour exchanges in the country went to coal importers, and in some instances to coal merchants, and, at least in the case of a number of coal merchants in Castleblayney, asked them to reduce the price of coal from the 14th February by 5/- a ton.  From the approaches made, and the documents placed in front of them, they thought that they were being given a Government order to reduce the price of the coal that they had then in stock by 5/-, and they signed the agreement.  They have since made representations to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, but have been told that they did not come within the proposed scheme for the refund of 5/- per ton.  So here we have a general class of people in the country who are being done out of this 5/-.  In that class you have a certain number of people who, as a result of what I may call misrepresentation from a Government Department, reduced the price of their coal from the 14th February, on the understanding that they were to get a refund of the 5/- on the stocks they had in hands.  Now these people are told that they are not to get that reduction.  I would like to hear from the Minister for Finance what is the equity of this business, and whether he proposes to introduce an amendment in order to restore the 5/- to the merchants in the country who had substantial stocks of coal on hand on the 14th February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>But the Minister had information that managers of the labour exchanges in the country actually went to coal merchants and put documents before them leaving them under the belief that this was a Government order to reduce the price of the coal they had in stock, and leaving them under the belief that they would get a refund of 5/- per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information in regard to that matter such as the Opposition claims to have, but I do know that an official announcement was issued from the Government Bureau on the 25th January, indicating that it was proposed to reduce the duty on coal held in stock by registered importers on the 14th February.  If any people were under a misapprehension they could have communicated with us. At any rate, I gather that the people in Castleblayney knew they were not registered importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will admit that if it was possible for officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce to be under a misapprehension, then ordinary people can be excused if they were under a misapprehension in the matter, as a result of a conversation that took place between those people and the merchants, leaving them under the impression that they were to get this 5/- back. Surely they deserve some consideration in this matter.  However, that is only one aspect of the question. I would like the Minister to deal with the equity of the position where a registered importer has a depot in Cork and a distributing office, as against a Limerick merchant who is not a registered importer.  The branch office of <Col N="1004" /> the Cork firm is going to get a refund in respect of the coal it has in stock, but the Limerick merchant is not going to get a refund.  I should like the Minister to say something as to the equity of proceedings of that kind.</P>

      <P>I dealt with that question on Second Reading.  This is an attempt to have another Second Reading debate.  The House has accepted the principle of the Resolution, which if it is drawn in narrow terms follows the custom of basing the Resolution on the long title of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has not accepted the principle of the Resolution. The House allowed the Second Reading of the measure to go through because it had enshrined in it a proposal which was just to one class of the community.  The House could not oppose that proposal of sectional justice simply because there was another class of the community to whom justice was not being done.</P>

      <P>If the Minister's contention were held to be correct, it would be impossible for Deputies to say anything at all on the Resolution.  We could not propose an amendment extending the principle, as that would be calculated to place an extra charge on the Exchequer.  Discussion should be allowed on the Financial Resolution in order that the case may be argued in an orderly way that further and better provision ought to be made so as to permit of substantial justice being done to everybody.  The plain reason for the Minister's attitude is very simple.  As usual, the Minister for Finance lost his head, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce lost his head.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They proceeded to flounder about, and they determined that the best thing they could do was to make this remission available to registered importers.  There is evidence of that out of the Minister's own mouth.  On Second Reading, he said that there were infinitely more registered coal importers than there were <Col N="1005" /> coal merchants, showing that he knew as much about the coal business as he knew about the Valencia oranges. Anybody who goes up and spins a story to him can get him to believe it, and then he acts on that representation. I believe that he thought he was doing substantial justice in providing for the registered coal importers.  He thought that the vast majority of the people who deal in coal were registered coal importers and that by providing for them the remainder of the people engaged in the coal business would suffer only a trivial loss. Labouring under that misapprehension, he has made a grave mistake and done a substantial injustice.  The coal merchants who are not registered coal importers far outnumber the coal merchants who are registered importers. The Minister has placed the registered coal importers in a very advantageous position for the purpose of competition in trade, and he has also penalised the coal merchants, scattered all over the country, who, in a desire to co-operate with him, laid in large stocks of coal and endeavoured to protect their immediate neighbourhood against any danger of shortage which would accrue if there were a coal strike in Great Britain.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  The Government made it known pretty generally that they thought there might be a coal strike and that precautions should be taken, and the coal merchants of Letterkenny, Ballybofey and other towns laid in large stocks of coal to provide against that emergency.  Within a week of the accumulation of these stocks of coal, the Government takes off the tax of 5/- a ton and demands that the remission be made forthwith all over the country.  That is manifestly inequitable, and it arises from the ignorance of the Ministers responsible for drafting the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is possible to remedy that error of judgment, arising from incompetence and ignorance, I believe the Minister has the goodwill to remedy it, but, as he and his colleagues have frequently found, when they put their foot in it once, it is often very difficult to get it out.  If they cannot get their feet out of this mess, then let some <Col N="1006" /> good, at least, come out of evil and let them learn from this example not to put their foot in it again, but to think for five minutes before they plunge into action.  If they would only do that, it is highly improbable that they would find themselves in the awkward position in which they now are.</P>

      <P>A point of some importance has been raised by the Minister and by Deputy Dillon as to the limits of discussion on a Money Resolution.  The primary function of the Oireachtas is, the Chair considers, financial control.  A Money Resolution affords opportunity for discussing all the aspects of the Bill which it covers. As to the suggestion that the debate is in the nature of a resumption of the Second Reading debate, I deprecate the suggestion, but the Chair should be loth to curtail discussion on a Money Resolution, Deputy Mulcahy was quite in order in raising now certain matters which he would be precluded from raising on the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

I am not as prone to betting as Deputy Dillon is, but he did say that the number of coal merchants far exceeded the number of registered coal importers.  As I said, I am not a betting man, but I am willing to give Deputy Dillon 2 to 1 in Spanish oranges that he does not know how many registered coal importers there are, and that he cannot at this moment tell the House how many coal merchants there are.  He has led the House to believe that he has figures in his possession which will convict one Minister or another of ignorance and incompetence in regard to this matter. I know that it is difficult for the Deputy to sit in the House and remain silent.  I shall give him an opportunity now of adducing to the House the facts upon which he based his statement.</P>

      <P>The Minister should satisfy the House as to the equity of another aspect of this proposal. I notice that recently the Ministerial Press and Ministers are running into this betting business.  Only the other day the Government organ found a reporter who found a coal merchant who offered to pay £10 to any one of three charitable organisations in the city if it could be proved that coal importers were making a profit of 2/4½ a ton on coal.  The day after the Controller of Prices came along and with one sweep, the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us to-day, an order was made, after a little bit of persuasion or recommendation and 1/- went wallop off whatever profits less than 2/4½ a ton the poor importers were making.  I am not impressed by that argument.  I should like to put a case to the Minister on the Money Resolution before the House which proposes to give relief to registered importers only.  Take the case of merchants who bought, when the 5/- tax was on.  That 5/- has had to come off. Merchants have had no margin inside which to make any recoupment in respect <Col N="1008" /> of their loss on the tax.  It does not seem to me to be so with coal importers.</P>
      <P>There was an announcement recently that the Controller of Prices had intervened, saying that 37/- a ton was too much to charge bellmen at the present time.  Whether by order, by suggestion or by recommendation the cost of coal to bellmen as sold by importers, was reduced by 1/- as a result of the action of the Controller.  The Controller of Prices intervened on the question of prices to bellmen two years ago, when the import price of coal at the port was 21/4.  He told the importers that a margin of 8/8 between the import price and the price at which they were selling to bellmen was unreasonably high.</P>

      <P>I am only making a simple comparison of the position of importers and merchants.  I wanted to say that if 8/8 was too much of a margin two years ago, when there was intervention recently by the Controller of Prices, after taking off the 5/- tax, importers were allowed to keep a margin of 10/9, so that they are 2/1 a ton better off in sales to bellmen to-day than they were two years ago. That class has been particularly picked out by this Money Resolution to get the assistance and relief that is enshrined in it.  The people who are being assisted owing to the lifting of the tax are the people who seem to have been best able to soften the blow of the tax. That action makes the iniquity of the proposal all the more unreasonable.</P>

      <P>No.  If there is an importer in Cork with 100 tons of coal on hands, and if he has a subsidiary store in some town in County <Col N="1010" /> Limerick in which there are 200 tons, consider the position of another merchant in some town in County Limerick who gets coal from the Cork importer, and who has 200 tons on hands on which he had to pay the 5/- tax. On such stocks as were on hands on February 14, merchants reduced prices by 5/-, and the importer, in respect to stocks in Cork and in the Limerick town got a refund of 5/- a ton, while the other merchant with 200 tons in stock will not get it, although he has not only paid the 5/- tax to the importer but, if the position was examined, has paid 6/- or 6/6. Two months after the tax went on there was an unexplained rise in the price of coal charged to bellmen in Dublin.  I am talking of bellmen's prices only because these are the prices that are easily ascertainable for good standard household coal.</P>

      <P>You will not say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; in a moment.  The Minister has included in the Bill a rebate to coal importers.  That seems to be accepted as bare justice but the Minister, either now or on the Second Reading, did not give any reasons why a refund should be given to importers and not to merchants.  Surely coal or any commodity is not in production until it is in the hands of the consumer.  Coal in the hands of an importer is no more <Col N="1011" /> in the hands of a consumer than coal in the hands of the producer.  Whatever case could be made for one could be made for the other.  If it is justice in the one case I hold it is justice in the other case.  All this prevarication of Deputy Donnelly will not get away from that fact.</P>

      <P>If it was done when a tax was imposed in the past, and if the merchants got the benefit, did not the importers also get the benefit?  Can Deputy Donnelly deny that they got it, and probably got a greater margin than the merchants got?  If it is unsound because of that reason to advocate a rebate to the merchants, it is equally unsound to include in the Bill a rebate to the importers.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, everybody in this country was expecting a shortage of coal because of the threatened strike in Great Britain.  Having no alternative, under the republican form of government, but to import coal from Great Britain, a strike in Great Britain meant no coal here.  If importers and merchants filled their stores with coal in these circumstances were they not performing a national duty?  What a howl would go up from the people if some morning we woke up and found no coal coming in from the country to which we had bound ourselves hand and foot to import from and from no other?</P>

      <P>Take a little of your own medicine.  There is no use in labouring the point.  Anybody who honestly thinks for a moment sees it. The whole point boils down to this.  It is conceded that it must be given to <Col N="1012" /> the importers.  Why not give it to the merchants?  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted that case and perhaps made some attempts to make the case, on the Second Reading, that they had to draw the line somewhere.  I agree with that.  But that line should only be drawn when it comes to the point where, if you cross it, the coal is in consumption.  If a factory bought 500 tons of coal for its own use that coal was in consumption and that would be a reasonable place to draw the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot blow hot and cold.  You are definitely not going to give any refund to the consumer.  I am not advocating that the consumer should not get it.  The reasonable line of demarcation between production and consumption is at the point where the trader parts with the coal to the consumer. If it were practicable to go into every cellar and examine the amount of coal in it, a refund should be given; but if the Minister said that was not practicable I would agree with it.  It is not practicable when we consider the number of cellars with a ton, or two tons, or three tons, or five tons of coal in them in this city, and the other cities and towns in the country, bought in for consumption.  We have to draw the line, and I think that would be a reasonable place to draw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Merchants who have a couple of hundred tons in their yards paid the tax on that in the inclusive price at which they bought it.  They have to sell that coal.  If they do not get a refund, they will lose that 5/- tax.  Their competitors, the importers, can drop their prices immediately and have the same margin of profit as before.  Deputy Mulcahy says they have a greater <Col N="1013" /> profit.  I do not know, because I have not gone into the figures closely.  I am dealing entirely with the principle. I suggest that when the Minister made up his mind to give a refund to the importers he should have extended that principle to the merchants.  There was no use in his looking for information on the 21st January in connection with something that came into operation on the 20th January.  The Government have many organisations throughout the country which could have procured that information for them.  Before the Minister made it public that the 5/- duty would be remitted, he should have taken stock of all the coal in the merchants' yards and in the importers' yards.  Whatever information he got about the importers, he could as easily have got about the merchants.</P>
    <P>There is no need to labour the principle too much as the Minister sees it. I understood that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, admitted the principle on the Second Reading, and that the only excuse they gave for not including the merchants was the difficulty of ascertaining what stocks they had. That being so, I consider that the Minister handled the situation very badly.</P>

      <P>I do not want to give the Deputy an opportunity of playing to the gallery and saying that he is for the consumer.  The Deputy is not for the consumer; he is many degrees away from him.  He has not got over the merchants, big or small, to get to the consumer.  I would say in reply to the Deputy that the same principle operates in the case of merchants for a refund as operates in the case of importers.  Whatever reason there is for refunding the tax to the importers, there is precisely the same reason for refunding it to the merchants.  I should be glad to hear the Deputy drawing a distinction between the two, as in both cases the coal is in production.  The coal is in production till it is taken over for consumption.  It is in production <Col N="1014" /> while in the possession of the importer; it is equally in production while it is in the possession of the merchant. When it leaves the merchant's yard and goes to a firm which is going to use it, it is then in consumption.  That is a definite line of demarcation.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill admitting the principle that the consumer should get a refund, but there is a provision in the Bill to give the refund to the importer.  I cannot see why that principle should not be extended to the merchant who is equally in production with the importer.  I want to emphasise this point, that the Deputy's innuendo or insinuation is that my concern is with the importer and the merchant and that I would not extend it to the consumer.  Does the Deputy advocate extending it to the consumer? If he does, I will support him.  Does he advocate that now?</P>

I will accept the Minister as having far superior intelligence to me if he can give this House a sound explanation as to why an importer of coal is entitled to a rebate of 5/- a ton and <Col N="1015" /> the merchant who bought coal off that importer, and who still has it in his store waiting to sell it to somebody else, is not entitled to any rebate.  If he can give a sound explanation of that he certainly has intelligence superior to mine, and his powers of perception are far superior to mine.  But the Minister gets away from that.  I asked Deputies Donnelly and Smith not to wave the flag of the poor consumer at all.  These Deputies see the game.  I would be very glad to hear the Minister dealing with that point, for in reality that is the sole point in this whole discussion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to present this case from a slightly different angle from that of the previous speakers.  I regard this Bill from a slightly different standpoint.  Most of the Deputies who have spoken, whether they meant it or not, have been possessed by one idea&mdash;that there is a clear-cut distinction between the coal importer and the coal merchant.  That is not so so far as my county is concerned. I hold in my hand circulars of which I presume the Minister for Industry and Commerce has got copies. They are from people in Castleblayney and Ballybay.  For the information of Deputies, I should like to give a few particulars, being as I am so near the Border.  I will take the town of Monaghan, for example.  Every coal merchant in the town of Monaghan is a registered importer of coal.  That is because the Minister for Industry and Commerce, owing to its convenience, allowed imports of coal across the land frontier up to last year.  Those people in the town of Monaghan and along that section of the country are coal importers and coal merchants at the same time.  But the towns of Ballybay and Castleblayney are on a different line.  They are on the line from Dundalk to Clones.  They never had any need to become registered importers. They dealt directly with the coal as they got it.  I am talking now of my own county, and I am giving an example of two different types of merchants who are dealing with coal.  On the one side you have the coal importer who, under the terms of the Bill, would <Col N="1016" /> be entitled to a drawback or rebate, whereas the coal merchant who bought all his stocks from the importer would not be entitled to this rebate of 5/-. These two classes are of course operating in the same area; one might call them distributors to neighbours in that area.  In the matter of contracts with local asylums, the practice has been that wherever Government interference came in&mdash;that is, in either putting taxes on it or taking off taxes&mdash;the amount of these taxes was added to the contracts, or <i>vice versa</i> in cases where the taxes were reduced.  But now in this particular case we have the fact that the manager of the local labour exchange called on these merchants in Castleblayney on the 24th January last and asked them to sign a circular bearing the Government's stamp agreeing to reduce the price of coal by 5/- a ton.  That, to my mind, was an act unprecedented in its operation&mdash;that people should be asked to sign a circular to reduce their coal prices by 5/- a ton and asked to do this officially.  One would expect that such an order would not be given unless the Government contemplated making some concession to these coal merchants.  That is the case that has been put up by those people.  I think it is very reasonable, when the Government interferes with the normal course of business, asking the merchants to reduce their prices by 5/- a ton&mdash;and the merchants took this as a compulsory order&mdash;that they should be given a corresponding relief.  Now it appears they have not been given any relief whatsoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think Deputy Donnelly should accuse me of trying to get any kudos for Fine Gael from it, but I only want to point out the direction in which this leads.  Why should we give such a concession to a coal importer who is also a coal merchant and leave the coal merchants who are not importers without any concession?  If the rebate is good for one it is equally good for the other.  Some Deputy pointed out earlier this evening that some time before the 24th January a strike was threatened in the coal mining areas in England.  Naturally, merchants were anxious to be in a <Col N="1017" /> position to serve their customers. They were not doing it for nothing, but, after all, a man in business wants to be in a position to supply stuff to his customers.  These people put in stocks of coal, and like a bolt from the blue this change came and 5/- a ton was allowed on the stocks of the importers, but nothing was taken off the stocks of those people who had large quantities of coal in their stores. We all know that the ordinary business man must take his chance.  Here you have the position where a Government official appears with an official order and goes to the merchants and says: &ldquo;You must reduce your coal by 5/- a ton from to-day.&rdquo;  Surely under these circumstances there should be something given to these men to recoup them for their loss.  That is my point of view in this matter.  It is only reasonable that when there are stocks of coal that can be certified in the merchants' stores on the 24th January, that these merchants and distributors of coal have just as good a right to the rebate as the coal importer.  None of us believe that the coal importer is in the business for the love of it.  But if he is importing the coal and paying the tax and putting that tax on to the merchant, why should a rebate be given to him and none to the coal merchant or distributor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton described the arguments of the Government Party as playacting.  It was almost as good a word for it as anything else.  Certainly there is no logic in either the Minister's defence of this proposal or in the defence of any Deputy who spoke on that side.  If the Minister has to agree to a drawback at all, then he should certainly not discriminate as to certain classes of persons who are entitled to that drawback. If X is entitled to a drawback. on certain coal which he retails, having already paid the tariff which has now been remitted, then certainly Y, who trades in exactly the same coal on which the same tax has been paid, is entitled to the same privilege.  The Minister's only defence, as far as I can see, was that it would be difficult to get information amongst the several coal traders in this country.  The <Col N="1018" /> merchants and coal traders all over the country are just as reliable as the average importer, and measures could be adopted to estimate correctly the amount of coal they had in stock on 24th January, just as measures have been arranged to estimate the quantity which importers had.  There would be a little difference in it, but not very much.  The real reason behind the whole argument of the Minister&mdash;which is devoid of logic&mdash;is that the Minister, having tried to bamboozle everybody that he was giving a drawback on the coal which was imported and not retailed, is trying to save money for the revenue by a subterfuge.  That is the long and short of it.  He is saving, by subterfuge, at the expense of the unfortunate retailers in this country, who are in exactly the same position as the importers to whom he is giving the privilege.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill do now pass.  The reason I do that is in order that we may give effect to the announcement which was issued on 21st January&mdash;an announcement which either has, in good faith apparently, been misunderstood by some people who are interested in this coal business, or else has been well understood and is now being dis <Col N="1021" /> regarded.  This matter arises out of a statement which, as I have already said, was issued on 21st January, 1936.  It was worded as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In view of the increase in coal prices consequent on the dispute in the coal industry in Great Britain, the Government has decided on the withdrawal of the duty of 5/- per ton on imported British coal.  For this purpose an Order under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1932, will be made at next Friday's meeting of the Executive Council.  It is proposed to refund the duty paid on the coal held in stock by registered importers as at midnight on Friday, January 24th.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was the undertaking.  This Bill is here in pursuance of that undertaking, and in order to fulfil it.  It relates only to those who are mentioned in the announcement&mdash;registered coal importers.  If a minor officer of the Government approached any person who was not a registered coal importer, that person presumably had this notice before him because he must have realised that it affected his trade one way or another, and if he were asked to sign any form or give any undertaking he could have pointed out that he, to his own knowledge, was not a registered coal importer, and if he had any doubt as to whether he came within the terms of that declaration or not, he could have communicated with responsible people and have cleared up the position.  But now, almost one month after the issue of that statement, Deputies come here and ask us to do an impossible thing: ask us to repay duty on stocks which we could not possibly check, and which were alleged to be in existence on the 24th January last.</P>
      <P>Now what is the position, and why was it decided that this concession would have to be confined to registered coal importers?  Because the registered coal importers are the only people in this country whose stocks could be checked with any certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Government by the officers appointed by the Dáil, through the Ministry, to carry on the administration of this country: the people who have responsibility for answering to the Public Accounts Committee and of accounting to the Comptroller and Auditor-General for the proper expenditure of public money.  They have advised me, and I think on good grounds, that if the proposal to make this drawback were not to be confined to the registered coal importers, it would be virtually impossible to make that drawback and to safeguard the State from fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the purpose for which it was decided that a drawback should be given was this: in the normal course of events, when a duty is being removed, it is removed as from a date which gives those who hold stocks an opportunity of clearing those stocks. The reason for that is easily understandable, because if sufficient time were not given to clear stocks, as a rule it would be those who held the stocks and not the general public, on the one hand, who have to purchase a commodity which carries duty, or the Exchequer, on the other hand, for whose benefit the duty was imposed, but it is those middlemen between the Exchequer and the consumer who would reap the profit as they reap a profit when a duty is imposed.  No person here has denied that when this coal duty was first imposed those who held stocks in the country immediately advanced the price of coal to consumers. They made a profit then which was an uncovenanted profit.  If any people who held stocks then and made a profit by reason of the duty having been imposed, and if, by reason of the duty having been removed now, they suffer, not an absolute loss on the sale of the coal because no person here has ventured to say that&mdash;certainly not the Opposition, in view of the propaganda that they were carrying on through the country for three or four weeks preceding the removal of the coal duty, <Col N="1023" /> propaganda which started significantly enough as soon as it became known that, pending the conclusion of the discussions which were then proceeding, a renewal of the coal-cattle pact had been agreed on.  Certainly the Opposition and those in the country who had been contending, during the three or four weeks that preceded this announcement, that there was undue profiteering in coal, could not come here and try to tell the House that those who held stocks of coal were going to have to dispose of those stocks at a loss in consequence of the removal of the duty.  Therefore I do not think that any substantial injustice, or any injustice, is being done to those who held coal in stock even if they were not registered coal importers.</P>
    <P>Now, why was it decided to make this concession at all?  It was decided to do so in order that the poorer consumers might get the benefit of the reduction at the earliest possible moment.  It would be an impracticable thing, as even Deputy Belton himself has admitted, to grant a remission to everyone.  Not merely would it be an impracticable thing but it would be a foolish thing.  This tax was imposed for revenue purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It completely changed its character, as Deputy Davin himself was one of those who contended, and as we never denied, from the moment that most of the coal imported into this country fell under the tax we had to impose upon it.  Otherwise, we were not going to be in a position to provide the social services for which Deputy Davin and his Party were continuously clamouring.  It was only when it became clear, as I said the other day, that the budgetary position would justify and would permit a remission of this duty, that the duty was removed. Now the point is this, that in removing the duty we had regard to the position of the poor.  I may say <Col N="1024" /> that, so far as the personal approach of every member of the Executive Council to this problem was concerned, we had regard to the circumstances in which, owing to the threatened dispute in the coal trade in England, the poorer sections of our people would have found themselves, and we did decide that some extraordinary step would have to be taken, and should be taken, if possible, in order that this remission of the duty might become immediately effective so far as those who buy coal from bellmen and others of that class were concerned.  Because it was the case of the bellmen that was being held up in order to arouse public opinion on this question, and the people from whom the bellmen in general buy their coal are the registered coal importers.  Accordingly, there were these two facts to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised, and I believe, that it is only the stocks of the registered coal importers that could be checked in order to find out what coal did actually pay duty.  Now, when Deputies talk about this matter they quite forget that even when the duty was imposed for revenue purposes there was coming into this country a very large proportion of coal duty free.  It is possible that not more than two-thirds of the total imports of coal paid duty, and the only people who keep registers which would enable us to check what quantity of coal they had imported duty free and what quantity of coal came in paying duty, are the registered importers.  The making of a revenue check on stocks of coal is not like making a check on stocks of tea or sugar. People like Deputy Dillon, who mouth so easily terms such as &ldquo;incompetence&rdquo; and &ldquo;ignorance&rdquo; ought to realise that.  If the Revenue Commissioners have to check, say, a tea merchant's stock, their officials go down and see the tea neatly packed in boxes or cases, or whatever it may be, and these boxes or cases can be weighed and checked quite rapidly and easily.  Send an official of the Revenue Commissioners, however, into a coal merchant's office, as distinct from that of a registered coal importer, and let him look at a heap of coal&mdash;let any <Col N="1025" /> Deputy here, if he likes, go down and look at a heap of coal, perhaps of many tons&mdash;and let that official or any Deputy say to himself: &ldquo;How am I going to determine, with the obligations imposed on me of not making a mistake, what amount of this coal has paid duty and what has not; how am I going to assess the weight of coal in that heap; am I going to bring in ten or 12 navvies and start checking the coal and weighing it, ton by ton; and, if I am to do that, at whose expense will it be done&mdash;will it be at the expense of the coal merchant or at the expense of the State?&rdquo; I am giving this as an instance of the practical difficulties in the way of those who say that everybody in the community&mdash; Deputy Belton would not have stopped even at the merchant, but would have us go to every coal cellar in the country in order to try to find out what amount of coal was in stock on the night of the 24th January&mdash;these are the difficulties in the way of the people who say we should be able to check up on all this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a special justification in the case of the coal importers?  If, as is now admitted, a rebate could not be granted in the case of the consumers who have had to bear the burden of the duty, surely, in equity, those who were able to make a profit when the duty was put on, and who still are able to dispose of their stocks, cannot be granted a rebate.  As has been already admitted by Deputy Belton, there are practical difficulties in the way of granting a rebate to everyone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The line has to be drawn somewhere, and it appeared to us that the only place in which the line <Col N="1026" /> could be drawn, with security to the Revenue and in justice to the House&mdash; because the House does not want to give the Minister for Finance or anybody else power to pay a drawback of duty to people who are not entitled to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it appeared to us that the only place in which the line could be drawn, where the Revenue Commissioners would feel that no drawback, in general, was being paid on coal on which duty had not been paid, was at this very carefully-defined list of the registered importers of coal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, when speaking, said that the registered importers were only a small minority.  That was apparently what he wanted the House to believe. He did not say so in so many words, but he said that, in his opinion, the coal merchants far outnumbered the registered coal importers, and, when I challenged him on that, he replied, with equal jocoseness, that, if he were asked to compare the number of hairs on one Deputy's head with the number of hairs on another Deputy's head, he might answer so-and-so.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the registered coal importers do far outnumber the coal merchants, as distinct from importers, in the country.  The essential thing is that substantial justice is being done, and that is all that can be asked for as well as being all that we can guarantee to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been so highly amused as on this occasion in listening to the innocent suggestions put forward by this innocent Minister for Finance.  The Minister wants the House to believe that the officials of the Revenue Commissioners have advised him that the registered coal importers are the only people, affected by this measure, whose stocks could be checked with certainty.  I wonder does he believe that statement himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reasonably sure of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that a lot of the coal <Col N="1027" /> merchants in the provincial towns in this country are not alone coal merchants, but are carrying on other businesses associated with the sale of coal.  The Revenue Commissioners have been watching these people very closely, and rightly so, for the purpose of checking their sales and finding out what profits they have made in the businesses they are carrying on.  In carrying out these operations, the Revenue Commissioners are able to check the stocks that the merchants have taken in, the prices at which the stocks are being purchased, and the prices at which these coal merchants sell their stocks to the local people.  In that way they can check the profits of these people in just the same way as they can check the profits of the registered coal importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking of checking profits.  Is the Deputy talking of checking stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but checking stocks means that, with the proper books being kept, they can check the stocks that came in on a particular date, knowing perfectly well what duty was paid, and they can also check the price at which the coal has been sold to the local people.  I am sure that any local person, who has any right to call himself a coal merchant, will have books to show which will satisfy the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister as to whether or not the benefit of this reduction has been conveyed to the local consumer.  I would be the last person, and my colleagues here, I am sure, would be the last persons, to appeal to the Minister for any consideration for either importers or merchants who have been charging such unduly high prices for a long time.  I want the Minister, however, to reconsider whether or not he is doing an injustice to some of the coal merchants in the way this Bill is about to be administered.  I know of the case of one merchant, who works on a large scale, and who, on the very day this announcement was made, telephoned to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in Dublin and advised him of <Col N="1028" /> the amount of coal that he had in hands on that day.  In the statement made by this particular coal merchant he indicated the actual tonnage of coal on hands on the date in question, and stated quite definitely&mdash;and, I believe, can prove it&mdash;that as from that particular date he dropped the price of coal by 5/- to the consumers in the town concerned.  Now, I contend that, in fairness to coal merchants of that type, provided that these statements can be checked and can be proved to be accurate, such merchants are just as entitled to the rebate as the registered coal importers; that is, provided that the facts can be proved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any appeal for any merchant of that type unless the officials can be perfectly satisfied&mdash;as I am sure they can be&mdash; from the records available that the position is as stated.  Registered importers have been making the same profits, and have been taking advantage of the threat of the British coal strike, in the same way as the coal merchants, and, as far as I am concerned, there is very little difference between the registered coal importers and the coal merchants in that connection, either in Dublin or in the provinces.  If, however, the Minister wants to be fair and wants to give this benefit to the people who are properly entitled to it, in my opinion they are the people who can produce evidence that they have extended this benefit to the community in the present operations. I would not ask this for any of them unless the Minister were satisfied that that was the case, but the Minister should make up his mind that almost all the coal merchants in the provincial centres are carrying on operations in other spheres and that their books are available and can be checked in the same way as the books of the registered coal importers can <Col N="1029" /> be checked by the Revenue Commissioners for other purposes.  I appeal to him to look at the matter from that point of view and to take into consideration, in the administration of this measure, the claims of coal merchants who can satisfy the Minister's officials that, from the date of the announcement of this concession, they passed on the 5/- reduction to consumers to whom they sold coal.  These are the only people for whom I am asking consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There were portions of the Minister's statement which it was rather difficult to follow.  First of all he appeared to make the case that as the Government had made a statement on the 21st of January, this House was bound by that statement. Let him get rid of such hallucinations as that.  We are not bound by any decree, order or decision of the Executive Council.  That is for Parliament to decide.  That the Minister has a majority to support his Executive Council we do not dispute, but the fact that he has a majority to support him in connection with this matter is no indication whatever that there is either sense or meaning in the precise terms of the statement they made or in their conduct in connection with this matter. There is the usual explanation that we get from amateur Ministers that there are administrative difficulties in doing anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a little longer experience in administration than the Minister or any member of his Executive Council.  I might say I had even that advantage over the members of my own Executive Council.  I am not boasting of it, but it happens to be the fact.  I would advise the Minister, further, not to make such charges as he made here against one set of traders about whom no Minister can know enough to make such a statement.  It has often been said in this House that traders make profits on certain goods the moment a duty is imposed on them in this House.  People who make that statement do not know what they <Col N="1030" /> are talking about.  Quite a number of such traders do; quite a number do not.  Having been in business for a number of years, and having had dealings with firms whose goods were subject to fluctuating duties of one sort or another&mdash;even having had on more than one occasion dealings with coal merchants&mdash;I found that these wholesale traders and importers passed on whatever concessions they received on their stocks to their customers. It is not the invariable rule, but it is a rule from which reputable firms do not depart.  It is nonsense to say that because coal merchants had stocks on their hands at the time the duty was first imposed, they forthwith imposed that duty.  Why, even small traders do not do it.  Any advantage they obtain they pass on to their customers. I believe it is only fair to the customers, and perhaps fair to themselves, that when they do not have to pay the extra duty they should not charge it to their customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told there are enormous administrative difficulties in connection with this matter.  The same explanation was put up a couple of weeks ago.  The Minister complains that we are dealing with this matter on the 20th of February when this valuable statement was issued a month ago. It is not the fault of this House that we are considering on the 20th of February, a matter which the Government decided on the 20th of January. At the very first opportunity the House got, this proposal to exclude from the rebate certain coal merchants was criticised here.  The explanation that was given was that there were too many of these merchants and that it would be impossible to check the huge quantities or the small quantities, as the case might be, which they had in stock. Any man who has been in the coal business and who has been looking at his coal stocks, day in, day out, could give to an approximate stone, certainly to a cwt., what quantity he had in store on a certain day.  It is one of those things you can do by instinct after many years experience at the work.  It might not satisfy perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor-General but if the Comptroller and <Col N="1031" /> Auditor-General had a few examples before him of these men's competency to judge stocks and check them, perhaps he too would be satisfied that that was the best method. Nobody wants anything unreasonable but we do say it is unreasonable that where there are two traders alongside each other, or perhaps in different parts of the same town, one, who had perhaps only five tons in stock, is called upon to bear a loss of only 25/- by this transaction while the other, who had 100 tons in stock has to bear a loss of £25.  That sort of fluctuating business on the part of the Ministry gives rise to lack of confidence, distrust and dissatisfaction and it is bad from every sense of the word.</P>
    <P>We are told that it is difficult to get after a large number of these merchants. Yet you can get after them with regard to income tax.  The police can get after them if they contravene the law by neglecting to have lights on their motor cars or carts.  We are told that it is impossible to trace them now.  Why, if there is only an attache case lost in O'Connell Street, it is probably found by the police within a week.  They are useful for doing things of that sort but apparently they are no use in going round to interview coal merchants to find out what stock they had on a particular date.  Three or four years ago a duty was imposed on tea and at that time, certain quantities then in stock were made liable to the charge.  That was quite easy.  Why? Because the Revenue wanted all the money.  The Revenue has no divinity about it.  The Minister, I suppose, does not need a lecture in this House as to what led to the unpopularity of kings or what brought down despots. Executive councils and cabinets are taking the place of kings but there are means of disposing of them.</P>

      <P>They are finding out the mistakes they made in their charges and their criticisms, as we observe from the altered statements that are being made now and the changed outlook that has come about. If there is one thing more than another that will shake them, it is conduct such as is being pursued here.  What after all is the principle guiding, or the principle which should guide, Ministries?  Is it not justice? Very good.  Justice postulates that men should be treated fairly and equally.  Is this fair treatment as between the two merchants I have mentioned?  Assuming there were two such merchants, is it fair that a man who had 30 or 40 tons of coal in stock upon which he had paid tax is to be denied the rebate, while a far richer man is going to be allowed the full rebate?  It is not.  And to put up the excuse, the very lame excuse, that there are administrative difficulties in the way, makes the matter really worse.  A decision was taken on this matter on the 21st January. We are not affected by it in the least; but if the decision were wrong, if it were an unfair decision, then it is unfair to tax people for certain things which they in turn are not entitled to pass on to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has come badly out of this whole coal business.  The thing from beginning to end has all the appearance of dishonesty about it. The tax was put on, in the first instance, as a retaliatory tax.  It was then changed to a revenue tax.  The Minister tells us now that it was necessary to supply the social services. We have heard that about <Col N="1033" /> other taxes, about every tax that has been imposed by this Minister.  They have imposed £6,000,000 by way of extra taxes, and they spent £3,000,000 on social services.  Where are the other £3,000,000?</P>

      <P>The Minister has explained that the reason that dictated the taking off of the 5/- tax was in order to bring relief to the poor who were suffering as a result of high prices.  I want to charge him that he is losing an opportunity of bringing further relief to the poor and to other classes of people, by dealing with this refund of the 5/- on coal in the way in which he is doing it and without co-operation between himself and the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I agree that so far as we on this side are concerned we have found the Minister for Industry and Commerce quite truculent and impossible with regard to coal prices.  It may be the Minister for Finance has endeavoured to get more reasonable co-operation on his part and has failed.  I doubt, however, that he can have sought it, because there has been no evidence given in the discussion that a very important aspect of the matter has been taken into consideration and that is, that the classes to whom this refund is being paid as a matter of justice are, in fact, making substantial profits entirely arising out of the imposition of the tax and the quotas and licences that follow.  The opportunity should have been taken, when the Ministry was prepared as a matter of justice to hand back a certain substantial amount of money to them, to put up to them the case that is sticking out, and that is that they are not giving to other people the justice that the Ministry is prepared to give to them, and that they are now charging prices for coal of a high character <Col N="1034" /> that they would not have been able to charge if the operation of this coal tax and quotas and licences had not intervened to cloud up the situation that surrounds the coal importers.</P>
      <P>I want to put three facts before the Minister to show how just is the charge that is being made against him. Two years ago the Controller of Prices intervened when the import price of coal was 21/4 and said to the importers: &ldquo;You are charging the bellmen too much for coal; 8/8 above the import price is too much and you must reduce it.&rdquo;  Two years ago 8/8 was too much.  To-day the Controller of Prices, by a recommendation, endorses and approves of coal importers charging 11/- more than the import price.  Manufacturers in this city have drawn attention to the fact that coal can be quoted to them in lots up to 1,000 tons to the Port of Dublin, c.i.f. for 24/-.  The importers are charging 9/6 more than to the manufacturers.  To manufacturers buying substantial quantities of coal they are charging 9/6 more than the port price, whereas two years ago the Controller of Prices considered 8/8 over the port price too high to sell to retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third class much worse off than the bellmen or the bellmen's customers, or even the Irish manufacturers. I refer to the ordinary householder who can buy coal by the ton.  The prices charged to bellmen or Irish manufacturers are comparatively reasonable, if they could be called so, compared with the astoundingly high price charged to ordinary householders. The bellman has figured prominently in this discussion, because his price was a price easily available.  The class he serves includes people upon whom the price falls heavily.  Also, the bellman was a person who suffered very considerably in that he was the man who had to go to the poorest class of people in the city and collect the tax and the profits on the tax.  Therefore, he figured large in this discussion on coal prices.  But outside him and his customers and the Irish manufacturer who has the complaints I speak about, there is the wide circle of coal users who buy by the ton.  Before the Minister set about to refund this money to <Col N="1035" /> the importers he should have taken some steps with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to sit down with the coal importers and examine what the situation was, and draw their attention to the discrepancy that exists between their profits to-day and their profits two years ago.  I hope the discussion that has ranged around this and the further representations that will be made to the Minister and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter will drive him to be as quick in dealing with the relief of the coal consumers as he has been in dealing with the relief of coal importers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave put his finger on the weakness of the Minister's whole case.  The Minister spoke of the announcement made on a particular day, as if he were speaking of the Commandments given to Moses.  He said that all those people included in that announcement had a right to get the drawback and those who were not included knew they would not get it. Of course, there is where the hardship has come in and the Minister did not touch on that weak spot at all.  The arguments he used would be applicable to a case where he was giving no drawback. He attacked the merchants who are not importers and accused them of having got their whack when the tax was imposed; he said that they immediately put up the prices on existing stocks and reaped a handsome reward.  I do not know whether they did or not, but if they did, so did the coal importers, because two people in the same business trading with the same people cannot charge different prices, and if the merchants who are not importers reaped a harvest on a former occasion, so did the importers. That would be a sound argument if he were able to adduce evidence against any drawback at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be in a position, so far as the information I have now goes, to dispute that case with the Minister. The Minister said that I, on the Second Reading, saw a difficulty.  If the Minister made the case that it was impracticable and unprofitable to examine small quantities, I would say there was a lot in that argument, but <Col N="1036" /> he would not be brought down into small cellars to examine and give drawbacks on the stocks of merchants.  If the merchants, as he contends, are considerably less numerous than the importers, the job of checking them would be considerably less difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in no way critical of the Minister, although I am afraid he lost his temper a little with me.  I recognise his difficulty in the matter, but, to my satisfaction, at least, he has not made a case for giving the drawback to the importers and not to the merchants.</P>
      <P>He said that he was advised by his officials that it was enough to go to the coal importers, and that they were the only people whose stocks should be checked.  I interjected that, then, we were having Government by the permanent officials.  He then went on to say that these were the people responsible.  They are responsible for carrying out the decisions of this House, and if this House decides to give coal to people for nothing, it is no loss to the permanent officials. They have only to keep their books right according to that decision. Whether the merchants, as distinct from the coal importers, are to get drawbacks or not is a matter for this House and not for permanent officials. The Minister should stand above permanent officials in matter of policy and the making of laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said they were up against a difficulty in respect to the merchants, and asked how could they ascertain what would be in a heap of coal in a merchant's yard.  I know it is difficult, and I remember a similar difficulty, as to how much coal there was in a heap, in relation to a matter which I raised at a meeting of the Port and Docks Board.  I am not an expert. There was a time when, if I saw a clamp of turf, as we used to call it down the country, I could say to a load what was in it, even if there were 50 or 60 there.  I could not do it now&mdash;I am not burning native fuel like Deputy Donnelly.  While admitting that there <Col N="1037" /> is a difficulty in estimating what is in a heap of coal, I put this to the Minister: is he not confronted with precisely the same difficulty in estimating what is in an importer's yard?  He has not shown us&mdash;I hope he will when he is winding up the debate&mdash;that there is any difficulty in dealing with the matter generally in regard to merchants that is not also present in estimating the amount of stocks that an importer has.</P>
    <P>It does not carry us anywhere to get into ecstasies about alleged profiteering in the past, and about the profiteering that took place when the duty was imposed now, equating the loss.  If there is anything in that, why did not the Minister equate that all round?  If he took up that stand, it would be difficult to controvert him or to find fault with his attitude, but the difficulty I feel in following the Minister and the policy of the Government is that this is given to one class and not to another. There is not an argument put up by the Minister as to the difficulty of giving it to the other class which is not equally applicable to the class to whom he proposes to give it.  I should be glad if the Minister cleared up that point and gave us a definite, solid reason, a reason which the ordinary man in the street could accept and understand, why he gives it to one class and not to the other.</P>
    <P>I appreciate his remarks as to his not doing his duty as a Minister for Finance if he allowed any individuals to make a profit to which they were not entitled in a change like this.  He made a point which would be good in different circumstances: that amateurs would be called on to estimate the amounts in the yards of various merchants, that there might be overestimation and that drawback would be given to people in respect of more coal than they had in stock.  He claimed that about one-third of the coal imported did not pay duty, and that he could not follow that coal into the various merchants' yards.  There is something in that point, but it is very little; and if he finds difficulty in ascertaining whether coal held by merchants paid duty or not, he will find an equal difficulty in ascertaining whether coal <Col N="1038" /> in importers' yards paid duty or not I am certainly not satisfied, and I should be glad to see the Opposition challenging a division on it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy puts up many-sided arguments.  He will raise the flag of the poor consumer.  There are some people who would not have any political war cry if they could not talk about the poor slum dwellers. The Deputy was on to the poor consumer, but he switches to the poor coal importers.  Here is a Bill that gives what is accepted on all sides as a proper drawback to one class.  To that extent it should be supported. The same Bill does not give a drawback to another class which is entitled to it. It all boils down to this: that the Bill gives justice to one section of people and injustice to another.  To challenge a division upon this matter now, before it finally passes this House, is not opposing the justice done to one section, but it is opposing the injustice done to another section.  I do not know if Deputy Donnelly has a clear conscience about voting against injustice.  If he stands four-square behind this measure he is voting for injustice, and it is because there is a glaring injustice in the Bill, as it now stands, that I would welcome a division upon this measure, so that an opportunity would be given to Deputies to register their protest against inherent injustice, while in no way voting against the justice that is in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I lived in a provincial town as long as any Deputy in this House.  Deputy Haslett did not live far away from it, and we know that the slightest little scare in connection with coal always put the price up. That is the state of affairs.  These merchants about whom we hear such a wail of woe have not lost so much. No one imports coal as a philanthropist. They were not thinking of the general public when the rumour of the strike was on.  I think Deputy Belton said that they would have come in for a very speedy condemnation if it was found there were not sufficient supplies in the country.  Was that the consideration that induced merchants to get in supplies?  They did not do it for philanthropy at all.  In this particular interest the tax has been taken off the importers, and the allegation of Deputy Belton and the Opposition is that the same thing should apply to the merchants.  But if you go that far why not go further?  If you give the reduction to the importers and to the merchants, what is the argument against giving it to the consumers?</P>

      <P>I am very glad to see Deputy Mulcahy in the House.  He made a statement in regard to the profit which coal importers might reasonably make on their imports of coal.  In connection with that I should like to know the standard he takes. Deputy Mulcahy said that coal was being imported at 24/- a ton c.i.f., and when delivered to manufacturers they were charged 9/6 per ton more for it. I am not prepared to say whether that is a reasonable profit or not.  I have not, perhaps, the same intimate interest in the coal business that Deputies on the other side have.  I do not profess to have the knowledge on this subject which Deputy Mulcahy's leader, Deputy Cosgrave, pretends to have.  Deputy Cosgrave told us that it was a comparatively simple business to measure up the quantity of coal held in stock.  He practically indicated that a person who had been trained to detect breaches of the lighting laws and to recover lost or stolen property &mdash;one of the ordinary Gárdaí&mdash;could perform this task.  According to Deputy Cosgrave, if you lost an attaché case to-day in Dublin the Gárdaí would be certain to find it for you within a week.  It is pleasant and comforting information to some of us who are inclined to be absent-minded and to forget things in trams and buses to learn that we need not worry any more, that we are going to get back these lost articles within a week.  Not alone that, but these useful retrievers of lost property can now be relied upon to walk into a coal merchant's yard and indicate to the Revenue <Col N="1042" /> Commissioners not merely the amount of coal held in stock by that merchant, but, as the result of a glance, the proportion of that coal which has paid duty and the proportion which has come in duty free.  No doubt it is as a result of a confabulation with Deputy Cosgrave that Deputy Belton has made up his mind that it would be quite as simple a matter to deal with the stocks held by coal merchants as it would be to deal with the stocks held by registered coal importers.</P>

      <P>No.  I am advised by those who know that they have an absolute check on the stocks held by registered coal importers, while they have no check of any kind upon any other dealer in coal, big or little.  I should not profess to be able to tell Deputy Belton the difference between a sugar beet and a sugar mangel.  I should be prepared to take Deputy Belton's word if I had to ask him to differentiate between the two roots, because Deputy Belton is an authority on agriculture.  In the same way, I take the word of the Revenue Commissioners when they tell me that it is not possible to check the stocks held by one class of merchants, while it is possible to check the stocks held by another class. The Revenue Commissioners are authorities on that question.  I am not, therefore, disposed to accept the statement for which Deputy Cosgrave made himself responsible this evening, that a person accustomed to tracing lost attaché cases could quite easily deal with all the problems involved in the granting of drawbacks upon coal stocks.  I am certain that when he made that statement Deputy Cosgrave thought he knew everything about the coal business.  If Deputy Mulcahy has read the records of this House, he must have some doubt as to the extent of Deputy Cosgrave's knowledge. Deputy Mulcahy thundered last Wednesday, Thursday and to-day about the exorbitant profits which certain interests in the coal business are supposed to be making.

He regards a profit of 9/6 per ton, to cover all charges&mdash;harbour dues, freightage, handling, insurance and everything else&mdash;as excessive.  It may or may not be excessive.  If it is excessive, I wonder how Deputy Mulcahy would regard a profit of 22/- a ton, to cover not half of these charges? What would he think of a case in which, with Government backing, coal merchants imported 25,000 tons of coal and, in order to cover the normal profits of that transaction and other expenses, were allowed not 9/6 per ton but 22/- per ton?</P>

The merchants did no more than import 25,000 tons of coal under Government guarantee.  The then Government, consisting, as Deputy Cosgrave was careful to point out, of professional statesmen and possibly superannuated business men&mdash;they must have been on the retired list so far as commercial transactions were concerned&mdash;allowed the coal merchants two and a half times as much as Deputy Mulcahy considers an exorbitant profit.</P>

      <P>However, as you said, this debate has travelled very far.  I think that people who take the trouble to read it will read Deputy Cosgrave's speech, if it is reported, with a great measure of relief, because the Deputy, in reply to a question by <Col N="1045" /> Deputy Donnelly, indicated that if called upon to take office on the same terms as Fianna Fáil took office, he would not do so.  I think that an epoch-making announcement, and that now the country can breathe again. The great terror that has hung over it for the last few years has been averted by Deputy Cosgrave's statement.  He has informed the House that he will not take office.  That statement reminded me of the fable of the ancient Greek.  If you remember he told the story of a fox looking up at a bunch of grapes, who tried not once but twice and three times to reach the grapes and, like Deputy Cosgrave, when he couldn't get them, turned and left the grapes behind, saying they were sour.</P>

      <P>I wanted to ask for a few additional details when the Minister is winding up.  I am not aware that he gave any information on sub-head E&mdash;Defence of Public Officials.  I think he ought to tell the House the nature of the legal proceedings that were necessary in the defence of public officials, and to explain how it is that this sub-head has become larger with the passage of years.  Does it mean that inexperienced officials exceeded their jurisdiction, or is it that some <Col N="1046" /> wholly unique action has arisen? Under sub-head D&mdash;I see that additional fees to counsel represent £2,500. We have paid State Counsel in this financial year the comfortable sum of £12,000.  Is the Minister in a position to give any information there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, the Minister has already paid £4,900, and now within a few weeks from the end of the financial year wants an additional £2,500.  He is not paying that for fun. Apparently, he has been advised that it is highly likely this sum will be required before the end of the financial year.  Otherwise, he would not ask for it.  These are the only questions arising on this Estimate that I wish to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to appear discourteous, but I think there is a rule against needless repetition. I gave all this information last night. The Deputy asked about fees to counsel in respect to which we are asking for an increased provision of £2,500.  I would like to point out to the Deputy that it is not to be taken, because we are asking for £2,500, that that money is going to be spent.  We have to make provision for cases where unexpected expenses have been incurred against the Estimate, and we have to make provision to carry on until the end of the year.  There was an unexpected case. I do not want to dilate upon it.  I will tell the Deputy what it was afterwards. It was a case in which considerable State expenditure was incurred, and when I disclose what it was the Deputy will understand the necessity for it. It was one in which the State had to provide for the defence of prisoners and had, at the same time, to conduct a very expensive prosecution.  In regard to sub-head E, I explained to Deputy Cosgrave last night that the increased provision here is almost entirely due to the fact that costs were given against the State unexpectedly in the case of some officials.  The Deputy will also understand that in cases where ancient title is involved the Attorney-General is made a party to the suit.  It is unusual, I think, to <Col N="1047" /> give costs against the State.  It happens that in this case they were given against the State and amounted to £1,530.  The other cases for which special provision has been made in this Estimate were the actions taken by Cork and Louth County Councils.  In view of the manner in which these cases were disposed of, I acceded to representations made to me by the legal representatives of these county councils, and we have agreed to bear a measure of the costs.  The other item for the defence of public officials arose in a case where costs and expenses were awarded in relation to Article No. 2 (a) of the Constitution against certain officers of the State who discharged their duties in the manner which had been customary under the previous Administration.  It was in consequence of that that the State was involved under this sub-head in something over £900, £350 being in respect of damages. On that point, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney stated last night that it was unusual for damages to be awarded against defendants in these cases.  The Deputy's memory must have failed him, because in 1931 damages amounting to £145 were awarded against certain detective officers.  In 1931-32 there was a similar payment, so that in respect of this sub-head these are items which are not unusual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;there is an additional sum of £3,782 required for salaries payable under two Acts&mdash;the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act and the Pigs and Bacon Act&mdash;which came into operation after the original Estimate was introduced.  As to sub-head H&mdash;Grants to County Committees of Agriculture&mdash;these grants are under two headings.  The first heading is: &ldquo;Special grants to provide lime for agricultural purposes,&rdquo; the amount being £9,500.  This is a scheme which has been in operation for two or three years, under which lime is given out by the county committees of agriculture at something less than cost; in other words, a subsidy is provided by the county committees.  The second heading is: &ldquo;Special grants to county committees of agriculture to meet expenses incurred in connection with distribution of cattle export licences,&rdquo; and the amount is £15,000.  Last July the distribution of licences for fat cattle, bulls and cows was handed over to the county committees of agriculture. The expenses of the committees in connection with the distribution of these licences will amount to £15,000 for the financial year.  The next item is I (1)&mdash;Special Agricultural Schemes in Congested Districts.  Under that heading there is £2,000 for special livestock schemes.  That is for the supply of bulls.  Then there is a sum of £500 for a scheme to encourage the use of lime for agricultural purposes.  That is a scheme of grants for the building of limekilns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item, K (2), is &ldquo;Contribution to Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (Grant-in-Aid), £186.&rdquo;  In 1933-4 the grant paid to the society, <Col N="1050" /> with the approval of the Department of Finance, was £186 in excess of the amount voted.  The Comptroller and Auditor-General held that it was not right to pay money voted under another sub-head as part of a grant-in-aid, even though it was a small amount, because under the other subheads money is voted by the Dáil for specific purposes and has to be accounted for.  In the case of a grant-in-aid the money is not accounted for. As to item O (8), under the Price Stabilisation Act there is a certain period of the year at which more money is paid out than the fund can provide at the time.  In other words, subsidies are paid out earlier in the year than the levies come in.  For the last three years we got an advance from the Minister for Finance of £100,000, which was repaid each year by the end of the financial year.  This year we asked for £150,000, but that was not sufficient, and we, therefore, want an additional sum of £30,000. That makes a total of £180,000.  As to M (8)&mdash;Butter Purchase Scheme&mdash;that is to meet the net cost of the scheme for the purchase of butter.  Item M (10) is: &ldquo;Grant in respect of additional sugar beet grown in the Cooley district.&rdquo; This is a grant of 2/- per ton to the growers in that area who are supplying beet to the Carlow factory. This special concession is made to that area because an attempt was made some five or six years ago to divert the farmers in that district from potato-growing to beet-growing, as far as possible, as there was a difficulty in the marketing of potatoes owing to black scab.</P>

Sub-head O (9) (Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933 to 1935) is an item for £1,000 additional.  In the Cereals Act there was a clause under which the Minister for Agriculture took responsibility for paying seed merchants where an agreement had been entered into between the <Col N="1051" /> grower and the merchant for the purchase of seed during the season 1934-35.  Some of these growers sold their wheat even after notice had been served on them by me, to some merchant other than the one to whom they were asked to sell their seed. I am, however, obliged to make good the cost of the seed to the merchants and I hope to recover this money later from the growers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Sub-head O (12) is under the Acquisition of Land Allotments (Amendment) Act, 1934. It is for £1,210 and it is an additional sum for seeds and manures under that Act.  Sub-head O (13) is under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act 1934-35.  It is for the purchase of cattle for canning in the Waterford factory.  These are cattle purchased for human consumption.  The cost of the cattle is £10,000 but the Appropriation-in-Aid amounts to £6,470.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There will, I am afraid, inevitably be a loss on that business unless the market for canned meat improves.  There is not a very great demand for canned meat in this country and I do not know whether it is advisable to encourage it.  At any rate, there is no great demand for canned beef.  The extract is all right.  We get as good a price for the extract as is got anywhere else. There is also an item for the provision of cattle for export.  Against that there are receipts for £217,000.  O (15) is a sub-head under the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.  With regard to the item &ldquo;Export of cattle,&rdquo; in the original Estimate there was a sum of £125,000 for the purchase of cattle for export, and that is to be added to the present sum of £214,000. Against that, there were expected <Col N="1052" /> Appropriations-in-Aid in the original Estimate of £147,500.  It must be remembered, however, that the previous financial year would have to be taken into account also to get at the true balance sheet of the year's trading because in the previous year there was a loss of something like £25,000, the reason being that we have to pay for the cattle as we buy them and we are generally three or four weeks in arrears in getting paid from Germany for the cattle sent out.  In the first year there was a loss and that loss would be made good in this present year.  At least we should not lose in the present year.  There will always be a slight lagging behind in the trading.  I think that covers all the points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it ought to be borne in mind that the Minister dealing in terms of £500,000 worth of shipping to Germany is gratified in reporting to this House that he has broken even, and I dare say that the individual farmers in the country who look with anticipation to this market may know that when they are in a position to market £500,000 worth per annum they may expect to get out without loss, but that if they only deal in the modest terms of £50,000 worth of cattle they may expect that the trade will not be very profitable from the point of view of the Irish farmer. The first sub-head on this Vote deals with additional staff for the administration of the Dairy Produce Acts and the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935.  I am extremely uneasy about the administration of the Pigs and Bacon Act, <Col N="1053" /> 1935.  I sat on the Committee which considered that Bill.  The members of the Opposition on that Committee were very carefully concerned that no analogy would be established between the Pigs and Bacon Board on the one hand, and the Electricity Supply Board on the other.  When the Shannon electrification legislation was going through it was so provided that no Minister of this House was responsible for anything the board might do.  The board was an entirely autonomous body and, therefore, no question relating to its administration could be raised here by way of question and answer.  We recognised that the establishment of a board of a similar character affecting a branch of agriculture in this country, would be disastrous, particularly when in its initial stages it was going to consist of bacon curers and producers whose representatives would be nominated by the Government.  We inserted in that Bill a provision giving the Minister power to make inquiries required from the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board, whenever he thought it necessary to do so.  Having put that proviso in the Bill, we are satisfied that the burden rests upon the Minister of requiring from the Bacon Marketing Board or the Pigs Marketing Board, any information that a Deputy of this House asks from the Minister for Agriculture in the ordinary course of his Parliamentary duties.  I think the House will realise how very necessary that is when I direct their attention to the fact that the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board have now announced their intention, quite blandly, of eliminating the pig jobbers from the pig industry altogether.  The Chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board quite recently attended a meeting in Cork, and there delivered a speech clearly indicating that he wanted to see the pig jobbers completely wiped out of existence, and all sales of pigs effected by delivery at the factory door.  If that were carried through, we would have a situation arising in which the Pigs Marketing Board could alter the whole social organisation of rural Ireland.  By <Col N="1054" /> destroying the local fairs they would not only injure business enormously in the small towns throughout the country, but they would also remove from the farmers the one open market that the small farmers have got where competition is going to operate to the small farmers' advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a pig dealer, an independent man, who when he bought so many wagons of pigs can either rail them to Great Britain or sell them to the curer here in Ireland, whichever bids the best price for them; if you once eliminate that man from the pig trade in this country you hand over the pig producers of this country into the hands of the bacon curers.  It is my considered opinion that if you hand the pig producers of this country into the hands of the bacon curers, you will see no dramatic change for about two or three years after that is effected, but, when the public mind is lulled into a sense of security by the fact that no dramatic change has taken place in pig prices, pig prices will be just such prices as the curer is pleased to pay for pigs.  No regard will be had, good, bad or indifferent, to the capacity of the farmers of this country to produce pigs at any given price.  Any Deputy who has any experience of a similar transaction which took place in the United States of America knows that the pig packers in that country were always concerned to break up the small rural fairs, because they foresaw, and rightly foresaw, that if they could once establish the principle that all live stock must be sold in the packer's yard, the day would come when the packer would rule the price for live stock of all kinds, and that any farmer who did not choose to take the packer's price could be smashed by the packers. If you eliminate the pig jobber from the pig business in this country you are going to hand over the producer into the hands of the curer, and that is a thing that no autonomous body like the pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board should be authorised to do.  If the Minister's contention that those are autonomous bodies is once admitted in this House, then that revolution can be effected by a body which does not admit the control <Col N="1055" /> of this House at all.  It can be effected behind the backs of this House, and no Deputy in the House will have any power whatever to prevent it or to protest against it.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should tell us now what his policy is on the question of fairs and markets, whether he wants to smash them and do away with them, and if so what are his reasons for such a departure.  I stand uncompromisingly for the recognition of the useful service that has been discharged by the pig jobbers and pig dealers' association in this country.  I am convinced, not only from the point of view of the producer, but also from the point of view of every business man in the country and in the rural towns, that it will be a disaster if the pig fairs are broken up and done away with and that, in the long run, the only body of people who can hope to derive any benefit from such arrangement are the bacon curers of the country.  Therefore I ask the Minister to state specifically what his policy is in that regard. I also want to ask the Minister to make an explicit statement to-day as to whether he does intend to adhere to the attitude he has taken up so far of declining to ask the Bacon Marketing Board or the Pigs Marketing Board for information.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to put to him another question.  After a protracted debate the Minister inserted, at the request of the Opposition, a section in the Pigs and Bacon Bill providing that, when the Pigs Marketing Board came to fix a price for pigs, they must not do so unless and until they had given due consideration to the costs of production as set out in the Pigs and Bacon Act.  I allege that the first price which was fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board was fixed without any regard having been taken to the cost of production. I allege that on the strength of a statement made by a member of that board at a meeting over which Deputy Belton presided, in the City of Dublin. I want an assurance from the Minister that he will insist that in future the price of pigs will not be fixed by the board until they have given due consideration <Col N="1056" /> to the cost of production, so that the price of pigs will not be fixed below the cost of production, unless the board intends to do so and is prepared to justify to the country such a line of conduct.  There has come into my hands recently a document issued from the Bacon Marketing Board, 36 Upper Mount Street, Dublin, which purports to fix the minimum prices at which bacon can be sold in this country.  I know of no authority under the Pigs and Bacon Act whereby the Bacon Marketing Board is authorised to fix a minimum price for bacon.  Is there any such power?  Would the Minister say if he is aware of any power under the Act for that purpose? I do not think he can, because it is certainly not in the Act.  I want him to address an inquiry to the Bacon Marketing Board to ask them by what authority they issued a document headed &ldquo;Schedule.  Minimum Prices,&rdquo; and giving thereunder a series of prices for bacon manufactured from pigs of different classes for consumption in Saorstát Eireann.  I remember very well that the Minister distinctly said that his policy was to leave the home market an open market, wherein the bacon curers might freely compete, and to distribute the export quota amongst the curers in accordance with an agreed formula.  Apparently, the Bacon Marketing Board, imagining that they had a degree of autonomy which they certainly do not enjoy, are prepared to go a step further themselves and fix the minimum price with a view to holding up the bacon consumers of this country, if they are allowed to get away with their initial activities such as I have described.</P>
    <P>Before I depart from that question there is one other extraordinary fact which has emerged.  Deputies are aware that the bacon industry of this country consists principally of the bacon that is consumed in Saorstát Eireann and the bacon that is exported to Great Britain.  The bacon which is exported to Great Britain is exported under quota.  That quota is known as the export quota, and is divided, according to formula, by the Ministry of Agriculture between the bacon producers of this country.</P>
    <P>The Bacon Marketing Board also <Col N="1057" /> have a formula by which they arrive at the &ldquo;home sales quota,&rdquo; and that quota is also divided up amongst bacon-curers, but there is apparently no provision for the bacon-curer who desires to export bacon to a market other than Great Britain.  Now, it so happens that the American market is sometimes prepared to pay what might be described as a fancy price for Irish bacon at certain seasons of the year, but if an Irish bacon-curer now wishes to send a consignment of bacon to America he must do it out of that part of his production which has been scheduled by the Bacon Marketing Board as his &ldquo;home sales quota.&rdquo; His &ldquo;home sales quota&rdquo; is only sufficient to supply his regular customers in the home market, so that if he gets the opportunity of advantageously placing 500 or 1,000 sides of Irish bacon in New York he will not be allowed to take it out of his export quota, or if he does he will lose that quota in the next quota period, but he may take it out of his &ldquo;home sales quota,&rdquo; and leave his regular customers in Ireland short while he supplies his customer in New York.  I submit to the Minister that that position is absurd.  Machinery ought to be devised without delay whereby a bacon producer, who is anxious to fill his &ldquo;home sales quota&rdquo; and his British quota and, in addition, a third market, should be allowed a special production quota in respect of that third market which will enable him to supply it without trenching on either his &ldquo;home sales quota&rdquo; or the quota for the British market.</P>
    <P>Lastly, in connection with the bacon business, I put it to the Minister that it is demonstrably necessary that very much closer supervision should be exercised by his Department over the activities of the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  The most extraordinary things have happened since those boards were set up. One must attribute the incredible messes into which they have got themselves to inexperience and ineptitude; but we do know that there were markets here and there through the country in which a quantity of pork could not be sold because there was no <Col N="1058" /> one to buy it.  We do know that in other cases the Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board went around and bought quantities of pork, and, instead of converting it promptly into bacon and cold-storing it, hawked it about until well beyond its prime, and then sold it as pork to bacon-curers for conversion into bacon at a very heavy loss.  It has been impossible for this House to ascertain what the measure of that loss was.  We also know that the Pigs Marketing Board or the Bacon Marketing Board have in store large quantities of bacon that they were obliged to cure, and that, in short, they made an unholy mess of the job they were given to do in the first three or four months of their existence.  Such a mess should not arise again.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the prices that have been fixed by the Pigs Marketing Board for pork since they started their operations.  The whole object of this Act was to give a long term view of what pig prices were going to be so that producers and feeders would know from time to time what they might expect to get some weeks ahead.  Far from that being the case, we have had the Pigs Marketing Board making an order for pig prices which was to remain constant for six weeks, and then revising their prices order half way through the period and raising them. Now, we all know why that was done. It was because the Minister made representations to them that the protests from the country were becoming too violent as a result of his having to increase the cost of his maize meal mixture: that something would have to be done to bring the prices for pigs into somewhat closer relationship with the cost of production, whereupon the Pigs Marketing Board broke in on their own prices order and raised prices all round by 2/- per cwt.  The Minister says that he did not approach the Pigs Marketing Board and I, of course, have to accept his word.  I think, however, it may be said that the Pigs Marketing Board knew what was in the Minister's mind.  My submission is that that kind of thing defeats the whole purpose of the Pigs and Bacon <Col N="1059" /> Act.  What you want is a long distance notification to producers of what the prices of pigs are going to be in the future, and unless you get that the whole system of regulation under the Act is worthless, and tends only to pile on profits for the procurers.</P>
    <P>I make this suggestion to the Minister that he is not providing adequate safeguards for the producers of this country unless he places on the curers an obligation to communicate to him, at the end of each financial year, what the certified profits of their undertakings are.  I do not ask him to publish such figures to the Dáil or to the country at large because where private companies are operating it would not be right or reasonable that their private affairs should be dragged before the public at large; but, it would be perfectly legitimate, where the Minister is providing regulation and a considerable measure of protection for curers, that he should require them to furnish him with a certified statement of their accounts by a recognised firm of auditors, so that from time to time he could satisfy himself that undue profits were not being made by any close borough of curers on a strictly regulated market.  I imagine if he does that he will agree with me that the most effective check he could have on inflated profits in the curers' business is the constant presence of the pig-jobber who, whenever the market is good, will operate his forces all through the country to push up the price of pigs and to keep the margin between the price of pigs and bacon reasonably close, providing a fair living for everyone and a fair price for the producers of pigs.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is really not much use commenting on the glorious inconsistencies in our agricultural schemes. We find that under sub-head I (1)&mdash; Special Agricultural Schemes in Agricultural Districts&mdash;that the sum of £2,000 is being asked for special live stock schemes to make additional provision for a supply of bulls.  Senator Connolly has said that he could tear down in 100 days the live-stock <Col N="1060" /> industry which it took 100 years to build up.  Yet, the House is being asked to vote £2,000 to provide bulls for the congested areas to produce live stock that Senator Connolly regards as anathema.  It does not seem to embarrass the Minister for Agriculture in the least to be kicked around the floor of this House by his colleagues, all of whom have a skelp at him from time to time.  Despite it all he comes up smiling in the long run.  The Minister has been given an embarrassing task in being asked to introduce a Supplementary Estimate such as this. If I could whisper a word in Senator Connolly's ear I should say to him that if he would stick to furniture and fish it would be very much more helpful to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some information from the Minister with regard to his profit and loss accounts on his butter transactions.  He has been selling butter in Germany and on the continent of Europe as well as in the despised British market which, as Senator Connolly said, had, thank God, gone for ever.  I would be very much obliged if the Minister would tell us how much butter he sold in the British market which, thank God, has gone for ever, and how much he sold in the German market, and what profit he made on each transaction, or what loss he sustained on each transaction.  The Minister has already been strangely reticent about that.  I think it is right, when the Department of Agriculture are engaging in commercial activities of that kind, that they would be scrupulously exact in rendering a clear profit and loss account to this House at the end of each year's operations.</P>
    <P>I see from the Estimate that we are going to provide 2/- a ton to the growers of sugar beet in the Cooley area.  How many Deputies in the House really know what the beet sugar industry costs this country per acre. Does Deputy Jordan, who lives in the midst of a forest of sugar beet?  Can he tell us how much each statute acre of that beet costs the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenJordan" hpid="Mr. Jordan Mr. Jordan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jordan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy gives me the document he has in his hand I will tell him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak subject to correction, but I have made it out as follows.  I think the calculation is a most interesting one when we contemplate adding 2/- a ton to the Cooley product.  I make it out that the net price of Tate sugar crystals delivered in Dublin City in bond is about 9/3 per cwt., and the corresponding price for sugar manufactured by Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann is 25/5.  That means that in bounties of one kind or another the State contributes 16/2 per cwt. on sugar.  That amounts to £16 3s. 4d. per ton on sugar.  Now, I am informed by a friend who is in touch with the Tuam beet factory and with other sugar areas in general, that they fix a figure of 7.25 tons of beet as the average amount required to produce a ton of sugar.  I am depending on this friend, who is familiar with the procedure of the beet-sugar factories, as to whether that figure is correct or not.  I am informed by the Minister for Agriculture that the average yield of beet is 10.5 tons per statute acre.  If 7.25 tons of beet produce one ton of sugar, then 10.5 tons will produce a ton and a half of sugar, and the bounty being £16 3s. 4d. per ton, that means that producers receive a bounty of £24 5s. per acre.  Now we are going to add 2/- a ton to the farmers in Cooley.  Does it ever occur to Deputy Jordan what his neighbours in his part of the country receive for delivering the beet to the factory?  Let us take 4/- a ton for delivery, and that leaves 32/6, free on rail, to the factory, which means that the farmer who gets a yield of 10.5 tons per statute acre&mdash;a very high yield for this country and far higher than most countries, with the exception perhaps of Czecho-Slovakia and Holland&mdash;receives £17 11s. 3d.  So that, we have this extraordinary figure presented, that in order to produce sugar beet in this country the Government goes out through the country and buys the crop, delivers it carriage paid to the factory, and, with the produce of every acre, they hand the factory £7 cash, and then tell the factory: &ldquo;Well, now, boys, you can sell the sugar at the world's price.&rdquo;  Is not that astonishing?  And this is one of <Col N="1062" /> the great economic boons and blessings that have been conferred on this country by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that it was a herculean struggle to start the great sugar beet campaign&mdash;one of the great new industrial enterprises of the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;one of the great triumphs of the new dispensation &mdash;but when you boil it down, it means that for every acre of roots these men grow, the Government buy the roots, deliver them to the factory, and then tell the factory that they can go out and sell the sugar at the world price. That is an achievement, is it not? That is surely something to be proud of! I must say that the poor old farmer, who is driven by want and distress into growing a crop of that kind, must find it hard, when there is a bounty of £24 5s. floating around, to realise that all he is allowed is £17. He is the man that does the hard work, the sowing, the cultivation of the crop and so on, while the gentlemen in the factories not only get the crop for nothing but get £7 per acre for taking it in through the door, and for the right to sell it at the world price of sugar after they have been paid for taking a present of the crop.  I think that comment on that economic brain-wave is unnecessary.  Well did the Minister for Finance on a certain occasion describe it as a white elephant &mdash;and what a white elephant!</P>

Therefore, I do not propose to delay the House further, but I do emphasise the matter that I have referred to in connection with the Pigs Marketing Board, and I do ask specifically for the accounts of the butter marketing and the cattle transactions that have taken place in respect to which large sums have been raised.  I look forward on next Wednesday to making suggestions to the Government which would make the continual appearance of a very large number of sub-heads in this Supplementary Estimate unnecessary in any future Estimates they may bring before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to say a few words in regard to the Pigs Marketing Board which tries to dictate not only the price of pigs but the manner in which they are to be put on the market. Deputy Dillon has referred to interference with pig-jobbers.  I am not concerned with pig-jobbers, but we are concerned in County Cavan with the system of marketing pigs that has obtained there from time immemorial. Farmers were in the habit of killing their pigs at home and selling them afterwards on the market.  I think there can be no real objection to the continuation of that practice.  Every county, every district, has its own method of carrying on business and it is not easy to get away from established methods, especially when farmers, by killing their pigs and selling them dead weight, know what they are getting for every pound of their pigs.  There is no very sound reason why that system should be departed <Col N="1066" /> from at the dictation of the Bacon Marketing Board or the Pigs Marketing Board or whoever is responsible. I think the Minister is responsible to a certain extent for both of these boards.</P>
      <P>Another matter is that they not only dictate the manner of selling pigs but also the breed of pigs that the farmers should keep and the class of bacon that the consumer should use. I think that is altogether uncalled for. I think consumers have a perfect right to choose any class of bacon they want. Complaints are general all through the County Cavan that people cannot get fat bacon to buy in the shops, and it is fat bacon they want to buy.  Poor people want to get fat bacon because they find it more beneficial.  They much prefer it to lean bacon.  The shopkeepers say they cannot get it from the curers and the curers say that they cannot buy fat pigs, that is, pigs of the Ulster breed.  The curers' objection to them is that they are too fat.  The people want to buy fat bacon, but it will not be sold to them.  I do not think it was ever intended by the Minister or anybody else to give the Bacon Marketing Board the right to dictate to consumers what sort of bacon they ought to eat or to dictate to producers what sort of pigs they ought to feed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people or a certain section of them are prepared to feed the Ulster pig, the fat pig, I do not think the board ought to object, and if there is a large class of consumers looking for that class of bacon I think these parties should be catered for.  I am satisfied that there is a demand for fat bacon and that the bacon curers should be entitled to supply this demand.  If they supply this demand to the full, they can continue to buy Ulster pigs. I hope the Minister will get in touch with the Bacon Marketing Board on this question, and I am quite sure that the Bacon Marketing Board will find that there is a demand for more fat bacon, if they are able to supply it. At least, that is my information.  As I say, the complaint is pretty general all through Cavan and the neighbouring counties that people cannot get fat bacon from the retailers, and the <Col N="1067" /> excuse of the retailers is that they cannot get it from the curers.</P>
    <P>I think also that the wholesale price for sides of bacon is abnormally high and that it constitutes an infliction by the bacon-curers.  I saw according to the paper a few days ago that the wholesale price was 103/-.  I think that that price is not justified by the price of pigs, or, alternatively, if it is, the price of pigs should be increased for the producer, to justify the price of bacon.  When you compare the price of pigs in Northern Ireland with the price in the Free State, and the price of bacon on both sides of the Border, I think it is plain that profiteering is being carried on both at the expense of the producer and the consumer in the Free State.  If the Bacon Marketing Board have got a monopoly, they should not abuse that monopoly, and I am afraid that it is only too apparent that they are abusing it.  If they are entitled to a monopoly of the bacon trade, they ought to be obliged to deal fairly between the producer and the consumer.  That is not being done.  I think that the Minister has a responsibility to see that the Bacon Marketing Board should not abuse the monopoly they have received from the country.</P>
    <P>The production of pigs, having regard to the price of feeding stuffs, is not a paying proposition.  That is another matter which I want to bring before the Minister.  Some time ago, when we were dealing with a certain motion in this House, and when we discussed the price of cattle, the Minister admitted that the production of cattle was not a paying proposition.  Cattle production, he said then, must be discontinued, and he added: &ldquo;You can pull up on the pigs and the hens.&rdquo;  If the cost of production for pigs is not given to the producer, how are producers going to pull up on pigs?  How can producers continue to produce pigs at less than the cost of production? I think anyone who has tried to produce pigs the whole year round, taking the good and the bad part of the year together, will agree that pig production at the present price is not a paying proposition.  If pig production is not paying producers, how are <Col N="1068" /> they going to pull up for their losses on other classes of stock by producing more pigs?</P>
    <P>The position is that the cost of feeding stuffs is too high.  Oats are being sold from 7/- to 9/- per barrel. The meal produced from these oats, mixed with the maize meal, works out at three times the price of the oats, so here again there is profiteering.  The producers have to bear all this profiteering, whether on the part of the miller, the bacon-curer or every other class that comes in between the producer and the consumer.  Because of the maize meal mixture, it is not open to the farmers to produce their own feeding stuffs.  If they were allowed, they could buy a certain quantity of meal and mix their own feeding stuffs, but as conditions exist they have to dispose of their own grain and buy it back mixed with maize meal at three times the price.  Across the Border the best Indian meal can be bought at 11/- a bag.  The maize meal mixture is costing 16/6 on our side of the Border.  It is plain to anybody that it is impossible for the producers on the Free State side to compete with people on the other side of the Border when they have to pay 40 per cent. more for feeding stuffs for the pigs.  When it comes to selling the pig they have to sell at the average price.  It is plain that if pig production is barely paying in the North it cannot be carried on in the Free State unless at a loss.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility in this connection too, because with the maize meal mixture scheme he gives the farmer no opportunity of buying maize at its ordinary price, crushing his oats at home and mixing the feeding stuff in his own way.  If the farmer were allowed to do that he could do it much more economically than if he were to buy the mixture made up by the miller.  In my opinion the scheme for the mixture of meal and the methods of marketing pork are tending to drive producers out of the production of pigs and it means imposing a very heavy burden on the consumers.  Everybody <Col N="1069" /> knows that the poor cannot afford to pay the extraordinary price demanded for bacon.  The prices producers receive bear no relation to the prices they have to pay when they are buying bacon.</P>
    <P>A great many poor people cannot afford to kill their own pigs and cure them.  They have to sell them and then they purchase bacon at extraordinarily high prices, far out of proportion to what they receive for the pigs.  I hope the Minister will see that the monopoly he has given the bacon-curers and the millers will not be abused.  I hope he will take note of the matters I have brought to his attention and see that the people whom he has protected, and in whose interests he has passed legislation, will not abuse the monopoly they have obtained and that they will not attempt to dictate as to what the consumers are to use.  The people who use bacon have a perfect right to get any sort of bacon they require.  If there is a demand for a certain quality, it should be supplied so long as there are producers prepared to supply it. It is not for the curers to dictate to the producers or the consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect that Deputy Brennan is going to speak on this Estimate, and my only reason for intervening is to ask him to be kind enough to explain what is the Fine Gael official attitude on the question of the Bacon Marketing Board; that is, as to the extent of Government interference which is desirable in connection with the Bacon Marketing Board and the Pigs Marketing Board.  To my mind the only thing that has arisen in this debate so far&mdash;the net effect of the speeches delivered&mdash;is the creation of bewilderment as to what should be the Government attitude with regard to these two boards.  When the Bill creating these boards was going through there was no opposition from the Party opposite.  There was agreement that it was a useful Bill, that this was the proper way to regulate the pig and bacon industry, to have boards that would make it their sole business to look after these matters, and to have boards that would be to a large extent independent of interference by this <Col N="1070" /> House.  But now not only Deputy Dillon, but Deputy McGovern, suggests that there should be not merely interference, but that there should be constant control by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is a very important question for some of us here who like to see what are the developments in policy that are taking place, as evidenced by the speeches.  I certainly would like to know are the Fine Gael Party already sorry that they allowed that Bill to go through or have they changed their attitude with regard to it?  Deputy Dillon took a very big part in the discussions on that Bill when it was in private Committee, and a very useful part, I am glad to say; but he never once suggested that he was opposed to the principle of the Bill.  In the discussions that took place he never once suggested that these boards should be under the control of the Government. Not only that, but in general the attitude of Deputy Dillon with regard to the interference of civil servants is that he is altogether opposed to it.  Is there any man who has been more eloquent in condemnation of the interference of civil servants in matters where they have no direct authority than Deputy Dillon?  Is there a day that passes that he does not protest against such a proceeding?  Is not the danger of bureaucracy one of the most common phrases in his mouth?  Yet this evening he warns the Minister that he must keep constant control over these two boards.  What is one to make of a position like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is due to the House that Deputy Brennan or some other leader of the Opposition should make it clear whether these speeches represent the official attitude of Fine Gael on this matter.  We must remember these boards do not stand alone.  A number of them has been created during the last ten years, and the possibility is that other problems will be dealt with by the creation of similar autonomous boards.  It is important to know whether they are to be created on the lines adopted up to the present, or whether there should be a new approach, and if the approach is to be that the Government should keep the constant control that Deputy Dillon <Col N="1071" /> desires, what is the use, what good will there be in creating such bodies? What good would a board be that would be subject to day to day interference by civil servants?  Why would men agree to act on such boards? What functions would they serve?  If they are to be rung up and told &ldquo;You must do so and so,&rdquo; where does their advice come in or what will their duties be, at all?</P>
    <P>I have a strong suspicion, of course, that Deputy Dillon merely made that speech because he had nothing to say on the Estimate.  Deputy Dillon's general attitude is that when he has nothing to say on a subject he makes a very long speech on the subject.  The impression I got from his speech this evening was that he really had nothing to say against the Department of Agriculture, and that for that reason he was going to make a fairly long speech against it.  His constant repetition of the same criticism with regard to an item of production which is now one of the fundamental things in our agricultural economy, indicates that. He knows very well that he is tilting at windmills when he talks against the production of beet and beet sugar.  He knows that these are as much a part of our agriculture now as the production of bacon or the production of butter, and yet he keeps on repeating the same criticism, knowing all the time that he has no support within his own Party, and knowing well that if to-morrow he attempted to put his criticism in the form of a motion he would not get the support of 3 per cent. of his own Party.  It looks to me as if the Department of Agriculture must be doing its work very well when on the occasion of an Estimate like this containing a number of different items, the only speeches we have are speeches criticising boards for which the Government has no direct responsibility, and regarding which the Government has, in effect, undertaken not to interfere, and has given that undertaking with the full consent of the Party opposite.  If that be the position, I think it is due to the House that it should be made clear that these speeches were not really seriously <Col N="1072" /> intended; that they were only made for the purpose of filling up time; and because, perhaps, the Estimate being one in which there were several different items relating to the chief business of the country, agriculture, it was necessary to say something.  I am sure, however, the House would be the better for a candid admission that there is no real intention that the Government should interfere with these two boards or that the boards should not be allowed to have the full responsibility for the business for which they have been created.</P>

      <P>I think I can reply to the Deputy's question in that way. Last fair day, in my own village, a poor man from Kilgarvan, County Kerry, travelled 15 miles with a sow which was bought from him for £4 10s. 0d. I said to the dealer who bought the sow: &ldquo;What would that sow be worth if we had an open market?&rdquo; and he said &ldquo;About £6 10s.&rdquo;  I put the question to him and several other dealers: &ldquo;Is there a market in England for all we are able to produce in this country?&rdquo; and the reply was that there <Col N="1073" /> was.  One of them went so far as to say, not only that, but that he could pay 10/- more for every pig he bought in the market that morning if he had an open market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>If he was, the Minister has a very easy way of finding out. There are a good many commissions at work.  Why not set up a commission now to examine the people who spoke at a meeting of the Pig Dealers' Association held in Dublin on the 12th of this month?  The report of the meeting says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. J. Sullivan, Tralee, seconding, said that last year, under a limited open market, the top price of pigs was 64/- a cwt., as against 59/- to-day, leaving pigs on an average worth 6/6 per head more in 1935 than at present.  Bacon quotations in Liverpool on 12th February last year were from 80/- to 85/-, and at present range from 81/- to 86/-.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He contended on the allocation of 62,000 pigs for February pig producers would receive £20,000 less than under an open market.  In some cases the English bacon curer paid 33/- more for certain pigs than the Irish curer, although he had to sell his bacon in the same market. It might be said that the association was depriving the country of a certain amount of industry by the export of live pigs, but were the Free State producers to get no consideration and was this labour to be kept at home solely at their expense?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should have an investigation to ascertain whether that statement is correct or not.  The report continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The pig producers' representatives on the marketing board seemed to have callously agreed to deprive the owners on an average of 7/- per head.  As demonstrating the attitude of the board towards producers, Mr. Sullivan said that in January, when members of the association were asked to send some pigs to one or two curers who were short of their quotas, they were told to get the <Col N="1074" /> extra expense incurred off the farmer.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. M. Murphy, Cork, said that 360,000 pigs unsuitable for the Irish trade in 1931 were shipped to England and made a better average price per cwt. than first-grade pigs killed at home.  When they now had a chance of regaining that market it was taken away in one swipe from them.  He computed that on 6,000 pigs shipped during the last week of January producers received £2,400 more than they would have under the ruling marketing board prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I contend that we should have open competition.  If you take up the prices issued by the different curers in the country from day to day, you will find that the price for a pig between 1¼ cwts. and 1¼ cwts. 14 lbs. is 60/-.  That means that if a pig is 1¼ cwts. and 15 lbs. the producer gets a smaller price.  Did anybody ever hear such nonsense?  Surely there could not be any difference in the quality of the two pigs?  There is nothing for it but open competition.  I put it to the Minister: Does he stand over the policy of destroying the fairs of this country?  The Minister and every Deputy knows very well that they were a great source of revenue to the business people in towns and villages, and I say that it is most unfair for the Government to adopt a policy which is going to deprive those people of their means of living.</P>
    <P>I will quote the statement of the chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board made in the Lecture Theatre of University College, Cork, on Monday.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It appears that in the interests of our country's trade, of the producer, and of the curer the marketing of pigs is best done by selling pigs as factory-purchased pigs.  If you doubt the factory classification we will safeguard you through our system of inspection.  Every factory is visited by the board's inspectors and at unexpected times, and only in one case have they discovered an error in grading, and this was a case of grading the animal higher than it deserved.  The point has been raised <Col N="1075" /> that the system tends to abolish fairs.  Is not a collecting station for pigs as beneficial to a town as a fair? Will not the money paid by cheque within a few days of the collection be as wisely spent by the producer as the money which he receives at the fair?  Will it not find its way back to the trader as surely as the money got on fair days?  Will the interested buyers be affected?  Pigs must still be got under the system I have outlined. Pigs must still be bought for shipping alive.  Possibly it will not be necessary to ask producers to pay 11 buyers to purchase 70 pigs, as has happened from time to time at fairs through the country, but buyers there will be who will continue to give the country their services and the benefits of their expert knowledge and advice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know if this policy is carried on where will the buyers be. They will be driven out of existence. I say these buyers were a fine, decent body of men, and the Government should do nothing to deprive them of their livelihood.  There are plenty of people on the dole, and we should do nothing that would put more people on the dole.  With regard to the statement made by Deputy McGovern on feeding-stuffs, Deputy Moore wants to get some idea of our policy.  Our policy is: give the people feeding-stuffs at a proper price.  Give it to the people at the price at which it is sold to farmers in the North of Ireland and in Great Britain so that we would be in a position to compete with them. Otherwise there is no hope of such competition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us last Thursday that there was more feed being consumed in this country to-day than four years ago.  He gave the figures as 7,800,000 cwts.  But let us look at the facts.  Four years ago there was more barley and oats grown in this country than last year, because last year many people substituted wheat for barley and oats.  That oats and barley four years ago was used by the people themselves, or sold to other feeders in the country.  But last year &mdash;and I challenge the Minister to contradict <Col N="1076" /> this statement&mdash;between 33? and 50 per cent. was included in the 7,800,000 cwts. which he says was milled, so that if you take off that 33? to 50 per cent. it would mean 2,600,000 cwts. short of what was grown four years ago.  Four years ago people fed their cattle and pigs themselves or sold them to people who fed them.  Deputy Moore challenged us as to why Fine Gael allowed this Bill to go through. Fine Gael could not prevent the Bill going through.  Our policy is to try and amend any Bill that the Government brings in, but we have no hope of preventing it going through.  Therefore, we have to try and prevent the Government making a hash of things. We have given them good advice but they would not take it.  At last, however, the people are beginning to see that the policy of the Government is simply driving the whole country into bankruptcy, which I am afraid will come sooner than many people expect.</P>

      <P>There are some items in this Estimate that I should like to get more particulars about.  There is a sum of £15,000 for the distribution of licences in different counties.  I should like to know from the Minister, when he comes to reply, how this £15,000 is to be spent.  It seems a very large item.  I imagine the work in connection with the distribution of licences is not so big as that figure represents. I should like to know the number of inspectors that are engaged, and any other information that the Minister can give us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I should like to refer to is the number of cattle that are being canned to which the Minister referred in his opening speech.  I should like to know what number of cattle was purchased for the canning factory in Waterford, the price, and the cost delivered to that factory.  I should like to know, also, the amount of money the Minister received from the factory for these cattle.  Another matter upon which I would like more information is in connection with the Pigs Marketing Board and the price fixed for pigs.  This marketing board was set up more or less for the purpose <Col N="1077" /> of securing a better price for the producer than he received in the past.  I do not think the board is fulfilling its obligations in that direction.  I think that the price fixed for pigs in the last three or four months was as high as could be paid in the circumstances. But I am given to understand that some of the bacon-curers and the factories were under the impression that a better price could be paid and that resolutions were sent to the Minister for Agriculture asking him to use his influence to have a better price paid.  It was their opinion that more money could be paid for pigs.</P>
    <P>The price paid for pigs in the past three or four months is less than the cost of production.  Pigs are fattened and sold at a loss and there is the danger that the industry will disappear altogether if there is not some improvement in the price.  We know that the special duty that has to be paid on our produce going over to England has a very serious effect. While these duties are on it will be very hard for us to get a fair or reasonable price for our produce.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the amount of money paid in bounties for the skins of calves.  I think that owing to the arrangement made by the Minister for the killing of a number of calves for this year and the year before cattle-numbers will be reduced in the future.  I think it would be advisable to put an end to the killing of these calves for the future. Now, owing to the new quotas, a larger number of cattle will be taken over to Great Britain.  Although the price is bad, and very bad, still an outlet is provided and the farmers are hoping that, if our cattle trade is not to be wiped out, some kind of settlement of this economic dispute will come.  I, as a farmer, ask the Minister for Agriculture, who is supposed to look after our interests, to use his influence with the Executive Council so as to settle this dispute as soon as possible.  There is also a big difference in the price for pigs in Northern Ireland and the price obtainable here.  Deputy McGovern dealt with that matter.  There should <Col N="1078" /> not be such a difference, but it is very hard for the Minister for Agriculture or any other Minister, under the present circumstances, to arrange prices that will give us a fair return for what we produce.  I am speaking as a farmer and not as a politician, and I ask the Minister to use his influence with the President and the other members of the Executive Council to settle the economic dispute. Otherwise, things will be very bad for the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary and Deputy McGovern made a number of comparisons between the price of pigs in Great Britain and Northern Ireland and here.  They also complained about the Pigs Marketing Board.  We had a gentleman down in Cork County who started off in this business the moment the economic war started.  His name was Mr. Dring, of Glanmire, and he feeds and fattens 400 or 500 pigs at a time.  He was threatening what he would do when the economic war was on.  He said: &ldquo;I will go over to where I can fatten my pigs on what mixture I like and get English prices for them.&rdquo;  Lo and behold, he departed from amongst us and went across to England.  He stayed 12 long months in England fattening pigs at the price which Deputy O'Leary mentioned.  He had not to use any admixture and he got the English prices.  But he came back to Glanmire a sadder and a wiser man.  He is now working the admixture scheme because he found it paid him better to fatten the pigs here than to go to England and fatten them under the conditions that obtained there.  I am not now dealing with hearsay.  I am giving the man's name and Deputies can see him any day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Pigs Marketing Board, we have seen, from time to time, long statements in the papers from a gentleman named Buckworth. He used to write columns in the Press about the admixture scheme and how he was being robbed fattening pigs under that scheme.  Mr. Buckworth now comes along and admits that he made £2,000 in 12 months fattening pigs.  I hope the Press will publish <Col N="1079" /> that and let Mr. Buckworth deny it if he wishes.  At a meeting of the Dairy Science Society in Cork, where Mr. O'Brien, the Chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board, delivered a lecture, Mr. Buckworth came along and said: &ldquo;I made money on marketing pigs until the Pigs Marketing Board came along.&rdquo;  He has now another bee in his bonnet, and he tells of the terrible things the Government are doing to him.  It is the Pigs Marketing Board which is troubling him now.</P>

      <P>These are statements made on these matters by three men in Cork, none of whom holds the same views in politics that members of this Party hold.  They are directly opposed to us.  I am giving the results of their experiences as a full reply to the statements made by Deputy McGovern and <Col N="1080" /> Deputy O'Leary.  Deputy O'Leary wants to get feeding-stuffs at the prices which obtain in Great Britain and the North of Ireland.  He knows, and I am sure Deputy Holohan knows, the difficulty there was in selling barley and oats at any period during 1931, 1932, or even 1929.  In these three years, you could hardly get a market for oats or barley.  There was a very limited market in the breweries, and this scheme was introduced to provide an extra market for Irish farmers' grain. It was designed to replace maize meal, for which we had to pay the foreigner, with grain grown at home, for which the Irish farmer would be paid.  Then we have representatives of the farmers like Deputy McGovern and Deputy O'Leary getting up and complaining.</P>
      <P>The one objection I have in connection with this Vote is in relation to the grants made to the committees of agriculture.  I wonder if the Minister for Agriculture has any control over the manner in which this money is spent by the committees.  I wonder if he is aware of the way in which this money is being spent by the committee of agriculture in Cork County.  Is he aware that the committee has endeavoured to use the money for political purposes&mdash;to victimise political opponents, and enforce a boycott of shows?  As a matter of fact, they went so far as to refuse grants to show committees which held shows, while they gave grants to show committees which did not hold shows.  If you did not hold a show, you got a grant in aid of the show, but, if you did hold a show, you did not get a grant.  I suggest to the Minister that he should exercise some control over these committees and the manner in which this money is spent.  This public money, subscribed by the taxpayer.  All the money spent by these committees of agriculture is subscribed either by the taxpayer or the ratepayer.  The Minister should, therefore, see that the money is spent at least fairly and that there is no political victimisation as a result of its expenditure.</P>

I suggest that that is relevant, and that such an appointment was illegal.</P>

I wished to call attention to it, and I am very glad Deputy Brennan reminded me.  I might have forgotten it.  When we know that every position, large or small, has to be sanctioned by the Minister, I wonder what particular sanction was required for the position for which money is now being voted.  Did the Minister have any inquiries made as to whether this gentleman was eligible owing to a conviction for work of the description mentioned?  I suggest that the Minister should look up that particular matter.  I did not intend to intervene in this debate, but when I heard statements being made about the Pigs Marketing Board, and about the admixture scheme, I thought it better to call in three witnesses who are high priests in their organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the attitude that has been adopted by Deputies opposite towards the Pigs Marketing Board, especially when it is realised that the farmers asked for the abolition of the &ldquo;rings&rdquo; that were formed by pig buyers, especially in rural areas.  I believe that the new system will work out well, and that, as time goes on, the people will be satisfied with it.  I could not believe that Deputy Dillon, who poses as the champion of the poorer classes, could be so sarcastic regarding live-stock schemes in congested areas.  The Deputy seemed to scoff at the idea of having live-stock schemes in the poorer districts.  It is certainly the height of hypocrisy for people like Deputy Dillon, who pose as champions of the Gaeltacht areas, to scout the idea of having such schemes there.  I am sorry that the Minister is not providing a much larger sum for these schemes.  In regard to the £9,500 allocated to county committees of agriculture, I appeal to the Minister, if it is at all possible, to increase that amount.  That money is mainly for the purpose of providing lime subsidies in congested and poorer districts.  Deputies who live in these areas realise the usefulness, as well as the great necessity of lime schemes.  That is especially the <Col N="1083" /> case in Kerry, where we feel very grateful for the assistance that has been given in that direction.  We have been advised that further grants will be required for that purpose, and I hope a larger amount will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the purchase of cattle for canning purposes, that scheme has been a great help in Kerry, in addition to the scheme for sending uneconomic cows to the Roscrea factory. The trouble about that scheme was that in some cases the inspectors in charge did not purchase directly from the producers.  As is well known, when these schemes were in course of inauguration, certain parties tried to take advantage of them and to make them inoperative.  Small dealers tried to defeat the object of these very effective schemes.  While the inspectors and the Department did their utmost on behalf of the people, still there were certain causes of complaint.  Despite that, I appeal on behalf of the people of South and West Kerry, to have that scheme reintroduced in these areas so that further consignments of cattle might be shipped to the Waterford factory. It may be said that there is no surplus of cattle.  There is a surplus, and a scheme such as that, worked in the way it was worked, was a God-send to the farmers on the mountain sides of South Kerry.  We realise that the Minister and the Department of Agriculture are doing everything possible to meet the farmers.  At the same time it is up to us, as representatives of the people to point out any defects as we find them, not by way of criticism but by way of assistance. Sometimes Deputies criticise the Department and its officials.  They do that in good faith on the understanding that errors may be rectified and that the people will benefit. There is only one other matter which I wish to refer to, and that is in connection with creameries.  About a year ago Deputy Belton was very sarcastic in his comments on travelling creameries.  He scoffed at the idea of travelling creameries, and ridiculed the Minister when a Bill <Col N="1084" /> was introduced to make these available in certain parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn has supplied the phrase which was omitted from Deputy Dillon's speech in referring to the assistance given to live stock schemes in congested districts. Deputy Flynn said it was the height of hypocrisy to make this sarcastic reference.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Dillon's point was that it was the height of hypocrisy on the part of the Government to be endeavouring to have cattle schemes anywhere in view of the fact that they were out for slaughtering calves and that the whole purpose of the Executive Council, as expressed by Senator Connolly and other people, is to kill the cattle industry.  That was Deputy Dillon's point, but Deputy Flynn just supplied the exact phrase that Deputy Dillon ought to have used, that it was the height of hypocrisy on the part of the Government to be doing that and killing calves at the same time.  As to one thing that Deputy Flynn said, I am glad to see that somebody has a good word to say for the canning industry.  I presume that is the scheme that Deputy Flynn said was a God-send to certain parts <Col N="1085" /> of Kerry.  There are a good many God-sends in this country at present, but they are at the expense of the State, and so is this at the expense of the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us continue to trade upon our capital in every respect. That does not appear to be the opinion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he goes down the country to open a factory and tells the people that the whole success of that factory depends on the prosperity of agriculture. Yet, if we take up any Estimate, we find that anything that is paying at present is paying at the expense of the State, and not on its own merits. We have in this Estimate what, indeed, was anticipated by any person who considered the matter sanely, and that is that in establishing a canning industry in a country which was one of the greatest producers of fresh meat in the world, in order to get rid of our surplus cattle, it was evident that there was going to be a loss.  It is a loss, a dead loss.  It may have been a God-send to some people, just as the dole is a God-send to some people.</P>
      <P>This Estimate really shows us the type of wibbly-wobbly, forlorn agricultural policy which the Government have.  In the main Estimate last year we had an increase in salaries and wages of £23,081.  In this Estimate we have a further increase in salaries and wages.  What have we got for that increase?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have we got greater prosperity in agriculture?  The Fianna Fáil Party told the farmers in one of their election leaflets of the prosperity that was to come to agriculture under a Fianna Fáil Government.  As far as administrative expenses are concerned, there is evidence of any amount of prosperity in the Department, but not down the country.  Anything that represents a profit has to be subsidised by the State.  That is the position we find ourselves in after all this expenditure. We have increases in various items in this Estimate.  In addition to <Col N="1086" /> an increase in salaries and wages of £23,000 at the beginning of the year we have a further increase in this Estimate.  If we could see that that would give us a profit on something we would welcome it, because it is badly needed.  But for a Government that came in to reduce expenditure and to make agriculture pay for the first time it is an extraordinary position to find themselves in.  We have also evidence here&mdash;I am afraid it is not gratifying for the farmers&mdash;of the Minister's own attempts at cattle dealing. He told us that he wants £214,000 for the purchase of additional cattle for export, and that he expects at least to make ends meet.  That is about all he can hope for.  I wonder where these cattle are to be exported to?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter where these are exported to, let it be-Italy, Ethiopia, Czecho-Slovakia, Germany, or any other place, if they are to be purchased at the price which is made from British buyers here and which carries the annuities, then we are paying the annuities to these other countries also.  In the frantic efforts of the Government to right the situation and to do something with it we have all these Bills, all this extra administration, and all this control, a control which I am afraid is working out very badly.  We had complaints made about the Pigs and Bacon Boards, and Deputy Moore, whom I always regard as an honest man, wanted to know what is the policy of the Opposition with regard to the Pigs Marketing Board.  Why should it be criticised?  I would like to ask Deputy Moore in return and I would like to ask the Minister are they perfectly satisfied with those boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's complaint was that these boards were exceeding their jurisdiction.  If the Minister thinks that is so, then it is the Minister's job, if he has not the power, to get the power.  If those people are going to interfere with the pig trade against the interests of the people of the country &mdash;and that is the net result of their <Col N="1087" /> interference&mdash;then the matter falls to be dealt with immediately.  I do not think, as a matter of fact, that the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board are giving satisfaction to anybody.  That is my own opinion&mdash;I do not think they are.  Certainly if their interference means the wiping out of what is known all over the country as the ordinary pig-jobbers, it will be bad for the pig trade and very bad for the country.  If the Minister feels in that respect that something is going to happen which will not be beneficial to the pig-feeders of this country, then it is his business to interfere.  Surely, when we are spending such huge sums on salaries and administration, we ought to get some value for the expenditure?  Are we getting value for it?  That is what the Minister ought to ask himself.  If he gets a satisfactory answer to it, well and good.  If he does not, then it is his job to set the matter right.</P>
    <P>An extraordinary thing was pointed out by Deputy Dillon in relation to the extra special subsidy to beet growing in Cooley.  It does seem to be an extraordinary thing if Deputy Dillon's calculation is correct&mdash;and I believe it is&mdash;that an acre of beet is costing the State £24 5s. 0d.  There is no use in putting it up to the people of this country that it is a good proposition to grow beet if the State has to foot the bill.  After all, the State is in the same position as an individual.  If the State is in business it must show a profit.  If it does not show a profit it goes down, and that's that.  We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he goes down the country to open a factory, no matter what it is, always making the speech that somebody in my Party has already made in this House.  That is, that agriculture is the chief industry, and that it must be made to pay before we can hope to make a success of any other industry.  Then the Minister comes into the House and says: &ldquo;We have nothing to offer you but subsidised items, as far as agriculture is concerned.&rdquo;  We have got to get away from that.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if I were a member of <Col N="1088" /> the Fianna Fáil Party, I would be very sorry and I would feel very much ashamed after all the promises made to the country with regard to the reductions in taxation to come before this House with an Estimate like that we have seen this evening, showing in one item an increase of £200,000, and in another a huge extra amount.  Is that sort of thing going to give us prosperity? I think if the effect of introducing this Estimate to-night would be to induce the Minister for Agriculture to take stock of the whole situation that exists in this country, the result might be of some use.  But if the Minister for Agriculture thinks that Government control of the main industry of this country, as illustrated by those Estimates, and as illustrated by huge increases in administration, salaries, wages and allowances, is going to bring prosperity to agriculture, he is making the biggest mistake he ever made in his life.  Government control of industry is bound to have bad effects.  It is bound to kill initiative and individual effort.  The probabilities are that our successors will be inheritors to the administering of a State the people of which will look to the Government for guidance in everything. That sort of thing is bad and definitely bad.</P>
    <P>The last item about which I would like to question the Minister is this matter of the appointment of inspectors under the county committees of agriculture.  Like Deputy Corry, I am deeply interested in these inspectors. I do not know exactly what the Minister's control is.  I am afraid his control is nil.  However, he has control of the funds.  Like Deputy Corry, I would like to know what inquiries were made by his Department as to the qualifications of those inspectors?</P>

      <P>In the matter of the Appropriations-in-Aid I was rather disappointed.  I suppose it would be expecting too much to get the information I expected although it might have come in under one of the sub-heads. I was anxious to see what Appropriations-in-Aid the Minister expected under the head of the cattle and sheep levies.  That information has not come to us although we are providing money under that particular Act.  I am afraid for to-night at least we are denied the opportunity of looking into those things.  In view of the expectations raised on the main Estimate, I would be very anxious to see how they are carried out and how they have been fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serious side of this Vote is that our expenditure in administration is going up and control by officials is going up.  I am afraid that the House has no control whatever over the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board.  It is the Minister's duty, if he feels that the administration of these boards is not beneficial to the country, to see that he gets that information or, at all events, that somebody gets it.  The proof of the advantage of having these boards or not having them will rest entirely on the question of the production of pigs in this country.  Are we producing more pigs?  Are we going to produce more pigs in the future?  We will produce more pigs in this country on the one basis only and that is if we get paying prices for them.  There is no use in anybody thinking anything else. That is what will make us produce more pigs.  Will the operations of the Pigs Marketing Board have that effect?  I am sure they will not.  If the Minister requires legislation for the purpose of <Col N="1090" /> amending any of those Acts, I say it is his job to see that that legislation is put through.  As far as we are concerned we will give him every assistance possible, but personally I am not at all satisfied that it has been working satisfactorily.  I am not at all satisfied that the producers are getting what they ought to get.  The price of pigs and the price of the finished article, bacon, are not equated, and it is the Minister's business to inquire into the matter so that it will be put right in some way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will not give it either to-day or on Wednesday, neither will any Minister.  I would give way to the Deputy now if he would make even an attempt at it.  I think he will find it even more difficult to put a face or a skin on an answer to that inquiry than he found it in regard to a matter with which the Minister for Finance was dealing here a short time ago.  It is interesting to look at some of the items on this Estimate.  We find: &ldquo;Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Acts.  Purchase of cattle for canning, £10,000.&rdquo;  I think it was Deputy Brennan referred to a canning industry being started here.  I think the origin of the canning industry was in areas where there was a large surplus of meat or fruit or something else.  Canning also had its origin in the fact that there are particular times of the year when certain commodities are in season, and that it is desirable to preserve them for other times of the year when they are out of season.  But here in Ireland fresh meat is always in season.  We always have a market, and we are in close proximity to markets.  Therefore, from the point of view of distance for an exchange of goods, we should not require to can. From the point of view of carrying meat from one season of the year to another, there is no need to can it, because at all seasons of the year we can have fresh meat in this country. Fresh meat is the best kind of meat to have, and gives the best return to the producers.  Anything else you do with it has a two-fold injurious effect.  It puts up the cost of production, and it puts down the grade of the meat.  In ordinary commerce, therefore, no meat should be canned in this country, from any point of view.  It is only an outcome, a blister that has risen on the soul created in the body economic in <Col N="1092" /> this country by Government policy, by Government folly, by the Government trailing their coat and challenging a fight.  For principle?  Every principle for which this fight was supposed to be fought has been abandoned.  With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I would develop that statement only that there are days near at hand when it can be well developed.</P>

Who is doing the buying, and who is passing the resolutions for the Government and saying that this country is prosperous?  It is the people who are being paid for buying the cattle in the Dublin market. Will any Deputy on the Government Benches get up and deny that these are sounding horns for the Government, members of which have been telling the country and all whom it may concern of the agricultural and economic prosperity that we have here.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether the Minister or the Government took cognisance of the fact that, subsequent to our declaration of war on Italy a few months ago whereby we refused to send cattle to that country&mdash;I am sure Mussolini got a heart attack when he heard of it&mdash; the export of cattle from this country to Germany increased.  I wonder where did they find their ultimate destination? I think if they were followed they would be found crossing the Alps, so that the position we find ourselves in is this: that while we are subsidising the sale of cattle to Germany the people there are able to double the prices they pay us for them by sending them into Italy.</P>

      <P>I never saw Deputy Donnelly so scared before.  He is afraid of his life that anything will be mentioned about the annuities. He can manoeuvre well, but his manoeuvring this evening did not do him justice.  Deputy Brennan said that if the Pigs Marketing Board and the Bacon Marketing Board were not a success, and that if the Minister has no power to interfere with them, he should seek power to do so.  But, did not everyone who studied the Act under which these boards were set up realise at the time that the measure was going through the Oireachtas that it could not be a success for anybody except the bacon-curers?  The Bacon Marketing Board was constituted of five or seven members, all nominees of the bacon-curers, with the Minister appointing the chairman.  If these nominees were unanimous on any point, the chairman had no power to interfere.  The Pigs Marketing Board was constituted of six members, with a chairman nominated by the Minister.  Three of the members of that board were nominated by the Bacon Marketing Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and I am only making a passing reference to it because of the statement made that the board has not been a success from the bacon producers' point of view.  I am simply saying that, from its very constitution, it could never be a success, because the pig producers were not represented on it, while on the Bacon Board the bacon-curers had full control, with half control on the Pigs Marketing Board.  The three alleged representatives of the bacon producers were nominees of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is now discussing an Act that has already been passed by the Oireachtas.  He is pointing out defects in it.  He should know that he can only discuss the administration of the Act.</P>

      <P>The only further comment I will make is that that Act could not prove to be a success from the pig producers' point of view.  Deputy Brennan was right when he said that the test of the success of that Act is the amount of extra bacon that we will produce, and my submission is that that will be contingent on, and only on, the price that we receive for pigs. The cost of agricultural administration and of experimental work is rising in an alarming way.  The position is, that a decadent industry has to bear all the increases that are being imposed on it every day that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is presented with a new key at the opening of some new industrial undertaking and poses before the camera.  When a new industry is set up it gets a guaranteed market and is protected by a high tariff which, in effect, means so much more of a tax on the general agricultural industry, not one single branch of which is paying its way to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Cereals Act fixing prices was going through the Dáil, it was pointed out to the Minister that no matter what artificial prices were fixed, the ultimate price that the cereals would be worth would be their value as feeding stuffs.  That price is fixed by the home market and externally. Recently, the Minister in consultation with the Department of Agriculture in Great Britain imposed a further tax on our own agricultural industry.  More inspectors are to be appointed, and the cost of them is, I understand, to be borne locally.  The Minister discovered the presence of a warble fly.  The result is that cattle have to be dressed and inspectors appointed.  The dressing of the cattle will involve a certain amount of expense, not a great lot, but it is something.  New machinery is to be set up to deal with this pest.  The cost of all that has to be borne by an industry in respect of which the Minister has done nothing to raise the general level of wholesale prices, while the general level of wholesale and retail prices of commodities which that industry has to buy have gone up considerably.  In most of the lines of general agriculture to-day the price is considerably below pre-war&mdash;some of them are half pre-war&mdash;while <Col N="1095" /> the goods that agriculturists have to buy are double pre-war and often more.</P>
    <P>These are matters that the Minister for Agriculture should consider and he should consider that his job is a little more responsible than merely carrying out automatically the administration of his Department, the administration of schemes throughout the country that are being carried out by the committees of agriculture, and the periodical visits of inspectors to agricultural meetings and to inspect agricultural schemes carried out in the country.  He should consider that his job goes a little further&mdash;both his job and that of his understudy, the Minister for Defence &mdash;than in attending an odd ploughing match now and again and cocking his eye to see whether the furrow is straight or not.  Ploughing matches are very good things in their way, but what counts, and the only thing that counts, is the remuneration coming to the produce of the plough, and the Minister has failed to increase the remuneration of the plough.  Not a single item in agriculture has gone up in price since the Minister came into office.  Generally, they have gone down.  Of course, I shall be met with the price of butter.  It is easy to put up the price of an article if you tax it first in order to inflate the price, and that is the position with regard to butter.  The area that gave the Minister worry, evidently, was Kerry.  I am sorry that there are no Kerry Deputies here at the moment.  Kerry shouts for a republic but will not bear the cost and expense of looking for it.  The black cattle in Kerry could not get a market.  Well, why should some platform men claim that Kerry is 100 per cent. republican? Why is it not 100 per cent. ready to bear the sacrifices that their votes helped to impose on other counties? Somebody must have squealed in Kerry when the Minister thought it well to set up a canning factory to absorb the old long-horn cattle in Kerry that would not bear the British tariff on export.  They would not have been even worth it.  All that could have been done with them <Col N="1096" /> was to shoot them where they stood. But no, a canning factory was set up for them in Roscrea and a guaranteed price fixed for them.</P>
    <P>Not only that, but Deputy Flynn a moment ago started criticising the attitude I took up with regard to travelling creameries.  He wanted to prove their utility and success and referred to the benefit the canning factory had been to Kerry.  Of course, his attitude and the attitude of the Government made it impossible to get a price for those black cattle in Kerry &mdash; those cattle that had a remunerative market up in the midlands every year.  None of them come to the midlands now, however, because the midlands cannot afford to buy them, or, if they can buy them, they cannot sell them.  In addition to that, however, a further assistance to the Kerry cattle area was that the 4d. per pound tax to be levied on home-made butter would be levied on all of the Free State area except the Kerry cattle area.  In that area they can produce butter in their homes without paying that tax, and they have the whole of the Free State for a market.  I should like to hear some Kerry Deputy here put before this House what claim, in equity, Kerry has to that special treatment. The Minister never made an attempt to defend it.  Evidently, there was a political fly in the ointment there and this is the method the Minister adopted to get it out of the ointment.</P>
    <P>I made reference to what appears, in the opinion of the Minister, to be the beginning and ending of his responsibility.  I am not aware of the Minister for Agriculture raising his voice at any time in protest against any imposition that Government policy made, and that ultimately would fall on agriculture.  He seems to have no further vision than the formulation of schemes and getting county committees of agriculture to carry them out.  He seems never to have any regard to the ultimate income that will come to agriculture either from those schemes or from the general routine of the old schemes for agriculture.  He does not seem to bother, and he has not left agriculture as well off as he found it. <Col N="1097" /> Neither is he making any genuine attempt to improve its position.  In a few days, we will have an opportunity of going over the ground in more detail, and I hope that the Minister for Agriculture will be present when that debate comes, because he, as a Minister, will be more concerned in that debate, as he should be more concerned, than any other Minister of the Government. As I see Ministers here, however, they just come in whenever they have something connected with their own Department, and they never interest themselves in anything else, just as if a Department of the State is an isolated cell that can work and function of its own without having any bearing on all the other Departments of State.  There is not a measure, or a Vote, or anything of any importance, that comes before this House, that is not of vital importance to agriculture, for agriculture is the foundation of the whole structure of the State, and that has been undermined and there seems to be no thought given to its preservation.</P>
    <P>We had before the House within the last couple of days Bills involving large sums of money.  In connection with housing, the difficulties and the financial straits to which the Dublin Corporation were reduced to get money were pointed out.  The amount of unemployment was laboured by Deputy Kelly here.  Of course, Deputy Kelly, like his colleagues over there generally, never look so far as to see or appreciate that the economic condition of the City of Dublin and the borrowing capacity of the corporation, are both reflected by the economic condition of the country, and particularly the condition of agriculture.  The Deputy knows some large businesses in Dublin which depend entirely on a country trade and which were not able to spend a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; on their premises when their lease under the Dublin Corporation ran out.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry severely criticised the appointment of inspectors in Cork by the Committee of Agriculture for the county.  He had a great grievance because, as he said, they were appointed because of politics. Certainly it is not my experience on Committees of Agriculture that politics interfere with their business at all. Even in connection with the distribution of licences, though I had very little to do with that in the County of Dublin, I had letters from Fianna Fáil farmers in the county, thanking me for the equitable treatment which they got from the county committee which is 80 to 90 per cent. non-Fianna Fáil.  I hope when the adjournment comes this evening the same treatment will be meted out to the young fellow about whom I raised a question to-day.  He is being sacked from a position under the Dublin County Council, simply because he was not a supporter of the Government, and for no other reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The big principle raised by Deputy Dillon was that the Pigs and Bacon Board had too much control in this country.  Deputy Moore asked Deputy Brennan to state the Fine Gael policy on that particular principle&mdash;whether they agreed that these boards should get full autonomy, or whether the Government should interfere.  I think Deputy Brennan said the Government should interfere if the boards were not doing their business properly.  Any unscrupulous Minister, it might be suggested, could say they are not doing their business properly and, therefore, he should interfere.  I would like to know if that is the considered policy of Fine Gael, because naturally when we are framing Bills we like to know beforehand what the opposition is going to be and, although we may not have a very high regard for the Opposition in some respects, we know that the votes count, <Col N="1102" /> and therefore we have to consider their policy in regard to various matters.</P>
      <P>When we regulate an industry like the pig industry and when we say to the producers and the factories: &ldquo;Take over that industry and regulate it for yourselves and you will have no interference from the Minister or civil servants,&rdquo; is it to be the policy of Fine Gael to reply: &ldquo;No; always keep the control in the Minister's hands, so that if they do anything wrong he will be able to make it right&rdquo;?  As Deputy Moore says, we then go looking for a board, and when I get a board I say to the members of it: &ldquo;As long as you do right, I will not say anything; but if you go wrong, I will interfere.&rdquo; What sort of a board will you get in these circumstances?  Certainly not a self-respecting one.  You might get a board prepared to act for what they are paid, but for no other reason.  Such a board would be very particular not to offend the Minister and, therefore, they will always do what the Minister wants them to do.  So the Fine Gael policy is that when we regulate an industry like that you will let the Minister have full control and his wishes are to be carried out in all things.  Perhaps Fine Gael are right.  If you have a sensible Minister, that is a good policy.  But I do not think Fine Gael would agree with that if I had put it into the Bacon Bill.  Deputy Dillon may have put his foot in it, and Deputy Moore may have asked a rather awkward question. Possibly Deputy Brennan did not want to let Deputy Dillon down and he had to take up a definite attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been told the pig-buyers will be put out of business.  I believe the Chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Board made a speech saying that the boards were considering the proposal to buy pigs themselves for the factories.  I do not know whether they have power to do that.  If they have not, we may have to come here for it.  If they have power and it is considered wrong that they should use it, we can stop them here.  Either way, the Dáil can deal with the matter.  I will say exactly what I said to the pig-buyers themselves. They asked me my attitude and I said that if the board convinced me that the farmers will get more <Col N="1103" /> under that method than at present, then I would agree with the board. Naturally, we will give the pig-buyers another chance of stating their position before we take that final step.  I think everybody here will agree that if the farmers get a better price under a scheme of that kind than they are getting from the pig-buyers, by all means they should be allowed to get the better price.  I am sure all Deputies here will agree on that point, because Deputies seem always to be on the side of the farmers.</P>
    <P>If we think we can give the farmer 1/- or 2/- more for his pigs, we will give it to them whatever the scheme may be.  Of course we will have complaints from the traders in the towns about markets being stopped.  I think Mr. O'Brien in his Cork speech made a good case when he said what does it matter to the traders in the towns; would they not be better off if the farmers have more money?  Why should the traders object to the farmers getting a better price for their pigs if they spend the money with them?  We are told that the farmers spend all the money they have, so that eventually all the money goes to the shopkeepers in the towns, and they will be better off if the farmers get a better price at the factories as compared with sending their stock to the fairs.  If it is a good scheme and if it will give the farmers a better price, we will be with them; if it is not a good scheme and if it does not give them a better price, we will not favour it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon wants to know if I intend to decline to answer questions here for the two boards.  I do not intend to answer certain questions for the boards.  The boards have full control in certain ways.  I have power to ask them for returns.  They have full control with regard to price for pigs. Either board is entirely responsible and they have no obligation to me in regard to the price of pigs as long as they fulfil the provisions of the Act. I do not see how I can defend them here and it is only a loss of time to put questions in regard to those matters.  It is possibly true the first <Col N="1104" /> price the boards fixed did not allow for the cost of production, but I am sure they now have given due consideration to the cost of production.  There are three men on the Pigs Board who represent the producers, and, naturally, any argument they can use like that in regard to the cost of production they do use it.  I am quite sure they have used the argument that the cost of production is high and that they are not getting it.  As the Act is framed, I think it is quite plain that the board are bound to give due consideration to that point and fix the price.  I would say that if the board were to fix the price so as to give the farmer a fair return the whole year round, they would be carrying out their duties in a fair way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has blamed the board for altering prices so very often.  I would not blame the Pigs Board for altering the price, because, in the first place, they are acting for the first year; they are, as it were, feeling their way, and they hope eventually to have about two or three periods for the whole year with prices running over a long period.  This year naturally they will have to alter fairly frequently.  There is another difficulty that they are up against.  I am afraid the Act will have to be amended.  Deputy Dillon was very insistent on having an amendment introduced in the Bill that they must give notice of a change of price.  I argued against that fairly strongly, but, being somewhat impressed by the arguments used by Deputy Dillon, as I always am, I eventually gave in; but I find it was a great mistake, because if they have to give four or five days' notice of a change of price&mdash;suppose they are putting the price up&mdash;there will be no pigs sold to the factory until the four or five days are over, and the farmer gets the increased price.  If they put the price down, there will be a rush of pigs into the factory.  The only way they can get over that difficulty is to adopt the method they have adopted of altering prices before the period is over.</P>
    <P>I was asked whether the Bacon Marketing Board has power to fix minimum prices for bacon.  I am not sure, but I think it would be a very good <Col N="1105" /> thing if they can do it, because I think that any Deputy who considers the matter will see that, if there was a fixed price, there would be much less profiteering by the factory, the wholesaler and the retailer.  I ask Deputies to consider the example of butter.  We have absolutely fixed prices in respect of the creamery, the wholesaler and the retailer, and, as a result of these fixed prices, there is less profiteering in the butter business than in any other business I know.  In the same way, if the Bacon Board are able to get fixed prices, ex factory, and if consumers get an idea of what these fixed prices are &mdash;or even if they do not&mdash;the retailers who are getting bacon at the same price, would have to cut prices against one another to the bare minimum at which they can sell, and I think there would be very much less profiteering if fixed prices could be introduced.</P>
    <P>There is something in what Deputy Dillon said about our having a formula in the Department for export quotas. We took a standard year, as it were, 1933, and, on that year, we allotted export quotas to the different factories. Afterwards, it was altered because certain factories did not carry out their quota in the first year and other factories were willing to take more than they were allotted in the first year.  Now it has come to a point at which there has been, I believe, no alteration for months and months. Each factory knows it gets a certain percentage of what is available each month and it has come to be a sort of standard arrangement.  In the same way, the Bacon Marketing Board has an allocation of production, and they go on a standard year, the year 1934. Deputy Dillon is right in saying that the factory gets a certain amount of production.  They can export a certain amount to Great Britain and have the rest for home sales.  If that factory finds a new market like the United States, they must take their supply out of their home sales.  I think that is a defect in the Bill, or in the regulations made by the Board, and if any amendment of the legislation were necessary, that is one of the things that should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked for closer supervision by me of the activities of <Col N="1106" /> these boards.  As I say, I do not agree with that.  I believe that when we regulate industry and set up a board which is representative of the various interests in the industry, we should give them the fullest possible powers and I should not have any power over them.  There are certain things, of course, which we must supervise&mdash;veterinary inspection and matters of that kind &mdash; but in such matters as the allocation of killings to the various factories, the fixing of the prices of bacon and the fixing of the prices of pigs, and other matters perhaps which are entirely a matter for the industry itself, the Minister should not have any power to interfere.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, I think, made an unfair attack on these boards.  He said there was a mess due to inexperience and ineptitude in their first few months of activity.  I think that if any Deputy wishes to be fair to these boards and to give them fair play, he must realise that they were up against a desperate position when they were created.  We had undoubtedly a very big surplus of pigs.  We were limited in our exports by quotas and we were naturally limited in our home consumption, and there were more pigs available than could be used.  They had to deal with that situation with that large surplus on top of them, when they came into operation.  If these boards had been created, say, last June, and if they had had three or four months to prepare for the position, I would agree with Deputy Dillon that they should have done things better, but, as it is, I think they made a very good hand of the whole position.  As a matter of fact, leaving out the Northern Counties, Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan, they had cleared up the mess almost completely in the rest of the Free State inside of about three weeks.  There were very severe complaints, and justifiable complaints, from the farmers' point of view, during the first week or two because the farmers were not able to sell their pigs at the fixed price, but that state of affairs was very quickly cleared up and I think the boards did their business very well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> Deputy Dillon also says that as a result of their messing of the whole position, they now have a large quantity of bacon on their hands. Now, that is not true.  They have been very successful in getting rid of a great deal of the bacon they purchased at that time, and I think they will have no great difficulty in getting rid of the amount of bacon they have on hands, and what bacon they have is in quite good order.  Deputy Dillon also made some allusion to my dealings in cattle, and he wanted to know how much I paid for butter and how much I was paid for butter in the trading I did in that commodity. I did not deal in butter at all.  The Newmarket Dairy Company sold all the butter that was sold to Germany and Belgium.  Their balance sheet will be published in due course and the value of that particular trade will be seen in it.  I could say at this stage, however, that even if we had had a free market in Great Britain last year, we would still have reaped some benefit from our sales of butter in Germany.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon also talked about the subsidy on sugar, and all I can say is that the Deputy was wrong somewhere or other.  I do not know whether he commenced wrongly, or went wrong in the middle of his speech but, at any rate, he ended wrongly. As soon as the official report is issued, he might look through it, and I am sure he will find his mistake, because beet is not costing anything like that by way of subsidies.  I know what he means.  He means that if we had not grown beet, we could import cane sugar at a certain price.  The Deputy talked of the price of cane sugar landed in Dublin, and he wants to know the price of Carlow sugar in comparison.  I say it is not costing anything like what Deputy Dillon made it out to be.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGovern supported Deputy Dillon in advising me to attack the policy of the Pigs Marketing Board. He also deprecated the powers I have of dictating to the various county committees the breed of pigs they should have.  I am glad to say my predecessor, Deputy Hogan, got that power for me when he was in office and I am sure, if he was here, he would agree that that power should be retained by the Minister for Agriculture to see that the best possible breed of pigs is kept in the country, taking into account the home market and the foreign market, and the prices which pigs should realise.</P>
      <P>With regard to the distribution of licences, the Department of Agriculture recoups the county committees for any expense they incur under that scheme.  As far as inspectors are concerned they are temporary men. Deputy Belton knows what that means. You can continue a man for six months; the county committees have the appointments and the Minister does not interfere in any way.  I am not sure that he has the power.</P>

Deputy O'Leary told us of a man who bought a sow and paid £4 10s. 0d.  He said if we had a free market he could pay £2 more.  If the Deputy worked out the matter for himself he would find that the difference between the tariff and the bounty on every sow going into Great Britain would be 15/-, so that the man who said he paid £2 for the bounty had no great regard for the truth.  That is the sort of argument we hear used in this House very often when people are talking about markets.  Deputy O'Leary concluded his speech, as usual, by saying the country is going into bankruptcy. Almost four years ago that kind of speech was first made in this House. At intervals of about three months the same speech was made.  We were always told the country was going into bankruptcy and cannot last much longer.</P>

      <P>As regards cattle for canning, there cannot be any more cattle taken for canning until about July, because cattle suitable for canning will not be in condition until they get more grass.

      <P>I gave notice to-day that I would raise a question on the adjournment arising out of the reply to Question No. 1 on the Order Paper dealing with the order for dismissal of an employee of the Dublin County Council by the Department of Local Government, and the filling of the vacancy by the Appointments Commissioners. The reply of the Minister to that question was not satisfactory, but I felt, from the reply given by the Minister to my supplementary question, that he was not aware of all the facts.  In that supplementary question I asked whether the Minister was aware that a temporary clerk in the county council office had been promoted to the permanent staff since the Minister took office, after an examination or educational test by the secretary of the county council and a favourable report as to the result.  I understood the Minister to say he was not aware of that.  I do not want to make any more of this case than is necessary, because I should be surprised at the Minister treating anybody harshly, especially a young fellow who has given over three years' satisfactory service in a temporary capacity.  I can assure the Minister <Col N="1112" /> that the case I mentioned in the supplementary question was accurately described.  If the Minister would be prepared to look into this matter I should be prepared to furnish him with proof of the subject matter of the supplementary question and if he would consider this case on similar lines to those on which be dealt with the other case I should not be anxious to proceed further with the matter now, as I feel sure that the Minister would deal equitably with this and any other case brought to his notice.  Would the Minister at this stage like to have the full facts of this and similar cases brought to his notice?  If he would I should not proceed further.  I am quite satisfied that the Minister would have justice done, and I should be prepared to leave the matter in his hands.</P>

      <P>I shall consider any facts&mdash;particularly any new facts&mdash;that Deputy Belton brings to my notice.  After the discussion we had on the question to-day I made inquiries and was told that what Deputy Belton had said was correct&mdash;that a man had been sanctioned under the circumstances mentioned.  I should like to repeat, however, that the getting of people into the local services by the back door&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;is a thing we have always been up against in the Department. That applies not only to the period during which I have been Minister but to the period of office of my predecessor and of every other Minister. We have always been trying to get the principle adopted by the local authorities that appointments to the local services should be by means of competitive examination.  They adopt that for a time, but then some influential ratepayer or member of a board comes along and gets a son or daughter appointed for six months. The Deputy knows, as I know, that that is done.</P>

I have <Col N="1113" /> a case before me where a man has been seven years in temporary employment, and it is only now it is brought to my notice.  It is very hard to put a man or woman who has been in a position for seven years out of that position. In Deputy Belton's case, the man has been three years in the position, but one must make a stand somewhere.</P>

      <P>If the principle is night, nobody ought to be allowed longer than six months by way of a temporary appointment.  There is another official&mdash;a lady&mdash;who has been 18 months or two years in the temporary service of the Dublin County or the Dublin Board of Health.  That lady will have to go out when her present period of sanction ends.  There are similar cases hanging over in a number of county councils and boards of health.</P>
      <P>I issued a general instruction to the Department that, without reference to any individual, we must stop this business of people getting in by the back door.  In these cases, the individual concerned is brought in without advertisement. Nobody knows such an appointment is to be made except the members of the county council or board of health.  The relative of some county councillor or member of the board of health is slipped in without the knowledge of the ratepayers, whose sons and daughters are equally entitled to try for the post.  That has been the position not only in Dublin County or Cork County, but all over the country. Wherever they could get away with it, they have been doing that.  Members say&mdash;not all, but some&mdash;&ldquo;This is the only bit of value we get out of membership of a public board in the way of patronage.&rdquo;  They try to get away with it in that way, and it is not fair to the ratepayers.  I think that Deputy Belton would agree with me in that and would stand for the principle of competitive examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, but I should like to point out to the Minister that, in the British and Irish Civil Service, where it was decided that unestablished posts should be established and filled in future by competitive <Col N="1114" /> examination, a chance was given to those who were temporarily employed to remain in and a start was made by saying that any new entrants would have to come in by competitive examination.  I agree that the Minister is right in establishing the principle of competitive examination, or whatever system is considered most equitable, but I do submit that anybody who has been in a position for a year, two years, or seven years, and who has given satisfaction, should not be thrown out on the road.  I have no personal interest in the boy involved in this case, but I do not consider it is fair to dispense with him now.  If he were in my personal employment, I should not throw him out, and I am sure the Minister would not throw him out if he were in his employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is there all the same.  If you had a person in your employment who was doing your work well you would not think of dismissing him.  This boy is doing his work well although he did not enter by competitive examination.  If the Minister decides that henceforth the principle of competitive examination must be observed in these appointments I shall agree with him.  It is the fairest way.  Every councillor who has no axe to grind agrees with that, because the other system is the greatest nuisance.  Every member of public boards knows all about it.  The Minister know it, because he was a member of public boards.  He knows that tails are pulled by this, that and the other person.  It is a nuisance, let it be good, bad or indifferent.  That is the way appointments were filled. This boy was in this position for three years after leaving school, and it is not fair to him, after spending three years there, and from the business side giving satisfactory service, to have to leave his position now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider that aspect of it, not only in his case, but in the case of anyone who has given service and who has been in a position for some time, and to give <Col N="1115" /> them a chance of continuing.  He could apply the principle of competitive examinations for new entrants.  I had nearly 20 years' experience of the British Civil Service, and I saw many classes in it that were temporary abolished.  Those who were in these classes were made permanent, but new entrants were recruited by means of competitive examination.  In no case was anyone dismissed.  They were always allowed to remain on in their positions.  I am glad the leader of the Labour Party is present.  I am sure he will support that principle.  I could say a great deal more on this matter as I got information about certain people boasting here, there and elsewhere, but I have sufficient confidence in the Minister to see fair play done. <Col N="1116" /> Though I heard that political influence was brought to bear on him I do not believe it.  I do not believe the Minister would fall for that.  That is why I am not going to use information that I cannot prove.  It was given to me as gospel, but I do not accept things as gospel unless I am convinced.  I do not accept the suggestion that the Minister would be influenced in any way in a matter like that.  I appeal to him to consider the cases of people already in the service, and to let the new principle, which is a good one, be adopted from now on for new entrants.  I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider this case.</P>
