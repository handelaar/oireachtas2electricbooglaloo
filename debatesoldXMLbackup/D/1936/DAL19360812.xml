      <P>Arising out of the Vice-President's reply, while I can easily afford to wait and see, I should like to ask the Vice-President to consider whether or not the electors of Galway and Wexford can and whether they are not entitled to know the answer to the first question on the Order Paper; also whether he will consider introducing emergency legislation to postpone the polling days of these elections until the Government shall have made up their mind as to the answer to the first question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett (for Mr. M. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he intends to take any <Col N="2538" /> steps to safeguard and maintain the rights to fishing in certain parts of Lough Foyle, claimed by and hitherto enjoyed by Free State nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Vice-President (for the Minister for External Affairs)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply given on the 27th October, 1932, to two questions by Deputy McMenamin relating to the same matter.</P>
      <P>As I stated in the reply referred to, two separate and distinct issues are involved in connection with Lough Foyle&mdash;(1) the claim of the lessees of the Irish Society to a several fishery in Lough Foyle, and (2) the question of jurisdiction over the waters of the Lough.  In the year 1932 the Government of Saorstát Eireann put forward a proposal for a temporary administrative arrangement pending the settlement of the fishery dispute and without prejudice to the wider question of the jurisdiction of Saorstát Eireann over the waters of the Lough.  The British Government made it a condition precedent to any administrative arrangement that the Government of Saorstát Eireann should agree to submit the legal issues involved in the question of the boundary between Saorstát Eireann and the United Kingdom in the Lough Foyle area to a British Commonwealth Tribunal.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann declined to submit any such issue to a British Commonwealth Tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Correspondence between the two Governments continued during the years 1933 and 1934.  In the year 1933 I again put forward the proposal which we made in the previous year. The British Government replied by placing a new difficulty in the way. They could not regard as acceptable any proposal for temporary administrative measures except on the basis of the <i>de facto</i> recognition of the claim of the Irish Society and its lessees to the several fishery during the currency of these measures.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann declined to enter into any agreement purporting to deprive any member of the public of his right to challenge the claim of the Irish Society or their lessees in the courts of Saorstát Eireann.  I accordingly requested the <Col N="2539" /> British Government not to persist in maintaining this new condition then put forward by them for the first time in a discussion which had extended over a number of years.  The British Government refused, however, to withdraw this new restriction.</P>
    <P>The matter, therefore, now stands as follows.  The Government of Saorstát Eireann are still willing to make temporary administrative arrangements for the preservation of order on the waters of Lough Foyle pending the settlement of the fishery dispute and without prejudice to the general question of jurisdiction.  But we decline to accept either of the conditions which the British Government seek to impose as a condition precedent to those arrangements.  We decline, that is to say, either (1) to give any undertaking that we will submit the international dispute as to our jurisdiction in the Lough Foyle area to a British Commonwealth Tribunal or (2) to make any agreement with regard to the fishery dispute itself which would prejudice the issue in that dispute or which would purport to remove the legal right of any citizen of Saorstát Eireann to test the claim of the Irish Society or their lessees in the courts of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be true to say that, having undertaken to the people of Donegal in 1932 that, if elected, the Government would dispose of this difficulty in six months, the facts now are that negotiations for a settlement of this dispute, conducted by the last Government to a point very closely approximating to success, have been made a hopeless mess of by their successors in office, and that we are now in a position in which the unfortunate fishermen of Lough Foyle are going to be denied their right to earn their livelihood there through the incompetence of the negotiating Minister who took charge of this matter <Col N="2540" /> when the late Government went out of office?</P>

      <P>(Clare) asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if reports have reached him as to the recruitment of labour on a water supply scheme at Miltownmalbay, County Clare, if he is aware that no rotation of work is in operation, although the work is in progress now for over three months; that people who have not any dependants are employed whilst others who have large and young families are left unemployed, and that in many cases the names are not procured from the employment exchange when workers are needed on the scheme, and if he will send an officer to investigate and report at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>No reports other than the Deputy's letter of the 10th June last were received by me in regard to the recruitment of labour for this work.  The work is being carried out by contract and the rotational system of employment does not apply.  The latest return of men engaged on the work shows that the total number employed was recruited from the lists of men obtained from the local exchange.  The matter has already been the subject of an investigation by an officer of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and it is understood that a communication in relation thereto has recently been addressed to the Deputy by that Department.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the area of employment is within a mile of Miltownmalbay where there are 40 families drawing the maximum unemployment assistance and that the <Col N="2541" /> area of employment given in the scheme is a sparsely populated rural area?  Is that any consideration for the Minister?</P>

      <P>The number of cases of scarlet fever notified to local authorities in 1934 was 3,271 and in 1935, 2,282.  No case of small-pox was notified in either of these two years.  During the years 1925 to 1933 inclusive the total number of cases of scarlet fever notified was 21,008.  No cases of small-pox were notified during these years.  The deathrate from small-pox per million of the population in 1935 was&mdash;Nil.  The death rate from scarlet fever per million of the population in 1935 was 30.</P>

Will he cause further inquiries to be made as to whether the quality of this twine is fair value for the price that is being asked for it in view of the fact that numerous complaints are being made that its varying diameter causes the twine to break, particularly in binders in which it is at present being used?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is giving expression to his dissatisfaction before he hears the answer.  I am going to give a full and comprehensive answer to the whole lot.  Question No. 14 by Deputy Charles Fagan and questions Nos. 17-23, inclusive, by Deputy Patrick Belton, appear to have been suggested by the recent shortage in the number of fat cattle licences issued to county committees of agriculture.  The detailed figures in respect of 1935 and 1936 asked for by the Deputies are not comparable, the method of distribution having changed in the meantime, and, therefore, I think it would be more satisfactory to explain generally that the recent shortage in the number of licences issued has arisen from the fact that a very large number of the licences issued to the county committees in the first half of this year had not been used.  In the circumstances, it was not considered until now that a substantial increase in the number of licences would be of advantage.  I may say, however, that the question of an increased number of licences for the remainder of this year is under consideration at the moment, and it is expected that satisfactory arrangements in that connection will be made.</P>

But the Minister is aware, I am sure, that he issued only 900 in 1936 as against 1,600 in 1935.  I want to know if the Minister would consider a second issue for Westmeath in view of the shortage of licences at present, because I know there are plenty of cattle to be sold in Westmeath and they could not be sold in the Dublin <Col N="2552" /> market last week owing to the shortage of licences?</P>

      <P>There are on the Order Paper ten items and certain Supplementary Estimates which have been laid before us since the House sat. Amongst these are the Insurance Bill, the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, together with several minor pieces of legislation, all of which are given precedence over the Land Bill.  I submit that it is a matter of vital importance that certain matters arising on the Report Stage of the Land Bill should be debated here to-day in view of statements made by the Minister for Lands in the country during the last week.  Seeing that the Vice-President desires to have all the business disposed of before the Adjournment, I submit that it cannot make any difference in what order the business is taken, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister for Lands is present. I therefore ask the Government to give precedence to the Land Bill and to allow the other matters to follow in the order as they appear.

The question of consulting the Whips has not arisen because, so far as we are aware, the Government have no desire to restrict the time on the Adjournment Debate.  If, at a later stage, it appears to the House that adequate time is not available for discussion on the Thursday and Friday of this week, it might then be open to negotiation for the House to meet again, if that course recommended itself to all sides.

      <P>That the Dáil approves of the alterations in the Rules of Court (Orders XXV, XXVI and XXVII) made by the Minister for Justice on the 25th day of July, 1936, under Section 36 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Chief Justice that the rules of which the House is now asked to approve have been agreed to by the Rule-Making Committee and that he regards it as important in the interest of litigants that the new procedure should come into force as soon as possible.  The main ideas underlying the proposed new rules are two, viz.:&mdash;(1) to have as far as possible one common procedure in appeals to the Supreme Court instead of a variety of different procedures, and (2) to make provision for appeals hitherto unprovided for, viz., appeals from the Land Commission Appeal Tribunal and on legal points raised in the Circuit Court in workmen's compensation cases.  I ask the House to approve of the new rules as settled by the Rule-Making Committee.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1936, made on the 24th day of April, 1936, by the Executive Council under the Sugar (Control of Imports) Act, 1936 (No. 16 of 1936).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Sugar (Control of Imports) Act, 1936, a Prohibition Order was made on the 24th April last.  That Order prohibited the importation of sugar into Saorstát Eireann during the period beginning on the 1st May, 1936, and ending on the 30th April, 1937. Under Section 37 of the Act it is provided that every Prohibition Order <Col N="2561" /> made shall cease to have effect at the expiration of six months from the date of its making unless the Order is approved by resolution of Dáil Eireann. I propose the resolution accordingly. The matter was very fully discussed on the occasion of the passage of the Sugar (Control of Imports) Act into law, and as the Prohibition Order was merely an operating portion of the legislation, I do not think it is necessary to go into the matter at this stage.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the ruling price of sugar in Liverpool for some time has been about £18 per ton?  I am not quite sure, but I think that price includes some small revenue duty.  Assuming that the price of £18 per ton contains no revenue duty but is the price which an importer would pay for that sugar, can the Minister tell us what customs duty was paid on that sugar, if any, when imported into Saorstát Eireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that either.  I know that the imported sugar, plus the customs duty, is, of course, cheaper than the Saorstát manufactured sugar, plus the excise duty.  But the lower price of the imported sugar would, according to the information at my disposal, if it were passed on to the consumers, be less than ¼d. per lb.  I regret that I have not the figures of the actual customs duty by me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if we put it at 2/6 <Col N="2562" /> per cwt. that would be £2 10s. per ton, and if 12,387 tons of sugar were imported it would suggest that somebody has got approximately £37,000 from the consumers of sugar in this country in extra profits on imported sugar.  These figures are all new to me, and I am only revising them as I stand on my feet which is not an easy thing to do.  I note that the Minister for Finance shakes his head, and, therefore, we want to be sure of our figures. The Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce says that 12,387 tons of foreign sugar were imported under licence.  It is admitted that the price of that sugar, plus the customs duty, will be something less than ¼d. per lb. cheaper than the price of Irish sugar, and ¼d. per lb. would be about 2/8 per cwt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for his correction.  He has had the advantage of three minutes' silence to make the calculation while I was trying to do so on my feet.  Let us take it that the difference in price is about 2/- per cwt.  That gives somebody a profit of £2 a ton on the sugar that was imported, or, approximately, £24,700.  Somebody has had that much profit on these imports of sugar, and what we want to know is, what has been done with it?  Where has that money gone?  I remember this question arising when the Act, under which the Order to import was made, was being discussed in the House.  I remember that we asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce then what it was proposed to do, in the event of a large profit being made by the importing authority on the sugar that came in. To the best of my recollection, the Minister's reply was that the sum of money involved would be so trivial as to make it quite unnecessary to have any legislative provision made about it.  Well, I do not think that £24,700 is a trivial sum, particularly when it is being levied on sugar, and I think the Acting Minister ought to be able to tell us what has become of that money. He ought to be able to tell us who has got it.  Somebody surely has got this rake off, and the Acting Minister ought <Col N="2563" /> to be able to tell us how it is being disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, is inclined to make a case on the statement I made, that the reduced price of the imported sugar, plus the customs duty, would not enable the lower price of the imported sugar to be conveniently passed on to consumers as, in general, the difference was less than ¼d. per lb.  The position is as was explained fully by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when the Act was under discussion in the House some months ago: that it has been found necessary that Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., should be made responsible for the importation of sugar.  The reason for that is that it has been found difficult to regulate prices otherwise.  The total consumption of sugar would be about 120,000 tons per annum, and 12,000 tons was the amount imported last year.  Since it is not the policy of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., to make a profit on any sugar which they may import, I assume that there is no foundation for the Deputy's suggestion that a large sum of money, such as the £24,000 which he has mentioned, has gone, presumably, into the coffers of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo.  It is their policy to have a uniform price for sugar, and any advantage that may accrue by way of a cheaper price in the case of imported sugar will, I am sure, be reflected by an adjustment in the general price level of sugar to consumers in Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no suggestion at all as to where this money has gone.  I do not know where it is going.  All I said was that, from what the Minister told us, there appeared to be a sum of £24,700 unaccounted for, and I wanted to know what had become of it.  I did not know whether Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo, was getting it, or who was getting it.  But, surely, when the Minister knows that that sum is there he ought to ask somebody to account for it.  If it is not the policy of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., to make this profit, then surely this money ought to be passed on to the <Col N="2564" /> consumers of sugar in this country, and if that cannot be done it would be better, I think, in the coffers of the Exchequer than in the coffers of a company which is already enjoying a very valuable monopoly.  I do not think it is reasonable for a Minister to come to the House and say that he is issuing licences to a monopolist, the net cash value of which is £24,700, and that he does not know what they do with that money.  Will the Minister entertain an application from me and grant me a licence on which I can cash-in to the tune of £24,700 at the expense of sugar consumers of this country, because if any individual can go to the Government and get a blank cheque from it for £24,700 on request, then the Government will be a little bit more popular than it at present appears to be.  Surely, we are entitled to ask the Minister what has become of this £24,700.</P>

      <P>The intention, as I have said, is that in general an equal price level should be maintained, but if it is the position that in actual fact the reduction in price occasioned by the cheaper price of the imported sugar cannot be passed on to consumers, then it will go into the Exchequer in the form of licence fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a small fee at the rate of 1d. per cwt. charged for each licence issued.  In actual fact, the position is that I am not in a position to state at what price the sugar was purchased.  The Sugar Company are keeping a separate account of their transactions in imported sugar, and it is only when the account is submitted that we shall be in a position to state how exactly these transactions stand, and what has been the result.</P>

      <P>Having taken 2/4 off sugar with a great flourish of trumpets on the 1st August, the Minister is now quietly putting it back again through a licence fee under the Sugar Act of 1936, so that on this 12,000 tons of sugar that have come in, <Col N="2565" /> the 2/4 that the Minister for Finance has boasted about having taken off sugar is to be put back again and no one is to be made any the wiser. Surely, there are good grounds for inquiry here.  Could not the Minister have got up and told us that at the start?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to draw information out of three Ministers, each one of whom is like an oyster with indigestion, clasping the pearl to its bosom.  Can I persuade any of these Ministers to open and disgorge the pearl of knowledge that he has got?  There is a sum of £24,000 involved.  What the Minister for Industry and Commerce said was this: &ldquo;All I know is that the imported sugar is something less than ¼d. a lb. cheaper than Irish sugar.&rdquo;  As Deputy Rice kindly calculated for us, 2/4 represents ¼d. a lb. on a cwt. of sugar. Let us take it that it is 2/- a cwt. cheaper.  That 2/- a cwt. amounts to £2 a ton, and £2 a ton on 12,387 tons comes to approximately £24,700.  I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what has become of that money, and he threw his hands in the air and said, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;  Now, after consultation, he tells us that what is going to be done with the money is that Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., will keep a separate account, and, when the import period is over, they will inform the Minister what profit they made on these imports of sugar, and the Minister will then fix a licence fee at such a figure as will transfer the entire amount of the profit into the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has declared that on the 1st August he took 2/4 a cwt. off sugar, but it now emerges that, after having taken off 2/4 under the Finance Act, he is going to put on 2/1 under the Sugar (Regulation of Imports) Act, 1936.  Surely that is cheap chicanery.  Why not be quite honest and tell the people you are going to go on taxing sugar in so far as you can knock a tax out of it?  That is <Col N="2566" /> the truth, and instead of trying to play ducks and drakes with figures, why not speak the truth?  If the Minister will tell the people the truth and trust them, he will probably find the criticisms of his actions will not be as stringent as they are at present. There are occasions on which the Minister for Finance is tempted to go beyond the bounds of discretion in telling the people the truth.  Then he is locked up for a while.  He is let out again when he cools off, and when he comes out he speaks more modestly and circumspectly.  These recommendations to circumspection have, perhaps, carried him too far.  Let me assure him that he is quite free to become indiscreet in Dáil Eireann.  He will always have somebody beside him to cover up his tracks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention on the part of Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., to make profits on the imported sugar.  The Deputy has sought to give the impression to the House that there is profiteering or some other procedure going on which would enable the State, for example, to secure certain moneys from the consumer.  If this sugar were imported in the ordinary way by private importers they would make a profit, and the Deputy would not find it necessary to raise the question here.  They would get the usual profit at the expense of the consumer, and we would hear nothing about it. But because it has been found necessary in connection with the administration of the sugar business here that all sugar must be imported through Cómhlucht Siúicre Eireann, Teo., then the Deputy, of course, has a great point, although he has been specifically informed that there is no intention that the company should make profits on such importation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reason that procedure has been adopted is that there will be a uniform price.  If it were possible to transfer to the consumer the reduction in the price of imported as compared with home-produced sugar, it would have been done.  It has not been possible, because it is certainly less than ¼d. per pound.  Until such time as we find out what the position is by examining the account&mdash;pending such examination and pending the receipt of the account, a fee of 1d. per cwt., which is a provisional fee, has been imposed and that goes into the Exchequer. Therefore, so far as there are any profits at present which cannot be passed on to the consumer by reason of the fact that the percentage of 1d. is too small, the Deputy would be justified in saying that such profits will go into the Exchequer.  But we are not in a position to discuss the question, and to know exactly what amounts are involved, until we have the account of the Sugar Company which will show us what the actual purchase price of sugar is.  Then the question of the fee <Col N="2568" /> and the relations of the Exchequer to these transactions can be discussed, having regard to the information available.</P>

Where has it gone to, or where it is likely to go?  It took a lot of argument from this side to induce the Minister to make any statement. We have a perfect right to get all the information possible, in view of the attitude adopted by the Government in connection with the sugar business.

      <P>And the sum in question is an undefined one; let us call it £X.  Obviously, when the Sugar Company is given a monopoly of the importation, they will have that sum of £X clear profit.  It may amount to £2 a ton; it may be slightly more or it may be slightly less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's explanation of the <Col N="2570" /> reason why it could not be handed on to the consumer is that it is smaller than any coin which is circulated here. I presume that is the explanation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are other difficulties in the way too.  There are the difficulties of working into trade. You could not wait until the last grain of home produced sugar was used up to spread out the imported sugar on the market at a reduced figure.  You must have a uniform price all the year round. I think the Minister got a bit mixed. First he explained that the profit arising to the Sugar Company from the importation of that 12,000 tons or thereabouts would be reflected in the general sugar price for the whole year, and that perhaps that bit of profit would be eaten up by selling the home produced sugar at something less than it would be possible to sell it at if there were no profit made on the imported sugar. That was his first line of argument.  He did not seem to be quite sure of that. Then he took up the provisional licence figure of 1d. per cwt.  I should think that a better way would be to have a bulk figure, which should be easily ascertainable independent of the Sugar Company by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce working together.  The Ministry of Industry and Commerce would give the permits for importation.  I am not versed in those permits, but I presume they would show the amount imported, the price paid, and the wholesale price it was worth here.  That would show the exact profit.  The difference between the price of 12,000 tons of sugar so imported, after paying the customs duties, and the price of 12,000 tons of home produced sugar plus the excise duties, would show the total profit of £X.  If that is the position, I consider that the Ministry of Finance would be entitled to that £X in a lump sum, and you will not get it any other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision for regulating the wages of agricultural workers, and to provide for other matters connected with the matters aforesaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to leave being granted for the introduction of this Bill, and I do so for the purpose of eliciting information from the Minister for Agriculture, who I gather is the responsible Minister.  I believe that every Party in this House accepts the principle that the standard of wages at present being paid to agricultural labourers is shamefully inadequate.  I believe that every Party in this House desires to take effective measures to restore to the labouring men on the land of this country a wage sufficient to make it possible for them to pay the rent of a decent municipal house, and to maintain at a decent standard of living such a family as providence may send them.  So far as we are concerned we resent an attempt on the part of the Government to hoodwink and deceive this section of the community by introducing a Bill the title of which would lead them to believe that effective steps were going to be taken by statute of this House to give the labouring man a decent wage, when in fact the Minister responsible for the introduction of this Bill knows that this Bill represents an attempt by the Government to achieve that classical impossibility, the squeezing of blood from a turnip or water from a stone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My submission, Sir, is that before a Bill could be entertained in this House for the fixing of agricultural wages there first devolves upon this House a heavy responsibility to provide a pool of prosperity in the agricultural community adequate to finance a proper Agricultural Wages Bill.  If we fix, under the terms of the proposed Bill, a minimum wage of 30/- a week for the agricultural labourer and require by statute the farmers of this country to pay that wage to every male <Col N="2574" /> employee they have, when those farmers themselves are not in receipt of 15/- a week, much less 30/-, we are simply legislating an impossibility.  I well remember, Sir, how the unemployed of this country were seduced by false promises made by the present Government that if the present Government were allowed to take office in this country they would abolish unemployment. I know the bitter disillusion that came upon the unfortunate men who confidently looked forward to getting employment if they voted for Fianna Fáil.  I say that the Minister for Finance, speaking in North Dublin &mdash;or at least one of his colleagues, although I believe it was the Minister for Finance&mdash;in the General Election of 1932, told the people then that they would all get jobs if they voted for his Party.  The unemployed of this country know the bitter disillusionment with which they met.  I now stigmatize as dishonest and shameful an attempt to perpetrate a similar confidence trick on the agricultural workers of this country, and I say that the introduction of a Bill here to provide a minimum wage for agricultural workers, by a Minister who is himself a Deputy for the County Wexford where he knows that the farmers of that county are, literally, physically unable to find the money to pay the wage that they want to pay to the men who are working for them&mdash;the introduction of a Bill of this kind by such a Minister is a shameless piece of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister to tell us now, how can the small farmers of this country, men with 50 or 60 acres of land, who would employ an agricultural labourer&mdash;because it has to be borne in mind that the residents in the congested areas do not employ agricultural labour; they do the work themselves or their families do it, and we are rather thinking in this Bill of the farmer with 50 or 60 acres who ordinarily employs men&mdash;if these men are engaged on the mixed agriculture which is their only hope for survival, how can they, under existing circumstances, extract money from that agriculture adequate to pay a living wage to the agricultural labourers of this country?  Let the House bear in mind also that the very Minister, who puts <Col N="2575" /> down on this Order Paper a proposal to introduce a Bill to fix agricultural wages, has himself fixed the limit at 24/- a week, and his own colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, has publicly proclaimed that he knows that if anyone went to get between a man and 24/- a week at the present time he would be torn to pieces by those of the labouring classes who are thirsting to get work at that price.</P>
    <P>Does this House consider, as a permanent standard of living for the agricultural workers of this country, that 24/- a week is a satisfactory sum? Is there any Deputy of this House living on 24/- a week?  Is it not shameless hypocrisy on the part of the Minister, who is himself responsible for precipitating a situation in this country in the agricultural districts whereunder the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance says that any person who stood between an agricultural labourer and 24/- a week would be torn to pieces&mdash;is it not shameless hypocrisy for that man to introduce a Bill for the regulation of agricultural wages?  If it were to fix a maximum beyond which they might not hope to go so long as Fianna Fáil was in office, we could understand the purposes of this Bill; but if it is to provide for what most of the people in this House want to provide&mdash;a minimum below which no man will be asked to work&mdash;then I say that the Minister is deliberately destroying the means of paying that minimum wage on the one hand, while with the other he offers, hypocritically, to the labouring men of this country an agricultural wage in this Bill of which we will hear no more until November 4th.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister now to get up and tell us, when he produces this Bill for our consideration, what maximum does he propose to fix and what wage does he think to be a living wage for the agricultural workers of this country?  That is the first question. Having told us what that figure is, will he tell us where are the farmers of this country to get the money to pay that wage so long as he continues the imbecile wrangle which he is at present conducting with the British <Col N="2576" /> Government, which leaves him at one moment urging the people to stand fast while we fight this quarrel to a finish with the ancient enemy, and at the next moment saying to us that he is in friendly negotiation with that Government in order to get a larger outlet for the fat cattle whose throats he wanted to cut six months ago? Where are the farmers to get the minimum wage the Minister intends to fix? What is it going to be?  When does he propose to fix it, and on what basis does he propose to make his calculation? Is it on the basis of the calculations he made when he introduced the beet sugar legislation, when he fixed the labour content of the production of beet sugar at either 21/- or 24/- a week&mdash;I do not remember which&mdash; because if it is, the labouring men of this country are entitled to know that the purpose of the introduction of this Bill is simply to fool them as the unemployed were fooled on the eve of the General Election of 1932.  It would be better for him and the country if he would frankly tell them what he has in mind and what he means to do.  I know that he has not got his Bill printed yet, but he knows what he is going to put in it.  Let him tell us now what is the wage going to be; where are the farmers going to get it, and what market has he in mind in which they can sell their produce at such a price as will enable them to pay the living wage that every Party in this House is prepared to give to the agricultural labourers of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, before Section 6 (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister shall in defining (a) a sale district, (b) a production district and (c) a joint district have due regard to the manner in which local public health authorities carry out their duties to ensure the production of clean wholesome milk in their respective districts and the Minister shall not include in (a) a sale district, (b) a production district or (c) a joint district more than one county health area unless the public health authority of the associated sale district is satisfied and expresses its satisfaction by furnishing the Minister with a certificate signed by its medical officer of health that any other proposed production district constitutes or forms part of a county health area in which the necessary precautions are taken to ensure the production of milk of an equal standard as that produced in the proposed sale district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to safeguard producers of milk and the health of the people within certain sanitary or public health districts where regulations under the Bovine Tuberculosis Order and the Diseases of Animals Act are carried out in an efficient manner and at great expense to the ratepayers.  I quoted expert opinion on the Committee Stage from the report of the Milk Commission of 1933 which sat in Great Britain, where it was accepted <Col N="2585" /> on all sides that the Orders mentioned should be carried out as the very minimum.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only dealing with it by way of reference, and not by way of criticism, to show the backing that such an amendment would have, and what a manifest injustice it would be to a sanitary area, or a public health district, in which they had a full appreciation of their responsibilities and had settled up the necessary machinery to deal with the production of a good article compared with places where such supervision is not provided.  This Bill proposes to fix a price for milk and that price will be fixed in other than production and joint areas and sale districts.  Where a large quantity of milk is bought and consumed the public health authorities will, of necessity, be in advance of districts where comparatively little milk is bought for consumption.  In other words, in urban and city areas supervision over milk will be in advance of supervision in rural areas, where very little milk is sold locally.  Comparatively little milk is produced in city areas, and none for limited consumption by families.  In the city areas we have machinery functioning to take the necessary precautions.  They are the minimum essential to provide a clean and wholesome supply of milk. This amendment wants to have such precautions taken that no production area will be included in a sale area with the right to sell unless there is equal supervision over the production of the milk.  That is a reasonable request.  The health authorities in the sale area have to work to a standard which is necessary to safeguard public health and they insist on milk being produced under certain conditions. The amendment asks that no <Col N="2586" /> milk should be allowed to come in there and be sold at the fixed price ruling in the district unless it is produced under certain conditions.  Such precautions are necessary.  If the amendment is unacceptable the result will be that a district that produces the worst milk will continue to do so and must get the price fixed.  The price will be fixed equally for bad milk and good milk.  Bad milk is, perhaps, not the proper term.  I am referring to milk produced under conditions where production is far cheaper than where it is produced under proper supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister very carefully to consider the equities of the case.  The Minister's job is concerned with price-fixing and I appreciate his difficulties. I am aware that he had to contend with a lot of difficulties which are not known to this House.  I know a great many of the difficulties which he had to contend with for the last year or year and a half.  As a medical man, he understands the importance of this question.  When milk is produced under conditions which provide for clinical examination of the cows and when there are stringent regulations with regard to construction and ventilation of the dairy sheds, the machinery which has to be provided to ensure supervision and the loss incidental to the clinical examination of the herds make the production of that milk dearer than the production of milk where there are no such requirements. In the opinion of the public health authorities, milk produced under these conditions is better milk than the milk produced under less stringent conditions. If this amendment is not accepted, it is inevitable that the Minister will mix the districts.  He has power to do that under the Bill and he will be forced by circumstances to do it if this amendment is not passed.  In fixing his price, if he associates a district with that price which has not the supervision I have mentioned&mdash;if he strikes a flat rate of 8d. or 9d. per gallon&mdash;it is obvious that if that price is only remunerative for milk produced under slipshod conditions, it will be unremunerative for milk produced under the hygienic conditions to which I have referred.  The result will be that milk will cease to <Col N="2587" /> be produced under hygienic conditions. On the other hand, if the price fixed be sufficient for the production of milk under the hygienic conditions I have mentioned, why should not the people who are being given that price and who are given access to the market produce good, clean, wholesome milk? If it pays one area to produce milk for a certain market at the price fixed, it should pay another area.</P>
    <P>There will be gross inequality in the administration of this Bill from the purely commercial point of view if this amendment is not accepted.  There will also&mdash;I realise that this is more a matter for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash; be serious danger to the health of the people in the cities, particularly the young.  I am mainly concerned now with the City of Dublin, which I represent. I can say that I represent every milk producer in the City and County of Dublin in urging this argument.  I can say that I represent all the societies interested in child welfare and nursing.  They do not want the standard of the milk provided under the present stringent conditions in the City and County of Dublin to be lowered. The Minister proposes to give for this milk no better price than he will give for milk produced from animals which may be diseased or which are not, at least, subject to clinical examination. That is dangerous to the public health. Speaking for an area that will be scheduled as the production area for the City of Dublin, under present conditions, I say that outside the production area of the City and County of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire these stringent conditions do not apply.  Nowhere contiguous to the city, or, indeed, in any of the county health districts of the Saorstát, is there a whole-time veterinary officer. That requirement has been looked upon as the low-water mark by expert opinion.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment, because it is necessary for the health of the city.  I am informed by lady social workers that no class in the city are so anxious to get high grade milk or so willing to pay for it as the poorer people.  Producers have, admittedly, been forced <Col N="2588" /> to produce an article in a manner which is more costly than other people are at liberty to use.  In these circumstances, it is unfair to fix a flat price for both classes of milk in the same market.  Speaking for the producers in the County Dublin, I can say that, if this be done, we will be very lax and, as far as possible, scrap the expensive machinery we have established for supervision.  That is, if we do not get recognition for the superior article which is being produced when the price of milk is being fixed in the sale area which will include the City of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify a point in regard to this amendment of Deputy Belton which appears to me to be quite reasonable.  Is it the intention of the amendment to require that the medical officer of health responsible for every proposed area will certify that adequate measures are being taken to ensure pure milk or is it Deputy Belton's intention to provide that the County Dublin, which he says has set the highest standard for the conditions under which milk may be produced for human consumption in the city, shall be the foot rule by which every other district shall be measured? Suppose the County Dublin had not only adequate safeguards in its regulations but had gone a little further than would satisfy minimum requirements and had progressed towards an ideal condition, if it were proposed to bring in another area, join it to County Dublin and fix the same price for the combined area, and that the second area had adequate provisions made but had not taken all the additional precautions that Dublin had taken, would Deputy Belton desire that those two areas should not be amalgamated under this Act to form one area for the purposes of supply?  If that is his purpose, does he want the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Local Government to conduct an inquiry into the kind of regulations obtaining in the two districts, that where he is not satisfied that the regulations are adequate, he should make them separate districts, and that he should be free to make them one district only where he is satisfied that the public <Col N="2589" /> health regulations governing the production of milk are identical in both districts?</P>
      <P>If that is what is in Deputy Belton's mind, I see a difficulty because it will be so difficult for any Minister to satisfy himself that the regulations in any two districts are adequate.  The prime object in Deputy Belton's amendment is to avoid a situation arising in which two men have to sell milk at the same price and one man is required to comply with very much less extensive regulations than the other. How can we avoid that difficulty unless Deputy Belton is prepared to go so far as to say that before amalgamating any districts into one sales or production area, the Minister shall satisfy himself that identical public health regulations apply over the whole area?  If that is the object that Deputy Belton has in mind, will it not be necessary to take out of the hands of the local authority the power to fix regulations governing milk production in the amalgamated area and transfer it to the Minister for Agriculture so that he can make regulations which would apply over the County Dublin, part of the County Meath and part of the County Wicklow in order to get these identical regulations which would give fair play to each producer and which would make it possible to demand that every producer in the appointed area would sell at the same price?  If a scheme along these lines could be devised whereby you could ensure that every producer in a scheduled area is required to conform to identical public health regulations then I think Deputy Belton's case is unanswerable but surely you would have to create some administrative machinery to carry that into effect of a more elaborate character than the certificate proposed in Deputy Belton's amendment?  Does Deputy Belton with his peculiar knowledge of local administration in and around the city, say that in his opinion the certificate procedure suggested in his amendment would be adequate to secure effective identity of public health regulations in the several areas which might be amalgamated as a sales district for the purpose of this Act?</P>

      <P>There is no regulation operating in either the City or the County of Dublin that had not to be approved by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health before it could operate.  It was made consequent on an order from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If Dublin City and County are ahead of other counties it is not that Dublin City and County went too far but that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health did not see that other counties went far enough. The certificate which I ask for here is not a certificate which will stand by itself as if there were no other machinery supposed to be in operation. The medical officer of health in a sales area would know all the other areas round about him.  If they were included in the sale area under this Bill, he would know of his own local knowledge whether the Dairies and Cowsheds Act, the Bovine Tuberculosis Act and the Diseases of Animals Act were being enforced in these counties and if there was proper machinery and sufficient regulations to enforce them.  He would know, broadly speaking, whether the machinery was similar to that in operation in his own area.  It is not a question of whether one officer is more diligent than another.  It is a question of whether the machinery was there. That is all that would be required and it would be a simple matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was discussed very fully on the Committee Stage, <Col N="2594" /> and I explained as well as I could what I thought of this particular amendment of Deputy Belton's.  This Bill, as a matter of fact, is dealing entirely with price.  It is not dealing with the quality or condition of the milk apart from the price.  Seeing that we have put a very elaborate Bill through the Dáil under the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, a Bill dealing with cleanliness, freedom from dirt, grading, and so on, it is not necessary to come along here and deal with the same matters in this Bill.  This Bill, in Section 31 (4), prescribes that no producer can register under this Bill and, therefore, cannot supply milk to an area unless he is already registered under the Dairy and Cowsheds Order and under the Act of 1935 when it comes into operation.  I think that is as far as we can go in meeting Deputy Belton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister what is to happen in districts where the Dairy and Cowsheds Order is not carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking, I think in that case a complaint should be made to the public health authority so as to try to carry it out.  I do not know what the authority of the local body amounts to, or whether you must appeal to the Minister in order to comply with the Act, but it is either to the local authority or to the Minister the appeal must be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing it was brought to the notice of the Minister that in a certain district the Dairy and Cowsheds Order and the Tuberculosis Order, etc., were not carried out, would the Minister be satisfied to take the power, or would it be incumbent in such circumstances not to include that district in a production area? Would he be prepared to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>How am I to sit in judgment in those cases?  The local authority is the registering authority under the Dairy and Cowsheds Order, and it will be so until the 1935 Act comes into operation.  Suppose, without casting any slur on the County Wicklow, that somebody reports to me <Col N="2595" /> that these orders are not carried out in Wicklow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I ask the local authority &ldquo;Are you carrying out the Act?&rdquo; surely I must take their word for it, but the Minister for Local Government and Public Health need not.  He has means of ascertaining for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I see that the local authority is allowed to carry on, then I must be satisfied.  If the City of Dublin is not satisfied, they could complain to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  There would be hopeless confusion if the Minister for Agriculture were to go into these questions of public health which are administered by another Department. The thing would be impracticable.  The Dublin sale area would probably be the City of Dublin, the County of Dublin, Howth Urban District, Bray Urban District and the borough of Dun Laoghaire.  You would have five local authorities there.  It is quite possible that the sanitary authority in Bray would agree that the Wicklow milk was good and, perhaps, the Howth sanitary authority would say that it was not good.  I do not see how we could get over that difficulty.  There are various practical difficulties involved in the amendment.  However, I do not want to make a point of that, because I would object to the amendment in any case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, having two Departments responsible for the same thing will always lead to trouble.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health might say that he was quite satisfied with the administration of the 1935 Act in a certain county, and I might say I was not satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot quite promise that it will.  Another point raised by the Deputy is that I am not in a position to give a reward for good milk, that is to fix a better price for the good milk than for milk that is not quite so good.  Of course I can fix a different price for Grade A, Grade B, and so on.  I can fix a different price for the various grades.  In that way we may be giving more encouragement to the higher grades than could be given in any other way under the Bill.  I do not see that we are in any way injuring a county which is carrying out its duties properly.  After all, if there had been no dispute, and the price all over was 5d. per gallon and if, as a result of the Bill, we raise it to 9d., they are still in the same position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise in this particular way.

      <P>I understood the Minister to say that his position is this: Take the two types of farmers referred to by Deputy Belton.  As they stand at present, they are in a certain position.  The Minister's contention is that under the Bill they will be relatively in the same position.  I can understand Deputy Belton's argument up to a certain point, but I do not see how the Bill changes the relative position of the two classes.  For instance, at the present moment you have milk which is not altogether clean getting, say, 5d. per gallon. Better milk will get 6d. per gallon. The Bill fixes a maximum price, say, of 8d. or 9d.  The better milk then, according to the Minister, would still be 1d. more per gallon.  The Minister's contention is that the Bill actually makes no difference so far as these two classes are concerned.  Deputy Belton would like the Bill to benefit the people who are producing milk under very stringent conditions.  But the Minister's contention is that the Bill does not affect them, that it leaves them in the same relative position as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Belton realises the force of Deputy Dillon's argument.  Certainly he did not reply to it.  Suppose you have milk produced <Col N="2598" /> under very stringent conditions; milk produced under less stringent conditions&mdash;the ordinary conditions which Deputy Belton says are not perfect&mdash;and milk produced without, in practice, the operation of the Acts. Why do you discriminate between what I may call the second class and the third class and not between the first class and the second class? Deputy Belton has not met that point. The Minister's contention is that the Bill leaves the thing where it is.  It is for the health authorities to step in and try to regulate this and possibly they may be able to do that under the other Act.</P>

      <P>The following provisions shall have effect in respect of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, (No. 34 of 1923), and in relation to certificates given or purporting to be given by the Minister thereunder, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the said sub-section shall be and is hereby amended as from the passing of the said Act by the deletion of the words &ldquo;within six months after the passing of this Act&rdquo; where those words secondly occur in the said sub-section.</P>

    <P>(c) no certificate given or purporting to be given by the Minister under the said sub-section shall be or ever have been invalid merely because the person to whom such certificate relates is thereby stated to have been reinstated in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann on a date prior to the passing of the said Act.</P>
    <P>(d) where it is stated in a certificate given or purporting to be given by the Minister under the said sub-section, that the person to whom such certificate relates was reinstated in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann on a date which was prior to the establishment of Saorstát Eireann, such statement shall be construed and have effect, and be deemed always to have had effect as relating to the reinstatement of such person in the Civil Service of the Provisional Government.</P>
    <P>(e) every person in respect of whom a certificate was given or purported to be given by the Minister under the said sub-section shall be deemed to have been reinstated in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann, or (where the circumstances so require) in the Civil Service of the Provisional Government, on the date on which he is stated in such certificate to have been reinstated in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(f) the period referred to in the said sub-section as the period of service which a person is otherwise qualified to reckon under the Superannuation Acts shall include and be deemed always to have included the period of such person's service within the meaning of the said Acts in any British Civil Service and also the period of his service within the meaning aforesaid in the Civil Service of Saorstát Eireann and (where the circumstances so require) the period of his service within the <Col N="2603" /> meaning aforesaid in the Civil Service of the Provisional Government and those several periods and the period between the date of such person's resignation or dismissal mentioned in the said sub-section and the date of his reinstatement similarly mentioned shall be reckoned as one continuous period of service.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the Committee Stage, Deputy McMenamin had amendments to Sections 7 and 27 in regard to which I took the opportunity of indicating that if, on examination, Section 7 as it then stood revealed an ambiguity in the section I proposed to remove it by introducing an amendment on the Report Stage.  This amendment gives effect to that intention.  In addition, it also further clarifies the position to meet the point which I think Deputy Norton desired to meet in regard to amendment No. 4 and makes it quite clear that both the service prior to resignation or dismissal and the period of absence and service subsequent to reinstatement would be counted in computing superannuation allowances in the case of officers affected by this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question I would like to make an appeal to the Minister for Finance in regard to his attitude towards certain established and unestablished officers in the matter of their retiring allowances.  Under certain conditions, a limited number of unestablished clerical officers are in the position of being retired on pensions&mdash;certainly this is the case as regards two who have each had about 36 years' service&mdash;averaging about 18/- per week.  I understand that the Minister has power under certain Acts to use his discretion in favour of granting pensions to such officers on the basis of their full service.  If the Minister were to exercise his powers in that regard, I think it would be only fair to the very limited number of officers concerned.  I understand that there are about ten clerical officers in the Department of Agriculture&mdash;I imagine there are officers serving in other Departments in the same position&mdash; whose total service is divided between established and unestablished service. Section 12 of the Agriculture Act of 1931 gives the Minister for Finance <Col N="2605" /> power to retire such people on a pension fixed on the basis of their full service, established and unestablished. The Minister has exercised his discretion in favour of giving pensions on the basis of full service to officers of the technical class in the same Department, and it seems rather strange that he has not acted in the same way in the case of the clerical officers.  I am appealing to him to look into their cases.  The number is very limited. Some of them have had very long service, and are likely to be retired, if not this year certainly next year.  I think that he should fix their pensions on the basis of their full service whether it is established or unestablished, and that he should exercise in their favour the discretion vested in him under the Act to which I have referred.  There is no reason why officers of the technical class should be retired on pensions based on their full service and a different procedure applied in the case of clerical officers. I would appeal to the Minister personally to look into that aspect of the few cases that may be concerned, and about which I believe strong representations have been made to his Department. I am not sure whether the cases which I am mentioning now have come under the Minister's personal notice, but I would be glad if he would look them up.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back on the point at any great length, but the Minister rather challenged me when this Bill was under discussion before to quote any living or dead politician who gave certain assurances in regard to the pension rights of people who made sacrifices in pre-Treaty days.  I would like the Minister in his spare time&mdash;he may not have very much spare time until the by-elections are over&mdash;to look up his own speeches in this House on 7th March, 1929, and he will see what he, a very much alive politician, pleaded for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>He was dealing with the position of the men in the Ordnance Survey Department, and on their behalf he made a very strong appeal. If the Minister will look up the debate <Col N="2606" /> on the Superannuation and Pensions Bill, columns 1134-5, he will see how eloquently he pleaded for better pension rights for the people who made sacrifices in the Ordnance Survey Department. If the Minister does not care to read what he said on that occasion, perhaps he would like to look up what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said on the same subject in 1928.  I cannot quote any greater living authority than the Minister, and I am sure he will be surprised to find that he himself had been pleading on behalf of people for whom we have been pleading on this occasion.  No doubt Deputy Belton knows more about the circumstances than I do, but I know the Minister made a very eloquent appeal.  I daresay it is too late now to get anything inserted in the Bill along the lines suggested by Deputy Belton, but it is no harm, even in spite of the fact that we are going through a strenuous by-election period, to remind the Minister of what he said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill passes I should like to deal with a few aspects of this matter.  This is probably the last attempt that will be made to do justice to a small deserving class; it is the last attempt probably not only of this Government, but of the last Government to do justice to those who made great sacrifices when there were very few to make sacrifices.  There were a few who were prepared to fight and die for Ireland in times gone by. Of course it has become a profession now to fight and die for Ireland.  I had a few amendments down, but they were ruled out of order.  It is extraordinary that those who will benefit under this Bill must first become beggars at the Government's table.  Nowhere is there a right given in this Bill to those people who took the risk and lost everything except their lives; it is all couched in those terms: &ldquo;If the Minister for Finance gives a certificate that certain things happened.&rdquo;  He is not obliged to give that certificate if certain things happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How different is the language of this Bill from the language of the British Government in making sure that the civil servants who were transferred in 1922 would have their rights protected <Col N="2607" /> and would not beg at anybody's table! The Minister is aware that the courts have unheld these rights.  So much for those who did not take any part in the fight for freedom.  But those who did were not protected under the Treaty by the signatories to that Treaty; they were not protected by the Government that grew out of the Treaty, nor were they protected by the successors of that Government.  I explained here on the Committee Stage that subsequent to the Treaty a deputation of those civil servants who were victimised or dismissed by the British for their political activities waited on General Collins, and he gave assurances.  They came to agreement.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton is not asking the Minister to take anything that is unreasonable.  The Minister knows as well as I do that for any of the events that happened in the last 20 years there is very little parchment evidence, but it is worth inquiring into in a sympathetic way.  Broadly, the case put up to General Collins&mdash;and I put it up to the Minister now&mdash;was: were those who sacrificed positions in the Civil Service because they took the side of Ireland in its fight for freedom not entitled to as good treatment from the Irish Government as those who minded their jobs got from the British Government?</P>
      <P>I put that as a definite straight question to the Minister.  There was nothing more ever asked by the victimised civil servants.  It should not have to be asked for at all at any time.  It should have been given as a right.  I am not aware whether there is any paper evidence, but ordinarily people who took that course on that occasion were entitled to that promotion.  Nobody would deny it to them at that time.  I think the Minister is aware how invaluable civil servants were in the fight for freedom, apart from any physical effort they made.  I think he is aware that but for them a lot of things which were successful could not have been successful, and Intelligence could not have been so good. Of course it was because we were then speaking to the Intelligence Officer of the old I.R.A. that he knew the value of the men we represented. He had his mind made up on what should be done for them, and he granted 100 per cent. of the requests made.</P>

      <P>I gave the Minister the three representatives of the victimised civil servants on that occasion&mdash;Mr. Dowling, Mr. P.S. O'Hegarty and myself.  We were instructed by a general meeting of all the victimised civil servants to put forward the following terms: That the victimised civil servants would have the right of reinstatement in the positions which they would have achieved at that time had they not been disturbed; that they would get all the reasonable promotion which they would have got, and the ordinary increments which they would have earned; alternatively, that they would get the right to retire as the transferred officers did, but that the victimised civil servants would get compulsory retiring terms, which meant that there would be added to their service three or four years more than under the normal terms; that they would get back pay for all the period during which they had been out.  General Collins agreed, but stipulated this&mdash;that any money which any member of the body we represented had got from public funds should be deducted from the total of the back pay.  We agreed to that. Those were the terms.</P>

General Collins then told us to supply him with a tabulated statement, giving each officer's rank, salary, time of dismissal, and the department in which he worked.  We said we would give him that.  He then said that he would make enquiries through the various departments; that he would <Col N="2610" /> require figures to be furnished officially from the departments; that he would only use our figures to check up on what he would get from the departments, and that when agreement was reached he would work on the departments' figures.

      <P>The terms that General Collins agreed to are the terms I have given the Minister.  I put it to the Minister that they are fair and equitable terms; that they are the minimum which should ever be offered to those men, even if General Collins never gave them.  But he did.  In dealing with civil servants who were asked to come and help in the fight for freedom, and who did come and help and paid the price, why should the Irish Government not give as good compensation to those civil servants who took the side of Ireland as to those who simply sat down and minded their jobs, and who the British Government made sure would be looked after in the <Col N="2612" /> transfer?  They only ask for equal treatment. They only ask for the same treatment which they would have got had they never done anything for this country but sat down, drawn their salaries and led an easy life.  When 1922 came, automatically everything that we asked from General Collins and that I am asking of the Minister and his Government now would have been guaranteed to us as a right.  In this Bill it is not guaranteed as a right; it is guaranteed as a concession.</P>
      <P>I remember being told by a senior civil servant that victimised civil servants were reinstated as an act of grace.  A man was very fortunate to have got away with his life, and at that time life was cheap.  He was very fortunate to have got away with his life, and surely it was an insult to offer to men, who were nearly starving at the time, that they would be let back temporarily as an act of grace, while over their heads were promoted the men who, to say the least of it, never turned out&mdash;not on the side of Ireland anyhow, and we have grave suspicion that they turned out on the other side secretly, for many of them were under observation.  Yet these men were promoted.  Surely it is only the elements of fair play to ask that those men be given as good treatment all round as the British gave in the Treaty to the transferred civil servants.  I do not know how it can be done now&mdash;I suppose it is too late&mdash;but I regret it very much.  The Minister can appreciate the difference between giving a right to people who have earned that right, and who forfeited that right by taking the side of this country on certain occasions and paid the price then, and the right of those who did not take the side of Ireland and remained in their jobs. They would have that right, and surely our own Government should give it as a right and not as a concession or an act of grace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that all through this Bill whatever is given is not given as a right but as an act of grace or a concession, if the Minister gives a certificate.  I have not the least doubt but that the present Minister for Finance will be perfectly <Col N="2613" /> fair and concede it as a matter of right just as much as if it were in the Bill.  I am sure the Minister does not think for a moment that I have any personal doubts as regards that. I am quite sure he will be impartial and fair and that if he errs at all he will err on the side of the applicants. I am quite satisfied about that, but still I hold that the wording should be different, and that, in case it is not all dealt with during the Minister's term of office, it should be there as an obligation, on his successors as well as on himself, that the rights of these victimised civil servants are those they are entitled to and should be embodied in this Bill.  I know many of them who saw hard times for six and seven years.  They had young families, and I know that the debts incurred by some of them in those years have not yet been cleared off.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has any power in this Bill, but I think that he ought to consider giving some recompense to those civil servants for the terrible losses they sustained during those years.  I know that on many occasions the hat had to go round. There was some help from public funds, but it was among friends that they got the most help, and help when it was most needed.  I think the Minister has not done justice to this case in the Bill, and I certainly register my protest against his not, first of all, giving to those people the rights they sacrificed and that were theirs by contract.  They were in Civil Service positions because they had got in by open competitive examination and had nobody to thank for that except their own ability and education and those who gave them the education. They sacrificed that at a very critical period of their lives, and I say that it is a poor and ungrateful country and a poor Government or poor Governments that did not treat those people, who came out and stood for their own country and fought for Ireland, as well as the British Government treated those civil servants who remained loyal to the British during the years when the others were fighting for freedom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In this Bill, Sir, there is a differentiation which, I think, the <Col N="2614" /> Minister ought to throw some light upon.  In Section 4 of the Bill it is provided that certain persons appointed to the service of Dáil Eireann before the 11th July, 1921, shall be deemed to have been appointed to established positions, while those who were appointed to the Civil Service of Dáil Eireann on or after the 11th July, 1921, shall be deemed to have been appointed to an unestablished position. I should like to know from the Minister on what grounds he seeks to justify this excessive tidiness in the matter of classifying people in this respect.  After all, there is not much difference between the 11th July, 1921, and, let us say, the 11th August, 1921.  The 11th July has a certain relation to national activities in this country, but not such a relation as would justify one person being graded as an established officer if he were employed prior to that date, and a person employed a day afterwards, but whose appointment might have been the subject of negotiation prior to the 11th July, 1921, being graded as an unestablished officer.</P>
      <P>There seems to me to be an apparent inconsistency between Section 4 and Section 6.  Apparently, service in the Provisional Government is to be service of a kind which may be reckonable under the Superannuation Acts as established service, while service in the Civil Service of Dáil Eireann, a body which was established prior to the Provisional Government may be deemed to be unestablished service and, conceivably, might not be reckoned for superannuation purposes.  I should like to know on what ground is it possible to have service in the Provisional Government deemed to be service for superannuation purposes, while service of Dáil Eireann, after 1921, is deemed to be unestablished service and consequently is not always reckonable for superannuation purposes.  That is a blemish, Sir, in this Bill that we are now asked to pass.  If possible, the Minister ought to throw some light on the apparent inconsistencies in the two sections and justify the discrimination which is made in the Bill generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to support the plea which has been made by Deputy Belton on behalf of those civil servants who have <Col N="2615" /> suffered a good deal because of their national convictions during the period, let us say, 1918 to 1932 and 1933.  This Bill is an endeavour to tidy up certain defects in the matter of their superannuation. This Bill is an endeavour to adjust the superannuation position of those persons who, because of their political convictions, were, on one ground or other, either forced to leave the Civil Service which existed in this country, or felt it necessary to resign from the Civil Service which existed in this country.  It may be that the State is going some distance to undo some of the hardships those persons have suffered by reason of the fact that committees were established which dealt with the cases of such persons, and, in a large number of cases, recommended reinstatement in the Civil Service, and that this Bill adjusts the superannuation position of the persons concerned; but I submit that that does not go anything like as far as the legislature ought to go in undoing some of the hardships imposed on those persons.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I happened to meet a person who was dismissed by the British Administration in 1918.  In 1922, if there had been no civil war, he would, in all probability, have been reinstated in the Civil Service here, but the civil war was one of those events which engulfed him, and, taking sides in the civil war, he found himself unable to secure reinstatement because of his activities during that period, and he was only reinstated in 1933.  If that person had not a national consciousness, he would have remained in the Civil Service from 1918 to 1933, and would probably have been promoted to various higher ranks but in fact, because of his association with the events of 1918 to 1921, and the events of 1922 and 1923, he was unable to earn anything like the emoluments he would have earned had he remained in the Civil Service.  It is well known that that person suffered a good deal of privation during those long years, because I know, from my own experience, that during many of those years he was unemployed, and during a fair portion of the time he suffered imprisonment, <Col N="2616" /> and those who happen to know him intimately were aware that there were many times during that long period of travail when that person was hungry and, indeed, on many occasions destitute.</P>
    <P>He was reinstated in 1933, but it needs little imagination to appreciate the enormous burden of debt which that man accumulated during the period when he was regarded as an outcast by the Administration which continued here.  To reinstate that person and to adjust his superannuation position goes some distance towards removing the hardships he has endured; but I suggest to the Minister that he is not going sufficiently far, and that in the case of some of these persons they will never be able to pay off, during their official lifetime, the substantial debts accumulated during the period of their enforced idleness.  While there is nothing in this Bill which makes it mandatory on the Minister to pay wages lost to those persons, I suggest that he does not in fact need any legislation to enable him to give these people some cash compensation for the long period of enforced idleness, the long period of suffering which they have endured, and that he should bear in mind, when considering this matter, that many of these people are to-day endeavouring to carry on their official duties under a burden of debts accumulated during that period of enforced idleness which it will be utterly impossible for them to pay.  It is not asking the Minister to do too much.  The cost of meeting the claim will not be considerable, and, after all, the Minister ought to realise that these people are the poorer because they gave their services to the country.  If they had been thinking of themselves, they would not have fallen into the appalling condition of debt in which many of them are to-day.  That ought to be some reason for the Minister reviewing their cases with a view to endeavouring to make some further effort to remove or to mitigate the hardships which many of them have endured.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked if I could supply him with the statement of claim and with what General Collins <Col N="2617" /> said.  It is a good while since I read the document, and there are some personal features in it, but that information is here without any personal reference.  I should like to give it to the Minister if I may.  The demands formulated were (1) reinstatement without loss of salary or promotions in the Civil Service, (2) where reinstatement was not desired, superannuation on the compulsory retiring terms of the Treaty, and (3) full pay and emoluments from the date of dismissal until claims are satisfied. General Collins gave an undertaking to the deputation that he would see that these demands would not only be granted, but that they were the very minimum that we might expect.  In inverted commas is the following: &ldquo;I will see that civil servants that were faithful to Ireland will not suffer, and will be accorded at least as good terms as those who served the enemy.&rdquo;</P>

These persons have no remedy. It is easy to identify those who resigned or were dismissed from the R.I.C. or the Civil Service.  I am not arguing against any of these people getting some compensation, but it has to be remembered when extravagant demands are made, that there were plenty of others who took too strong a view about the relations between this country and Great Britain, ever to go into a British service at all.  I am throwing out these observations, without wishing to oppose this Bill, but because some of the demands that are made are really extravagant and unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin asked me to look into the case of a certain clerical officer in the Department of Agriculture to see whether he could not be granted the terms of the 1931 Act. <Col N="2619" /> I would prefer if he had asked me to examine it earlier.  I will look into it, but I must say this, that if to do what the Deputy asks would run contrary to the established rule in the Civil Service, I am afraid, so far as the cases of such people are concerned, the investigation will be fruitless.  However, I will look into it, but I am perfectly certain that everything in favour of the individual was taken into consideration, because our Superannuation Acts are not unjust or unfair to civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember the rule upon which we work now is that no person in the Civil Service, as far as we can secure it enters through patronage.  Large numbers of people who are to-day unestablished were patronage appointments. They were employed in a temporary capacity, being required for a limited period, but were allowed to carry on, and ultimately a limited examination was held subsequent to 1922 by which they might become established and be granted pensionable rights.</P>
      <P>When we look at the facts we must say that the rights of establishment they got was uncovenanted benefit; something not provided for at all in the original service.  I think they have no complaint.  We cannot deal with them on a pathetic basis. We have to look at the service as a whole, and cannot in cases of hardship undertake to treat them with undue consideration.</P>

      <P>In the Civil Service the principle of like case like rule must always apply.  Otherwise it would become a matter entirely of personal administration on the part of a Minister or of some senior official and in that way there would be bound to be favouritism and abuse.  As Deputy <Col N="2620" /> Belton stated when I am dealing with these cases I do as my predecessor did, and as my successor will do.  I try to interpret the rule, if I can, for the benefit of the individual affected, but I cannot break it, no matter what hardship there may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There were sound reasons for that.  If the Deputy had given me notice that he intended to raise the matter I have no doubt I would be able to give a very convincing answer.  Deputy Norton asked me what was the purpose of the distinction made in Section 9 (4) of the Bill.  I think the Deputy might have raised on the Second Stage, rather than on the Final Stage, what was the reason for the distinction in sub-section (4) between persons appointed to the Civil Service of Dáil Eireann before 14th July, 1921, and persons appointed subsequently. The original purpose of the Bill when it was conceived was to ensure that people who were reinstated in the Civil Service after the change of Government in 1932, would be placed on exactly the same plane as those who were reinstated by the Provisional Government, subsequent to the Treaty in 1922 and 1923, were by the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, which regularised and gave some sort of statutory security to persons then reinstated.  As a practical rule to deal with all sorts of individual claims that would be pressed, it was ultimately laid down in the 1923 Act that those who had been appointed prior to the 11th July, 1921, that is, entered the Civil Service of Dail Eireann during the period of actual warlike operations, when the risk was greater, would be given establishment and that those appointed in peace time during the term of the Truce would be regarded as unestablished. Every one of the people regarded as unestablished were given an opportunity of sitting for a limited examination in 1925 or 1926, and any of them who passed that limited examination and showed that they were <Col N="2621" /> fit to enter the permanent Civil Service were granted establishment as from February, 1926.  The difference between the two classes is very slight. Those who entered the Civil Service of Dáil Eireann during the period of strife and warlike operations got that period of service counted for pension purposes, and those who came in when matters were easier did not get that period of service counted for pensions.  The interval is not more than three or four years.  That is the distinction and it is carried forward in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no inconsistency between Sections 4 and 6.  Section 4 is to give a statutory authority to regard service in the Provisional Government as counting for superannuation, provided that the person who rendered service was either appointed to an established post in the Civil Service of Dáil Eireann or had been appointed to a post which was regarded as being an established position prior to 11th July, 1921.  In practice that service in the Provisional Government was always regarded as counting for superannuation. Nevertheless, as it is questionable if there was statutory authority for the practice, and this section is merely to give the necessary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with a great deal of attention to what Deputy Belton said to-day in regard to the interview with General Collins, because I was anxious to get the real facts in that matter right.  I could not conceive this position arising, that General Collins, who was head of the Provisional Government, gave a positive assurance to this deputation that the terms they asked for should be granted, that is, that civil servants who were dismissed would be granted reinstatement and be given full pay from the date of victimisation to the date of reinstatement, and have the right to retire if they wished on the same terms as those civil servants who continued in the service; that is, that they should have the same rights as transferred officers.  It was inconceivable to me that General Collins should have accepted without qualification those terms, and should have pledged himself <Col N="2622" /> to give effect to them, and that those who were his colleagues and successors in the Government of this State should not have sought to fulfil that pledge.  I had some investigations made, and this is what I believe to be a true account of what took place at these meetings with Deputy Belton and two others.  General Collins said he thought the claim was fair, but he added: &ldquo;However, it must be understood that that is only a personal expression of opinion.  I have not examined the question at all, and I am not committing the Provisional Government, or even the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>

Why does he think we should accept that obligation and have the disagreeable responsibility of burdening the people with the cost of meeting these claims which were <Col N="2624" /> rejected by our predecessors over 12 years ago?  What is the burden of all the speeches the Deputy has been making on this Bill?  He goes up and down the country and talks about the cost of the Civil Service going up.  He tells the people that taxation has gone up under the Fianna Fáil administration. He talks about the price of tea and sugar and then he comes in here and asks us to heap burden after burden on the people's back to meet the claims of himself and those associated with him in connection with this unjust demand&mdash;because it is an unjust demand.</P>

From all the people who suffered from 1916 to 1923 in the cause of this country&mdash;there were, as Deputy MacDermot pointed out, many men whose careers were broken, many whose businesses were ruined, many men whose families suffered penury and want because of the sacrifices they made&mdash;we are to pick out this one, special, privileged class of former British civil servants and not merely reinstate them, as we are doing; not merely give them the benefit of pensionable service when it comes to calculating their superannuation at the period of their retirement, but give them full pay from the date of victimisation to the date of reinstatement. Was ever a more unreasonable demand put forward on behalf of any class or section of the community than that put forward by Deputy Belton?  Can we go down the country and compensate every farmer for the losses he suffered from 1916 to 1921?</P>

      <P>I was saying that I think that the people who are dealt with in this Bill, and the small isolated sections for whom Deputy Belton speaks, have been dealt with very fairly.  They are being given reinstatement. Deputy Norton said that a person who was not reinstated until 1933 did not secure the compensation or the promotion to which he thought he was entitled.  I can say that, in the case of no person who has been reinstated, has consideration not been given to that fact in fixing the point in the scale and the grade in which he should re-enter the service.  I do not think that it is fair for Deputy Norton, on the basis of one isolated incident that has been brought before his notice of a person who says that if he had been in the service he would have got such-and-such, to charge us with unfairly treating those people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have gone through all those cases very carefully with a desire to do the best I could, in justice, for those people.  I do not think that any person who has been reinstated has been treated unfairly either in regard to the grade or the point in the scale of pay attaching to that grade at which he has been reinstated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely.  Why should he be entitled to a cash compensation as against the farmer, the farm labourer, the student, the shopkeeper&mdash;every single individual who constituted the majority which stood behind the Republic of Ireland from 1918 to 1921?  Why is this particular individual whom Deputy Norton has in <Col N="2628" /> mind&mdash;who met Deputy Norton somewhere on the street and said that if he had been in the British Civil Service from 1918 to 1921 and then had continued to serve until 1933, he would have earned such and such an amount of money&mdash;why is he entitled to be fully compensated for loss of salary during that time when all the rest of the people, the people who would pay him that compensation and who might possibly have made even greater sacrifices, are to go without anything?  That is the claim that has been made by Deputy Norton.  That is the claim made by Deputy Belton.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is.  The difficulty about Deputy Belton is that he himself does not understand the effect of his demands.  Let me remind Deputy Belton of what he did ask General Collins&mdash;&ldquo;for reinstatement and for full pay from the date of victimisation to the date of reinstatement&rdquo;. That is to say, that every penny that these ex-British civil servants lost is to be made good to them, that it is to be made good to them at the expense of other people who may have suffered very much more serious losses and for whom our State and our people are unable out of their resources to make adequate compensation.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is looking for scarcely enough in this Estimate.  He became, in his closing remarks on the Bill which has just gone through, very solicitous about the poor farmers and the poor agricultural labourers; in fact, for all suffering humanity around the country.  He knows that these unfortunate people for five years had to pay 6d. in the £ for the damage done in 1922.  He knows that if it were not for that blackguardism the demands for superannuation <Col N="2631" /> put up to General Collins in 1922, which have now become exorbitant, would be trivial.  They would mean little or nothing to the State.  But instead of that, some £20,000,000 or £30,000,000 went up in smoke that year.  The Government of the day was declared an outlaw.  But the Government of that day was no way different from the Government of this day.</P>

      <P>It is inadequate compensation for former civil servants, especially as the present Government adopted the principle in the Local Government Act of 1933, Section 7, whereby, ten years after the event, local authorities were compelled to reinstate such servants of theirs as they had not already reinstated.  They were compelled to reinstate those officials who went out to fight for the sectional republic in 1922-23, headed as they were by Eamon de Valera as he then was.  These men lost their positions but ten years later the present Government introduced a Bill and passed an Act in this House which compelled those local authorities to reinstate officials.  Whether reinstated or not the local authorities were compelled to pay them for the year during which they were absent from their work on the local bodies and during which they were engaged in blowing up bridges, burning houses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister a moment ago said that my suggestion if carried out would rob the public of the country and that it would create an intolerable burden; that there were other people who were entitled to compensation for the time and sacrifice they made in the fight <Col N="2632" /> for freedom.  The Minister and his Government made the special case for them that they were fighting for freedom. They said they were out fighting for freedom when as a matter of fact they were out to destroy the freedom that we had won.  These men should not be compensated at all. They were not fighting any foreign army or any foreign authority.  They were fighting a native Government, the Government of this country which was then as much a Government of this country as is the Government we have to-day, the Government of this country. They went out in rebellion against the Irish Government, a Government that expressed the majority will of the people.  The people of this country were taxed under the Act to which I have referred.  They were taxed in order to make payments to Irregulars who in 1922 and 1923 were engaged in blowing up bridges.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke against the principle of compensating former civil servants for the time they were out of employment.  He said it was an intolerable principle to put up, a principle that no responsible Government could adopt.  But the Minister himself adopted that principle in a much worse form in the Local Government Act of 1933.  Though no advance has been made to-day towards getting justice, I welcome this discussion because it has unmasked hypocrisy. That hypocrisy has lasted much too long.  I am glad the matter is being discussed here to-day.  I am glad that many of those civil servants to whom I am referring have made good since those days.  I remember on one occasion that a couple of us were asked humiliating questions.  We were asked to adopt a humiliating attitude.  I referred before to what I said to the gentleman who addressed us.  To-day we are not paupers knocking at any workhouse door.  If we were I think Workhouse Master MacEntee would not let us in.</P>

There were other applicants whom the preceding Committee had decided had resigned on national grounds, but who, because they were associated with a certain side at the time of the Treaty, did not get pensions.  In the case of the latter naturally their claims were made good when we took office, because I could not accept as good the reason why my predecessor had refused to grant pensions in those cases.  In no case was the pension granted where it was not made clear that the resignation arose because of the national principles and sympathies of the applicant.  I do not know that I need say anything more on the Supplementary Estimate. The Dáil has discussed the principles involved in the measure at great length, and we have had a fairly prolonged discussion on it to-day.

      <P>(1)  A prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act, other than Section 9, may be brought at the suit of the Minister;</P>
      <P>(2)  A prosecution for an offence under any section of this Act may be brought at any time within whichever of the following periods latest expires, that is to say:&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is designed to give effect to the Night Work (Bakeries) Convention of 1925.  Under the Bill when it becomes an Act certain actions may be offences.  It seems to me that there is no provision in the Bill to enable the Minister to initiate a prosecution for offences under the Bill.  The object of the amendment is to enable the Minister to bring a prosecution in the case of offences under the Bill, except in the case of Section 9, where provision for dealing with that matter is contained <Col N="2637" /> in the section.  I think the Minister ought to have the powers set out in the amendment.  It seems to me that he has no such comprehensive powers in the Bill as submitted.  The Bill will probably be improved by giving the Minister these powers within the Bill, which would then be self-contained from the standpoint not merely of making the regulations, but of enabling the Minister to take action if these regulations were transgressed in any particular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister envisaged the situation likely to arise in rural Ireland where he fixes one period as night for one district, and another period as night for another district? Let us assume that, in the first district, he fixes the period of night from <Col N="2640" /> 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. on the following morning, and that in an adjoining district he fixes the period of night from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.  That means that the bakers in the second area will bring out their first batch of bread one hour before the bakers in the first area. Under modern conditions bread is carried considerable distances from town to town, and any one familiar with the bakery trade knows that the advantage accruing to a baker who arrives first at the door of a potential purchaser in the morning is very great indeed. Has the Minister considered the situation that will arise if by statute the bakers in one area are precluded from offering their bread in their own area before their rivals from another area can come in and offer bread which has been baked during a different night period to that fixed for the first area? Would the Minister not consider fixing the one night period for all parts of rural Ireland in order to avoid competition of the kind that I have described arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most likely that there will not be wide variations in the periods fixed for different areas in the event of different periods being fixed for different areas.  The amendment which enables the Minister to fix different periods for different areas is being put into the Bill in response to a request made by Deputy Mulcahy, that the requirements of different areas should be adverted to.  The Minister, before making Orders of this kind, will, of course, have to enter into consultation with the representatives of the trade, both employers and employees, and I think it is most unlikely that periods will be fixed which would in the nature of things interfere with the efficient carrying on of the industry, assuming that the principle of the abolition of night work is agreed upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does see the point that if he were to fix for the Boyle area 11 p.m. to 7 a.m., and for the Castlerea area 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., the Castlerea bakers will have all the trade of the Boyle area before the bakers there will have power to send out a single loaf from their bakeries.</P>

      <P>The problem to which Deputy Dillon has referred does not arise merely as between two districts in rural areas.  The problem is one that may arise between an area in a rural district and the City of Dublin. Quite a fair amount of bread, which is produced in the country, is supplied to the City of Dublin and with considerable advantage to the poor of Dublin.  The fact is that very often they are able to get their bread cheaper from the country than they can get it in Dublin.  It could easily happen if the Department overlooked a circumstance such as that that the country bakers supplying Dublin would be penalised.  I think that the Minister, in acting upon this provision, should give careful attention to it to see that the healthy competition that exists between certain rural towns in Ireland and the cities should be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 seems to be very drastic.  Let us envisage the situation that may arise.  Take a lock-up bakery in connection with which the bakers go ordinarily at five o'clock or six o'clock in the afternoon. At three o'clock in the morning a member of the Gárda Síochána arrives at the door of the bakery and demands admittance, but there is nobody there. The proprietor or the manager of the bakehouse may live some distance away.  He must get up and open the bakehouse and admit the Gárda.  Then he goes home again.  Is any such drastic provision necessary?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see any other way of dealing with the matter.  The object of the Bill is to prevent night work in bakeries.  We ask the Gárda Síochana to administer the Act, and I fail to see how we can operate it unless we give them these powers.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to waive my objection to what seem to be extremely wide powers provided the member of the Gárda Síochána is in a position to prove that he had reason to suspect baking was in progress.  I suggest that the inspector of the Gárda Síochána ought to be obliged to prove that he had some reasonable ground for believing that baking was going on before he gave a warrant to the Gárda to enter the premises at two o'clock in the morning.  At present no police officer is entitled to enter a premises on an ordinary search warrant unless it can be proved that he had reasonable <Col N="2644" /> grounds for suspecting that some breach of the law was being committed, and a Gárda must satisfy the officer responsible for issuing the warrant that he had reasonable grounds for suspicion.  I submit that a similar obligation should be imposed on the officer of the Gárda Síochána who gives what is the equivalent of a search warrant under Section 9 (1) of this Bill.</P>

The member of the Gárda who is out to detect a misdemeanour must satisfy the person charged with the responsibility for issuing a search warrant that he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that such a misdemeanour is being or has been perpetrated. All I want is that the officer of the Gárda is placed under the obligation of showing that he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that baking is in progress in the premises that he wants to enter in the middle of the night.</P>

In other words, it is considered that there ought to be a definition of &ldquo;is issued.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the section is to require that policies shall be delivered to the policy-holders from the company's offices in Saorstát <Col N="2648" /> Eireann or by their representatives here, and not from offices outside the country.  It is sufficient then, for this country, to require that the policies should be issued here.  It is not contemplated or proposed to put foreign offices under the obligation to have policies executed or signed in this country.  The matter has been gone into very fully, and we consider that it is advisable that policies should be issued here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied in his mind that the courts of this country will hold that delivery of a policy to a policy-holder constitutes &ldquo;issue&rdquo; within the meaning of the law?  The Minister requires that every policy which is issued after the commencement of this Part of this Act to a person ordinarily resident in Saorstát Eireann shall, if such policy, bond, certificate, or other instrument of insurance is issued in the course of and as part of the carrying on in Saorstát Eireann of assurance business, be issued in Saorstát Eireann.  The Minister says he means that it shall be legitimate for the British companies to draft their policy, to fill it in and sign it in Great Britain, then to post it to their branch office in Dublin, and that the branch office will then issue it to the policy-holder.  That is the Minister's understanding of the word &ldquo;issue.&rdquo;  But the courts may very well hold that the operation of issuing a policy is the reception of the proposal and the act of acceptance.  It is to be borne in mind that the issuance of a policy is the acknowledgment of a contract of indemnity between the insured person and the insurance company. I think I am right in saying that from the moment when the proposal reaches the insurance company, and an authorised officer of that company signifies his acceptance of the risk, the insured party is covered against the risk referred to in the terms of the policy.  If that be so, <Col N="2649" /> surely that constitutes issuance of a policy.  Or does it?</P>
      <P>If that alone does not constitute issuance of a policy, is it not an integral part of the issue of a policy&mdash;first the acceptance of the risk, then the committal of the risk to writing, the committal of the terms of the contract of indemnity to writing, and lastly, the furnishing of a copy of the terms of the contract to the insured party?  All those elements enter into the operation of issuing a policy of insurance.  If the Minister intends no more than that policies of insurance shall not be posted direct from London to the insured party, why not draft the section to say so?</P>

      <P>We are not proposing to go further than we have gone.  We have gone into the matter very carefully. I have definitely stated that it is not the intention to compel companies to have policies executed or signed in this country, but if they wish to do so they may.  We recognise that it would be unreasonable to demand that they should do so in all cases. We think that we are justified in asking that they should issue them here. The matter has been gone into closely in the Departments concerned, and I am satisfied that the intention is covered by the section as it stands. It was gone into again after the Recommittal Stage, and we are still of opinion that the object which it is sought to achieve is adequately covered by the present wording of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Bill finally passes the House I think it appropriate to make some general observations regarding its character.  It was recently stated by the president of an important insurance body that insurance was almost of the character of a public utility.  I think it will be generally conceded that there is scarcely any type of business in which the public is more seriously concerned, or in respect of which it is more <Col N="2650" /> important that it should be properly carried on, than insurance business. The necessity for State regulation has been admitted even where the business has been carried on with proper security behind it; where it has been managed with skill and ability, and where little fault can be found in its organisation and management from the purely commercial point of view.  The many Insurance Acts on the Statute Book testify to this need, and I think we can all agree that the general effect of this legislation has been beneficial to the industry as well as to the policy-holder. The present Bill marks a further advance.  I think we can congratulate ourselves when it becomes law in having enacted a measure which will undoubtedly strengthen the business of insurance in this country.  It will, in my view, be of national advantage in that it will greatly aid our native companies in attaining that high degree of stability and security which we are all anxious they should attain.  We are anxious that they should attain a position of unquestioned stability in the shortest possible time.  I am confident that this aim will be achieved within a comparatively short period once the present Bill is in operation, and that as time goes on our native companies will consolidate their position and will be in a position to secure a continually increasing moiety of Saorstát insurance business.  I hope that the companies will accept the new position with a good will, that they will realise that it has been the Government's desire to assist them by every means possible, and that furthermore, they will take all necessary steps to ensure that from this time forward our native insurance business will be placed on a proper basis.  The serious problems that now face the Saorstát companies can be got over if they are faced in a practical and resolute spirit, and once they are dealt with, there is no reason why our native companies should not have a secure future before them.  We are taking steps to promote the extension of native insurance by prohibiting the entry of any further foreign insurance companies into the Saorstát.</P>

      <P>Powers are also being taken under this Bill to set up a reinsurance company so as to secure the transfer of a portion of the general insurance at present in the hands of foreign companies to Saorstát companies. Already the Government's proposals in this regard have borne fruit and a pooling arrangement has been made between the British Tariff Offices and the Irish Tariff Offices, the effect of which will be to secure a substantial income by way of reinsurance premiums to the Saorstát Tariff Offices.  It has been agreed that so long as the pooling scheme is operating to the Minister's satisfaction Part VI of the Act should not be put into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of industrial assurance in the Saorstát presented many difficulties. The provisions in this Bill will certainly aid very considerably to a solution of the existing problems in this branch of insurance business. As a first step machinery is being set up to facilitate the amalgamation of the existing Saorstát industrial offices and furthermore to provide that should an amalgamation take place substantial State contribution shall be provided by way of shareholding to meet the deficiencies on valuation. Although the amalgamation provisions cannot be imposed on any of the Saorstát companies I am very hopeful that there will emerge in due course one substantial industrial assurance comany in this country.  In any reorganisation of industrial assurance that may take place steps must be taken to secure that the deficiencies which have arisen in the past&mdash;and which must be met with the aid of State funds&mdash;must not be permitted to arise in the future. Moreover, it is in our opinion, essential in the interests of the policy-holders, that industrial assurance should be operated in the most efficient manner; and it can scarcely be disputed that one properly organised and equipped unit should be adequate to deal with all the industrial assurance business arising in the Saorstát, with the minimum cost to the policy-holder and to the State.  During the discussion on the Second Recommittal Stage Deputy Dillon put forward what was, in his opinion, a workable basis on which the <Col N="2652" /> amalgamation of the Irish industrial offices could be brought about.  I have no doubt the companies concerned will explore fully Deputy Dillon's proposals and I can give an assurance that when amalgamation schemes come before the Minister for consideration the views of the Deputy will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>Apart from dealing with the special problems of the Saorstát industrial assurance offices, provisions are incorporated in the Bill which govern the whole field of industrial assurance. These provisions follow generally the British Industrial Assurance Act, 1923, which, I am informed, has been operating in a satisfactory way for some time.  There are, of course, some important modifications of that Act to meet our particular problems here.  I am satisfied that these provisions will lead to increased efficiency in industrial assurance while constituting valuable safeguards for the insuring public.</P>
    <P>The principle of separating life and industrial assurance from all other classes of assurance business for the future which is a feature of the Bill, has led to a certain amount of criticism. I am quite satisfied that the principle of separating these classes of business so that the same insurers shall not be allowed to carry on life business and non-life business is a sound one. It has not been effectively contended and I doubt if it can be argued with merit that it is sound practice for a life assurance company to undertake the substantial risks inherent in general business.  To put the matter briefly, life insurance is the saving of money to secure the payment of a fixed sum on the expiration of a certain time, or at death, if such should take place earlier, while general insurance is taken out to secure indemnity against loss, should such loss arise during the currency of the policy.</P>
    <P>There are other important changes to which I shall refer briefly.  All the main classes of insurance, excluding marine, have been brought in and are now being controlled while the old system of freedom with publicity is being retained.  There is a provision that a deposit of £20,000 is required for industrial insurance as <Col N="2653" /> well as for life assurance.  More extensive information is required to be given in the statutory returns so as to secure fuller details of purely Saorstát Eireann business.  The assets of the life and industrial fund are to be kept separate from any other business transacted by the company. There is an important provision empowering the Minister to fix the rates of premium for mechanically propelled vehicle insurance and for employers' liability insurance.</P>
    <P>With regard to the winding-up of insurance companies, there has been for some years a need for powers to deal quickly with such companies. The Minister will secure such powers in Part IV of the Bill and he should thereby be in a position to take effective action in any case where the financial position of a company, and consequently the security of the policy-holders, is in danger.</P>
    <P>The question of making provision for compensating insurance workers who may be affected by amalgamation proposals has been debated very fully, and while I still adhere to the opinion that, in view of the voluntary nature of these proposals, no statutory provision for compensation should be made, I repeat the undertaking given by the Minister that it is his intention to ensure that persons who are dependent for their livelihood on insurance employment will be fairly dealt with.</P>
    <P>The measure has received very careful examination by all the parties concerned.  I am grateful for the criticism and suggestions put forward during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil.  The Act will not come into operation immediately it has been passed by the House, but with the exception of Part VI it will be brought into operation by Order without undue delay.  I am confident that this measure will secure increased protection and security for policy-holders of all classes in Saorstát Eireann.  I am confident also that if all the problems of this great industry be approached in a reasonable spirit there will emerge, in due course, a much stronger, more efficient and sounder native industry <Col N="2654" /> than would be possible under existing legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot echo the optimistic hopes which have been put into the Minister's mouth. I am aware that in this country there is steadily developing a bureaucratic machine which has become obsessed with the idea that it can not only operate the Civil Service but can run everybody's business better than the people themselves.  I notice particularly that the Department for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible is peculiarly ready to undertake the task of supplanting men who have devoted their lives to the development and management of highly technical businesses, to take over these businesses as Departments of State, and to say quite blandly to the community that they are quite satisfied that under this new dispensation they will be very much better run than they were heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he expects this Bill will result in there emerging one efficient unit for the handling of all the industrial insurance of this country, and that he is convinced that such a unit is the most desirable method of dealing with industrial insurance in Saorstát Eireann.  That is a sound socialist view.  The socialist always holds that if you can centralise everything in the hands of the Government, consolidate everything, eliminate private enterprise and regiment everybody everything will be best in the best of all possible worlds; but the socialist is wrong and I view with great alarm the increasing tendency of the present Government to drift from one socialist experience into another.  We alternate in the most extraordinary way between State capitalism and State socialism.  I think these insurance proposals are strongly flavoured with State socialism, and I believe the ultimate intention of the Government, having forced all the industrial insurance of the country into the hands of one unit, is to nationalise that unit and to make an attempt to equate industrial insurance with national health insurance and to operate it as a semi-Government Department.  In my opinion, if they do, they will kill industrial <Col N="2655" /> insurance in this country.  I am convinced that the elimination of competition in the industrial insurance field is going to react unfavourably on the policy-holders.</P>
    <P>We have made it quite clear on every stage of this Bill that we were anxious, and are now anxious, to cooperate with the Government in removing from industrial insurance practice here any and all abuses that have manifested themselves during the last 50 or 60 years since industrial insurance first came to be known here.  Probably one of the best reforms included in this Bill, a reform which deals with the pseudo-transfers from one company to another, has been inserted at the instance of Deputies on this side of the House, but we are equally clear that the socialisation of industrial insurance, or of anything else in this country, is not a good thing and ought never to have been undertaken. The Minister says that this Bill will aid our own native companies to attain greater strength.  That is true in so far as it refers to insolvent Irish companies. They are going to be picked up and fortified with State money, set upon their feet and forced into amalgamation. That is the plan.  They can be forced into amalgamation by the threat of winding-up unless they submit to the terms suggested by the Minister's Department.  When they have been amalgamated into a block, supported by Government money, they will undoubtedly be able to carry on and they will carry on as a semi-Government Department.  The British companies will be able to carry on because they have accumulated great reserves over a long period of unregulated operations in Great Britain, which will enable them to meet the requirements imposed on them by the terms of this Bill, but the solvent Irish companies will be destroyed by this Bill, and this House should realise what it is doing in that regard.</P>
    <P>They are going to be left to compete, on the one hand, with a Government company composed of the insolvent Irish companies which the Minister will have taken over, and, on the other hand, with the great British companies <Col N="2656" /> offering better terms which the British companies are in a position to finance from their accumulated funds.  The reward of men who have deprived themselves of the profit they might have taken out of these insurance concerns which they themselves built up, who preferred to put them back into the business in order that the policy-holders of their company would be doubly secure, is going to be destruction, and I say that in so far as that is true a very cruel injustice is being done by this House to a body of men who never asked anything from this State but the right to carry on legitimate business in a legitimate way.  Out of that dilemma there is no escape for this House, except by amending legislation which would provide equitable terms of amalgamation for the shareholders in these companies.  Unless that course is adopted, this House should open its eyes to the fact that it will, in effect, confiscate the property of honest men who have built up honest business, and who had no reason to apprehend penal legislation of any kind being directed against them in this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he hopes the Irish companies will accept the new conditions. Most of the persons concerned with industry in Ireland have shown themselves on more than one occasion to be good citizens, and they will accept the law for what it is, but to hope they will be able to make a success of the new conditions he is creating for them is to hope for the impossible. They cannot do that, and I believe that the Minister's advisers know that.  Many Deputies will ask themselves how can such a situation have developed and the answer is perfectly simple.  The Government rushed into this business without fully understanding the problem with which they have to deal.  They had a kind of idea that there was some kind of analogy between national health insurance and insurance of that character and industrial insurance.  There is, in fact, none. They became obsessed with the policy-holder's view, and, while it was right and proper that the policy-holder's claims upon these companies should be given the fullest weight and amplest consideration, it was also right and just <Col N="2657" /> that the interests of the shareholders and proprietors of solvent companies, who were quite prepared to carry on and quite prepared to submit their companies to whatever examination or regulation the Government thought expedient, should have been considered. Their interests have not been considered.  Their property is going to be destroyed, and I say that is a very grave injustice, and a situation which the Government has made no genuine attempt to meet.  The Minister referred in passing to the view his Department would take of the amalgamation scheme which I outlined on the Report Stage.  He said that if he approached the Irish companies with a scheme of that character he felt sure it would be favourably and carefully considered.  The obstacles in the way of carrying through an amalgamation scheme within the terms of this Bill are insuperable.  It cannot be done. The only efficient way to effect amalgamation is to do it by <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, which will cut the Gordian knot presented by the impact of existing companies on the problem with which we have to deal here.  The Minister said that his policy is to end up by having one unit of industrial assurance. If that is his policy it is a bad policy, and he has to prevail upon this House to adopt it.  All I say is, if that is his policy, then let us make no shilly shally about seeking a realisation of the policy he has in mind and which this House has accepted.  Not one Deputy in the Fianna Fáil Party knows one section of this Bill from the other, but, good or ill, they have voted for it, and as it has been accepted by the Oireachtas, then let amending legislation be introduced at the earliest possible moment to incorporate a scheme of amalgamation which will most effectively carry out the Minister's opinion.  If he wants to do that the first preliminary is to invite the constituent companies to the proposed amalgamation to meet him and to present an agreed scheme.  If they will not produce an agreed scheme he could inform them that it is his intention to draft one, which will do the best equity he can devise, in the absence of the co-operation of the companies to be amalgamated, and that he will ask Dáil</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2658" /> Eireann to pass the Bill, because he has been unable to get from the constituent companies an agreed scheme which he could incorporate in a Bill and submit to the House with the consent of the companies.</P>
    <P>Let me make myself clear upon that.  I should like first if the Minister could get the five companies to agree to a scheme that he could incorporate in a Bill to be brought in and carried through this House, so as to override any difficulties which might arise under the existing law.  If he cannot get agreement amongst the five companies, after consultation with the companies individually, he should devise what, in his opinion, is the most equitable one that could be hammered out, or the best of the schemes laid before him by the constituent companies, and he should then draft a scheme of his own devising and bring it before the House and force it on the companies.  Otherwise the only people who will suffer will be the solvent companies.  All the others can afford to sit back and let events take their course, without having any apprehension whatever of what the ultimate consequences may be.  I think the Minister should say now, before the Final Stage is passed, whether he is prepared to provide the legislative machinery which will be necessary to carry amalgamation effectively into force, and if he is prepared to introduce an amending Bill for the purpose of facilitating the realisation of what he has declared to be his ultimate aim and policy in regard to this business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only assume that the companies are not quite so blind to their own interests as Deputy Dillon thinks.  The extraordinary thing about the Deputy and people like him is that, in spite of all the talk about people doing legitimate business in a legitimate way which should not be interfered with, when it becomes obvious that, in the interest of the community, some of these businesses should be interfered with, we have them calling upon the Government Department, as the Deputy has just been calling upon <Col N="2659" /> me, to come along and to devise a scheme.  We have not discussed during the passage of this Bill the arguments for amalgamation.  I do not know whether Deputy Dillon feels strongly that amalgamation should be necessary.  I gathered that he was not quite satisfied about that.  But, from the point of view of the community, there is a very strong case indeed for amalgamation.  Even from the point of view of their own future it must be clear to the Irish companies that if the duplication which is going on were to continue, and if no steps were to be taken by the Government to regulate matters, it would simply mean a continuance of the present state of affairs for a long period.  After all, it is 14 years since the Saorstát Government was brought into being, and this problem has not been dealt with during that time.  In some respects it has been getting worse, and it has become quite clear, since we came into office, that it would have to be dealt with probably during our period of office.  The matter has been considered very carefully, and there is ample data at the Minister's disposal to show that the necessity exists for taking action. Although we have not had a Commission on the question recently, I think we have got good advice, advice of the highest character, as to what ought to be done in the special circumstances of Irish insurance. We are not simply introducing a measure which proposes to regulate the Irish companies by saying: &ldquo;If you do such and such you will simply have to get out of business; you are going to be wound up compulsorily&rdquo;; or &ldquo;If you do not take certain action we are not going to aid you.&rdquo;  The Government is giving very definite aid, and if it is asking that certain things be done it is coming in to place the Irish companies on a sound foundation for the future.  Deputy Dillon has ignored that aspect of the matter.  Once this Bill becomes law, and once the amalgamation proposals go ahead, with Government support the Irish insurance business will be on an entirely new footing.  There will be no question <Col N="2660" /> in future as to security, as to management or good faith.  So far as public psychology is concerned which is, I suppose, the most important element in connection with insurance, I have no doubt the public will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not promising the Deputy to introduce legislation.  I do not know why I should at this stage even presume to think that legislation will be necessary.  It is impossible to foretell what may happen in the future, but I am convinced that the Irish companies will be in a much better position when this Bill is in operation.  I cannot see why they cannot come together and put up a scheme.  I am not going to say that the Department of Industry and Commerce, of which Deputy Dillon has a very low opinion, is going to come in when the companies themselves fail to come to agreement, and suggest a scheme which will be perfect from the point of view of the community and of the companies.  I have no doubt the Department will give every assistance possible, but I cannot promise that it would take upon itself to put forward a scheme even in the event of failure of the companies to reach agreement.  I cannot see why, having regard to the situation in the industry, and the absolute necessity for facing up to that situation, and getting rid of dead weight, the companies do not come together and hammer out a scheme.  After all, the important thing for them is to secure the good-will and the confidence of the community.  Even if they cannot please everyone they should be able to carry out a workmanlike scheme. The Deputy thinks the Government has some ulterior motive at the back of its mind in going ahead with this legislation.  There is no such motive. From the examination of the Irish insurance business which took place long before this Bill was introduced, it was impossible to see a state of affairs in which we would have in existence an united company which would be able to take the larger portion of the Saorstát business.  It will take some time to reach that position but the foundations are laid in this Bill and there is no reason why the term, which might <Col N="2661" /> be rather long, should not be made much shorter.  The Deputy thinks that the insolvent companies will benefit and that the other companies will not benefit.  Why he refuses to face the fact that the insolvent companies, or the companies that are considered to be in a weak financial position, are a menace to the welfare of the other companies, I cannot say.  If there were some other way of dealing with this problem than the method outlined in the Bill, the companies had ample opportunity, since the Bill was introduced, to put forward a scheme.  But there is no use in the solvent companies taking up the attitude that the position of the insolvent companies is no part of their business.  If the Government or the Department of Industry and Commerce can make these companies see that it is to their interest to clear off this matter of the financially weak companies, on that ground alone the Bill would have justified itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>The Deputy also told us that State interference with people carrying on business in a legitimate way is the greatest evil of the time. The one thing which will save Irish companies from State interference and State regulation in the future will be their ability to show the Irish public that they are carrying on their business on a sound basis and in an efficient manner and that the Irish policy-holders will, at some time&mdash;not too far distant&mdash;get as good terms from the Irish companies as from the foreign companies.  I believe that the provisions of this Bill will bring that day nearer and the Deputy is rather short-sighted if he thinks that a business like the insurance business is going easily to agree to any policy of nationalisation in the future.  The companies are going to see that it is to their advantage to become more <Col N="2662" /> efficient, to give better terms to policyholders, to gain the confidence of the public in a surer manner than they have been doing and, in that way, should the question be raised by any future Government as to the taking over of insurance business to show that, from the point of view of the policy-holders and the community, it is better that private enterprise should continue and that control of the insurance business should remain in the hands of private concerns.</P>

      <P>When Section 18 was being discussed on Committee Stage, Deputy Costello asked what the measure of damages would be in the event of the death of a passenger.  He pointed out that under the section, as it stood, nothing was said but that damages &ldquo;may be awarded,&rdquo; and that there was likely to be considerable discussion when the section came into operation as to the measure of damages.  The object of this amendment is to make clear that the principle of Lord Campbell's Act is to be applied as the measure of the damages to be awarded.  That is to say, the amount of damages is to be restricted to an amount proportionate to the actual financial loss sustained by the death of the person concerned.  The amount of damages will depend entirely on the amount of dependency and on the actual financial loss suffered and will not contain any element of compassionate or vindictive damages.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 30, Section 24 (1), before the word &ldquo;caused&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;without any gross negligence or wilful misconduct on his part and without any gross negligence or wilful misconduct (to which he was privy) on the part of his servants or agents&rdquo;, and in the same line to delete the words &ldquo;without his actual fault or privy&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the principle of limitation of liability for damages done to third parties on the surface will, in fact, operate.  I explained, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, that the words used in the Merchant Shipping Acts, &ldquo;actual fault or privity,&rdquo; were introduced here on the ground that the merchant shipping legislation was somewhat analogous to the air legislation which we are at present considering. It seems, however, that the expression &ldquo;actual fault or privity&rdquo; might have the effect that there would be no limitation of liability.  It would be very difficult to imagine an accident taking place to aircraft flown by an owner-pilot and something happening that would not be taken to be within his privity.  In view of that, it is thought that the advantage of limitation of liability might be lost.  We are, therefore, removing these words and substituting for them the words set out in the amendment, so that, in order that the air-craft owner should receive the benefit of the limitation, he will have to prove the absence of gross negligence and wilful misconduct and, similarly, he will have to prove that wilful misconduct or gross negligence on the part of his servants or agents did not exist with his privity.</P>

    <P>Deputy Dillon asked on the Committee Stage whether provision was made for the payment of compensation when a private right of fishing was prohibited or limited and I undertook to consider the point.  I am informed that the position is that when private property is interfered with by the State, unless <Col N="2665" /> there is specific exemption from compensation, it is implied that compensation is payable and that as the section stands it gives a right to compensation. It is considered better, however, to provide specifically for compensation when a private right is interfered with and for the method of determination of the amount of compensation. Amendment No. 4 is to distinguish between a public right and a private right of fishing or of landing fish.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the payment of compensation when a private right is interfered with, the amount of compensation in the absence of agreement to be determined by the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act, 1919.  The payment of compensation, when a public right is interfered with is impracticable, and I cannot foresee any circumstances, in which a private right of navigation would come into question, where compensation could be granted for interference with such right.  The effect of the amendment is to ensure that suitable compensation will be granted where the State interferes with private rights of fishing or landing fish or any other private rights of that character.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I should like to have cleared up on this Stage.  I understand that this Bill is to provide for a Commonwealth airline to operate within the Commonwealth of Nations to which we belong. <Col N="2667" /> I think emphasis should be thrown on the fact that this departure, which definitely puts Ireland on the map of aerial transport for all time, is consequent on the fact that Saorstát Eireann has the good fortune to be a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and that but for that fact it might very well be that it would be for ever excluded from participation in transatlantic aerial traffic.  I should like the Minister to tell us in Dáil Eireann, whilst his colleagues are waxing eloquent in other places upon the historic struggle that is going on with our ancient enemy, Britain, how far he has been engaged in direct negotiation with the British Government in connection with the agreements that have been incorporated in this Bill which is going to become a statute of Oireachtas Eireann.  Does he consider that our international position, in the course of these negotiations, was in any way rendered more difficult by our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations? Does he believe that our membership if the Commonwealth of Nations jeopardised or injured the national interest in connection with this very important development in our industrial and mercantile life?  Does he consider that the independence and sovereignty of this State were called in question at any time during the negotiations which led up to the developments which gave rise to this Bill?  Would he tell us whether he thinks that it in any way derogates from the national sovereignty of Ireland that we should co-operate, as we are co-operating in this legislation, with Great Britain and Canada and the other members of the Commonwealth of Nations?  Those are questions on which, I think, the Minister ought to say a word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second matter which I should like him to deal with is this: It appears to me that certain matters arising in connection with this measure would have constituted appropriate material for treaty arrangements with the other sovereign States of Great Britain and Canada who are parties to the common arrangement.  Can he say what the official opinion of our Department of External Affairs is on that question? <Col N="2668" /> Can he inform us whether any of the negotiations which have been carried on in connection with the arrangements which have been arrived at, were conducted from the Department of External Affairs or whether they were conducted by direct contact between the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of this country, the Board of Trade in Great Britain and the corresponding Department in the State of Canada?  If the negotiations were conducted in this direct way, would he say that this constitutes a new precedent, and if so, does he consider such a precedent desirable from the constitutional standpoint?</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies I wish to say that Deputy Dillon has always represented us over here as wrapping the green flag round us.  But every time the Deputy gets an opportunity he wraps the flag of the Commonwealth around him.  On the necessity for air transport, I want to say that before Deputy Dillon was born we were concerned here with aviation.  I could go so far back as 1912.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but not of the Deputy's manner.  In 1912 Cunningham Graham was flying his aeroplane in Belfast and the late Mr. Arthur Griffith and I brought him down to Dublin and we had his aeroplane here.  It was hung from the roof of the Rotunda and we arranged lectures for the people of Dublin every half hour.  The man who delivered the lectures was The O'Rahilly, who was killed in 1916.  We had large crowds of people at the lectures on aeroplanes, and the lecturer spoke of the advantages aeroplanes would be in the future.  That only shows that our connection with and interest in air navigation goes very far back.  However, what made me rise to speak was more than a whim.  It was a view which came into my head when Deputy Dillon was speaking.  Whether it is through misfortune or bad luck or through some other reasons peculiar to the British, we must all lament the awful number of accidents that happen to them in the matter of their aviation. Almost every week there are fatal accidents. This morning's papers disclose, I think, 68 fatal accidents to the British Royal Air Force this year.  Hundreds of men have been killed in recent years in aeroplane accidents in England. Whether it is that their technicians are at fault or through some other grave reasons, the percentage of accidents appears very high.  When we compare their records in aviation with the record of Germany, England shows up to great disadvantage.  One seldom hears of accidents to aeroplanes in Germany.  Their great airship, the Hindenburg, travels into storms and gales.  It goes all over the world and travels safely.  We all know what happens to the big English airships.  One of them had only left England a few hours when it collapsed in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These thoughts came into my head when Deputy Dillon was speaking. Similar misfortunes dog the progress of the American air service.  One of their airships was lost some time ago on the coast of Florida and another <Col N="2670" /> off the coast of California when 70 or 80 young men in the American air service lost their lives.  Why is it that the German air service is so safe?  Is it through their lack of competence that the British air service compares so unfavourably with that of the Germans?  These are the facts at all events.  I am hoping that when the Minister enters into this service he will avail of the services of the best advisers and technicians.  If the Government has any interest in this new company that is to promote aviation I hope they will get the best men the world can produce so that it cannot afterwards be said that there was any fault or any lack of science in the construction of the aeroplanes that will fly between this and other countries.  I am putting these remarks before the Minister.  I hope the Minister will take heed of them because I offer them in all sincerity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if Deputy Kelly is correct in his facts. It is perfectly true that Germany leads the world as regards dirigibles.  That is because her experimentation in dirigibles goes farther back than those of other countries.  But even German airships have suffered disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I never heard of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMacDermot" hpid="Mr. MacDermot Mr. MacDermot">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacDermot</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will search his memory or look through the newspaper files he will come across reports of these disasters.  As regards aeroplanes, I very much question the Deputy's statement that there is a higher proportion of accidents in Great Britain than in Germany.  After all we do not read the German newspapers to any great extent in this country and the Deputy cannot expect that he will see an accident to a German aeroplane reported in the same way as he would see reported an accident nearer home.  I think the Deputy ought to take the trouble to investigate the facts with more care before getting up here and suggesting that Commonwealth aeroplanes or aviators are inferior to foreign aeroplanes or aviators.  I do not think there is anything in his contention.  I believe that civil aviation in America is greatly ahead of any country including <Col N="2671" /> Germany.  But apart from America, my opinion, given for what it is worth, is that Great Britain is probably the best of the rest of them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked what Departments were concerned with these negotiations.  Negotiations have been going on in different places, London, Ottawa, Dublin, and at different times different Departments of State have taken part in these negotiations.  At one time or other all the Departments concerned have taken part in them. The Department of External Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Industry and Commerce as well as the office of Public Works have all taken part in the negotiations. There is no abrogation of national status or any infringement of constitutional rights or anything of that class involved in connection with the agreements that have been made with regard to transatlantic air services. Deputy Dillon would not be correct in stating that because of our connection with the British Commonwealth we have become participators in these transatlantic air services.  The truth is that it is really our geographical position which has been the main factor in determining that we should become part of the present enterprise. We have had negotiations with all the Governments concerned and they have been carried on in the way I have mentioned. The Departments concerned have at some time or other taken part in them.  I do not think the Deputy raised any other point of importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly referred to the question of accidents.  My information is, as Deputy MacDermot has just pointed out, that so far as commercial aviation is concerned it is on an entirely different plane to the air forces of the different countries.  Commercial aviation in the nature of things has to be safe.  We have no proper conception in this country of the extraordinary degree of safety that has been attained in commercial aviation. Deputy Kelly can rest assured that so far as the Government are concerned &mdash;since they are now pledged to take <Col N="2672" /> certain steps to develop aviation and to establish other services&mdash;we shall seek for the highest technical advice that can be procured.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may rest assured that no efforts will be spared, as far as the Government are concerned, to see that any services that we sponsor or establish will be as perfect and as satisfactory to the public as we can make them.</P>

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1937, for expenditure in respect of Public Buildings; for the maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; for the execution and maintenance of Drainage Works; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the River Shannon Navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estimate is for the sum of £10, but the Vote required is for a sum of £20,0000.  I stated on the Committee Stage of the Bill that it was estimated that the construction of the airport would cost <Col N="2673" /> £500,000, or if residential quarters for the staff employed were required, £520,000.  It is contemplated that the construction of the airport will be carried out by the Office of Public Works. I should make it clear, however, as Deputies will see on the back of the Estimate, that the total estimate for the work has not yet been officially made by the Department, and that the estimate of £500,000 which I have given, or £520,000, including residential quarters for the staff, is a provisional estimate.  Preliminary work in fact is only being done at present.  Inquiries are being made and so on, and it is really very difficult to state a precise figure, but I have given a figure of £500,000, which may be taken as a provisional estimate.  The Vote required is £20,000.  It is expected that that will be made available from savings under other headings by reason of works provided for, which may not be carried out during the year.  The works which will be undertaken in the year 1936-37 will comprise preparatory work in connection with the drainage of the landing area and other preliminary work for the general construction works including the erection and fur nishing of huts for a radio station, etc. This expenditure will be chargeable under sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions, of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.</P>

      <P>I cannot say really. These are figures supplied by the Board of Works.  I think that the Board of Works feel that it is extremely difficult to give a very close estimate.  Not having had experience of this kind of work before, they really are in the position that they will have to take counsel probably and get special technical advice and assistance before they proceed very far.  I think it is for that reason that they feel they cannot give a close estimate.  But I assume they feel, from the knowledge at their disposal and the amount of work already done by the chief engineer, that it is quite likely that the £20,000 will be expended.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will notice that there are two items in the Supplementary Estimate &mdash;Civil Airport, £10,000 and Meteorological Services, £6,000.  With regard to the civil airport, it is being established primarily in connection with the transatlantic service, but I should like <Col N="2675" /> to take the opportunity to make it clear, as it has been mentioned elsewhere and, I think, in this House previously, that it is the intention of the Government to develop civil aviation in this country and to take the fullest advantage of our geographical situation.  It is our intention, when the proper time comes, to take suitable steps for the establishment of an air service connecting various suitable points in other countries with the airport we are now proposing to establish in connection with this scheme for a transatlantic air service.  In my statement to the Dáil on the transatlantic air service, I stated that each of the four Governments concerned in the arrangements made for the operation of the service had undertaken to provide the airport necessary in their own territory for the service, and, also, that the Saorstát airport, with adequate radio and meteorological equipment, would provide all the necessary facilities for flying boats and land machines and would be constructed, owned and controlled by the Saorstát Government. A survey of the proposed site has been completed and has shown it to be suitable for the construction of first-class airport.  It is necessary that arrangements should be made at once to acquire the necessary land in order that some preliminary drainage work can be done on the site before the end of the summer season.  As large an area of land as possible will be acquired by agreement but, in the event of failure to agree, the powers of compulsory acquisition, provided in the Air Navigation and Transport Bill, will be used.  It is expected that the work of acquisition will not be completed in this financial year as the preliminary investigation and legal formalities will take some time, and the sum of £10,000 is expected to cover the outlay under this head before the end of March next.</P>

    <P>This Estimate is for the purpose of making provision for aviation and meteorological wireless services in connection, primarily, with the establishment of transatlantic air services.

The total amount of the Estimate is £14,700, of which £13,900 is proper to the establishment of transatlantic air services and developments arising therefrom. This sum represents the amount that will, it is estimated, be required to cover the cost of the wireless equipment; Customs duty thereon; installation charges; rental of sites, the provision of temporary buildings, the provision of power lines, telegraph and telephone services and operating staff.

      <P>It is clear, however, that this radio installation of ours will be purely our own property, and that it is proposed to erect it pursuant to an undertaking on our part.  That would seem to clear the way for our establishing direct radio contact with the United States of America.  It would be interesting to know whether the British Post Office have made any representations in connection with that matter.  There may be some Geneva treaty regulating postal facilities, but it would make a very great difference indeed if our Post Office were in a position to handle direct telephonic traffic between this country and the United States as it would be a source of very considerable revenue, which must at present be enjoyed by the British Post Office.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 11 (2), before paragraph (e) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) all land bonds which are transferred under this section to the said adjustment account and are not transferred under this section to the credit of an estate shall be cancelled <Col N="2679" /> or otherwise disposed of in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to make it perfectly clear that land bonds which are not required may be cancelled or disposed of as directed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says that land bonds may be cancelled or otherwise disposed of by the Minister for Finance, he does not mean, I take it, that the Minister for Finance can conduct open market operations&mdash;sell land bonds on the open market and raise money in that way.  The Land Acts provide that the only purpose for which bonds may be issued is for the payment of land acquired under the Land Purchase Acts.  Let us suppose that excess bonds are issued in error, would this amendment give the Minister for Finance the right, in so far as it conferred power on him, to dispose of them in any manner that he may direct: to sell those bonds on the open market and raise money for the Exchequer in that way?  Ordinarily, that course would not be followed, but it might appear that, under the section as it stands now, such a course would be open to the Minister if he felt inclined to pursue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the purpose this section is designed to secure.  Up to now the position has been that land bonds were issued in respect of a particular estate and could not be used in respect of another estate.  Actually, the Minister could not even cancel them.  Under this amendment, we are proposing to give power to the Land Commission, first of all, to transfer land bonds from one estate to another: that is, if there is a surplus in respect of one estate to use the bonds in the case of another estate.  Power is also being taken to cancel land bonds. This is the first time that power has been taken to cancel land bonds without issuing them to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to the power of cancellation in the least, but the Minister will observe that after the word &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo; there are the <Col N="2680" /> words &ldquo;or otherwise disposed of&rdquo;. That would appear to give to the Minister the right to sell them in an open market transaction, thus floating a loan without the authority of the House at all.  Perhaps the Minister will look into that question and see if he has not made the section a little wider than he intended?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This section has been sent back two or three times to the Parliamentary draftsman in order to cover powers of cancellation and also powers of transfer.  These were the two purposes that were put before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has specifically taken the power to transfer, and we all accept that.  Sub-section 2 (e) gives him power to cancel.  That is all agreed.  Now it goes further and says &ldquo;or otherwise disposed of in such manner as the Minister for Finance shall from time to time direct.&rdquo;  That seems to me, where the Land Commission have purchased an estate the purchase price of which is £100,000, to give the Minister power to issue £1,000,000 worth of land bonds and then not to transfer the £900,000 worth of land bond surplus to other estates, not to cancel them, but to hand them to the Government stockbroker and so sell them on the open market and turn the money into the Exchequer.  That clearly is not the intention of the Minister and it would open a source of revenue to the Exchequer which it is obviously not the intention of the House to give.  I may be wrong in apprehending that, but I think it is a matter that ought to be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask for a specific ruling in regard to amendment No. 3.  My submission to the Chair is that amendment No. 3 is merely declaratory and is not fundamental inasmuch as it does not alter the existing law.  I base that submission on the repeated statements of the Minister for Lands in the House and in the country, that the fixity of tenure of any person with less than £2,000 worth of land is not affected by any Land Bill or Act for which he has been responsible.  If that statement is true, my amendment is merely declaratory and the position which the Minister states exists.  If, on the other hand, it is true that the Minister has power to acquire the land of anybody, whether he has less than £2,000 worth of land or more and whether that land was vested in him under the previous Land Acts or not, then I admit this amendment is fundamental. But I submit that unless the Minister is prepared to certify that my amendment materially alters the law, it is not a fundamental amendment and is, therefore, quite in order on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 10, Section 17 (1), to delete paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) and substitute the following paragraphs&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if the money certified in such warrant to be due exceeds three hundred pounds, to charge and (where appropriate) to add to such money and (in any case) to levy under such warrant such fees and expenses, calculated according to the scales appointed by the Minister for Justice under paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 14 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926 (No. 18 of 1926), and for the time being in force, as such county registrar would be entitled so to charge or add and to levy if such warrant were an execution order (within the meaning of the said Act) of the High Court, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) if the money certified in such warrant to be due exceeds twenty-five pounds but does not exceed three hundred pounds, to charge and (where appropriate) to add to such money and (in any case) to levy under such warrant such fees and expenses, calculated according to the said scales, as such <Col N="2684" /> county registrar would be entitled so to charge or add and to levy if such warrant were an execution order (within the meaning aforesaid) of the Circuit Court, and</P>
    <P>(c)  if the money certified in such warrant to be due does not exceed twenty-five pounds, to charge and (where appropriate) to add to such money and (in any case) to levy under such warrant such fees and expenses, calculated according to the said scales, as such county registrar would be entitled so to charge or add and to levy if such warrant were an execution order (within the meaning aforesaid) of the District Court.</P>
    <P>These paragraphs are all designed to deal with the clause upon which there was a certain amount of discussion on the Committee Stage.  Deputy Fitzgerald Kenney objected, for instance, to clause 3 (b) of Section 17, which set out: &ldquo;every judgment or order obtained in any such proceeding before the passing of this Act which was made solely on the ground that such warrant was invalidated by such addition of fees and expenses as aforesaid shall be and be deemed always to have been void and unenforceable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have practically scrapped that whole section and redrafted it so that it will only cover exactly what we want it to cover.  The point is that if there were pending cases the plaintiff is also to be entitled to his costs.  I think it covers the matter in a way that would be fairly satisfactory, at any rate, to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.</P>

    <P>7. In page 10 to delete Section 17 (3) and substitute two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3) No action or other proceeding instituted in any court before and pending at the passing of this Act against a county registrar in respect of anything done by him under a warrant issued by the Land Commission under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933, shall (subject to the next following sub-section of this section) be further prosecuted or proceeded with if or in so far as such proceeding is grounded on all or any of the following allegations, that is to say, the allegation that the charge by such county registrar in relation to such warrant of any fees or any expenses which might lawfully have been so charged if the foregoing sub-sections of this section had then been in force was unlawful, or the allegation that such warrant was invalidated or prejudiced by the addition to the moneys thereby certified of any fees or any expenses which might lawfully have been so added if the said foregoing sub-sections had then been in force, or the allegation that the levy under such warrant of any such fees or any such expenses was unlawful.</P>
    <P>(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in the next preceding sub-section of this section, it shall be lawful for the court in which any such action or other proceeding as is mentioned in that sub-section is pending at the passing of this Act to make on the application of the <Col N="2686" /> plaintiff in such proceeding after such passing such order as to the costs of such proceeding as such court shall think proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, before Section 25 (5), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) Whenever the Lay Commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) shall have made a decision upon any objection or requisition they shall if so requested by the person making the said objection or requisition or by counsel or solicitor on his behalf deliver to the said person or to his solicitor as the case may be a statement in writing of the findings of fact and rulings in law on which their said decision has been based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is designed to secure <Col N="2687" /> that persons whose interests are vitally affected by the decision of the lay commissioners shall know the facts on which the lay commissioners purported to form their judgment, and the law which influenced them in forming their judgment on the accepted facts.  The Minister says that while the lay commissioners are prepared to communicate the legal decision at which they have arrived, they will not state the facts, because there is no appeal from their finding as to fact.  But surely it is not an unreasonable demand on the part of any citizen of this State to know what facts were accepted in arriving at the decision?</P>
    <P>While I admit the principle that the Minister should not interfere in the activities of the Land Commissioners, in so far as they extend to reserved service, is a good one, I also feel that this House is the legitimate guardian of the rights of every man in this country.  If it became clear that the lay commissioners had completely misdirected themselves on some fundamental question of fact concerning the property of a citizen of the State, and in consequence of that complete misdirection had arrived at a legal decision which could not for one moment be sustained if the true facts were present to the commissioners' minds, then I think that there should be available to the citizen a remedy, either in the courts if they had not been set aside by statute specifically, or, in the event of the courts having been set aside, by raising the matter in this House either on the Minister's Estimate or in some other way, in order to direct attention to a very material injustice.  It must be to avoid resort to that remedy in the event of injustice accruing that the Land Commissioners and the Attorney-General are opposed to the proposal that the facts on which their decisions are founded should be communicated to the parties interested.  I cannot see why the views of the Land Commissioners or of the Attorney-General should ultimately prevail in a matter of this kind.  The matter at issue is not the convenience of the Land Commissioners or of the Attorney-General. <Col N="2688" /> The matter at issue is the rights of an individual citizen against the Land Commission.  Why should the Land Commissioners be the persons to decide as to whether or not this remedy should be made available?</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is incumbent upon him to give this House some more exhaustive explanation of his reasons for refusing to accept Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's suggestion than to say he has consulted the Land Commissioners and the Attorney-General and they will not let him accept it.  Does the Minister, as an ordinary citizen&mdash;forgetting for a moment that he is a minister of State or has any association with the Land Commission&mdash;agree with me that a man ought to know the facts upon which a decision which intimately concerns his person or his property has been reached?  I think on the face of it the justice of such a claim is irresistible.</P>
    <P>No evil can possibly flow from such a suggestion if no substantial injustice has been done.  I submit that it is bureaucracy run mad to say &ldquo;Once we have arrived at a decision on a matter of fact, we decline to state the facts upon which we founded our decision.&rdquo;</P>

At the end of it all he said: &ldquo;Well, if you are not prepared to accept this amendment, will you consult the Attorney-General and the Land Commissioners on it?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Remember, this has been a practice since the Land Commission has been established.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney did not make a case which convinced me&mdash;not knowing very much about it&mdash;that the practice should be changed, and I undertook to consult the Attorney-General and the Land Commissioners on the matter.  I have <Col N="2689" /> since done that.  After consulting with both the Land Commissioners and the Attorney-General I do not feel called upon to accept this amendment.</P>

However, we will not.  All I am submitting is that there used to be an appeal to Judge Wylie, or whoever filled his position in the past. That appeal was taken away by the 1933 Land Act, and a very different situation arose since then.  Could not the Minister view this matter from a detached viewpoint and ask himself the question: &ldquo;What evil could accrue from informing persons who are engaged in proceedings of this kind of the facts on which the Commissioners founded their decision?&rdquo; I cannot imagine any conceivable evil consequences accruing, but I can see the possibility of evil arising through a decision being arrived at on grounds of which the interested party knows nothing.</P>

    <P>In page 16, before Section 37 to <Col N="2690" /> insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Where, on the application of the occupier of a parcel of untenanted land and after notice to all interested parties, the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) are satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that such land is held by the said occupier thereof under a contract of tenancy (other than a fee farm grant, a lease for lives or years renewable for ever, or a lease for a term of 60 or more years) entered into after the 9th day of August, 1923, and before the 14th day of October, 1933, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that such contract of tenancy was not a letting for temporary depasturage, agistment, or conacre or for temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that such land is being worked by such occupier as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it would be in the interests of the country that such land should be sold under the Land Purchase Acts to the said occupier thereof,</P>
    <P>the said lay commissioners may by order declare that the provisions of the Land Act, 1923 (as amended and extended by subsequent enactments, including this Act) relating to tenanted land shall apply to such land.</P>
    <P>(2) Whenever the lay commismissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) make in respect of any land such order as is authorised by the next preceding sub-section of this section, the provisions of the Land Act, 1923 (as amended and extended by subsequent enactments, including this Act) relating to tenanted land shall, subject to such appeal as is hereinafter mentioned and subject to the provisions of this section, apply to such land as if it were tenanted land within the meaning of the Land Act, 1923, as so amended and extended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2691" /> (3) Where, on the application of the owner of a parcel of untenanted land and after notice to all interested parties, the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) are satisfied&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that such land is held by the said owner thereof under a fee farm grant made after the 9th day of August, 1923, and before the 14th day of October, 1933, or under a lease similarly made for lives or years renewable for ever or under a lease similarly made for 60 or more years, and</P>
    <P>(b)  that such owner is in bona fide occupation of such land and uses it in the same manner as an ordinary farmer in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, and</P>
    <P>(c)  that such land is not required for the relief of congestion or for the purpose of resale to the persons or bodies mentioned in Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, as extended by the Land Act, 1933, and</P>
    <P>(d)  that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it would be in the interests of the country that such land should be sold under the Land Purchase Acts to the said owner thereof, and</P>
    <P>(e)  that such owner is willing to purchase such land under the said Acts,</P>
    <P>the said lay commissioners may by order declare that such land shall vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day as if it were tenanted land.</P>
    <P>(4)  Whenever the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) make in respect of any land such order as is authorised by the next preceding sub-section of this section, such land shall vest in the Land Commission on the appointed day as if it were tenanted land within the meaning of the Land Act, 1923, as amended and extended by subsequent enactments and the provisions of Section 44 (except sub-section (1) thereof) of the Land Act, 1931, as amended by Section 42 of the Land Act, 1933, and by this Act shall apply to such land with the modification <Col N="2692" /> that every reference to an application under the said Section 44 shall be construed and have effect as a reference to an application under the said next preceding sub-section of this section.</P>
    <P>(5) Whenever the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) make in respect of any land such order as is authorised by whichever of the preceding sub-sections of this section is applicable to the case, the following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to such land and shall so apply and have effect by way of modification of the statutory provisions applied to such land by such order and the said preceding sub-sections, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 19 of the Land Act, 1923, the words &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; shall be substituted for the words &ldquo;the passing of this Act&rdquo;, and in the said sub-section (2) the reference to the first gale day in the year 1920 shall be construed and have effect as a reference to such gale day prior to the appointed day as will permit three years' arrears and not more than three years' arrears to be compounded under the said Section 19 and the reference to the second gale day in the year 1920 shall be construed and have effect as a reference to the gale day next after such gale day prior to the appointed day as aforesaid;</P>
    <P>(b)  in fixing the standard purchase annuity of such land, the Land Commission shall have regard to the value of such land at the date of the said order but not so as to lessen the amount of such standard purchase annuity on account of a deterioration in value of such land which is, in the opinion of the Land Commission, due to the wilful neglect or default of the applicant for such order;</P>
    <P>(c)  the purchase annuity payable by the purchaser on the sale of such land under the Land Purchase Acts in consequence of the said order shall consist of&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2693" /> (i)  the said standard purchase annuity, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the additional annuity (if any) in respect of compounded arrears of rent added to the purchase money, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  an annuity at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. on the contribution of the State to the standard price of such land, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  an annuity at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. on a sum equivalent to two per cent. of the purchase money of such land;</P>
    <P>(d) the annual sum payable under sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Land Act, 1923, shall be equivalent to the purchase annuity as calculated under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, and the additional sum payable under sub-section (3) of the said Section 28 shall be computed accordingly;</P>
    <P>(e) Part III of the Land Act, 1933, shall not apply or have effect in relation to the said purchase annuity or to the said annual sum or to the said additional sum.</P>
    <P>(6)  Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (4) of Section 9 of the Purchase of Land (Ireland) Act, 1891, or in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) shall not be precluded from making an order under this section in respect of a parcel of untenanted land by reason only of the fact that such parcel is a part of a holding purchased under any Land Purchase Act, but in every such case Section 14 of the Land Act, 1923, as amended by this Act, shall apply and have effect.</P>
    <P>(7) The Land Bond Act, 1934 (No. 11 of 1934), shall apply to land bonds created and issued by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this section in like manner as the said Act applies to land bonds created and issued by the said Minister for the purposes of the Land Act, 1923, or any of the Acts amending or extending that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2694" /> (8) An appeal shall lie to the Appeal Tribunal from every order made by the lay commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) under this section, and the decision of the Appeal Tribunal on any such appeal shall be final subject only to an appeal to the Supreme Court on questions of law.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to admit new tenancies which have been created since the passing of the 1923 Act. Most Deputies know that under the 1923 Act it was stated that after a certain date new tenancies would not be admitted to land purchase.</P>
    <P>Since 1923, however, a number of tenancies have been created on untenanted land and sometimes even on purchased land, and on freehold land as well, and we have decided that from 1923 up to 1933 at least we will admit the new tenants who took land and allow them to purchase out in the same way as tenants who took over a lease prior to 1923.</P>
    <P>This whole section looks rather long, but it is really putting what I said into water-tight legal language.  There are various standard sub-sections that had to go in.  One thing, however, that is different from the normal procedure is that these new tenants will not have the Land Commission annuities halved.  We are giving them a benefit which they never expected and we are giving them a concession which will better their position very greatly indeed.  There are some cases &mdash;one case in particular that I heard of, where the man is paying about £3 an acre and it was an impossible position for a man like that, where his neighbour was paying very much less.  There is one other point of difference, and that is that whereas the State pays an added bonus of 10 per cent. to the landlord, in this case the tenant will give to the State all that has been passed on to the landlord.  The Land Commission will be at no expense beyond our ordinary normal expenses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject matter of the amendment is one of the utmost complexity.  It is to be noticed that the terms of purchase are to be entirely different from those enshrined in all the other Land Acts. It is to be noted that it amounts to a very categorical repeal of part of the 1923 Land Act&mdash;a complete departure from the established law, of which there was no forecast in the draft Bill or in the Bill as amended in Committee.  I do not know what is the position under this amendment of a tenant purchaser under a previous Land Act of this class.  Take the case of the widow of a tenant purchaser under the 1923 Land Act, who has a holding of 30 acres of land and who has two sons still going to the National School.  That widow goes into town to live and lets her holding for a period until such time as her sons will be old enough to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That holding is excluded because it is a letting of temporary convenience or temporary necessity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes, but of course the Minister can see that cases could very easily arise by which a simple person, who had the assurance that land purchased under the 1923 Act could not be made subject to compulsion at the instance of a tenant, might not take all the proper precautions for securing that a letting of temporary convenience would be provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that if he reads the section he will <Col N="2696" /> see that any letting for temporary convenience or temporary necessity is excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, what sort of holding does the Minister contemplate being able to touch by this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary what a number of holdings, since the passing of the 1923 Act, were let out by the owners on a fee farm grant.  They had let the holdings for 60 years, and for various numbers of years.  They had actually become new landlords, and in some of these cases it was the original landlord, who had a certain portion of land attached to his demesne, who created tenancies since 1923, who let them out for a long number of years. This is not intended at all to affect land which was let by the owner for the purpose of temporary convenience or through temporary necessity but it deals with the owner of land who set out to become a landlord, sub-divided his holding, and let it for either 60 years or as a lease for life and so on and so forth.  If there are a certain number of people throughout the country who have taken on very big burdens on themselves indeed, I think it is only right that we should do something to help them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the position is that this is an amendment of the widest possible implications.  If the Minister tells us that the powers in the amendment are requisite to deal with gentlemen who are speculating in land, who are becoming petty landlords through the country, then we are prepared to co-operate with him in drafting legislation effective to deal with that problem. I am amazed that he has not already got such powers as he would require to deal with that problem.  No urgency, however, arises here.  This is not a section to deal with a pressing and urgent evil.  It is rather something that the Minister wants to carry into the machinery of the land law to deal with what he foresees may be a recurring problem.  I object to its being brought before the House in this way and I suggest that the proper course would be to introduce a small amending Bill to deal with these kinds <Col N="2697" /> of cases on our reassembly next November. The Minister probably will not use these powers before next November, and if he would introduce an amending Bill to deal with this particular class of thing, it would facilitate matters in many ways.  If this amendment is incorporated in the Land Act of 1936, you are providing for the purchase of land by tenant purchase in the same Bill on entirely different terms of payment.  Would it not be much better to have a separate Land Act to deal with these exceptional cases, provided that in these exceptional cases the full rent will be applicable and that the reduction terms of the 1933 Land Act would not apply? In any case, however, it would be better if we had some time to consider the safeguards that would be necessary to have introduced in order to prevent this proposal from applying to persons to whom it was never meant to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would read sub-section (1) (b).  Sub-section (1) starts off in this way:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where on the application of the occupier of a parcel of untenanted land and after notice to all interested parties, the Lay Commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) are satisfied: (a) that such land is held under a contract of tenancy....</P>
      <P>and so on.  Then paragraph (b) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That such contract of tenancy was not a letting for temporary depasturage, agistment, or conacre or for temporary convenience or to meet a temporary necessity.</P>
      <P>This section, while it is long, is not difficult to understand.  There are sections in the Bill of only a few lines which are very much more complicated and difficult.  This is straightforward, and if, because of the Deputy's objection that it hangs more with the following section than any other two sections hang together, we were to introduce a new Land Bill for every separate subject dealt with, we would have 46 Bills instead of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is simply an extension of the 1923 Act to cover the cases of tenancies created since that Act.  It is easy to understand, very much more easy to understand than other sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Dillon's attitude to this amendment. I have a case in mind of a tenancy that was created immediately after the passing of the Land Act of 1923.  The people are carrying it on in accordance with the methods of husbandry.  They are <i>bona fide</i> farmers and the rent is in lieu of a lease, and the exclusion of this particular type of holding from the 1923 Act means something in the neighbourhood of £2 an acre.  That is an impossible burden, taking all the circumstances into account.  Is there to be no provision made for the inclusion of these <i>bona fide</i> cases in the amending legislation? Where is the justification for the exclusion of cases of that type? There is none whatever that I can see. Deputy Dillon, with the far-fetched type of case he has mentioned&mdash;I suppose they are very few, if there is one in the country&mdash;would suggest to the Minister the advisability of deferring the inclusion of this section in the Bill, and the infliction thereby of severe hardship on <i>bona fide</i> occupiers of land who are excluded because their tenancies were not created before the Land Act of 1923.  That is one case I have in mind, and there are others I have heard of.  I think this section has all the necessary safeguards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that this section possibly covers such cases as were mentioned by the last Deputy, but there is a possibility that it might inflict a hardship on some individuals. My chief objection, however, is that it is a lengthy section covering practically three pages of the list of amendments, <Col N="2699" /> and it is introduced for the first time on the Report Stage.  Some of us are not as quick on the uptake as the Minister presumes we are, and I for one do not feel competent, after a few minutes of debate on the Report Stage, to appreciate what is or what is not intended by it.</P>

      <P>Even since Friday, and it did not come into my hands on Friday.  I do not think there are many Deputies into whose hands it came on Friday or Saturday.  If the section had been introduced in the Bill originally, we might have had an opportunity of making inquiries as to the number of cases it would cover, and possibly of discovering if there was any particular objection to it.  On Committee Stage there would have been an opportunity of amending it, if necessary, but we are now denied any opportunity of correcting anything wrong that may be discovered in it. This House is the final arbiter in this case.  Hitherto, if this House made a mistake in legislation, there was an opportunity of correcting it, but that opportunity, unfortunately, to my mind, is lost to us now, and once the Bill passes, this will be law.  I think it unfair that advantage should be taken of the Report Stage of a Bill to insert a section of such length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can scarcely agree with the sentiments expressed by the last couple of Deputies.  I think this will be a very useful section, speaking from my own experience.  I know cases of farms that were free of rent being put up for sale since 1923, and in order to get a better price or to attract a customer, a rent was put on them and they were sold with the rent. The 1923 Act did not cover those cases and you could not buy out under a rent created since 1923.  I think this will be a very useful provision.  If we are to have contentment in our country, we must try to give people equal opportunities. Since 1923, there were several cases of land purchases on which a rent was put and there is no hope whatever of relief in those <Col N="2700" /> cases under any of our Acts.  I think the principle is all right, but I would say that when the Minister started on this, he should have gone the whole hog and given them the same as the rest of the tenant purchasers and not put on the 4¾ per cent. on the 2 per cent., as provided in Paragraph (4).</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that this amendment is really too fundamental in character to have been introduced at this stage, and I think that after the discussion we have listened to it becomes apparent. I quite admit to Deputy Gibbons and Deputy Haslett, and I think that Deputy Dillon made it clear, that there is a reason for considering all these cases mentioned by them and by the Minister, but if the section is so important and so desirable, this is not the stage at which to introduce it.  It is really a question of the precedent that we are setting of introducing important amendments of this kind on this stage of a Bill, when there is no possibility of an amendment of them.</P>

      <P>It was not mentioned.  We are asked to discuss this now for the first time.  Is that good for the conduct of the business of the House?  What occurs here may happen in connection with other Bills.  There was an amendment ruled out of order to-day as being fundamental.  I have no doubt it was ruled out on that ground by the Chair. Surely everything that has been said by the Minister and by the Deputies who supported him bear that out. There was no opportunity for properly discussing this.  That is the real objection. Remember what you are doing in this particular case is going to be precedent for other legislation.  As <Col N="2701" /> Deputy Bennett pointed out, we have not now the safeguard of the Seanad. Anything that is introduced into the Bill on the Report Stage remains in it. That is wrong.  Deputy Gibbons stated that this was a very important matter. Deputy Haslett also mentioned a case as an excellent reason why they should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  That is no reason to justify a bad Parliamentary precedent.  May I raise a point of order now to get a ruling as to whether it is fundamental and can be introduced at this stage?</P>

      <P>I think the point of order should have been raised before the matter had been under discussion for a quarter of an hour.  This amendment did however give the Chair some food for thought as to whether it should be allowed or not and I looked up the debate on the Committee Stage.  The amendment seems to apply the procedure under the Land Acts in respect to tenanted land, to land untenanted in 1923 but which has become tenanted since 1923.  To that extent it is relevant and introduces no new principle.  There was a discussion of the matter in Committee and in Volume 63, No. 6, column 2078, the Minister expressed his intention of bringing in an amendment on these lines and stated his reasons. Having considered the matter very carefully I came to the conclusion that this was admissible.</P>

      <P>In face of that ruling I am not proposing to oppose it.  I have not had time to consider it. I apprehend that it may give rise to a series of situations which this House does not anticipate, and which it never meant to legislate for.  If that situation arises, all we can do is to move for amending legislation to remove any anomalies that this unexpected proposal may give rise to. If we do not vote against this amendment, it is not to be taken that we are accepting the principle, but merely that we feel that we have not had sufficient time to give mature consideration to justify active opposition.</P>

      <P>I must say that if the Deputy has not had time to read this amendment, he might have read the next one, which was put down by members of his own Party, designed to do portion of what this one does. There are other sections in the Bill which are very complicated indeed, although consisting only of a few lines.  This is a straightforward amendment.  I indicated clearly what it does.  It does that and nothing more.  I think the only objection that could be put forward is one by new landlords who have leased land since 1923.  They are getting the same portion of the price as any other landlord, but it will certainly be a big relief to a fairly large number of people who entered into these tenancies since 1923 and assumed impossible burdens.  It will be a big benefit to them to have the rents reduced to fair rents, and to purchase out their land rather than to be paying rent for ever.</P>

      <P>(3) The following provisions shall have effect in relation to holdings usually occupied by a person in connection with a parcel of untenanted land which is a demesne, home farm, park, garden, or pleasure ground, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, shall apply to every such holding as from the passing of this Act;</P>
      <P>(b) in the application of Section 19 of the Land Act, 1923, to any such holding, the words &ldquo;the appointed day&rdquo; shall be substituted for the words &ldquo;the passing of this Act&rdquo; where the latter words occur in sub-section (2) and sub-section (3) of the said Section 19, and the reference in the said sub-section (2) to the first gale day in the year 1920 shall be construed and have effect as a reference to such gale day prior to the appointed day as will permit three years' arrears and not more than three years' arrears to be compounded under the said Section 19, and the reference in the said sub-section (2) of the second gale day in the year 1920 shall be construed and have effect as a reference to the gale day next after such gale day prior to the appointed day as aforesaid;</P>
      <P>(c)  in fixing the standard purchase annuity of any such holding, the Land Commission shall have regard to the value of such holding at the passing of this Act but not so as to lessen the amount of such standard purchase annuity on account of a deterioration in value of such holding which is, in the opinion of the Land Commission, due to the wilful neglect or default of the tenant of such holding;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  the purchase annuity payable by the purchaser under the Land <Col N="2707" /> Purchase Acts of any such holding shall consist of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the standard purchase annuity of such holding, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the additional annuity (if any) in respect of compounded arrears of rent added to the purchase money, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  an annuity at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. on the contribution of the State to the standard price of such holding, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  an annuity at the rate of four and three-quarters per cent. on a sum equivalent to two per cent. of the purchase money of such holding;</P>
    <P>(e)  the annual sum payable under sub-section (2) of Section 28 of the Land Act, 1923, shall be equivalent to the purchase annuity as calculated under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section, and the additional sum payable under sub-section (3) of the said Section 28 shall be computed accordingly;</P>
    <P>(f)  Part III of the Land Act, 1933, shall not apply or have effect in relation to the said purchase annuity or to the said annual sum or to the said additional sum;</P>
    <P>(g)  the Land Bond Act, 1934 (No. 11 of 1934), shall apply to land bonds created and issued by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this sub-section in like manner as the said Act applies to land bonds created and issued by the said Minister for the purposes of the Land Act, 1923, or any of the Acts amending or extending that Act.</P>

      <P>In page 19, before Section 40 (4), to insert two new sub-sections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Where sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, would apply to a holding but for the fact that part of such holding is held in fee farm or for lives or years renewable for ever or for a term of years of which sixty or more were unexpired at the passing of the Land Act, 1923, the Lay Commissioners (other than the members of the Appeal Tribunal) may, if having regard to all the circumstances of the case they think it expedient so to do, by order divide such holding into separate holdings and apportion the rent of such holding between such separate holdings and declare the appointed day for any such separate holding to which sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, applies.</P>
      <P>(5) The next preceding sub-section of this section shall not be precluded from applying to a holding by reason only of the rent of such holding being payable partly in respect of the land comprised in such holding and partly in respect of an incorporeal hereditament, and, in any such case any apportionment of such rent under the said next preceding sub-section shall be so made that an apportioned part of such rent is payable partly out of a separate holding (created under the said next preceding sub-section) to which sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Land Act, 1923, does not apply and partly out of such incorporeal hereditament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill, as it stood, we took power to allow portion of a holding to be brought in to the benefit of land purchase. <Col N="2709" /> This amendment is drafted to deal with a peculiar type of holding where portion is subject to a long lease and another portion is subject to a yearly tenancy.  In the Bill, as it stood, we took power to segregate a tenancy from an incorporeal hereditament and we are taking power here to divide a holding that is held under two types of lease into two parts and to admit the part that should come within the land purchase scheme.</P>

      <P>To-day I asked the Minister if he would state the number of cattle export licences issued to producers since the coal-cattle pact, 1936, and the number of similar licences issued to producers during the corresponding period of 1935.  In the next question I asked the Minister to explain the cause of the decrease.  In <Col N="2711" /> Question 19 I asked the Minister whether there was any provision in the coal-cattle pact to issue a specified quota of licences for each month or whether the reciprocity of the pact had reference to the whole year's trading only.  In a further question I asked whether the coal-cattle pact provided for a proper balance of quotas for licences for export of fat cattle, store cattle, dry cows and bulls, or whether the pact provided only for a quota of cattle undenominated against a certain amount of coal of a like value.</P>
      <P>The next question asked whether he was aware of the number of licences issued for County Dublin for August, 1936, as compared with August, 1935. A further question inquired if he was aware that in August, 1935, 722 licences were allotted to County Dublin whereas in August, 1936, only 472 licences were allotted to that county.  He was further asked if he was aware that County Dublin provides a large portion of the market for stores raised in the Midlands, South and West of the Saorstát.  In the next question the Minister was asked if he would state the number of fat cattle licences received from the British Government for each month in the years 1935 and 1936 and the exact numbers allotted to each county for each month of those years.  Deputy Fagan had three other questions, questions of great interest not only to Meath, Westmeath and Kildare, but to the whole agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To all these questions the Minister produced an answer that was nothing short of an insult to the country and to this House.  The Minister began his reply by stating: &ldquo;Question No. 14 by Deputy Charles Fagan and questions Nos. 17-23, inclusive, by Deputy Patrick Belton appear to have been suggested by the recent shortage in the number of fat cattle licences issued to county committees of agriculture.&rdquo; What is it to the Minister what suggested these questions to us? We have a duty to perform here and when we ask certain questions it does not matter to the Minister what suggests them to us.  We ask them to get an answer, not for ourselves, but <Col N="2712" /> for the country which is looking for an answer and it is the Minister's duty to give an answer.  The reply went on: &ldquo;The detailed figures in respect of 1935 and 1936 asked for by the Deputies are not comparable.&rdquo; Why are they not comparable?  The Minister went on: &ldquo;&mdash;the method of distribution having changed in the meantime and, therefore, I think it would be more satisfactory to explain generally that the recent shortage in the number of licences issued has arisen from the fact that a very large number of the licences issued to county committees in the first half of this year had not been used.&rdquo;  How could the fact that the Department of Agriculture ceased to distribute licences and that they handed over the distribution to the county committees of agriculture affect the number of licences?  If they were distributed equitably in the first instance by the first method of distribution and if, afterwards, they were fairly distributed by the second method of distribution, no material difference should arise and there is no reason why the figures for each month should not be comparable.  The Minister knew firsthand from his own Department the number of licences that were distributed in each county when his Department was administering that service. He knew also the number of licences that were distributed to each county committee of agriculture when the second method was adopted, because it is from his Department that the licences are allotted to the county committees of agriculture.</P>
    <P>His reply goes on: &ldquo;In the circumstances it was not considered until now that a substantial increase in the number of licences would be of advantage.&rdquo; I wonder what the Minister was doing?  Was he asleep when it was not considered that an increase in the number would be of advantage until now?  Had the poor unfortunate people who had to leave their homes at 11 or 12 o'clock at night to get their cattle into the Dublin market, to find that there were buyers there but that there were no licences which would enable them to buy cattle for export, to suffer that disappointment and to <Col N="2713" /> go to the Minister or his officials before, as he stated in the question, it was considered that a substantial increase in the number of licences would be of advantage.  Was he not aware as Minister for Agriculture that fat beef was reaching its peak and that the maximum number of licences were required for the month of August?  Did he not learn that lesson until people were disappointed in their market?  What idea of his responsibility as Minister has he?  Was he not aware that there was a shortage in the number of licences?  When I heard of the matter&mdash;and I did not hear it from the committee of agriculture&mdash;I 'phoned the committee of agriculture and I found that the number of licences they had received from the Ministry was 472 for the month while last year the number distributed was 722.  We know all the &ldquo;blowing&rdquo; there was here at the beginning of this year about the coal-cattle pact and about the unlimited market the Government had obtained for us in Great Britain through their negotiations. We could not get from the President any information then as to who signed that agreement or, if it were signed, we could not get any of the points of agreement or the basis of trading from the President.  The Minister has refused again to-day to answer the questions which I put to him beyond giving the nonsensical reply which I have quoted.</P>
    <P>It would have appeared to any ordinary person that something was wrong when our share of licences in County Dublin fell nearly 40 per cent. for this month as compared with last year.  It is the duty of the Minister's Department to send the licences to the county committees of agriculture.  When he got his bundle of licences from the British Government for the month, was that not the time for him to move?  I want to know from him to-night what was the number of licences he got for August.  I asked a question for that purpose but he has not answered it. When I got the figures from the county committee of agriculture, I 'phoned the Department of Agriculture and I told the official to whom I spoke there that I would raise a question in the Dáil on this matter.  I did not want <Col N="2714" /> him to give an answer which might lead him to believe afterwards that I had set a trap for him.  He said it was all right.  I asked him: &ldquo;Why are you down by 40 per cent. in the number of our licences this month?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Because the number of licences we got from the British Government for this month was down by 40 per cent. as compared with last year.&rdquo;  The Minister in his reply said: &ldquo;In the circumstances it was not considered until now that a substantial increase in the number of licences would be of advantage.&rdquo; He did not know that it would be of advantage to have enough, or nearly enough, licences to meet the trade for the month of August! If he did not know that it would be of advantage, I know, and the country knows, that he is not fit for his job. He goes on to say further: &ldquo;I may say, however, that the question of increasing the number of licences for the remainder of the year is under consideration at the moment and it is expected that satisfactory arrangements in that connection will be made.&rdquo; Under consideration by whom?  The Minister did not answer the question to-day.  I anticipated every side wave he was taking in answering my main question, and that is why I put down seven of them.  The Minister, knowing of no way out, did not answer any of them.</P>
    <P>Let us come down to business.  There is only one source to consider in the giving of these licences.  The Minister is only an intermediary between the county committees and the cattle producers. He is at best only an intermediary between the British Government and the cattle producers.  The British Government calls the tune every time.  What is the coal-cattle pact and what is it worth?  Our total consumption of coal in 1934 was worth £2,239,724.  Of this Germany sold us £496,000 worth; Poland £743,000, and England approximately £1,000,000.  In the years 1935 and 1936 England was given nearly all our coal trade.  In 1934 we exported in money value £1,407,571 worth of fat cattle.  The number of cat cattle that year totalled 126,759.  In 1935 we exported 161,138 fat cattle, worth £1,736,000.  In <Col N="2715" /> 1935 we imported £2,461,000 worth of coal.  The money value of the coal we imported last year from Great Britain is £700,000 greater than the value of the fat cattle we exported to Britain. If the coal-cattle pact had increased our market for fat cattle in Great Britain in 1935 we should be getting £700,000 more for our cattle from Great Britain than in 1934.  What relation has the coal-cattle pact at all to our exports of cattle?  Has it any, apart from store cattle?  If we include store cattle the value of the cattle exports in 1935 would be £5,500,000.  Has that figure any relation to the amount of coal we bought from Britain?  This year we expected to have an increase in the value of our cattle exports.</P>
    <P>If there had been any business brains or business intelligence shown in arranging this coal-cattle pact, the Minister for Agriculture should be there and have his figures as to the quota of licences for those months in which we have fat cattle to export.  He should get from Great Britain that number in order to be able to cope with our requirements in the way of fat cattle exports.  If, as was suggested here to-day, licences in excess of our requirements were sent here in the earlier months of the year when we did not require to export so many cattle&mdash; when, in fact, we had not the cattle to export&mdash;may I ask what was the Minister for Agriculture doing?  What is the use of getting licences to export fat beasts in the months when we have not these fat beasts ready?  What is the use at all of the coal-cattle pact if licences are going to be given for the month in which we have not the fat cattle to export?  Why did the Minister allow that sort of thing when he knew that these licences were counted against us and cancelled afterwards?  I do not, however, believe that that is what has happened.</P>
    <P>My view of the whole position is that the Minister for Agriculture has as much to do with the arranging of those licences and the export trade in fat cattle as I have.  The British Government controlling those licences give as many as they wish when they wish. We are only a beggar at the table of the British Government.  We all know <Col N="2716" /> the basis of the coal-cattle pact.  It was merely that Britain wanted to get the £5,000,000 a year out of this country, and she decided on taking more of our cattle against her coal. It was a case of spreading that £5,000,000 a year in taxes over a greater number of cattle, and consequently a lesser tax on each beast was necessary.  Are we to continue to be treated to the insults and to the brazen effrontery of Ministers getting up here in this House and at meetings throughout the country and saying &ldquo;we will never surrender these annuities,&rdquo; after Ministers have agreed in this coal-cattle pact to pay these annuities in full to the British?</P>

      <P>It is the British Government that decides how many fat cattle we are to export and what we are to be paid for these cattle.  Why does the Minister not take this House into his confidence and let us know the facts?  These questions were put down deliberately by me in order to get this information for the House and for the country, and if direct answers had been given to them there would be no need for us to be here now.  If we had got straight answers to them we would know exactly where we are.  The Minister, and particularly the President, asks for national solidarity and co-operation in this fight with the British Government.  But when we ask for the information here which we are entitled to get, we are refused that information.  Will the Minister, when replying now, inform the House if his representations to the British Government are considered by them when issuing the quota licences for each month?  What increase in the number of licences was anticipated when the coal-cattle pact was agreed <Col N="2717" /> to?  How is it that there has been such an abnormal decrease in the numbers of the licences in the months when they were required?  If the matter is under consideration now, who is considering it?  Is there anybody in this country considering it? Or does it matter a <i>tranin</i> whether there is anybody in this country considering it?  Are we at the absolute mercy of the British Government to say how many cattle they will take from us, what price they will pay for them, and when they will take them? Was there ever a people more slaves to another people than are the agricultural community and the whole Irish nation slaves to the British Government to-day?</P>

      <P>Briefly, but truthfully and comprehensively, so that it can be understood.  I did not raise the question to give the Minister a further opportunity for evasion but that he might give the country information and explain why in the height of the grass beef season, fewer licences are obtainable for the export of fat cattle to Great Britain than last year when we had not such a comprehensive coal-cattle pact as we are told we have this year.  I give the Minister an opportunity now of informing the country why the arrangement has broken down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not satisfied with the answer to my question to-day.  I want to know why in August, 1935, 1,513 cattle licences were issued in Westmeath and in August, 1936, only 948.  The people were led to believe that owing to the coal-cattle pact there would be more licences going about, that they would be wastepaper even.  In fact, owing to the methods of distribution, in May and June licences were going about like waste paper.  After listening to the answers to-day I think that is the fault of the Minister's Department. They should know that in May and June fat cattle are not to be had here. He says they did not know it in time. They should know that from the second week in July there was an acute shortage of licences in the Dublin Cattle Market.  That was known all over the country.  From the second week in July licences went up from 2/6 to 10/- and 15/-, until now they have reached the price of 30/-.  It is a question of getting them at any money if you want to send cattle to England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask if it would be possible for those unused licences which are going about to be made available for this month as it would <Col N="2719" /> help a lot of people; or if it would be possible to make a second distribution of licences during this month, because if we had to wait until September there will be a terrible shortage.  No cattle can be shipped except for the number of licences given out, and licences will go to a very high figure.  When arranging for the month's licences in future the Minister should also remember that there are practically no cattle now going across the Border.  That is, I think, one of the principal causes of the shortage of licences.  Cattle have got much dearer and there is a bigger risk in bringing them across the Border.  The Minister should remember that and distribute the licences earlier.  I should like to get a more satisfactory answer to the question I asked to-day.  I asked why we are getting fewer licences in August, 1936, than in August, 1935, and why he says they are not available because, as far as I know, the method of distribution in Westmeath is the same this year as last year.  Last year they were given out by the county committee of agriculture also and there is no difference this year in the method of distribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to answer in five minutes questions which took 25 minutes to put.  Licences are distributed monthly.  That is to say, by agreement between the two Governments the allocations are made monthly rather than yearly.  There is a certain number for fat cattle, a certain number for stores and a certain number for bulls and dry cows based on the figures of export during 1933 and afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not want to hear the answer; he wants to make a political speech.  We exported 40,000 more store cattle this year than last year, and 20,000 less fat cattle.  The <Col N="2720" /> methods of distribution are not comparable. Up to this period last year the licences were given out by the Department direct to the producers. After inspection of the applications received the licences were distributed in proportion to the number available. Now they are distributed between the counties on the cattle census of the last three or four years, so that it is quite possible that a county might have got more last year than this year, as the method of distribution is slightly different.  However, that does not explain the whole thing.  I am following the question along, as Deputy Belton said I tried to evade the question asked.  I said an increase would not have been advantageous up to now, because it is plain that we had got something more than last year.  But we exported practically 20,000 less fat cattle than last year, so that it is obvious we were asking for too many all the time.  There are something over 21,000 licences unused since 1st January.</P>
      <P>It is easy for Deputy Belton or anyone else to say that we are not fit for the responsibility, because we did not know the proper numbers.  Deputy Belton, or even a person with less in telligence, would know afterwards that a person had made a mistake.  But I should like Deputy Belton to test his superior intelligence on this matter now by giving me an idea of the number we will want during each month for the rest of the year.  Then I can see afterwards whether he was right or not, and perhaps I can talk about his want of intelligence when the year is over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, we have asked for advice from the cattle trade on the matter.  We have asked the consultative council for advice on the matter.  After consultation with them we asked for too many up to this, as the Deputy sees.  If it gives Deputy Belton any satisfaction to refer to the Government as mere intermediaries for the British Government, let him have that satisfaction.  If the Deputy wants to talk about the slave mind it is easy to see where that should be applied. That shows the reverence and respect for the power and influence of the British Government in this country which he always had and always will have, I suppose.  Deputy Fagan asked if the unused licences could be used now.  They cannot.  Licences issued for one month should be used that month or the following month, but cannot be used in any subsequent month.  The Deputy also asked whether there could be a second distribution of licences this month.  There probably can be.  We were in the position a week or two ago of having too many licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this matter of the insufficiency of licences was raised, we indicated to the British Government that we had not got enough and they agreed to give us more.  I am not sure whether they will arrive before the end of this month or not, but I think some of them will.  If I could be told by a Deputy the approximate number that we will want in September to suit the trade of the country I have no great doubt but that we could get that number of licences, because under the coal-cattle pact we are entitled to a certain number for store cattle, a certain number for fat cattle and a certain number for cows and bulls, and, according to our imports of coal, they would amount to a substantial increase on the number that we got last year.  As I have said, we have already exported 40,000 more stores than last year. That number may be more than the number that we were entitled to export based on our orders for coal, but as against that our exports of <Col N="2722" /> fat cattle were 20,000 less than the number we were entitled to export.</P>

It is not a case of making representations. It is a case of presenting the facts to them, and saying that we are still entitled to export cattle up to a certain value.  The fact that we have not exported cattle to the number that we are entitled to export them will entitle us to say <Col N="2723" /> that we can export more cattle up to the end of the year so as to make up the total number in value that we are entitled to export.

      <P>On the 9th September, 1934, a communication was received from Mr. Logan setting out particulars of his case and inquiring as to compensation. He was informed on the 26th October, 1934, that the latest date for making application under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, was the 9th December, 1933, and that in consequence his application could not be considered.</P>
      <P>Mr. Logan was afforded an opportunity of having his case dealt with under the Army Pensions Act, 1923, a prescribed form of application having been sent to him on the 1st April, 1924, and on the 20th June, 1924.  Neither form was returned by Mr. Logan to my Department.</P>
