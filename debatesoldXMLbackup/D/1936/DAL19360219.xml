    <P>The average rates of payment made to widows not including children's allowances cannot be determined. When a widow's (non-contributory) pension includes children's allowances it is not possible owing to the operation of the means test to indicate separately what amount is payable in respect of the widow and what amount is payable in respect of the children.  If the widow or any of the children is possessed of means in excess of an amount prescribed in the Act, the amount of such means is deducted from the maximum pension (including children's allowances), which would be payable if there were no means.  In the reduced pension so payable, the amount appropriate to the widow or to the children respecttively cannot be distinguished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that allowances made to widows by non-contributory benevolent and other institutions are taken into consideration and reckoned as means under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, and that the pensions awarded in the case of such applicants are reduced accordingly, and if he will take steps to exempt allowances from such sources from being assessed as means under the Act.</P>

      <P>I am aware that allowances made to widows by benevolent and other similar institutions are taken into consideration and reckoned as means in making awards to claimants for non-contributory pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making an award a deciding <Col N="779" /> officer is bound, by the provisions of the Act, to take into consideration, when assessing a claimant's means, income derived from the sources referred to, and I have no power to exempt allowances from such sources from being assessed as means under the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that where the amount of the pension granted is 3/- or 4/- or 5/- a week, and where the pensioner was in receipt of home assistance from the county board of health, the boards of health have stopped payment of relief to the the widows, so that in reality they are worse off.  Will the Minister take steps to deal with that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard of some cases where boards of assistance have acted in that way, and we have communicated with those boards by circular letter pointing out what their powers are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that, but I am aware, at least, of one board which did not act on the Minister's instructions.  Will the Minister take steps to enforce these powers?</P>

      <P>Representations have been made to me regarding the development of the sulphur, copper and ochre mines in the Avoca district, and I am informed that there are considerable deposits of minerals in the area, some of which were extensively worked in the past.  I understand the ownership of the deposits to be in private hands, but the fact that they are not being worked at present may be attributable to price and other economic factors.  The development of mineral resources generally is a matter primarily for private enterprise and I am not prepared under present circumstances to undertake the acquisition and exploitation on behalf of the State of the mines referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that on February 12th, 1936, Messrs.  Ranks (Ireland), Limited, posted one week's notice of their intention to close down the City Roller Mill at Roche's Street, Limerick, and <Col N="789" /> to dispense with the services of the large staff of workers employed at the mill; whether the firm in question furnished to his Department any reason for closing this mill and dismissing their employees, and, if not, whether it is his intention to ask for their observations on the matter; whether the quota allowed to this firm was reduced recently, and, if so, for what reason, and, further, whether he is prepared to take steps to ensure that the workers concerned will not suffer loss of their employment.</P>

      <P>My Department was advised under date of the 12th instant that Ranks (Ireland), Limited, would find it necessary to close down one of their mills at Limerick for a week at least and possibly longer.  The reason given for the temporary closing of this mill was that the Limerick mills were overstocked with flour.  The quotas of wheat allotted to this firm have not been altered since they were first allocated.</P>

The only information in my Department in <Col N="790" /> regard to the average price of coal realised by British collieries relates to the quarterly (and not the monthly) price of coal disposable commercially, and is published in the United Kingdom Mines Department Statistical Summary.  In the first three quarters of 1935 the average prices per ton at the colliery of coal disposable commercially were as follows:&mdash;Quarter ended 31st March, 1935, 13s. 6.40d.; quarter ended 30th June, 1935, 13s. 2.85d.; quarter ended 30th September, 1935, 13s. 1.99d.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of persons with claims to unemployment assistance current at the Kilkenny Employment Exchange who were summoned during the last three months to appear before courts of referees for the purpose of having their title to benefit investigated; the circumstances in which such investigation was ordered, the principle on which particular cases were selected for investigation, the facts inquired into and the number of cases in which claims were disallowed by the referees; whether he will state if the decision of the court of referees has been accepted in all cases, and, if not, whether he will state the number of cases in which their decisions were reversed to the disadvantage of the claimant, and if he will state further whether it is customary to suspend payment of benefit during the period covered by the investigation referred to, and, if so, the average duration of the suspension.</P>

      <P>During the period from 13th November, 1935, to the 10th February, 1936, the applications for unemployment assistance lodged at Kilkenny Employment Exchange by 128 applicants were referred to the Court of Referees.  In 43 of these the Court of Referees recommended that unemployment assistance be refused. The unemployment assistance officer has not disagreed with the recommendations made by the Court in any of the 128 cases, but some of them are still under consideration.  The unemployment assistance officer, not being satisfied that the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance were fulfilled by the applicants in question, was obliged before making payments either himself to determine the questions that arose or to refer the cases to the Court of Referees for its recommendations in accordance with the provision made in the Unemployment Assistance Acts for determining such questions.  These were the circumstances in which and the principle on which the cases in question were referred to the Court.  The Court, presumably, inquired into all the facts <Col N="792" /> which appeared to it to be relevant to the points at issue.  With reference to the last part of the question, the position is that when a question arises as to whether the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment assistance are fulfilled or not, no payment of assistance can be made until the question has been properly determined. The length of time it takes to reach a decision depends on the nature of the particular case and the readiness, or otherwise, with which the necessary information can be obtained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of men for employment on works financed wholly or partly from Central Funds is based on the principle that, when there is not sufficient employment for all the unemployed, such work as is available should, as far as possible, be given to those who being physically fit and qualified to perform the work are relatively in the greatest need of it. In pursuance of this principle, preference for such employment is given to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance, regard being had to the scales of unemployment assistance payable to them, men in receipt of the highest scales being submitted first and so on down.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this method secures the most equitable distribution of the work and I cannot see my way to cause any alteration to be made in the procedure.</P>

There has been a continuous decline since 1928 coinciding with a general shrinkage in the quantity and value of eggs imported into the United Kingdom from all sources.  The drop in the export of eggs from this country to the United Kingdom in 1935, as compared with 1934, has been offset to a large extent by an increase in exports to other countries.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The provisions of this Bill are intended to implement the financial provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts of 1932 and 1934 by making available a further sum of £700,000 for the payment of grants to <Col N="807" /> private persons and public utility societies in respect of the erection of new and reconstructed houses completed before the 31st March, 1937.  In initiating the Government's housing policy in 1932 it was clear that a very heavy housing programme would have to be carried out by local authorities for the better housing of the working classes, and it was then deemed necessary to encourage to the fullest extent possible the building of houses by private persons, public utility societies and philanthropic societies, and also the reconstruction where necessary of existing houses.  The Act of 1932 authorised a sum of £700,000 to be provided in respect of houses erected or reconstructed before the 1st April, 1935, while the Act of 1934 increased that amount to £1,400,000, at the same time extending the date of completion to the 31st March, 1937.  Up to the 31st December last a sum of £303,898 had been paid in grants in respect of 5,344 houses completed in urban areas, £434,818 in respect of 6,786 houses completed in rural areas, and £176,354 in respect of 4,538 houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers.  There have, therefore, been provided within the space of three and a half years, from the middle of 1932 to the 31st December, 1935, 12,130 new houses and 4,538 reconstructed dwellings. Within the same period 16,308 houses were provided by local authorities.</P>

    <P>It is a matter of some significance that the larger proportion of the grants for houses built by private persons, public utility societies and philanthropic societies has been paid in respect of new houses erected in rural areas.  An examination of the position shows that building has taken place at a greater rate in the counties where, according to the Census of 1926, bad housing conditions prevailed.  This is particularly the case in the Counties of Mayo, Kerry and Galway, which in the order of bad housing conditions ranked first, third and fourth.  Placed in the order of new houses built up to December, 1935, these counties rank respectively first, fourth and fifth.  At the other end of the table the counties with the best housing conditions in <Col N="808" /> 1926 were Wexford, Waterford, Tipperary and Cork, and these counties placed in the order of new houses built up to December, 1935, rank 14th, 25th, 23rd and third on the list.  In the urban areas a very large proportion of the amount provided for grants has been payable in respect of houses erected in the City of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  The position is being carefully examined, and at present I may say that the evidence available indicates that there is not the same need for a continuance of grants in urban centres that exists in the rural areas.  Of the 6,786 houses built in rural areas, 1,025 are for agricultural labourers, 3,204 for farmers, and 2,557 for other persons.  In addition, 4,538 houses have been reconstructed, of which 455 are for agricultural labourers and 4,083 for small farmers.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, grants to the amount of £176,354 have been paid in respect of houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers.  The nature of reconstruction work done varied with local conditions. For instance, in West Cork and South Kerry areas almost all the houses which are in process of reconstruction are old masonry-built structures roofed with local slate.  The windows of these houses were invariably very small; the height of upper rooms in many instances inadequate and unceiled, and timber work throughout rough and worn with long and hard wear.  It has been found in practice that where the existing house is sound externally farmers in these areas prefer to spend money in the reconstruction and improvement of the existing dwelling than to build a modern new house.  In cases where the upper storey is very low the walls are raised.  The upper rooms are ceiled and properly partitioned, and in reroofing the existing slates are invariably re-used.  Concrete floors are substituted for earthen floors, and timber work renewed as required.  In some areas thatch roofs, which necessarily require attention frequently, are being removed and replaced with either native slates or concrete tiles of Saorstát manufacture with the assistance of the reconstruction grant.  The <Col N="809" /> low, unsightly and unhealthy corrugated iron structures which hitherto were to be seen in some of our rural areas are also disappearing and are being replaced by well-ventilated rooms of adequate height with slated or tiled roofs.  Many instances have also been found where it has been found more economical to adapt existing solidly-constructed buildings which had hitherto been used as stores or out-offices into modern two-storey dwellings rather than to reconstruct the former dwelling-house.  The inspection of the completed work in the different areas has shown that living conditions have been very considerably improved by the aid of these grants, and it is noteworthy that the standard of cleanliness of the newly reconstructed houses has also risen.  The average cost of the reconstruction work carried out by applicants is approximately £60.</P>
    <P>There has been very little demand for grants by public utility societies for the erection of houses for letting in urban areas at rents approved by the Minister.  Only four societies have in hands the erection of 160 houses, of which 36 have been completed to date.</P>
    <P>The provision enabling grants to be paid to local authorities and philanthropic societies for the renovation of tenements has not been availed of to the extent anticipated.  The number of philanthropic societies which have undertaken this work is two, and the number of tenements renovated is 22. So far as can be judged at present, work of this nature will in the main have to be undertaken by local authorities themselves.</P>
    <P>Saorstát materials and appliances are being used increasingly in the erection and reconstruction of houses for which grants are being paid under the Acts.  The payment of grants is conditional on the use of Saorstát materials as far as possible, and the failure to comply with this condition leads to a substantial reduction or in some cases to forfeiture of the entire grant.  A list of Saorstát manufacturers of house-building materials and appliances has been compiled by the Department, and there is no longer any reasonable cause for failure on the part of builders to use Saorstát <Col N="810" /> materials.  The percentage of Saorstát materials used in house-building in 1932 was, it was estimated, 30 per cent. of the whole.  This had increased in 1934 to 45 per cent., and to-day it is 53 per cent. approximately.</P>
    <P>The present Bill does not propose to extend the period for completion of houses, and to qualify for grants all houses must be completed by the 31st March, 1937.  It is estimated that by that date 22,000 new houses will have been erected and 18,000 houses reconstructed since 1932 with the aid of grants.  Our main responsibility in regard to housing in the future must be directed towards speeding up the working of slum clearance and the eradication of unhealthy dwellings.  Most of the local bodies have a good record in this respect.  The measure of Government assistance for these bodies provided under the Act of 1932 is on a generous basis and as their schemes progress the liabilities of the Exchequer increase.  When the further amount for private building to be provided by the present Bill is allocated it is intended to review the question of making grants to private persons and public utility societies.  I am satisfied that in urban areas assistance can be withdrawn or at any rate considerably modified as regards the size of houses which should qualify for subsidy without lessening the extent of building which is at present being undertaken in urban areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that a certain amount of building that he hoped to get done by public utility societies is not being done, and that, therefore, increased responsibility will fall on rural housing authorities for the building of even more houses than he anticipated in his scheme.  He indicated that as the housing programme has gone on, the financial burden has become greater and greater. The Minister gave us no indication of what the burden is up to the present and what the rate of increase in the burden is likely to be.  I think it important to look at that aspect of the situation just for a moment, particularly because while huge amounts are being spent to-day and enormous sums <Col N="811" /> are being allocated for housing, the unemployment in the building trade was never apparently greater than now. The last figures for which I have detailed information&mdash;if we except whatever information Deputy Pattison may have got in reply to his question to-day&mdash;is for the quarter ended October last.  These figures were made available in the beginning of this month.  The situation disclosed in these statistics shows not only a very considerable amount of unemployment but an increased amount if we take some quarters running back to 1930.  I find that the number of persons on the live register in respect of the building industry in the beginning of October, 1930, was 1,747, in the same time, 1931, the number was 2,264; 1932 it was 4,396; 1933 the figure was 3,066; in 1934 it was 5,467; and in 1935 it reached 6,308.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister may say there is a difference in the type of registration and, therefore, in the amount of registration when we take 1930 and 1931 and compare them with 1934 and 1935, he can hardly say that the same circumstances in the matter of registration did not exist in October, 1933, October, 1934 and October, 1935.  In October, 1933, the number on the register was 3,066, while in October, 1934, it was 5,467 and in 1935 it went to 6,308. While that increase is disclosed in the building industry a huge amount of money is being spent out of grants, indeed a much larger amount, and it is spent in such a way as not only to put a very high debt on the State but also to put a very large debt on the local authorities.  On the 11th April last the Minister gave figures showing the number of houses that had been actually built under the 1922 to 1931 Housing Acts and he quoted figures to show that 23,440 houses had been built with an expenditure in grants of £1,529,416.  Of that sum two-thirds went to private persons and one-third to local authorities; for that expenditure we have 23,440 houses erected.  The Minister to-day, in reply to a question, gave the number of houses completed on the 31st December last.  The figures he gave were 12,130 houses by <Col N="812" /> private persons and public utility societies in urban and rural districts. The State grants for these amounted to £1,042,614.  That is to say, that sum was paid in respect of the building of these houses.  According to the Minister, 16,001 houses were completed by the local authorities up to 31st December last and these were entitled to grants under the 1932 to 1934 Acts.  In respect of these 16,001 houses the State has incurred a debt of £3,039,465.  So that in respect of houses built under the 1932 to 1934 Acts there has been incurred by the State, including grants, an amount of £4,082,079.  During the same period the local authorities have also incurred an amount of debt about which we have no information.  It is unascertainable.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to tell us something about it.  The position in the country is that there is increasing unemployment in the building industry, and the House would be interested to hear from the Minister what comments he has to make on it, and how the unemployment in the building industry can be explained at a time when all this expenditure is going on.  This is not the occasion upon which to discuss certain aspects of house building by the local authorities, but I think that the board matter of general expenditure on the housing programme at the present time does deserve some comment at this stage.</P>

      <P>There are a few points which I should like to make with regard to the Bill before the House. The Minister gave us certain figures with regard to houses that are apparently complete, but I do not think we can gather from that that the grants have been paid in all those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are completed the grants have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear the Minister say that.  If grants have been paid within a reasonable time on all houses completed I am very glad to hear it, because I had complaints last year from two providers in Roscommon, which disclosed a scandalous state of affairs as far as the payment of grants was concerned.  From the <Col N="813" /> figures which I got from those two providers it was evident that it was not the Government but the local providers who were building the houses. Accounts were shown to me in cases where houses had been finished and the people had been living in them for two and a half years but the grants had not yet been paid.  One of those providers furnished me with a bill which disclosed that an amount of over £900 was outstanding in his case alone.  I am sure that the Minister or the Local Government Department does not desire that such a state of affairs should exist, and my purpose in drawing attention to it is in order that it should be remedied.  With regard to those providers, I should like to know from the Minister what protection or security they have with regard to the supplying of material to applicants for the grant.  Take the case of a man who applied for a grant to the Local Government Department, through a utility society, and got his certificate of approval.  On that certificate of approval certain building providers in Roscommon advanced all the materials for the house.  When the house was built, the applicant let the house and went to America.  What remedy has the provider in that case?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly not.  I wonder if the local providers did not accept that security how many houses would be built in the country?  It is on that basis they are working.  What is that man's remedy?  Take the case of another provider; again, he gave the material on the security of the approval certificate of the Local <Col N="814" /> Government Department.  The contractor apparently did not finish his work satisfactorily; the inspector will not pass it; nobody has any money; the man is living in the house.  What is that provider's remedy?  There ought to be some statutory protection for those people if they are supposed to give material on the security of an approval certificate from the Local Government Department.  There ought to be somebody whom they can follow, and from whom they can recover their money.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, and that is, the limit of 1,250 square feet.  The original intention, I understand when that was put into the Act and into the previous Act was to prevent people of means, who are well able to build houses for themselves, from building a large house and getting a Government grant for that house.  The number of square feet was limited to 1,250.  That has not prevented anybody from taking advantage of the grant, and I am sure the Minister knows that.  It has not saved one halfpenny to the Exchequer.  What is happening is that people with plenty of means build a house of 1,250 square feet, and when it has been inspected and the grant paid they add to the house.  The result is that you have a badly laid out house.  In many cases you have a house which is a kind of eyesore.  It is really a question as to whether, after all, 1,250 square feet is ample accommodation for a man and his wife and nine or ten children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the rural districts.  They have nothing to do with it.  The Deputy is wrongly informed. The position is that the restriction of 1,250 square feet is responsible for the erection of houses which are to a certain extent a kind of eyesore, and it is not saving the Exchequer or the country one penny.  Any man who <Col N="815" /> wants to take advantage of the grant takes advantage of it by building a smaller house first, and adding to it later on.  I would urge upon the Minister the necessity for considering those two matters.  The provider really has no security, and in many cases is out of his money for years.  My attention was first drawn to the matter in the case of a certain poor man, a small farmer, who got a certificate of approval through a utility society, and went to a provider, who refused to supply the material.  I went to the provider and wanted to know why that had been done.  He showed me his books, and an extraordinary state of affairs was disclosed.  I think that some of those grants have since been paid, but I know that there are outstanding, in the vicinity of Roscommon town, grants which should have been paid for houses in which people have been living for over two years.  That is a state of affairs which should not be allowed to exist.  I am sure the Minister for Local Government and his Department are most anxious to right that matter, and consequently I have drawn their attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which I should like to raise on this Bill &mdash;matters which are germane to any discussion of the housing problem.  The first is the question of the construction of labourers' cottages, particularly in rural areas.  I think most Deputies in the House who have taken an interest in that problem are familiar with the position created by the action of persons describing themselves as builders, who tender for the erection of a small number of labourers' cottages, and secure a contract, on the basis that they are builders.  Having secured the contract, the local authority finds very considerable difficulty in getting those self-styled contractors to proceed with the work, and still greater difficulty in inducing those contractors to finish the work of erecting the houses.  Cases have come to my notice in the County Kildare, where persons were allowed to secure contracts from the Board of Health for the erection of labourers' cottages.  The contracts were duly signed and sealed; the sites were laid <Col N="816" /> out by the engineer; the contractor was instructed to proceed with the erection of the cottages, and was allowed a period of 26 weeks in which to complete them.  In many cases the 26 weeks had entirely passed, and the contractor had not even laid the foundations in respect of the cottages which he was supposed to have completed within the 26 weeks. If there is any value at all in putting an obligation on a contractor to finish a house within 26 weeks, he should be obliged to adhere to the bond which he enters into.  He enters into that bond under a penalty which would enable the local authority to complete the house and send him the bill to meet the cost of doing so.  But the local authority never do anything in the matter of compelling a contractor to comply with the terms of his contract, and unless some member of the board of health or some Deputy is sufficiently interested in the matter, the question of whether the erection of the house is started or not depends entirely on the contractor.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister's officials could tell him of cases which I have been compelled to bring to their notice from time to time, and I suppose I ought to make this acknowledgment: that whenever I have brought such matters to the attention of the housing section of the Minister's Department steps were speedily taken to compel the board of health to insist on contractors starting work on their contracts. But it is an unfortunate and an extremely regrettable state of affairs that it should be necessary, either for a Deputy or a member of the board of health, to insist, through the Minister's Department, in seeing that a contractor will honour the obligation he has freely entered into with a local authority.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister's Department will give special attention to that problem in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is unsatisfactory that persons who are not really house builders should essay the task of building houses.  I do not think that they build a satisfactory house, but they are paid for it as if they did. At a time when inspectors are deluged <Col N="817" /> with work: trying to inspect this house and that and to certify for this reconstruction grant and that, there is a tendency, because of the pressure of work, to overlook defects which if neglected at the outset may become very serious afterwards.  I do not want at this stage to make any reference to the Castlebar houses or anything like that, but the fact remains that in a deluge of work inspectors may overlook defects in houses, not through any culpable negligence on their part, but because of the fact that under pressure of work defects which would be regarded normally as serious cannot possibly be observed in an endeavour by inspectors to deal with the huge amount of work which must necessarily devolve upon them when the State is building houses at a rate ten times greater than in previous years.  I suggest that it is especially necessary for the Minister's Department to ensure that those who tender for the erection of houses are, in fact house builders, and that their tenders for the erection of houses should only be accepted if there is definite evidence that they are, in fact, genuine house builders.</P>
    <P>I find that the bulk of the defects, in the matter of the low rates of wages which are being paid, in the defective condition of the houses which are erected, in the reluctance to start work on the contracts and the greater reluctance still to complete contracts, arises because of the fact that persons who are not builders by vocation tender for this work and secure contracts.  They simply go into it more with the object of getting money out of it than of satisfying the needs of erecting decent houses which will stand the test of time.  I would be glad if the Minister's Department would issue some special instructions to boards of health impressing on them that, as far as it is humanly possibly to do so, they should eliminate that type of person who is getting into the building trade, not for the benefit of the trade but for himself: the type of person who is not any great acquisition to the building trade and not <Col N="818" /> a very successful provider of shelter for working-class folk throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that the Minister's Department should insist on boards of health performing the simple duty of compelling a contractor to adhere to the terms of his contract.  It would be unreasonable, I suppose, if a board of health which offered to pay £220 for the erection of a labourer's cottage were subsequently to say that it could afford only to give the contractor £200.  The contractor, naturally would say that the board signed a contract to pay him £220 for the erection of the cottage and would demand payment of that sum and yet this same contractor will sign a contract to complete the erection of a house in 26 weeks, and very often 36 weeks will have elapsed before he makes a start, and then only when the Minister's Department gets the board of health to insist on his doing so under threat of cancelling the contract. I do not deny that there are considerable difficulties in the way of the Department in a matter of this kind, especially when houses are being built at the present rate, but these difficulties I think might be minimised considerably if the onus were put on the secretaries to boards of health of insisting that the terms of contracts freely entered into should be honoured by contractors, and that, if not, the penalty clauses in the contract should become operative in the case of a contractor who deliberately, and for reasons of his own choosing, ignored the terms of his contract.</P>
    <P>I had occasion recently to endeavour to induce the Minister's Department to sanction a scheme for the erection of houses by direct labour as an experiment with a view to testing the quality of the work done, the cost of the work, and with the view generally of comparing the work in that way with the work that is being done by private contractors.  After some considerable cogitation the Department ultimately sanctioned the erection of about half-a-dozen houses of this kind by direct labour.  From my experience of the work that is at present being done on <Col N="819" /> the houses, I think the Department will not have any reason to regret the decision it arrived at in that matter. At a time when there is, apparently, a scarcity of contractors&mdash;contractors who know their business in the matter of house-building&mdash;and at a time when there is a tendency for unqualified people with very little knowledge of the organisation required in the building industry to enter it, I suggest that the Minister's Department ought not to be so timid about sanctioning schemes by direct labour.  If there is a competent engineer in charge&mdash;I presume the engineers in the public service are competent, because otherwise their services would not be retained in it&mdash;I suggest that the Department ought to entrust the carrying out of housing schemes by direct labour to persons of that kind. I am sure that if a competent engineer were to undertake the task of organising the erection of houses by direct labour it would be possible to ensure that the work would be put into hands much more capable of erecting decent houses than many of those who are now getting contracts to erect houses. I think, therefore, that, far from being shy about sanctioning schemes of direct labour, the Department should endeavour to extend throughout the country the practice which apparently it has been willing to adopt in the matter of direct labour schemes in the Counties of Wicklow and Wexford. If they do that they will probably find that schemes for house-building throughout the country will be carried out as successfully as they have been, particularly in these two counties. The Minister himself has paid tribute to the housing schemes carried out by direct labour in these two counties.</P>
    <P>There was one matter to which I thought the Minister would make reference in the course of his speech, and that is the position with regard to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, particularly in the City of Dublin.  As the Minister knows, for some time past it has not been possible for potential house purchasers to borrow money from the Dublin Corporation under that particular Act.  I have no hesitation <Col N="820" /> in saying that the effect of the Corporation not making money available under that particular Act has been to slow down, on the one hand, the erection of houses, and on the other hand to produce a fair amount of unemployment in the building trade. While I concede, and would not dream of challenging the contention for a moment, that the primary purpose of the State's house-building endeavours must be to take people out of the filthy, insanitary dens in which they are compelled to live to-day, and while that, however, is and must be the primary purpose of the State, the raising of money to finance schemes of purchase under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is in no way in conflict with the discharge of that primary purpose.  The erection of houses, no matter from what source the money is provided and no matter in what way the houses are erected, helps in its own way to relieve the problem of slumdom and the problem of overcrowding. Therefore, a local authority should do everything in its power, consistent with prudent finance, to encourage the erection of as many houses as possible.  Every additional house erected is an aid in the solution of these problems.  Every additional house erected will ultimately yield a revenue from the point of view of the local authority.  Every additional house erected means better health, longer lives, and makes for stronger and healthier men, women and children, and that is a thing that ought to be encouraged in every possible way by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, however, for some reason or other, there seems to be a disposition to regard moneys advanced under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act as being a very small factor in the rescuing of people from the slums and insanitary dwellings.  I am not by any means convinced that the two schemes are in conflict with each other.  The Dublin Corporation are able to borrow money now at, approximately, 4? per cent. or 4¼ per cent., and the Corporation have been able to get a large number of borrowers by advancing this money to potential house purchasers at 6 per cent.  I do not think <Col N="821" /> there has been any serious difficulty, so far as the Corporation is concerned, in having the money repaid; so that, when it raises money at 4¼ per cent. it lends at 6 per cent.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy proceeds to develop that argument, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that this is an amending Bill and, in such a Bill, you discuss the Bill and the main Act only in so far as it is affected by it. This Bill, as I gather from the Minister's statement and the Bill, makes provision for grants relating to private persons, public utility societies and philanthropic societies, and not local authorities.  At least one Deputy stated that he was refraining from referring to certain matters because they were not in the Bill.</P>

I notice a Deputy, who is also a member of the Dublin Corporation, taking a keen interest in the line of discussion Deputy Norton is now following. If that line of argument, therefore, is extended to the action of the Dublin Corporation and the administration of the Local Government Department, the discussion might be protracted.</P>

      <P>I was suggesting to the Minister, Sir, that one of the ways in which he can help to make an adequate contribution to the solution of the housing problem in Dublin will be through making available under this particular Act the money which it was normally intended should be made available under the Act, and, if he were to use his influence with the Dublin Corporation or with the Minister for Finance in such a way as to ensure that there would be adequate sums of money available to finance house purchase under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, it would probably be more effective in providing a solution of the problem in Dublin than the continuance of the grants to builders or to public utility societies.  The Minister is providing additional money for grants under this Bill, but what is the use of doing so if the potential purchaser is not able to get the balance of the money to purchase the house?  He can get a grant from the Minister of £45 under this Bill, but he may have only a small deposit of perhaps £100, or perhaps £150.  The price may be, perhaps, £600, and his problem is to find the difference between his £150 and the £45 grant and the price.  I suggest <Col N="823" /> that he cannot get it, and that the only way he can get it effectively, and on terms which will not be too onerous on him, will be under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I should be glad if the Minister would ensure that adequate sums of money will be available in that way, because, if they were available, I think it would make a greater contribution towards the solution of the problem than by advances to public utility societies or private builders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very noticeable effect from the fact that money is not now available in anything like adequate sums under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. Deputy Mulcahy quoted certain figures in respect of unemployment.  The figures he quoted might be subject to the criticism that they are not up to date, but let us look at the position during the past 12 months, and I am afraid we can find very little consolation in the figures.  According to a return furnished to-day by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in reply to a question asked by Deputy Pattison, there were registered as unemployed on the registers of employment exchanges and branch offices on the 7th January, 1935, not less than 7,578 unemployed building trade workers.  The figure fell to 7,300 in April, 1935.  It fell to 6,300 in July, 1935.  It remained at 6,300 in October, 1935.  But between October, 1935, and January of this year&mdash;a period of three months&mdash;the figures rose from 6,300 in October, 1935, to 8,700 in January, 1936; in other words, an increase of 2,400 persons in a period of three months.  When we are looking at that return, let us take a few particular crafts which are fairly reliable pointers as to the tendency of employment in the trade.  It used to be said, of course, that bricklayers and plasterers were exceptionally difficult people to secure.  In January, 1935, there were 120 bricklayers idle.  In July, 1935, there were 60.  In October, 1935, there were 74; but in January, 1936, there were 198 idle&mdash;nearly three times the October figure, and an increase of almost 80 on the number of bricklayers registered as unemployed on the 7th January, 1935.  If we find that it is the <Col N="824" /> position that bricklayers are becoming unemployed in, what is for them large numbers, I think there is a clear indication that there is a slowing down in housing activity.</P>
    <P>If we take plasterers, there were 137 plasterers unemployed in January, 1935, 42 in July, 1935, and 26 in October, 1935.  Then for January, 1936, the figure rose to 269.  That is, there were practically twice as many plasterers unemployed in January, 1936, as there were in January, 1935. In respect of builders' labourers, there were an additional 600 labourers unemployed in the 12 months to 1936 as compared with the previous 12 months.  I suggest to the Minister that these are pointers which indicate the way in which the housing breeze is blowing.  I think a considerable amount of that unemployment can be found within the City of Dublin and it is found there, because of the fact that many builders who have been erecting houses are not able to sell the houses because money is not being made available, in anything like adequate sums, by the Corporation through the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  In that respect the Corporation is in a somewhat unique position. Local authorities throughout the country are making money available because they can get it through the Local Loans Fund.  If the Corporation find any difficulty in getting money in the open market for the purpose of financing operations under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, I think the Minister ought to endeavour to do something to provide money through the medium of the Local Loans Fund which is now being put on a statutory basis and which, I suggest, is capable of advancing the necessary money.  The houses erected would form a substantial asset in respect of any money advanced for these purposes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take a personal interest in the question of the position of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act in the City of Dublin. I think it is important from an employment point of view and I think it is still more important from the housing point of view.  So far as <Col N="825" /> Dublin is concerned, the Minister knows it will take a long time to make an impression on the problem as it exists here.  We cannot possibly afford to ignore any opportunity for the erection of houses.  I think the erection of houses, assisted through the medium of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, would, in its own way and in its own time, make a contribution to the solution of the problem, which in this city is going to defy the efforts of many ministries, so long as the rate of progress continues as at present.  In saying that I am not making a reflection on the Minister's Department. It is a problem that we have had for generations and every possible effort should be made to speed up its solution. I think the provision of money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act would make a pretty useful and helpful contribution towards its solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>A point which Deputy Norton seems to lose sight of is that money can be advanced by public bodies under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to members of public utility societies.  This has been done in the Counties Monaghan and Dublin and, I think, in other counties also.  The Minister stated in the course of his remarks that the evidence available indicated that there is not the same need for the continuance of grants in urban centres as exists in the rural areas.  He also stated that there has been very little demand for grants by public utility societies for the erection of houses for letting in urban areas at rents approved of by the Minister.  He mentioned that there were only four such societies, who had 160 houses in the course of construction and that only 36 had been completed to date. The Minister I think is not in possession of all the facts.  I happen to know of the activities of one of these utility societies in the City of Dublin as the secretary happens to be a personal friend of mine.  Whilst they have on their rolls of membership a couple of thousand members, through lack of finances they are unable to <Col N="826" /> proceed with their programme.  They have, I think, only 16 houses in the course of construction.  It does not seem to be the policy of public bodies to help out building of the kind of houses most needed in the urban areas, that is houses for artisans and labourers.  I seriously contend that the best way to help the building of such houses is to implement advances to public utility societies in the same way as they have been carried out in the Counties Dublin and Monaghan.  There may be legal difficulties in the way but legal difficulties can certainly be got over.</P>
      <P>The Minister said something to the effect that assistance could be withdrawn or modified, having regard to the size of the house.  That is a very hopeful statement of the Minister, and knowing the necessity that exists in urban areas, where you cannot carry out, say, a labourers' cottage scheme or a scheme for a certain class of houses for the artisan and the labourer, I say the sooner the Minister's wishes are put into operation the better.  He also stated that it was intended to carry out a review of the making of grants to private persons and public utility societies.  I hope he means by that that it is intended to ask more help from public bodies for utility societies.  I know the amount of work carried out by the Utility Society of Ireland&mdash;I do not know whether that is the correct name.  A certain lady is secretary, and the work she has done in her own way is immense.  If any help could be given to spread out that work and make it a national work, I think that would be one of the best ways we could go about solving the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not present for the whole of Deputy Norton's speech, but such portion of it as I heard would indicate to me that the only bodies he sees as capable of solving the housing problem are public bodies.  I contend that utility Societies which are actuated by a desire to help members with the greatest possible economy could, if all the things expressed in the Minister's speech were co-ordinated, give valuable help in that direction.  If given help by the Government and public <Col N="827" /> bodies they could assist in the erection of the type of house I have indicated&mdash;the artisan's and the labourer's house.  I hope this Bill is a preliminary to such a measure.  That is all I have to say on the matter.  I am glad this Bill has come along as a help to previous legislation, which has done so much for housing since the Minister took over office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very much interested in the Minister's statement when he was introducing this Bill.  I was perhaps more interested in the speech delivered by Deputy Norton.  I was surprised and rather disappointed that Deputy Tom Kelly did not jump to his feet after Deputy Norton's speech.  It might be well to remind some people that there is a body of opinion in the Dublin Corporation favouring the idea that there are other methods of dealing with the slum problem than the direct method.  I wish to endorse every word Deputy Norton has said about the utility of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, carefully and cautiously administered. He said that that would be a very potent factor in solving even the slum problem.  I have given the matter some study, and I think that it would be a major factor in solving the slum problem.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this chance to bring the suggestion before the Minister that at least 60 per cent. of the people whom the Dublin Corporation are housing under their housing schemes&mdash;and they are housing them at a big initial loss to the corporation&mdash;could be housed under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act without any loss if an opportunity were given in time to those people.  What I mean is that if artisans in fairly steady employment, earning about £4 a week, could find £50, £60, £70 or £100 they would be sure of a house for an all-in outlay of 15/- to 17/- a week.  They could easily in a year or two save sufficient to make a deposit and get such a house for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the type of people who are being housed by the Dublin Corporation, taken out of the slums, <Col N="828" /> we will find that the majority of them are artisans who had to drift into the slums, because no other housing accommodation was available at the time, and as their families increased they could not get out by their own efforts, and now they have to be housed at the public expense.  Taking conditions as they are, there are many artisans with large families and they have nothing saved because they had no incentive to save.  Up to this, if they were lucky enough to save £50 or £100, they could not get a house for a deposit of that amount.  Now, if the opportunity were given to artisans to secure a house for a deposit of £50 or £100, and if they are allowed to avail of the facilities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, you will have two forces working to clear the slums.  You will have one force clearing them and another diverting the stream from going into the slums. You will give many young couples an opportunity of starting life in a decent house.</P>
    <P>Following Deputy Norton's statement, I would like to clear up the position with regard to corporation loans. Within the last three and a half years the Dublin Corporation have lent £900,000 and there is now available another £250,000.  I agree with what Deputy Norton said.  That is my own point of view and my attitude in the corporation was dictated by that point of view.  There are members of the corporation who are also members of this House and they take an opposite view, and I think it is only fair to the Minister that they should be vocal in a matter like this, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  I am aware that the Minister is only too anxious to get information on this point and I am sure he will do what he considers best. There are two points of view battling in the corporation over the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans and advocates of both points of view are in this House.  It is only fair that the other point of view should be given here, with the permission of the Chair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton dealt with the starting and completion of contracts.  Since I came here I never found myself in such thorough agreement with Deputy <Col N="829" /> Norton in all the points he raised. Before I go away from the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act I would like to say it is an Act that has to be very carefully administered, otherwise, as I am sure the Minister and his officials are aware, there is a danger of inflating the price of houses.  You will inflate the price of anything if you make too much money available for it and, of course, it will be a harvest for those of us who are interested in building. But a harvest reaped by any section at the expense of a larger section ultimately may turn out to be more harm than good, even to the section that temporarily benefits.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Kennedy that we should throw money into utility societies.  The Deputy spoke of a society, of which a lady is secretary, and he said it did a lot of good.  That may be, but from a business standpoint and a financial standpoint, it is an intricate and dangerous undertaking. There are not many women knocking about whom business men would trust with the management of such a matter. I do not know if such terribly good work has been done by this society. Our experience of building societies in the County of Dublin is a sad one.  If some of them were not swindles they were the next step.  I know some societies were able to wipe the eye of the county council and they got the county council to pay 100 per cent. of the price of the houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a satisfactory feeling to know that they will get no more of it in their pockets.  In the valuation of these houses, I think that the Department of Local Government should get into closer touch with the <Col N="830" /> local authority.  We got counsel's opinion and, to my amazement, the law found out a price that no business man would ever find.  The law said that there could be a price different from the selling price or the price fixed by the valuer, which brought us ordinary plain people into a kind of mess. From the business standpoint, the Department should be in closer touch and should, perhaps, assume a little more authority in this matter, where large sums of money are being given out.</P>
      <P>I am speaking now more of county councils than of the corporation, because the corporation has some sense of responsibility because they have to raise the money and they have to keep conditions such as will enable them to get money at a certain price. In the case of a county council, all they have to do is to knock at the Minister's door and say they want so much and thank him for all they get. They have not to consider the conditions which rule the raising of money. On the final form which is sent to the Department in regard to final sanction of the loan&mdash;the last act in the whole business&mdash;should be stated the purchase price of the house.  If that were done, the officials of the Minister's Housing Department would have all the facts that count before them&mdash;the amount of loan, the valuation of the house and, the most material factor, the purchase price.  They could see at a glance whether the loan was roughly a fair loan to give on such a house.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton also raised the question of contractors for labourers' cottages.  I thought we were bad enough in Dublin in the matter of contractors, but Deputy Norton's story in regard to that matter in other counties is far worse than I thought existed.</P>

      <P>Local authorities find themselves in the unfortunate position &mdash;and it is very hard to rectify it&mdash;of having to accept the lowest tender.  It is difficult because it would leave matters open to abuse if any other tender could be accepted, but we have had sad experiences in the matter.  In one case, on which we came to a final conclusion only this week, we had to take the contract from the man.  The houses should have been finished in October, 1934.  There was some disappointment with regard to the times and our engineer recommended an extension to February, 1935.  It is now February, 1936, and the houses are not completed and we had to take the contract from him.  A carpenter who worked for him came before our board a fortnight ago and said that his wages had not been paid.  We summoned both of them before the board yesterday, and we got a letter from the carpenter, from Galway, saying that he had now settled the matter because he had got a decree for his wages against the contractor last Thursday.</P>
      <P>We have another case of a man at the other side of the county.  We had trouble with the houses, and three or four sand men, carpenters and builders' providers have got garnishee orders against the little bit of money he has left.  We have to send out men to finish the cottages and we are paying interest to the Local Loans Fund of some thousands of pounds on money we have borrowed for the schemes to date.  The people who are looking for the houses and to whom the houses have been allocated are in hovels.  We have to pay interest on the money, we cannot get the houses given up, and we cannot put these people in and get rents for them.  I should like to have a talk with the Minister on the matter.  It happened because the majority of the board of health held different political views from those of the contractor, and they gave grace and leniency because they felt that if they carried out the contract exactly&mdash;that is true and there is nothing to laugh at; I will give the Minister evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will desist from that. If the Minister cares, I should be glad to talk this matter over with him privately.  I do not share the views expressed by Deputy Breathnach because I am sure Deputy Dockrell will smile when he hears it suggested that builders' providers were so gullible as to dish out stuff to the value of £900 or £1,000 to a contractor who got a contract of some thousands of pounds, on the off chance that the man would pay them.  I do not think Deputy Dockrell would do that, although I have strained his credit to a great extent.  He is too keen and too honourable a business man to allow any man who had not sufficient resources or reserves to go too far into debt.  I think that Deputy Breathnach's contractor and his builders' provider were both foolish men to go so far along a line on which danger was indicated and which turned out dangerous in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the view expressed by the Minister that housing grants are not such an incentive and that&mdash;although I am speaking against myself in saying this&mdash;they should be reviewed in urban areas.  If, however, the Minister wants to keep up the building pace&mdash;and I am sure he does&mdash;there is only one way in which he can do it&mdash;it has already been pointed out by Deputy Norton: he must help house purchasers to buy their houses.  If, in Dublin City and County, the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts were permanently suspended, the building of houses except houses priced at £1,200, £1,300 and upwards would practically cease.  So that building in the city will depend upon the availability of money to help house purchasers.  I am not advocating that it should be given.  If Deputy Dockrell speaks upon this matter, and deals with this point, I am sure he will say that from March of last year there was no money available from the Dublin Corporation. Even yet it is not available under the new loan for small dwellings. Deputy Dockrell will say that in the 12 <Col N="833" /> months just ended there was a decrease in the output of building materials, and in the orders to build, to the extent of five or six or seven hundred thousand pounds.  That is the reason of the unemployment among building operatives referred to by previous speakers.</P>
    <P>In the County Dublin we lent £150,000 which we got from the Local Loans Fund.  Building will practically come to a standstill if that is not continued. It will come to a standstill with regard to the houses I have mentioned in the city if not continued after this £250,000 is expended, and this £250,000 will last only a very short time.  I know the Minister is alive to that.  My business in the Corporation has brought me into contact with the Minister, and I know what he thinks on this question.  I only raise the matter here in order that others, in the building industry, may be able to give their point of view from their own angle, so that the Minister can gather the whole of the information necessary and digest it.  If steady work is required in the building trade, if skilled men are to be kept in substantially continuous employment the housing grants must be properly regulated.</P>
    <P>A man building his first house gets a grant, but it is not worth a fig if he does not get a purchaser; a bribe to the builder is not going to help the building trade.  If the houses are not taken off a man's hands he cannot go on.  It is far more important that a builder should be able to get purchasers than that he should get a bribe to build. If the Minister for Local Government, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, could devise some means for sufficiently financing the purchase of houses and helping private individuals to purchase, if he could provide that money then, even if he does nothing else as regards the type of people building houses, building will go on, and skilled artisans engaged in the housebuilding trade will be kept in steady employment.  It is a bad system to have a rush of money now, and none after a while.  That means that men are employed now, and none are employed after a while.  Of course, it is better than nothing, but it is not the best thing to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The Minister wants to provide steady work.  If that is so, a steady flow of money, for the purchase of houses built, ought to be devised.  I submit to the Minister, from my little experience of local administration, and my experience as a builder, that that is the need in regard to the building of houses and in order to provide steady employment in the building trade.  I hope he will give it careful consideration.</P>

I smiled when I got a list of what are termed &ldquo;small dwellings.&rdquo;  Here are some of them.  The number of houses built was 1,640.  There were 390 of these of a market value of £500; 320 of a market value of £600; 380 of a market value of £750; 220 of a market value of £850; and 330 of a market value of £1,000.</P>

Deputies who take an interest in the city and all Deputies who take an interest in the abolition of slums&mdash;and there are many of them in Ireland, more especially in Dublin &mdash;have to ask themselves if this money for small dwellings is helping in that direction.  Where is the artisan who is going to take a house at the value of £750 or £1,000 and pay as well, ground rent, rates, insurance, repairs, maintenance and income tax?  Where is the artisan with £4 a week who can do that?  He does not live in this country or in any other country for that matter.  The other £250,000 has been clamoured for and got, and if it is to be spent on the building of houses of £1,000 or £2,000 market value who is to buy them?</P>

      <P>I have given the figure of £950,000 spent in the last three years.  Yet we hear a Deputy saying that we are not spending money under the Small Dwellings Act.  It is quite clear that he has not got the proper information.  I suggest to the Labour Party that the Dublin Corporation is faced with the responsibility of an expenditure of £10,000,000 in the next ten years.  Money spent on the abolition of slums, and on the housing of artisans is well spent.  I query whether the money here is well spent at all.  One would think the Corporation did not try to help the very class Deputy Norton has spoken for. What did they do?  In 1920 the Corporation, then elected, devised a scheme for artisans dwellings on a purchase system.  They built hundreds and hundreds of houses on sites such as Fairbrothers Fields, Merrion and Clontarf, Donnycarney and many other districts.  They built these houses and let them under a purchase scheme at annuities which meant 11/1 and 7/6 per week.  That went on for one or two years, and was continued when the Commissioners were administering the affairs of the city.  And what was the result?  Four or five years ago the position was this: The City Manager and members of the Council came to the conclusion that the scheme ought not to be continued.  A large number of the people could not pay the rents and fell into arrears.  And the position was this: the City Manager if the scheme is to be continued, would have to undertake wholesale eviction if he was to carry out his duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation was eased when 500 houses were built at Cabra to let at 7/6 per week on the ordinary letting system.  The City Manager had to transfer a number of the tenants who had signed these house-purchase agreements and who, through misfortune or illness, were not able to pay the <Col N="836" /> necessary sums for the houses being built under the purchase system, to the houses in Cabra, which were intended for people less fortunate.  That is the position, and the City Manager can furnish the Minister with all the relevant figures.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to talk about houses costing £850 or £1,000 being built under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act to relieve congestion in the slums.  I am in no way friendly to this house-purchase system under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act unless the houses are really small and the amounts to be paid each year are consistent with the incomes of the families going into possession.  The question of unemployment in the building trades is one of some difficulty at present.  The diminution that Deputy Norton spoke of arises from the fact that the Corporation could not for some time get the money to carry out their programme for this year. They succeeded in getting it only quite recently, and they would not have got it but for the success of the effort of the Minister for Finance.  That relieved the situation very considerably for us.  We were in the position that the banks would not advance any more money.  They refused to underwrite any further loans.  Fortunately, the Minister I referred to has come in at the right time.  If bricklayers and plasterers have had to be dismissed, it is because we could not carry on our building programme in the city.  What were the facts a couple of years ago? Two years ago, I think, the City Manager had to issue licences to tradesmen from other countries to come in here to work.  Probably they have remained here and will remain here.  The building schemes with which the Corporation is principally concerned give an immense amount of employment.  The money put into this building work goes to the benefit of everybody.  A lot of the money goes into the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  Having regard to the responsibilities which the Corporation has undertaken in connection with housing, they cannot afford to be spending much otherwise.  We have heard from Deputy Norton of a lot of &ldquo;handymen,&rdquo; who are taking contracts <Col N="837" /> from local councils to build houses.  Is it any wonder, then, that there is idleness in the skilled trades? With all the experience of housing which I have had for many years, it never entered my head until to-day that I myself should start building. We hear of men who never built a house getting contracts.  I wonder that the Labour Party allows it.</P>

      <P>If that is so, why does he allow it?  I do not think it is right that that class of people should be going round the country pretending they are builders, getting six months to build a house, and then its being found, at the end of six months, that not a brick is laid.  I say that the Corporation has done its duty in regard to the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and that it has enabled many families to obtain their houses, but it cannot allow those people to be labelled as coming from the slums. They do not.  The people living in the slums cannot afford to build houses under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, having regard to the responsibilities which they would undertake and to the extent of their income.  I hope that the Minister will see to that in future and that most of the money will be spent by the Corporation on the big work they have undertaken, which, please God, they will carry to success.</P>

      <P>In the remarks which I propose to make, I shall not follow the last speaker into the operations of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  I shall endeavour to keep within the terms of the Bill and to address my remarks rather to the question of building in the country and in country towns than to the question of building in the City of Dublin which, though of tremendous importance, should not be allowed completely to overshadow consideration of the needs of the country districts.  I am afraid that, in the building schemes which the Minister has put into operation, there is one fundamental defect which has had the most injurious effect.  I refer to the urgings by the Minister that houses <Col N="838" /> should be built within a certain time and at a certain rate, and to the requirement that houses should be completed within a certain time in order to obtain the grants.  I think that that is entirely wrong.  It leads to the view: &ldquo;Let us have something that looks like a house.  Let it be habitable or uninhabitable, but let us have it built quickly.&rdquo;  That is, I think, the principle on which the building schemes are being worked.  A considerable number of houses which are being built partly by means of building grants and partly at the expense of the owners are being rushed up. Many of them are gerry-built and will not be habitable even for the whole of the lifetime of the youngish men who are building them.  That arises from this desire to get houses built quickly and to pile up statistics.  The idea seems to be: &ldquo;Let us be able to say that so many houses have been built this year, and we shall be satisfied.&rdquo; There does not seem to be sufficient anxiety as to whether the houses built are good houses, bad houses or indifferent houses.  There was a good deal of talk about inefficient persons taking contracts for labourers' houses.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the House of what I see happening in the county to which the Minister has alluded as the county in which most building was being done under these schemes.  A person wishes to build a house and, no tradesman being available in the neighbourhood, he goes to a handy young chap, who says he can put up a cement house.  There is an idea that anyone can put up a cement house.  I dare say if Deputy Kelly were younger and more energetic he would hold himself out as being perfectly competent to build a cement house.  Young chaps who never built a house, and never had any training, take contracts from private individuals.  In many of the houses built like that I am satisfied there is not even the proper quota of cement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that is what has happened in the building of a considerable number of houses <Col N="839" /> I know instances where handy young fellows have done their best to build houses for neighbours, and who afterwards took contracts to build houses for local authorities.  There is always a safeguard in contracts given by local authorities, because there is a competent engineer to inspect the work. If it is not properly done the contract is taken from the individual, and is finished at his expense by some other contractor or by the surveyor in charge.  There is no such check in the case of private houses, because there is no engineer.  No one really sees or tests these houses until they are finished, when there is a casual superficial inspection, which is perfectly worthless. The result is that while this idea of speed is resulting in a great number of gerry-built houses being put up, the problem which might be solved now will be a living and a vital one again in 20 years, when a number of these so-called habitable houses will turn out to be uninhabitable.  Take that sample on a bigger scale, where there is not the particular danger I have mentioned and where a competent engineer is in charge.  I will give an example of what has been the result of trying to build houses too fast, careless of whether they have been well built or built on good or bad foundations. In the matter to which I am going to allude as an example the Minister was very much the driving force.  There was a very substantial scheme of houses in the town of Castlebar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Wide latitude has been given to Deputies, but the administration of the Local Government Department should not be discussed now.  There will be ample opportunity for discussion on the Minister's Vote. Moreover, if specific instances arose, obviously neither the Minister nor the Department would be in a position to reply now, not being prepared for matters that are not relevant to the measure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Belton alluded to the position of builders' providers.  I am speaking of country districts, and not of the cities. In the country districts builders' providers have, perhaps, only a limited amount of capital to draw upon, and if they advance supplies worth thousands of pounds for the building of houses, they may have to wait a considerable time for payment.  Half of the money is paid when houses are partly built, and the other half when they are finished. Builders' providers are not in a position to advance considerable sums in that way, because they have not the ready money available.  Smallholders who are availing of the loans or grants to build houses are dependent almost entirely on these payments to pay builders' providers.  These people do a great deal of the work themselves.  I had to communicate with the Department on this question some time ago, in a case where a builders' provider <Col N="841" /> found he had as much money out as he could afford, and could not give any further goods upon credit, although he knew that he would be paid by the Department in time.  I am satisfied that some of the cause of that is due to the persons who are building houses, because they often draw the materials with which they are going to build to the site, and leave them on the ground for three or four months.  That is unfair to builders' providers, because it is delaying the period when they will be paid.  It is also hard on their neighbours, inasmuch as the builders' providers' cannot be expected to give unlimited credit.  I ask the Minister very seriously to consider putting a time limit on the advance of money, such as he has done in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the main thing in the country is to provide good habitable houses with chimneys that will draw, and not chimneys that will smoke.  What is wanted are comfortable houses that will not let in draughts.  I know a case of people who lived in a comfortable thatched house and who went into one of the modern cement houses.  They found that they had been very much more comfortable, and much better off in the solid stone house, which was warm and had a thatched roof, than in the modern house.  I am afraid there will be gerry-building, because it is fashionable now to leave thatched houses and to go into one of the new houses that are being built.  I would press upon the Minister not to hurry and, if he can, to devise a better method of checking, so that an ordinary man, who cannot pay to have expert advice and who simply gets an untrained builder to build his house, will have as good a house as, say, a labourer will get if his house is built under the supervision of the local county surveyor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave the House very valuable information and furnished figures to prove to the satisfaction of anybody that satisfactory progress is being made so far as the number of houses built is concerned.  I would, however, appeal to the Minister to take serious personal notice of the warning which Deputy Norton has given in regard to the results and <Col N="842" /> particularly in regard to the activities of those small, inexperienced, self-styled builders who are certainly not giving value for the money to the local authorities or the State and who are not carrying out their contract within the contract period.  I have furnished evidence to the Department on more than one occasion to justify action on the part of the Department.  I furnished particulars some short time ago of a self-styled contractor who got a contract for the erection of seven houses for two local authorities.  He was given a contract for the erection of one of these houses 18 months ago and has not completed it yet, while the unfortunate married man with his family, who is waiting for the house, is living in a hovel which the Minister would be ashamed of.  That gentleman operates in this way.  He gets a contract for the erection of one or two houses at different periods.  He erects a house up to a certain point and gets a certain payment on account.  He then leaves the house there and does the same in regard to another house. I would prefer to see building activities stopped altogether in that particular area until such time as we can get a competent contractor, rather than stand the continuance of that particular kind of house building.  I hope the Minister will take steps in the area concerned to terminate the services of builders of that type, because they are no use to the State, to themselves, or to the people looking for work from contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of opinion also, and I think there is evidence in the Minister's Department to bear me out, that contractors who are building houses in a very large number of cases are ignoring their obligations in regard to the payment of the district trade union rate of wages.  I furnished evidence on a recent occasion&mdash;it is only one of many cases&mdash;where a shopkeeper got a contract for the erection of two houses convenient to a certain town in my constituency.  He was reported to the Department for having failed to secure the services of a skilled plasterer.  I understand that the unskilled men whom he got to do the skilled men's work were paid at the rate of 25/- per <Col N="843" /> week instead of 38/-.  In order to get over that, he obliged the people whom he employed to get their wives to buy groceries in his shop and, in one particular week, the wife of one of the so-called skilled employees drew the sum of 2/-, the remainder being spent on groceries in the shop of the self-styled contractor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been reported to the housing department and I regret to say that no action of an effective nature has been taken to deal with that type of case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if the workman concerned and his wife, who is obliged to deal in this shop, made a sworn statement before a local peace commissioner effective action probably could be taken by the Department, but with the existing unemployment in the area and in other areas there is no disposition to lose employment by doing a thing of that kind.  There is one way in which the Minister and his Department can get rid of this type of contractor and that is by insisting upon local authorities advertising for the erection of houses in lots of not less than 10 or 20.  They will then be in a position to get competent contractors to tender, or at least contractors who will have to get certain security, so that it will be possible for the Minister to deal with people who take these big contracts.  That suggestion has been put up to the Department from more than one area to my personal knowledge and I hope that some more effective measures will be taken to get rid of gentlemen who are not giving value for the money and who are not giving any employment to the people in the locality.  A contractor who takes a contract for the erection of one or two houses does not give any employment to the registered unemployed.  These contractors have not been taking any skilled or unskilled people off the local labour exchange register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> If the Minister wants to help to solve the unemployment problem through house building, he will have to take more drastic measures for the purpose of getting competent contractors. Once he gets a competent contractor for the erection of a fairly large number of houses he will be able to take some of the local unemployed off the unemployed register.  In one rural area in my constituency the average cost of a working-class house&mdash;I might say it is the standard figure&mdash;is £250.  There is evidence to prove that the type of contractor I have mentioned is generally the type operating in this area.  He does not pay trade union wages or take any men off the local unemployment register.  He does not build satisfactory houses and I think there is no advantage in having that type of gentleman operating in the country.</P>
    <P>I seriously suggest to the Minister that if he is to get better results for the money to be spent on housing in the future he should have a serious talk either with the consulting engineers or the county engineers at some convenient date, or make representations on this matter through the engineering association to the consulting and county engineers responsible for carrying out the Act.  I think more effective supervision on the part of consulting and county engineers would bring about better results.  I cannot understand how any consulting engineer or county engineer tolerates or recommends the appointment of a man as clerk of works who is neither a skilled tradesman nor an engineer.  I think a lot of the trouble in regard to the manner in which houses are completed, where houses are unsatisfactory, is due to the employment of a clerk of works who is neither a skilled man in the building trade nor a man with an engineering degree.  If the Minister gets rid of that type of engineer, I think he will probably have far better results from the money spent on housing in the future.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that he should take drastic steps in every part of the country to see that the contractors complete the houses within the stipulated time.  I had a case brought to my notice as late as last Sunday. It was mentioned to me previously but <Col N="845" /> I had not been able to go into it.  I was questioned as to why the Minister for Local Government and Public Health had failed for a number of weeks to give his sanction to the erection of a large number of houses in a certain town in my constituency.  I made enquiries and I found that this contractor got a contract for the erection of 13 houses.  In the first instance, in the erection of the houses there was great delay and the final certificate was not given by the engineer; it is very doubtful whether that certificate will eventually be given for there is outward evidence that the houses are in a most unsatisfactory state with leaking roofs and other defects.  The same contractor had a further contract for 18 houses which were to be completed last October but they are not yet completed and only God knows when they will be, unless the Minister or his Department takes action to compel him to do so.  I was questioned on Sunday as to why that same gentleman has not been sanctioned for the carrying out of a huge housing scheme in the same town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are cottages which are to be erected by town commissioners in my area.  Deputy Norton referred to an experiment which had been sanctioned for his area in connection with direct labour.  I made similar representation to the Housing Department and I want to say, as far as the Housing Department is concerned, that it is the best organised section of any Government Department in this State. There is visible evidence in the country to-day that that Department has done more work in the real nation-building way since the passing of the Treaty than any Department of this Government. I have no grievance and nothing to say except that I look upon it as the best organised Department in the State.  One can always get satisfactory answers and explanations when required by sending a letter to the Department.  In this respect it is more satisfactory than any other Department in the State.  In anything I am saying I am not making any complaint against the officials.  I am satisfied <Col N="846" /> that if they had the necessary technical machinery at their disposal more satisfactory results would be secured for the money spent by the State on housing.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where a housing scheme was carried out in a town in my constituency by direct labour.  I understand the officials of the Department regarded the costs of the scheme as excessive.  But I would invite the Minister, when next in that area, to go into that town and look at the type of houses and see the good results secured from the alleged excessive amount of money spent on them.  Then I will ask him to go to the other side of the square in the same town and compare a housing scheme carried out there by contract a short time previously. Let him compare the costs of building of each scheme and the results and he will see the position for himself.  I am prepared to give the Minister the name of that town. The two schemes are within a few hundred yards of each other.  I am sure if he compares the two he will have no hesitation in concluding that the houses built by direct labour are likely to last much longer than the others built by contract.  The houses built by contract are already reported as being in a very unsatisfactory state, with the smoke going out the doors instead of up the chimneys, but the contractor has been paid his money. In his speech to-day the Minister referred to the use that has been made of Irish material in the building of houses all over the country.  That is one of the things in which I disagree with the Minister.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I consider the activities of the Ministry have been apparently conducted under the supervision of very competent officials, assisted by the Housing Board.

I should like to hear the reasons why that vacancy has not been filled or whether it is the intention of the Minister to fill it?  Deputy Dillon is laughing at that question.

      <P>Whether he was prompted by Deputy Donnelly or not, Deputy Kennedy made some references to Deputy Norton's speech.  Now, Deputy Kennedy was not in the House during the time Deputy Norton delivered three-fourths of his speech. Deputy Kennedy took up some note which had no reference to the speech delivered by Deputy Norton at all.  He quoted certain words which he alleged Deputy Norton had uttered, but I think what he was quoting from really was the speech delivered by the Minister.  He evidently did not know which.  It will be information for Deputy Kennedy to know that Deputy Norton is a member of a utility society which has erected or is responsible for the erection of 120 houses.  Deputy Norton, therefore, has no prejudice against the activities of public utility societies.</P>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Tom Kelly so effectively disposed of the dishonest arguments put up by Deputy Belton in regard to solving the housing problem in the future through the medium of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  If there is any necessity for bringing an amendment to that Act I hope the Minister will have a private talk with Deputy Kelly, so that he may get a name for the Act that will bring it into line with its operations.  I dare say Deputy Kelly would not say that a proper description of it was the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act in view of the information which he himself has given to the House.  There was a dishonest argument put forward on the part of Deputy Belton in connection with the solution of the housing problem&mdash;that there is only one way of solving it, and that that was through the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the present building activities and the figures given by the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="849" /> Public Health to-day of the number of unemployed in the building trades I notice that he said that on the 7th January, 1935, there were 7,576 able-bodied men in the different skilled trades in the building business unemployed, and that on the 6th January, 1936, the figure was 8,696 persons.  That would go to show that there has been some slowing down in the building business in recent times, or that the contractors who have been operating throughout the country are not employing the same number of skilled tradesmen as they did 12 months ago.  I am prepared to encourage going more carefully and more slowly for one reason. I can see that there is justification for going a little more slowly for one reason only, namely, I would prefer to go a little bit more slowly and carefully in regard to building houses, especially by local authorities, unless and until we are able to get a type of contractor who will give better value in future than they have been giving up to the present.  I want to see those self-styled contractors who have been giving bad value, and not giving employment to the registered unemployed, cut off the list of contractors who are available for building houses on which grants have been given at the expense of the taxpayers of this country.  I would encourage the Minister to go slowly for that reason&mdash;in order that he may be able to get the services of competent contractors who will give better value to the State and to the local authority in the building of houses which are required in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with portion of Deputy Davin's speech, and with portion of it I do not agree.  I certainly agree with his statement that there is more supervision required.  I believe there is.  I believe you want better qualified men as clerks of works on the housing schemes throughout the country.  I believe also that the engineers in the different districts in charge of those housing schemes should give them greater attention.  It may not be the fault of the engineers themselves; a lot of the responsibility, I believe, rests on the local authority.  In many districts&mdash;I know that this is true of my own <Col N="850" /> county&mdash;incompetent men are appointed as clerks of works.  I raised the question here on a few occasions, and the answer I got was that they were sanctioned and nothing could be done.  In some cases I have learned that the engineers in charge have reported those gentlemen for inefficiency. That state of affairs should not exist. Where you have big housing schemes, on which a large amount of the taxpayers' money is expended, a state of affairs should not exist in which, for no reason except a political reason, a man who has no experience whatever is appointed clerk of works.  I might say also that in the County Galway, in the case of some of those housing schemes with engineers in charge, I find the assistant surveyor in charge of roads in the Connemara district; I find the assistant surveyor also in charge of a housing scheme in the Gort district; I also find that assistant surveyor recently appointed as architect to the mental hospital at Ballinasloe. Now that man cannot give to those schemes the attention which they require.  It cannot be done.  You travel from Connemara practically into the constituency of Clare; you travel from the same place practically into Athlone; the same man has to cover all that ground.  He cannot do it, and he has not a clerk of works who is able to carry out the work in his absence.  With that portion of Deputy Davin's statement I certainly agree. I know that, as Deputy Davin said, the Housing Board are doing very good work.  It is not their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that where you have an assistant surveyor in charge of housing he should be in charge of housing just in the one district where he is in charge of roads. He should not stir outside that.  If the assistant surveyor attends to housing and roads in his particular area he is doing good work.  You have plenty of qualified men to take charge of hospitals and other buildings that may be erected.  There is another point of Deputy Davin's with which I do not agree, and that is in regard to houses costing £250.  I know that down in my constituency the contract price of a particular house is £190.  As a contractor myself, I do not see how it is <Col N="851" /> done.  I do not see how you can have a house built for £190.  It cannot be done.  No matter what the contractor does I do not believe he can give a satisfactory house for that price. Deputy Davin also raised a point about direct contracts.  I will ask the Minister to give the prices in both cases&mdash;the houses built by direct labour and the houses built by genuine contractors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>You will not get work out of labour.  &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; Deputy Donnelly says.  Why should you advance £50 on a £250 house? Why should the taxpayer or the ratepayer be asked to pay for that particular labourer who is told, before the house is started, that he is going to get that house at 3/6 a week? When the house is built by direct labour it costs £50 extra, which means at least an extra 6d. per week.  The labourer will tell you at once that that was not his agreement.  The only other man who has to pay then is the ratepayer of the county.  I should like the Minister, in his reply, to deal with that aspect of the matter.  I am just giving the figures as I know them from my own experience.  Deputy Davin also raised the matter of cement blocks.  I quite agree with Deputy Davin on that.  I do not believe that cement blocks, with which I have seen some houses around the country being built, could be a success, or that you could have a good house built with them.  I myself believe in mass concrete; it may be a failing of mine, but I believe it.  Earlier in the debate <Col N="852" /> the question of floor space was raised. Even in the former Government's time I think the floor space was as low as 1,000 square feet.  It is 1,250 square feet at the present time.  The idea at the back of that was that the man who was able to pay should build a house out of his own pocket.  That has not been effective, because the man who is able to pay is building a house of 1,250 square feet; he is getting the £45 grant, and as soon as the inspector passes it, or a year afterwards, he puts up a porch or some annex which makes an eyesore out of a pretty good house.  I would ask the Minister to consider extending that figure to 1,500 square feet.  You will then have a good house.  You will have a house that certainly will be lasting, and a house that looks well.  Deputy Kennedy raised the matter of utility societies.  I do not agree that they are very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Merchants throughout the country who supply the materials&mdash;it may be only in the rural districts it happens; Deputy Belton does not believe it happens in Dublin&mdash; find great difficulty in getting their money.  There should be some arrangement that where a grant for a particular house is paid some guarantee should be given to the merchant that he will be paid up to the amount of the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter arises again in the construction of labourers' cottages.  We saw in last Thursday's newspapers, and again yesterday, reports relating to some of these housing schemes.  In Thursday's newspapers there was a reference to a housing scheme which was opened about 12 months ago by the Minister for Local Government in the County Kildare.  Several of these new houses, the report stated, have been condemned by the local medical officer of health and the county medical officer of health.  I think the county medical officer of health condemned at least 12 of them as not being fit for human habitation.  He reported that, during the recent snow storm, the snow came in not merely through the roofs but through the ceilings and lodged <Col N="853" /> on the floors.  The people had to leave these houses which were built only 12 months ago.  I believe these houses were roofed with concrete tiles.  A report, much to the same effect, appeared in yesterday's newspapers in relation to new houses built not long ago in Cashel.  I do not know whether the defects in these houses were due to the concrete tiles used or to the laying of them.</P>
    <P>I do say, however, that we went much too fast in the use of concrete tiles for roofing houses.  We should first have tested them and satisfied ourselves that they were of such a quality as to be able to bear up against the most severe weather.  I always felt myself that you could never do a really good job if you used concrete tiles.  There is the point, too, that there is nothing Irish about them, and, therefore, there is no use in saying that this is an Irish industry. I do not know why we should be so fond of using them.  They make a very heavy roof.  We have plenty of slate quarries throughout the country, and if they were properly developed we could have all the slates that we require for the housing schemes that are being carried out by the Government. Instead of doing that, we adopt a new idea and use these concrete tiles which, from what I have seen of them, can never be watertight.  They are not Irish.  The machines used for making them are British, the cement is Belgian and the dye used is German.  Yet, in spite of all that, we are advised to develop what is described as an Irish industry.  It is nothing of the sort. My advice would be to concentrate more on the development of our slate quarries.  If the people who own the quarries are not prepared to develop them, then the Government should take power to do so in order that good Irish material may be made available to put sound roofs on the houses that are going up.</P>
    <P>I would again impress on the Minister the desirability of extending the floor space to, say, 1,500 feet.  I agree that some very good houses are being built throughout the country by individuals, but they are being spoiled by allowing annexes to be built to them a year or so after their erection.  My suggestion is that they should be built in a solid <Col N="854" /> block, and if that is insisted on.  I believe you will get people to take advantage of the grant of £45.  I wish, again, to refer to the appointment of clerks of works.  I would appeal to the Minister to see that qualified men are appointed.  I do not care whether these men are B.A.s or just practical men. At any rate, see that they know their job, and that you have good engineers responsible for the different housing schemes.  Let the assistant surveyors deal with the housing schemes and roads in their own districts.  If that is insisted on, you will have good work done.  Let them not be going from one end of the county to the other, as is happening in the County Galway&mdash;from road work in Clifden to housing schemes in Gort, and into Athlone as regards hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot agree with my colleague Deputy Davin in one thing that he said towards the close of his speech, when he suggested that the Minister ought to go a little slower with his housing schemes, so as to get rid of some of the unsatisfactory contractors referred to by the Deputy. I do not regard that as a sufficient reason for slowing down building activity in the country.  It is a pleasure to discuss a question like this in the House, especially when we find that practically all are agreed that the Minister is doing wonderful work in connection with housing.  The figures quoted show that wonderful progress has been made in this respect under the Minister's administration.  It would be a pity, therefore, in my opinion, if there was any slowing down in building activity.  I do not want to introduce a controversial spirit into this discussion, and whatever may be said on other questions, I do not think that anyone will accuse the Government of falling down on their promises in the matter of housing.  Therefore, I do not think that the reason advanced by Deputy Davin for a slowing down process is a good one.  After all, are not these building contracts given out under certain conditions?  As I understand the position, the bigger the contract the more strict are the conditions laid down.  There is a time-limit fixed within which contracts must <Col N="855" /> be completed.  Deputy Davin seems to think that a good deal of the trouble is due to lack of supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>My point was that the contracts are not being completed within the time laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnDonnelly" hpid="Mr. Donnelly Mr. Donnelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, a penalty can be inflicted if a contract is not completed within the period specified. Why are not the penalties enforced against contractors who default in that respect?  Contractors, surely, will find it more to their advantage to do the work within the specified time than to leave themselves open to a fine if they fail to meet their obligations in that respect.  I do agree to a certain extent with what Deputy Brodrick and Deputy Davin said about the cement blocks.  It certainly is a strange sight to see houses, as you sometimes see them, in this country built of cement blocks on top of a granite quarry.  That seems ridiculous. Perhaps, in what I have to say about these cement blocks my friend Deputy Tom Kelly will agree with me.  It is this: that if some time or other we have in this country a very severe, long continued frost, I fear some of these cement block houses may melt away when the thaw sets in.  I appeal to the Minister to see that something is done to get rid of the use of that type of material in the execution of his house building schemes which, otherwise, are going ahead so successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all, quantity is not everything. Quality must also be taken into account.  The quality of the house that you build is, in my opinion, more important than the number you build. The Minister is in charge of a very efficient Department, particularly the house building section with which we are concerned at the moment.  Therefore. I would appeal to him to see that the quality of the houses erected will not suffer, no matter how speedily his schemes are pushed ahead.  Deputy Tom Kelly, in the course of his speech, made a plea for the eradication of the slums.  The Government in their housing programme are dealing with that evil, but we should take care that we will <Col N="856" /> not have new slums in another 25 or 30 years.  If slums are to be rooted out now in our cities and towns, care ought to be taken that the houses erected to replace them will be of such quality that they will last for very many years.  The reason why I am so much opposed to the use of cement is this: that I have seen some of the houses built of cement in the Minister's own constituency.  In this connection I was very much impressed by the speech of Deputy Kelly.  I have seen some of those houses built of cement crack after three or four months' occupation, the result being that they had to be put into the hands of the contractor for repairs. As to the supervision exercised in their erection I am not able to speak. At the moment I have one of these houses in mind.  The ironic thing about it is this: that three or four months after it was occupied the person who built it came and warned the woman of the house that, as the little boundary wall outside was dangerous, it would be advisable for her to keep the children inside in the house.  He said the wall was dangerous and might fall.  As a matter of fact it did fall.  The rent of the house was £1 12s. 6d. a week, and the occupier was a working man earning £3 10s. 0d. a week.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  As I have said, I am not able to speak of the kind of supervision that was exercised in the erection of that house, but I do say that great care ought to be taken in the giving out of the contracts. The putting of inferior material into these houses ought to be stopped. I am sure there is no one more keenly interested in seeing that kind of thing stopped than the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the direct labour system might prove to be a good way of getting rid of those unsatisfactory <Col N="857" /> contractors referred to by Deputy Davin.  I do not agree with the views expressed by Deputy Brodrick, and if my vote were to decide the matter as between the contract system and the direct labour system, then it would go every time in favour of direct labour, because it comes down eventually to this: that competent officials and competent people will be in charge and the work will be more satisfactory.  If it is true, as has been the case made about the employment of these contractors, that that may be a reason for slowing up the work, why not eliminate the contractors and go ahead at the same speed?  If that is the case, then get rid of them altogether. There is an efficient Department dealing with the matter, and even though it might mean the appointment of a few additional inspectors, in order to get the work efficiently done, why not do that?</P>

      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but this is one of the things that we cannot be accused of breaking our words about.  The building of houses in the rural districts and in the cities is quite as important, in my opinion, as the settlement of the land question or as the question of the land annuities.  It is quite as important as any of the other things we discussed in this House many a time.  This is a question also in connection with which we can go ahead much quicker at the same time, because we have more unanimity on the matter.  All Parties are more or less agreed on this question of housing.  Therefore, I say that if these contractors are in the way, get rid of them.  If a public board will not do it, the Minister's Department can do it.  I believe that there is too much patience altogether in this matter, and too much patience in this matter is not fair to the people who are waiting for the houses.  Too much patience should not be accorded either to a local authority or a contractor or anybody else, if they are standing in the way of the solution of this problem. problem.</P>

      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, although some of the matters have been already referred to.  It is pleasant to be able to tell the Minister something that he knows of officially already but about which, perhaps, he has not got the fullest information; and that is that in many parts of the country, and notably the part of the country from which I come, in connection with the housing grants given to private persons, there has been a tremendous change for the better.  The appearance of the countryside, as a result of grants given to individuals&mdash;workers in many cases, small farmers in many other cases&mdash; and as a result of reconstruction grants, has been entirely transformed. I know that the Minister would be very happy to get some fuller information on what is undoubtedly a revolution in housing in country districts.  I may tell the Minister and the House that there is no exaggeration in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy Davin in saying that the time has come for giving direct labour a very definite place in housing policy.  Direct labour has been proved to be an unqualified success in other directions.  Up to some years ago, it was regarded with a good deal of suspicion, even in the matter of maintaining roads, and I suspect that, locally, a good deal of the opposition to direct labour at the present time arises from the fact that, from the official point of view locally, it entails more trouble&mdash;that there is more difficulty in making up wages sheets and matters of that kind&mdash;and, consequently, it is avoided.  I believe, however, that it is entirely the better policy, and that it will more easily eliminate defective work.  I believe that it would have been a very good job for this country if direct labour had been embarked upon many years ago when labourers' cottages were being erected through the country.  In many parts of the country we have standing monuments to the inefficiency of the manner in which labourers' cottages were erected at that time.  Even if the employment of direct labour were to involve a little more expense, <Col N="859" /> there would be ample compensation in the provision of a better type of house, and I do not think that the tenants of these cottages would grudge the little extra rent that it might entail on them as that would be saved in the knowledge that they would have good houses.  Neither do I accept the view that it would be much more expensive. It has been carried out very successfully in certain areas.  As a matter of fact, I think it is only recently that at least one board of health constructed a number of labourers' cottages by direct labour.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give some immediate consideration to that aspect of the housing problem, and that in future local authorities will be definitely encouraged&mdash;and they need some encouragement in that direction&mdash;to give direct labour a place in their building programmes, even in a limited way, for some time, so as to ascertain, if there are still any doubts on the matter, the value of this method of erecting houses.</P>
    <P>There is, in the case of some local authorities, still a good deal of reluctance to proceed as energetically as they might in regard to housing schemes for the smaller towns and villages I am referring here to towns and villages that have not got urban powers.  I hope that the Minister will press very strongly the need for activity of that sort.  A good deal has been done in urban towns, but in the small towns and villages in the rural areas, the position is still extremely bad and I hope the Minister will press very strongly for immediate results in that direction and will see that no objections of any kind&mdash;because, generally, the objections advanced will be frivolous&mdash;will be allowed to stand in the way of that particular improvement, which will be bringing the places in question into line with the general progress that has been made in the matter of housing.</P>
    <P>There was one provision in the Housing Act which has been flagrantly disregarded and disobeyed, and I want to draw the Minister's attention particularly to it.  I refer to the stipulation in regard to wages.  The provision <Col N="860" /> in the Housing Act was all very well and it pretty definitely conveyed the intention of the Oireachtas, but it has been found, and I am sure the Minister knows this, that very large numbers of persons are successfully evading that provision.  I should like the Minister to consider, if necessary, the provision of a more definite clause in the Act in regard to this question of wages.  I think it is a scandal and an incentive to defective work that skilled artisans and unskilled workers should get far less than a reasonable wage for their work in connection with the housing schemes.  There are many cases where local authorities are in this conspiracy to disregard the provisions of the Act and, if there is not a definite trade union standard in a particular part of the rural district concerned, there is&mdash;and I know cases where it arises&mdash;a standard of wages by the local authority for other workers.  I think that that could be regarded at least as a sufficient guiding line for the purpose of interpreting this particular clause regarding trade union wages in the Housing Act.  As it is, it is very much more honoured in the breach than in the observance.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to say &mdash;I have said it on more than one occasion in this House before, but it deserves to be mentioned more especially in this connection&mdash;is that all of us on this side of the House and, I think, on all sides of the House, are very much indebted to the members and officials of the Housing Department for the assistance we have always got in our efforts to promote housing, and for the assistance of local authorities throughout the country in this direction.  We have been very well and very courteously met in regard to representations made from time to time.  We appreciate that all the more having regard to the pressure at which the Department worked during the last few years.  I think it is right that that should be said here.  I want to congratulate the Minister on the manner in which the officials of the Department have handled their work and have entered into the spirit of the campaign to create a revolution in <Col N="861" /> the matter of housing in the country. With some attention to the points that have arisen in the debate, I think there can be no doubt whatever about the Bill being an outstanding success.  All that is needed is some revision of certain matters to enable the work to be continued until the ideals of members of the House, on all sides, in regard to housing are fully realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister for Local Government and Public Health what is a public utility society?  I understood a public utility society bore some analogy to a housing or building association but my experience in rural Ireland is that a builders' supplier invites his customers to pay him a shilling and join a particular building society which that builders' supplier organises.  As a result of contributing one shilling to the builders' supplier, that individual can get £10 more of a grant than his neighbour can.  Outside that transaction, I cannot discover any function which is being discharged by public utility societies in rural Ireland.  I should be glad to hear from Deputies or from the Minister what is their experience as to the usefulness of these public utility societies, for I can discover none whatever beyond the collection of the shilling by the builders' supplier and the payment of the extra £10 grant to the individual who has the foresight to pay a shilling to the builders' provider.  There is an evil inherent in that, because there are certain individuals, with a quixotic sense of duty, and they do not feel entitled to form a public utility society when they cannot see its serving any useful purpose.  The result is that their customers have got to do without the extra £10 grant or that they go to a builders' provider who is prepared to form a public utility society in order to get the £10 grant.  I think that is an evil.  I mentioned the matter on two occasions before in this House.  I suggest to the Minister that he should define quite clearly what the duties of a public utility society are, if they exist, and that he should enforce them very <Col N="862" /> vigorously and insist on every public utility society carrying out all the duties that he ascribes to such an organisation.  Unless he is in a position to do that, he ought to abolish the difference between the grant given to a private individual and that given to a member of a public utility society and bring each of them up to the £80 level.  I do not want to labour that point, because Deputies and the Minister must be as familiar with the details as I am.</P>
      <P>I want to ask another question in regard to a matter which I have raised here before.  Has the Minister made up his mind to deal with the ribbon-building evil?  The present situation is that a local authority announces its intention of building a number of labourers' cottages or other houses in the neighbourhood of a town.  The potential tenants of these houses are pretty well known and an agitation is immediately started to have the houses built in a desirable location.  Of course, opinions differ as to what is a desirable location for the cottage of a married man with a family of young children, but I think Deputies will agree with me that the average man in the country likes to have his house built on a main road, and the result is that you get a regular local agitation started to erect 15 or 20 cottages in a string along a main road over which motor cars and other rapid-moving traffic are continually passing.  That, to my mind, is a most unsuitable arrangement.  It is unsuitable from that point of view and unsuitable from any point of view.  If the local authority proceeds to acquire a long piece of land, all of which is fronting on the main road, the owner of the land is entitled in justice to him to get a disproportionate compensation for the area of land acquired.  If you take the entire frontage of a man's property, of course you have got to pay for it, whereas if you take a whole field and develop it&mdash;run a road in through it and build houses in on the land&mdash;the price for the acreage acquired would not be at all so high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a third element in it and that is the purely aesthetic element. Houses built in rows have a monotonous appearance.  They do not at all <Col N="863" /> improve the general appearance of the countryside.  A similar number of houses built on a well-developed field might constitute a considerable contribution to the scenic amenities of the neighbourhood if the job were properly done.  This evil assumed such proportions in Great Britain that special legislation was introduced to abate and make an end of it and, in my opinion, it is beginning to assume very formidable dimensions here.  I do not think special legislation is necessary here because I believe, through the machinery for housing grants, the Minister could bring adequate pressure to bear on local authorities and others to prevent ribbon building.  It will be too late to take the necessary steps when the ribbon building is done.</P>
    <P>I am convinced from my own experience of local bodies and from living in the country, that all local bodies want is the encouragement of strong representations by the Minister to abandon ribbon building and develop on town-planning lines immediately.  There is no difficulty at all about it in rural Ireland.  There is plenty of land available.  It is going to be more economical because, admittedly&mdash;and this is a case which will be put up by county engineers&mdash;if you try to develop a field, the cost of making a road into the field or of bringing one service or another into the field, on which houses will be built, is going to be considerable, but in my submission you will economise by acquiring the whole field instead of buying a long frontage, and you will almost completely compensate for any additional expense in developing the land instead of building in strips and ribbons along the road.</P>
    <P>Of course, I am principally interested in the West of Ireland.  I know that everybody speaks now of concrete tiles and slates.  Has nobody a word to say for thatch?  Why should the countryside be studiously discouraged from using thatch roofs?  They are very attractive to look at, and they are extremely effective.  They are cool in summer and very warm in winter.  They have this enormous additional advantage: that they provide invaluable constant work for craftsmen in the country.  There are very few crafts <Col N="864" /> being left in the country.  It is very hard for any man pursuing a craft such as shoemaking or smithy work or thatching, or weaving and spinning&mdash; all these crafts are dying out of the country.</P>

      <P>The most of them.  I come from a part of the country where very many of the people live in houses with thatched roofs, and I never heard it suggested anywhere that they gave rise to any disease or sickness that was not equally prevalent under a tiled roof or a slated roof.  They had this quality in any case, that they kept the house dry and warm, and from what I hear about the houses with tiled roofs, they can do neither one nor the other. One does not expect a roof to cure all the ills of man, from scarlatina to whooping cough, but it is expected at least to keep the house dry and warm. I maintain that the thatched roof does that effectively.  In addition, it provides a very good livelihood and a constant livelihood for rural craftsmen, and I throw out this suggestion to attract the Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government, that it provides about the only purpose for which you can use wheaten straw.</P>

Thatch is a much better roof for the houses, particularly in the West of Ireland, than concrete tiles, and it has the other advantages to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that where there are repairs to be carried out on country houses, especially in the West of Ireland, due consideration should be given to any proposals for repairs or alternations which would incorporate the restoration of a thatched house rather than the alteration of the house with a tiled or slated roof.  I would have no objection in the type of case that frequently happens.  For instance, somebody returns to the neighbourhood from abroad or from a position in another part of Ireland, and determines to abandon the house in which the old people are living and build a new house.  I would have no hesitation in giving a grant to such a person if he proposed to build on the holding another thatched house to take the place of the old thatched house he proposed to abandon and out of which he proposed to take the father and mother.  The Deputy is familiar with the kind of thing that happens.  A great many people would laugh at such a suggestion.  They would say: &ldquo;If you build a new one, of course it will be either slated or tiled.&rdquo;  In such a case the Department should say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; If you examine the respective merits of the various roofing materials available, there is no reason to assume that thatch is the least suitable.</P>

What I have mentioned was the only evidence of activity that I saw, and it did not seem that the Housing Board was going to be given very much rope to do anything except look dumb.  The whole House will wait with interest and anxiety to hear from the Minister what assistance and guidance he has received from the Housing Board and the pitfalls out of which he has been guided by their prudent intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of adverse comment on contractors.  We are led to believe that if we abandoned the system of giving houses to contractors and employ direct labour, a great many of the unsatisfactory elements in the present housing situation will be eliminated.  I cannot follow that reasoning.  My experience on a local body is that we prepare a scheme from specifications which are pretty exhaustive and contracts are entered into, the lowest tender being accepted provided the contractor can put up the bail bonds to carry out his contract according to specification. <Col N="867" /> Then the local authority fixes the day to begin and the day for the completion of the contract, and there is a fine provision incorporated in the agreement.  The local authority appoints its own clerk of works, who is supposed to devote the greater part of his time to supervising the cottages he is put over.  If he has any doubt as to the correctness of the contractor's procedure, he has full authority to communicate with the county engineer, who will confirm or correct his misapprehensions. If the clerk of works feels that something is being done that might be concealed by other work by the time the county engineer arrives, he can stop the contractor. If the stoppage runs into a day, on the country engineer's certificate some kind of allowance can be made for that in the contract period of time.  If you prepare your specification and see that the building is crected according to the specification, what advantage can there be derived from direct labour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>None, if the contracts are carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What we really want are good clerks of works.  What we really want is to ensure that on each cottage contract there will be a man who is really competent to command the contractor.  Of course that is what we frequently have not got.  We either have a man on whose integrity full dependence cannot be placed or else we have a perfectly honest, well-meaning fellow who has not the knowledge or authority to keep a contractor in his place and who allows the contractor, to use the vernacular, to get away with the murder.  I have no doubt the Minister can get a good deal of that right by admonishing the county engineers to remember that the clerk of works is really only the county engineer's agent, and if there is any failure on the part of the clerk of works to correct the contractor or prevent him doing any concealed bad work, that the responsibility will be the county engineer's and he will have to answer for it.  If we take that attitude, and I think we should, there ought to be this change in the present <Col N="868" /> procedure.  At the present time the local authority appoints the clerk of works, quite independent of the county surveyor.  If you want to make the county surveyor ultimately responsible for the houses built in his area, then you must leave the work of the clerk of works to the county engineer.</P>

      <P>It may be in some bodies, but it is not, so far as I am aware, in the Roscommon Board of Health.  My recollection is that we there actually appoint clerks of works ourselves.  I am not prepared to say that positively, but that is my recollection.  Wherever that is the case, there should be a change, and the local authority should say to the county engineer: &ldquo;We are responsible to the Minister for getting these houses properly built, and you are the responsible person to see that these contractors carry out their bond; if you find it necessary to appoint deputies, in the shape of several clerks of works, in order to give you time to do your normal work, appoint them, but, remember, it is your duty to see that they are efficient men, and it is no excuse, if these houses proceed to fall down, to come back to us and say: `The clerk of works let me down'; he is yours, and if you do not get the right man you must shoulder the responsibility for anything that goes wrong.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin spoke to-day of some contractor who compelled a workman's wife to deal in his shop and deducted from the workman's wages the amount of the weekly bill.  That is not a matter with which the Minister should concern himself at all, because, if the workman's wife is a wise woman she will continue dealing there so long as the contractor orders her to do so, and get as much goods as she can, and, when the term of the contract of labour is finished, let her sue the shopkeeper under the Truck Act and recover all the money she paid, and the shopkeeper can then sue her for goods supplied.</P>

My colleague from Galway in decrying cement tiles to-day said that there were plenty slate quarries in the country to provide all the slates we want.

      <P>They cannot supply any at all except to those who have long standing contracts with them.  If you or I want a wagon of slates to-morrow, Killaloe will not look at our order because their supplies are booked up for a considerable time ahead.  The same is true of the Donegal slate quarries, so far as I am aware. Carrick is closed up.  I think there is a slate quarry in Louisburgh, but I do not think that any slates are available there.</P>
      <P>That slate problem is, and has been for the last three years, a very great problem.  If there are these slate quarries to which my colleague from Galway has referred, I should like to know where they are, because there are many of us who would very gladly undertake to develop any good slate quarry that is available.  I know that I was looking for such a one two years ago and I could not find any slate quarry of that character.  The only one I came across would take about £15,000 to put into proper condition in order to get slates out of it at all, because it had been piled up with debris for years and the business of cleaning the quarry in itself would have required a very large capital sum. I think Deputies would do the Minister for Local Government a great service if they would communicate to him the location of good slate quarries and ask him to get into touch with the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to finding persons prepared to exploit them and to open them for the public welfare.  I do not think he will have the slightest difficulty in finding any number to open, if they would produce the type of slate which Irish builders are employing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear what Deputy Thomas Kelly had to say, but <Col N="871" /> I understand he referred to the slums. Is the Minister satisfied that the slum problem is being dealt with as rapidly as it should be?  I am fully aware of the great difficulties that obtain in eradicating the slums from the City of Dublin, but we have been four years at it now.  Can the Minister conscientiously say that any very great impression has been made on the slum problem in Dublin?  I must confess that I see very little impression being made upon it.  I know that an enormous number of houses are being built in Crumlin, and around the city, but, for some mysterious reason, these new houses do not seem to be drawing the people out of the tenements.  It is difficult to understand who are going into them, but it seems to me that there are just as many people in Dominick Street, Gloucester Street, Werburgh Street and the other slum districts.</P>

      <P>The rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will perhaps explain that.  I have lived all my life in the middle of a slum and it is just as slummy now as it was 20 years ago.  I was told, I think, two years ago, that the whole of that area bounded by Marlborough Street, Gloucester Street, Summerhill and Gardiner Street was condemned for clearance.  I do not see any sign of anything being done.  I do not want to minimise the difficulties; I recognise that they are immense, particularly when dealing with a fairly large city like Dublin, but I do feel that we do not seem to be making even an encouraging inroad on the problem in this city.  Some fine blocks of flats have been built.  There are very fine flats in the neighbourhood of the Four Courts, and it does seem odd to me that further progress cannot be made more rapidly in building small houses suitable for the tenants of these tenement houses, or, if it must be flats, blocks of flats in the city to accommodate these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the risk of creating some indignation, I want to put this to the Minister: I think that where you have an open space in the City of Dublin the first duty on the Government is to preserve that open space.  If you <Col N="872" /> determine that it is no longer possible to preserve it, I do not think any building should be erected upon it, save houses for that type of person who the Government make up their mind cannot be asked to go outside the city.  So far as I can see, very extensive building operations have been begun in Parnell Square.  I suppose that it is an extension of the Rotunda Hospital.  I cannot help feeling that it would be much better if some alternative accommodation had been supplied to the Rotunda Hospital, and that if that square was utilised for the purpose of building at all, it should have been utilised as a space upon which flats might be erected and to open up a pathway to Gloucester Street, Marlborough Street, Gardiner Street, Summerhill and so on.  I know the great difficulty in tackling the existing order is to find any substantial piece of ground upon which to build houses near to the vacated slums or to effect clearance of the slums so as to erect decent flats and gradually to wipe out the whole slum problem.</P>
    <P>I should be sorry to see any existing open spaces built over in the city, because we have too few of them, but if you are going to build on open spaces it does seem to me that housing ought to be the scheme.  Dublin is a great problem, but why should there be, in smaller cities like Limerick, as bad houses are there are in Dublin?  I went for a stroll down the quays in Limerick and the last thing I expected to see were tenement houses.  But the fact is I found as bad tenements in the streets of Limerick as we have in Dublin.  It amazed me.  One could walk across the City of Limerick in half an hour.  It cannot be a hardship for any workman, in Limerick, to live in a house on the outskirts of the city. From any part of the city he could walk home, not to talk at all of cycling home, in less than ten minutes.  There the problem should be simple.  I think if the Minister wants to give an earnest of his readiness to make good in regard to urban slums, he ought to insist that, in cities the size of Limerick, tenement houses will not be tolerated; he should build houses for the workers on the outskirts of the <Col N="873" /> towns, and pull down the tenements in the cities and towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the building of labourers' cottages in towns, and said that while a good deal has been done he was not satisfied that sufficient had been done to provide accommodation of this character in villages and rural areas.  Speaking for the county that I know, we are building all the houses that were certified to be necessary under the survey taken under the Minister's direction about nine months ago.  I think Deputy Murphy, and other Deputies, have not worked out this question.  Where are we to draw the line with reference to the type of tenant we can put into subsidised cottages?  The Labourers Acts are interpreted so widely, so far as I know, that persons working in industrial pursuits in rural areas are classed as agricultural labourers and are put into labourers' cottages, with the result that I know men earning £3 10s. a week who have got labourers' cottages.  These cottages are subsidised to the tune of £2 10s. a year, and that subsidy is paid by small farmers in the county.  There is not a single small farmer in that county earning £2 10s. a week, and there are very few in this country, taking one with another, earning £3 10s. a week. It does, therefore, seem to me somewhat incongruous to subsidise a house for a man earning £3 10s. a week out of the pockets of men who are not earning more than 25/- a week.  Surely the time has come to review that situation. It can be reviewed without in any way checking the building of houses.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest objection to building houses for everybody if people pay an economic rent&mdash;that is, a rent that would provide for sinking fund and interest to pay off the capital expended in the erection of the house. It is a good thing to make capital available in that way for deserving citizens.  There is no need for the average man earning good wages being allowed into a labourer's cottage. There ought to be a different rent for a man earning wages in industrial and commercial pursuits as opposed to a labourer working on the land.  These <Col N="874" /> houses were originally designed to help the agricultural labourers who could not be expected to pay as high rent out of their earnings, as agricultural labourers, as people could pay out of commercial or industrial pursuits.  You may fix an uneconomic rent for an agricultural labourer, but I think if you set a house to a person who is not earning agricultural wages, but who is earning a higher wage in industry or commerce, a rent should be fixed for him that would be an economic rent.  If that is done there will be no difficulty in providing for everybody.  But I think the time has come when the Minister should consider the propriety of not letting subsidised houses to people who can pay an economic rent.</P>

      <P>The question of public utility societies was referred to.  There is one good service that would be lacking but for these utility societies, and that is the provision of credit for the very poor applicants for houses.  I am speaking now of the Breac-Ghaeltacht area.  I know places where no building would be done under the scheme without the assistance of a utility society, because the builders' suppliers would not give credit to the individual applicants. With the assistance of the utility society, that difficulty has been overcome.  I think that justifies the formation of these utility building societies and the extra £10 is, in my opinion, well justified.</P>

      <P>I only want to make a few remarks on housing as concerning the City and County of Dublin.  I have seen a good deal of houses in the country, but the remarks that I wish to make will be more particularly confined to the city.  We seem to have two points of view expressed here to-day&mdash;one by Deputy Belton, who advocates the continuance of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, and another by Deputy Kelly, who says that every penny the Corporation have ought to be spent on the housing of the working classes, and that there is nothing to give in respect of the acquisition of small dwellings.  I rose to make a few remarks because I know what Deputy Kelly has said represents a view which is shared by other persons and, I think, officially by the Corporation.  At the same time, there is another point of view which should be placed before the Minister before this debate concludes.  There is a great deal of truth in the remarks of both Deputy Belton and Deputy Kelly. Deputy Belton is quite right when he says that the building of a number of the cheaper houses bought out under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, with money provided by the Corporation, afforded considerable employment. Those houses have been purchased by people who would, at least, have been competitors for some of the Corporation houses.  Deputy Kelly tries to meet that argument by asking &ldquo;What about the houses costing up to £1,000?  It was not out of slums that the people who built those houses came.&rdquo;  There is no doubt about that, but these people did not roost in the trees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> The housing problem as regards Dublin City and County is a very grave one.  It is a highly specialised problem and I think I am right in saying that we had about 20 minutes devoted to the discussion of it in the last three years.  That may be the reason why some Deputies wandered from the strict limitations of the debate on this Bill. I am afraid, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I also shall have to claim your indulgence.  I hope I shall receive your indulgence, because if other Deputies have wandered fairly widely from the Bill, considering the time which has been allotted for some years to this subject, you might quite fairly put the blame on the Government.</P>
    <P>To continue, Deputy Kelly is quite right, in my opinion, when he says that the corporation require all the money they can get.  They can only raise a certain amount of money per year and a considerable amount of detail is involved in shifting people out of houses and putting them into other houses.  There are really three sources of supply for the working classes and the very poor people who, I might say, are below the artisans.  A limited number of the small dwellings in which Deputy Belton is interested are acquired by those people.  Of course, we have nothing to say to what the corporation are doing.  They are doing their best to house the people as quickly as possible.  To show that the problem is very acute, I may mention that it is not so long ago since the Lord Mayor said in this House that somebody had come to him saying that he could not get even a single room at a rent of 10/-.  That shows how fierce is the demand for that class of house.</P>
    <P>There is another point on which, I think, Deputy Kelly would agree with me.  A number of houses are really unfit for human habitation.  When they are brought to the notice of the corporation, they admit that, but say that they have no alternative accommodation and that they cannot put the inhabitants out under canvas in the park.  Therefore, they leave the houses standing.  I should like to point out that every city is going through a process of evolution and that Dublin is sharing in this process.  Houses are <Col N="877" /> possibly occupied, in the first place, by very wealthy people.  I speak now of the bigger houses.  Later, they are occupied by people of moderate wealth. Then, they are turned, perhaps, into lodging houses.  Then they become fairly good tenement houses and they ultimately wind up by being tenement houses unfit for human habitation. They are then pulled down.  The suggestion I propose to make would not be an ideal solution of the problem but, in the present state of housing in this city, I do not think it should be disregarded.  The man who took up the £1,000 house to which Deputy Kelly alluded came, presumably, out of a house in the city which had started on the downward way.  As I suggested, he did not roost in a tree.  It displaces another house at the end of the line in that class, and enables somebody to shift up in the lodging house line, and another house is added to the tenement class.  Anybody who goes through the streets of Dublin knows that neighbourhoods which at one time were inhabited by well-to-do people have passed through a gradual state of decay, until they are occupied now by the very poorest class of the population. I do not know whether the House will agree with me but in my view, during the present crisis, anybody who puts up a house on the outskirts of Dublin, and that somebody is shifted in from the City of Dublin, gives a contribution to the solution of the housing of the working classes.  I do not suggest that that is anything more than a temporary solution.  The ideal solution is that they ought to be housed in separate houses, and in the case of old people, and married people without children, that they should be in flats.  I suggest to the Minister that at present we cannot afford to dispense with any of the present sources of supply of houses, namely, corporation houses in their own sphere, and the small dwellings which Deputy Belton has pressed for.  My contention is that if that supply were considerably accelerated, it would in turn release houses in the city area.  A valuable though temporary solution of the difficulty would be helped along by having more <Col N="878" /> houses vacant in the city.  I know that I have been treading very near the border line, and I thank you, A Chinn Comhairle, for your kindness in letting me make these remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a pretty long and a fairly exhaustive discussion on housing this afternoon, for which I thank the various Deputies who spoke, though 90 per cent. of them were, with all respect to the Chair, out or order and talked on anything but what is in the Bill.  Nevertheless, their remarks were of interest to me and their criticisms, so far as they were levelled at the Bill, are accepted with the greatest goodwill by me.  In most cases, if not in all cases, I think they were meant to be helpful.  The Bill does not purport to deal with costs at all or with the building of houses by local authorities.  That is outside the scope of the Bill, though 90 per cent. of the talk was on that subject.  I never resent anybody talking on housing.  I think Deputy Dockrell's recollection must be at fault where he suggests that the Government are at fault for not providing more time for discussions on housing.  There have been many opportunities, and if Deputies did not avail of them to discuss housing in Dublin it was not the fault of the Government.  Every year we have Estimates, and Supplementary Estimates sometimes, relating to local government and money for housing, on which Dublin could be discussed if any Deputy wished to do so.  However, that is aside from the main purpose of the Bill.  As the Ceann Comhairle has been so generous, and has allowed the discussion to range over a field outside the scope of the Bill, I shall take advantage of his generous mood to answer some of the criticisms, perhaps not exactly in the order in which suggestions were made, but as they occur to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy opened the discussion on the Bill with the suggestion that there were very heavy burdens being laid on local authorities, and upon the State by this housing legislation. The Deputy is right there.  Very heavy burdens are being laid on the State by the Oireachtas, at the <Col N="879" /> Government's suggestion, if you wish, and upon local authorities, and through that on the people as a whole in connection with housing.  I think the House and the country should be fully conscious of that.  Certainly the matter has been brought before them very frequently in the last few years.  It is not even since this Government took office that the housing question has been discussed. Considerable time has been given to it inside and outside this House and to suggested remedies for ending what every member of every Party realises is a grave and an urgent problem; that of ending the slums as soon as we can, and providing proper sanitary housing accommodation for dwellers in slums, and the working classes in general.  The proposition that housing must be provided for those who cannot afford to provide for themselves, by using State finances and local finances to that end, is one that is accepted.  People may discuss the amount of the burden.  I have stated ever since I sat in this House and discussed housing that it was going to be a very heavy burden indeed, one that would require not only considerable time but an enormous amount of money, as well as increasing the burdens on the State and on local authorities in order to deal adequately and efficiently with the problem.  I emphasised that several times here, and I suggested that the House and all Parties should realise that situation. I have invited criticism on the subject.</P>
    <P>No one has attempted to say that we should not spend all the money that is necessary to end the housing problem, as we have known it in our day.  I am not at all adverse to Deputy Mulcahy or any one else calling attention to the amount of money that is being spent, as well as the additional burdens the State is bearing, and that local authorities are asked to bear&mdash;and that they are bearing willingly in connection with housing.  It is all to the good that that should be so, because I have often had it borne in upon me that some people in their exaggerated demands do not realise what the <Col N="880" /> State is doing.  I am talking now from the purely financial point of view of what local authorities are doing.  A great effort is being made, and generous grants have been put at the disposal of private persons, public utility societies, and local authorities&mdash;more generous than ever in the history of the country, and more generous in proportion to our resources probably than any other country, so far as I am aware.  That is all because the Oireachtas agrees with the Government, that the problem was so great that an effort should be made to find a solution of it.  The House has agreed with me when I have stated the proposition here that whatever money is required to find a proper and satisfactory solution to the housing problem must be found.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the question of unemployment and called attention to the rise in the unemployment figures which he gave for the last few years.  Certainly it is true that in the last 12 months there has been an increase in the number of men in the building trade who are on the unemployed register in the City and County of Dublin and in the country as a whole.  If you examine the total figures you will find that the unemployment is greatest in the City of Dublin.  That arose last year from stringency of money for house building.  It will be within the recollection of Deputies who read newspapers that the housing loan floated by the Dublin Corporation last year was not a success for one reason or another which we need not go into now.  The banks had to carry an unduly large share of the loan then floated.  But there has been a great change within the last few months.</P>
    <P>Some two months ago, however, when the last loan of £1,000,000 was floated by the Dublin Corporation, it was over-subscribed two and a half times.  That is a big change within less than 12 months, and I think it is largely due, as Deputy Kelly said, to the better financial position which the country as a whole and investors found themselves in, perhaps as a result of the financial operations of <Col N="881" /> the State directed by the Minister for Finance in the last 12 months.  But as a result of the stringency of money at that time the city manager found himself unable to provide money to finance the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, and he also slowed down the giving of contracts for building schemes that were well advanced and could have been gone on with at an earlier date if money had been available.  That accounts, I think, for the increased unemployment in the building trade as exhibited in the figures with regard to last year.  Building, however, is going to go ahead at a much greater rate in the current year.  The city manager has already accepted tenders for a number of large schemes and £250,000 has been made available for the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  That will put back into employment a great number of those in the building trades who have been on the unemployed register so far as Dublin City is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act has been referred to by different Deputies who spoke.  I believe that the Act is a useful one and has helped local authorities and private individuals to provide houses that would not be otherwise provided and at a much less cost to the State and to local authorities than if the Act had not been in operation.  I agree with a great deal Deputy Norton said with regard to the utility of the Act and the desirability of keeping it in operation and making finance available for it, especially in the City of Dublin.  But I am also in agreement with the suggestion as to limitation made by Deputy Kelly.  I believe that so far as the £1,000 house is concerned the field should be left to the private building speculator.  Usually the person who wants a house costing from £750 to £1,500 is able to provide the necessary finance out of his own resources.  The person who wants to live in a house of that kind in Dublin I believe can get money from the banks or other sources. At any rate, I do not think he is the type of person that the local authority ought to limit its resources or its credit in order to house.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> So far as local authorities and the Government are concerned, our main task is to wipe out the slums and provide proper sanitary and decent housing accommodation for those who are unable to provide it for themselves. That is our problem, and not to provide houses for persons in the City of Dublin or outside of it who wish to live in houses valued at £1,000 or £1,500, such as Deputy Kelly referred to.  But, with that limitation, I believe that the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act is a useful and valuable Act, and certainly in the urban areas it should be put into operation.  So far as the credit of the local authorities will allow, I should like to see it in operation everywhere that it can be prudently worked.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties with regard to its operation in rural areas under county councils.  Where people are holders of land under various forms of title under the Land Commission, legal difficulties have arisen where such people want to avail of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and so far we have found it next to impossible to get over these.  In addition to that, cases have been brought to my notice in one or two counties where there has been gross default.  In that case I would advise the local authorities concerned to make an example and go slow, if not to stop the operation of the scheme altogether, until those who have neglected their duty have been brought to their senses and the civic spirit in the neighbourhood generally has been improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised a point as to delays in paying grants.  I know that a couple of years ago there used to be pretty frequent complaints about delays.  So far as my personal experience as Minister is concerned, judging by the letters of complaint received, the complaints are much less frequent than they used to be with regard to the paying of grants to private persons and public utility societies for housing. Deputy Brennan also raised a point about the responsibility of the Local Government Department towards builders' providers who provide persons building their own houses with the assistance of grants with building material for the erection of those houses.  The Department of Local <Col N="883" /> Government and Public Health does not accept responsibility for the payment for goods supplied to any private persons by private builders, suppliers or others, except where private individuals building houses, having been notified that such grant will be available to them, have signed a form giving authority to the Local Government Department to pay the grant to the builders' providers.  That responsibility we take, and we will pay the grant to the builders' providers in the name of the person to whom the grant is given.  That grant is paid directly to the builders' providers.  They have got to get the signature of the grantee to it.  But further responsibility than that we do not take.  If persons to whom Deputy Brennan refers want to take risks other than those that prudent businessmen would normally take, well they must bear the consequences.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk in the early part of the debate about different kinds of contractors and bad contractors. We have not had many complaints about bad building or bad workmanship where large housing schemes are concerned.  Generally speaking from those builders, certainly in the City of Dublin and in the Cities of Cork and Limerick and other large towns and county boroughs where building schemes have been concluded, we have had no complaints.  I have seen work and seen building schemes completed for the last three years and, as to these contractors and their workmanship generally speaking, I must say, it has been very satisfactory.  The chief complaints which have reached me are, to a certain extent, complaints as to where labourers' cottages have been advertised, and where persons who had little or no experience in building were accepted as contractors for the building of two, three or four cottages.  They seldom get more than that.  Sometimes it is only one cottage, and it often happens that 12 months after that contract is signed and sealed the foundations of the cottage have not been begun.  That sort of thing has happened in several cases. But while the housing section of the Department of Local Government, in consultation with myself, has often <Col N="884" /> raised with the local authorities the advisability of allowing contracts go to people of that kind, we have been met frequently with deputations from the local T.Ds., members of the boards of health and county councils, urging us in the case of men who had sufficient financial backing and who were not builders themselves, that they would employ competent tradesmen to do the work.  We have frequently given way and the results are not always satisfactory. There are cases in Clare that I know of, there are cases in Leix that I know of and there are cases in other counties where cottages built by such contractors have had to be taken down because of very serious defects which had to be remedied.  There are cases where the Department have urged the local authorities, on the reports of our inspectors, to refuse further payment to those people until the defects were made right.</P>
    <P>We have had also difficulties about delays referred to by several Deputies who have spoken.  I suppose in a time like the present, when so much building is being done, it is natural to expect that many new people would come into building operations.  In Dublin City there are pretty competent builders, but a number of these were not in the building trade in Dublin City five years ago.  I could reckon at least a dozen of them who are carrying out pretty large contracts now who were not builders four or five years ago.  They get, I suppose, expert advice and competent workmen and, so far as I know, they have done, and continue to do, good work.</P>
    <P>It is where you have small men in the country, men who are building one or two cottages at a time, that the difficulties arise.  These men are without experience, and this is certainly a matter that requires very close inspection and very careful watching on our own part and on the part of the engineers and others connected with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Where there has been such a tremendous increase in the building business, it is natural to expect that some difficulties of this kind will arise. I know there are places where it has been found next to impossible to get tenders at all.  There are such areas. <Col N="885" /> We have asked these boards of health, at any rate when building labourers' cottages, to try and get the houses taken in groups, but there again we have found that it very often takes six or eight or ten months before they can get a contractor to take the cottages. Some of these cottages are scattered over the area and that is what causes most of the difficulty.  There is a cottage here, another cottage half a mile away, and others two or three miles away.  The contract in such cases does not offer a big enough financial profit to contractors to go into the business.  At any rate, for some reason or another, perhaps owing to the great stress of the times, owing to the great demand for building contractors and for building operatives, there have been difficulties and delays that perhaps, with greater experience, as time goes on, will disappear.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the system suggested by Deputies Norton, Murphy and others, of putting this type of building out to direct labour would or would not be a success.  I know that in some counties very good houses, at reasonable prices and good workmanship have been turned out under the direct labour system.  While that is so in some counties it is equally true that in other counties we have had under the direct labour system bad workmanship, delays and costly houses.  We have had both types of experiences and we have had them also under both types of schemes.  We have had difficulties under the direct labour system and we have had difficulties under the contractor system.  We cannot draw any very definite conclusions from these.</P>
    <P>There is this difference between direct labour and contracts that in the case of the contractor you can impose penalties.  There are often penalties clauses in the contracts.  But when it comes to the time to enforce them the boards of health are reluctant and they very seldom do it.  We sometimes force them to take action, but I cannot recall any one case in which we succeeded in getting the contractor to pay up.  Sometimes when we have got the local authority to the point of sueing the contractor for the penalties <Col N="886" /> it is found that the sureties offered are men of straw.  We meet things of that kind and these instances show the difficulties there are in carrying out to 100 per cent. the terms of the various contracts that had been entered into. There have been successes and there have been failures under the direct labour system and under the contract system as well.  There is no definite opinion in the Department against direct labour.  If a local authority, whether it be an urban council or a board of health, is strongly in favour of direct labour, and we are satisfied that they have a staff of engineers who will give satisfaction in the work, we have no objection&mdash;in principle, at any rate&mdash;to a scheme of direct labour in building being operated.</P>

      <P>We have permitted it in a lot of places.  In Grangegorman they have on the spot competent engineers, and men of experience in the building trade who can supervise the work.  Deputy Broderick to-day talked about an engineer who is an assistant county surveyor, and who is supervising roadwork in one part of the county and expected to supervise housing in another part of the county.  That kind of division of labour does not work out satisfactorily.  If the boards of health and the county councils would come together and organise their engineering staffs, giving one person full responsibility for designing and carrying through the work, direct labour if tried would probably work out better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton talked about the county council being obliged to accept the lowest tender.  That is not quite correct.  Provided the council or local authority concerned can show with reason that they have not confidence in the person who makes the tender, they are not obliged to accept the lowest tender.  They are obliged to accept the lowest tender only in cases where they cannot show that they have good grounds for refusing that lowest tender.  There have been cases, in my experience of local authorities, where after years of working it is discovered <Col N="887" /> that there is a certain number of contractors on whom you cannot rely to carry out their work and be subject to the terms of their own contracts.  A wise local authority will not accept a tender from such a person, no matter how much lower that tender is than the tender of the next person who is a responsible tenderer and a good contractor. I would certainly say to the local authorities that they are not obliged to accept the lowest tender when the lowest tenderer is a person in whom they cannot have confidence that he will carry out the terms of his contract.</P>

In the case of the third scheme in another town in a neighbouring county the work had also ceased.  I wondered what had happened and I said: &ldquo;Those people ought to have made inquiries.&rdquo;  The man in question is a man of good social standing, and <Col N="888" /> when he went into a new line of activity most people who had not made inquiries would not perhaps hesitate in accepting his tender.  People who did not belong to Dublin City or County, like the Deputy and myself, might accept his tender without making further inquiry.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy and everybody in this House know I dislike very much interfering with the ordinary administrative work of local authorities.  I never do it unless I think it is necessary.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, unlike Deputy Norton, thought we were going too quickly. Deputy Norton and others thought we were not going quickly enough; they talked of the delays.  Undoubtedly they gave specific instances of <Col N="890" /> delays in particular contracts. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney thinks we are going much too rapidly.  I should not like to see a house being built at such a rate as would mean bad workmanship.  If that is what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney meant, I would agree with him, but so far as it is humanly possible&mdash;with the staff at our disposal and the staff at the disposal of the local authorities &mdash; to superintend and inspect the houses being built, we are trying to do it. I think it was Deputy Broderick talked about the want of inspection in the case of houses being built with the assistance of grants under the Housing Acts.  A certificate is not given in the case of any house which has not been inspected at least twice. At any rate it is not given if the inspectors carry out their duty, and I believe they do.  It is a human society, and we know that to err is human.  We know that these inspectors have had an enormous amount of work put upon them in the last few years, but I believe that they have honestly carried it out.  I had one or two serious complaints made to me by Deputies.  I got the engineers against whom the complaints were made to come face to face with the Deputies concerned, and after spending a couple of hours going into details with the inspectors concerned, with some of the officials of the Department and with the Deputies who made the complaints, I was absolutely satisfied that the complaints were without foundation. The houses built under the Housing Acts are inspected at least twice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin, amongst other matters, referred to the question of the non-payment of trade union rates of wages by certain contractors. Where cases were brought to our notice that the section of the Act dealing with that had not been adhered to, we have had inspectors sent down immediately, and I do not think there was any case brought to our notice in which we did not succeed in having the terms of the Housing Act, 1932, complied with.  If Deputy Davin knows of any further cases, I would be glad to hear of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> I was asked by two or three Deputies about the work of the Housing Board.  That is one of the minor activities in which the members of the Housing Board have been of great assistance to me.  They have not been in the limelight or asked to publish any reports except the weekly reports that they send to me; but scarcely a day passes that I do not have some reason to send complaints, or suggestions, to the members of the board.  They have been all over the country meeting individuals, local authorities and engineers, discussing with them sites, plans, lay-outs, costs, building materials and every aspect of the housing question.  So far as the provision of houses has come under their review, they have been of the greatest possible assistance to me in getting the amount of work which is to our credit in the housing section carried out in the brief space of time that we have been dealing with the housing question.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will remember, on the Second Reading of the 1932 Act I made an estimate of what I thought would be a reasonable amount of work to be got through in three years: a reasonable number of houses to be built and reconstructed in that period.  The estimate was on these lines: to be erected by urban local authorities in three years, 7,000 houses; to be erected by rural local authorities in three years, 2,500 houses.  Instead of the 7,000 houses we had actually completed at 31st December, 1935, 10,671 houses.  In the case of rural houses, instead of the 3,950, we may say 4,000 houses.  That the case of private persons and public utility societies, the estimate was 3,950, we may say 4,000 houses.  That was for urban areas, but instead of the 4,000 we have had built 5,344. For rural areas the estimate was 4,800, and we have had built 6,786.  As regards the reconstruction of houses, the estimate was 1,200, but we actually have had reconstructed 4,538. That is, I think, a creditable record. I do not think it would be possible to achieve that if it were not for the constant help, superintendence and advice given to me all through by <Col N="892" /> the members of the Housing Board, and I would like to take this opportunity of expressing to them my gratitude for their assiduity and attention to this work at all times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon wished to know what the work of a public utility society was. I think he meant that as a rhetorical question.  Public utility societies have been useful in urban and rural areas. Deputy Bartley told us of the use that he found for a public utility society in the County Galway.  It frequently happened that when an individual who desired to build a new house, or reconstruct an old one, went to a builders' provider for materials, he found that the builders' provider did not think him good enough security, even with the promised grant under the Act, and it was not until a number of such people in an area came together and formed a public utility society, thereby being enabled to give joint security to a builders' provider, that they were enabled either to build a new house or reconstruct an old one.  In that way, public utility societies in rural areas have proved to be extremely useful. Unquestionably, some public utility societies that have been formed in the last three or four years have done little or nothing to justify their existence. That mainly arises because their officials were inefficient.  I know that in Dublin City houses have been built by public utility societies that have been started by the members of different trades or professions.  The Post Office Public Utility Society, for instance, have built magnificent houses, a number of them by direct labour&mdash; houses which are a credit to themselves and to those they employed in their erection.  The same remark applies to trades public utility societies.  They have done some splendid work and have helped materially towards assisting the local authority to solve the housing problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, I think, adverted to the use of thatch.  We do not refuse a grant to persons who wish to use thatch.  In the case of new houses we have had very few applications&mdash;I think the number could be counted on the fingers of one hand&mdash;from persons who wished to use thatch; but there <Col N="893" /> have been many such applications from persons proposing to reconstruct their houses.  We have no objection in principle to the use of thatch, and if the use of thatch is disappearing, as Deputy Dillon says it is, well, that cannot be laid at our door as so many things are laid at the doors of the Government for the time being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to the appointment of clerks of works and to the use of slates. Clerks of works, I may say, are appointed by the local authority.  We try, when we are sanctioning, to make every effort to insist that they are competent people.  Indeed, in the beginning, when I took up office, I tried to insist that they should be University men with engineering degrees, but I had one or two experiences from which, well, I decided not to insist in future that they should be men with University degrees.  I have found by experience that sometimes you get more satisfactory work and more satisfaction generally out of men who are experienced tradesmen&mdash; carpenters, masons, bricklayers, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have covered all, or nearly all the points that were raised.  I do not agree that people earning £3 10s. a week ought to be provided with labourers' cottages. I think that people who have a wage of that kind and who are not agricultural workers should be able to <Col N="894" /> pay an economic rent for their houses, and I think that any board of health that gives a house of that kind to a man who is not an agricultural labourer is wronging the agricultural workers and the ratepayers.  I think that such a man in a rural area ought to be able to pay an economic rent for a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not give it in County Dublin and it is more likely to be given there than in any other county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Deputy Dillon was talking about County Roscommon, I think.  Deputy Dillon also mentioned ribbon building.  Well, I travelled a good deal around the country in the last two or three years and I have not noticed ribbon building, so far as labourers' cottages are concerned at any rate, except in one place in County Wicklow, and there I called the attention of our Housing Department and our Chief Engineer to the fact.  I do agree with Deputy Dillon that we ought to put obstacles in the way of building labourers' cottages close to main roads where there is very heavy motor traffic.  As I say, I have seen that in one place&mdash;in County Wicklow.  First of all, it is bad for the cottagers themselves.  I have seen that road, over which I have travelled very often, crowded with very young children.  It is a most dangerous thoroughfare&mdash;one of the main roads leading to the South of Ireland.  I agree that it is not right that these cottages should be built on the edge of the road, as they are at that place, and on one of the main arteries of traffic.  It would certainly be better if the board of health, instead of extending these cottages along the main road, were to take a field and erect the same number of cottages in a field of suitable size, or in several fields; but to spread them out in ribbon fashion along the edge of a main road certainly looks bad&mdash;as Deputy Dillon quite properly said, it is bad aesthetically&mdash;and it is bad economy as well as being dangerous for the children, if not for the older people in the families living in these cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also made reference <Col N="895" /> to the slums and asked if any real progress is being made in the City of Dublin.  Well, I certainly think that I can say that I am not satisfied with the progress that has been made in the City of Dublin.  I had hoped two years ago that, at least up to now, if not before now, we would have reached the stage at which at least 2,000 houses a year could be built.  I saw, in evidence given by the secretary of the Housing Committee at this tribunal that is now inquiring into municipal affairs in Dublin City and County, that the secretary, Mr. Sherwin, stated that they had not succeeded in building more than 1,000 houses a year.  That is not satisfactory.  If only 1,000 houses a year are being built, I cannot see, within my time at any rate, that slum problem, as we know it in Dublin City, being wiped out.  Whatever chance there is if we get the activity of the Department worked up to 2,000 houses a year&mdash;and there is some chance there&mdash;if we leave it at 1,000 houses a year, I doubt if there is any immediate present prospect of seeing an end of the housing problem for the workers in the City of Dublin, in my time at least.</P>

      <P>I raised that matter with the City Manager, but I did not get a very clear decision from him as to whether he wished to have a housing director to assist him or not.  I raised the matter with him some time before Christmas, but he did not give me a definite answer.  I raised that matter because I am anxious that everything possible should be done to get speedier working on the housing schemes, particularly in Dublin.</P>

      <P>There is, of course, a number of housing schemes in progress in Dublin City.  In Crumlin there are 1,098 houses in progress; in Hanover Street, 115 dwellings; in Cook Street, 346; in North Cumberland Street, 66; and in Watling Street, 72. In other words at the moment, 1,697 dwellings are actually in hands, and I think, that so far as Cook Street, North Cumberland Street, Hanover Street, and Watling Street are concerned, a good deal of these will be completed before very long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give them at the moment, but I shall send them to the Deputy if he wishes.  I mentioned these specific cases in order to show Deputy Dillon that, at any rate, something tangible is being done in Dublin, and that already a good deal has been accomplished even in the way of wiping out, not alone slum houses, but slum streets.  In the case of the area to which he referred&mdash;Gardiner Street and Gloucester Street and that area generally&mdash;a beginning has been made at Cumberland Street, and I hope it will not be long before other streets in that area will be tackled.  I know that the Corporation and its staff are working hard.  I know that they have had difficulties in connection with staff and workmen and, above all, in connection with finance.  I know that they have these difficulties, but, as I say, a way must be found to get over the difficulties, and if the City Manager and the Corporation feel that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health or his Department, or the Government as a whole, can do anything further to help, we are always open to receive any suggestions of any further help we can give.  I do know that the City Manager is as anxious as any person in the country on the subject <Col N="897" /> of housing.  I know that there is nothing that gives him greater uneasiness or more worry than this question. I believe he is as sincere in his desire to end this problem as any other man in Ireland.  Difficulties of finance and other difficulties that may exist must be got over, and we must try to find out some way of arriving, at any rate, at a point where not less than 2,000 houses a year will be built for Dublin City.  If we do that, we can see an end in sight to the problem in Dublin, but without that, I think the end is not in view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As the House may remember, the Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds (Amendment) Act, 1933, fixed the 31st of August, 1934, as the final date for the lodging, by subscribers, of applications for the repayment of sums subscribed to the Dáil External Loans. The main purpose of the present Bill is to extend that date to the 30th June of the present year.  The Dáil Eireann Loans and Funds (Amendment) Act, 1933, became law on the 28th of July of that year.  The making of the necessary regulations thereunder and the setting up of the financial and accounting machinery, to deal with the transfers of money from the Central Fund, to secure due control of the process of repayment, occupied some considerable time but was completed by the 1st March, 1934, that is, six months before the date which was fixed as the <Col N="898" /> final one for lodging applications. From that date, extensive publicity was secured by advertisements in the public Press, here and in the United States of America, advising subscribers as to the necessity for lodging applications for repayment and notifying them of the existence of the final date by which such application should be lodged.</P>
      <P>In addition to bringing the question of repayment under the notice of subscribers in this way, the repayment offices issued to every subscriber who had communicated with the offices of the receivers appointed originally by the United States Court in connection with the repayment of the loan, or with the repayment offices here, a form of application, the completion and return of which before the 31st August, 1934, would entitle the claimant to repayment. The total number of subscribers to whose notice the offer of repayment was brought in this way was, so far as I can estimate, about 200,000.  From these there have been received to date something over 100,000 claims of which about 15,000 were lodged after the final date fixed by the original Act.  It is not possible to state the figures for the late applications with any degree of exactness, as it may prove that many of the communications which have arrived since the final date, and which appear to relate to new claims, on examination, may be found to relate to claims which in fact have been already lodged or were lodged before the final date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This question of repayment has aroused widespread interest in America&mdash;somewhat belated interest on the part of a number of people who had subscribed to the Loans. Since the lapse of that date, representations have been made to me from many quarters that the final date for making application should be extended and, after careful consideration of all the circumstances, it has been decided to accede to these representations. This Bill is introduced accordingly to give effect to that decision.  In addition to extending the time limit for applications under the Bill, the measure also proposes to set up machinery for the completion of the work of the audit and the accounts <Col N="899" /> relating thereto.  On the general question of the wisdom of extending the date within which applications for repayment may be made, may I again remark that the Government's action in offering to repay external loans has been most favourably commented upon in the American Press and that it has done not a little to enhance our credit with the American public.  Of the many Press references, I shall quote just one example.  It is from a magazine which has a widespread circulation, not only in the United States of America but also in Great Britain, Ireland, and in English-speaking countries generally.  I refer to the <i>Saturday Evening Post.</i>  In one of its principal editorials, this journal has been so appreciative of our action in regard to the loan, and so generous in its praise, that I feel the terms in which it refers to this matter ought to form part of the permanent records of the House.  I would ask your indulgence, therefore, if I take the unusual step of quoting it in full.  The editorial to which I refer is headed &ldquo;Irish Free State Pays Up.&rdquo;  It appeared in the issue for the 9th November, 1935.  It reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At a time when so many attitudes and policies throughout the world are well calculated to arouse both fear and censure, it is gratifying to call attention to conduct which deserves only praise.  We refer to the action of the Irish Free State in voluntarily paying both principal and interest to bondholders in this country, whose claim was moral rather than legal. This action is contrary to that frequently followed under similar circumstances, and larger powers have taken advantage of much smaller excuses to default in payment.  To appreciate the full meaning of the good faith displayed, it is necessary to recite even, in at least skeleton form, the background of circumstances.  At a general election in November 1918, the Sinn Féin Party, which had previously held only a handful of seats, swept the country and pledged itself to establish a republic.  A <Col N="900" /> constitution was drawn up a Cabinet elected and Eamon de Valera, the last surviving senior commander of the republican forces in the rebellion of 1916, was elected President.  However, many of the leaders, including de Valera, were actually in jail at the time. The republican forces were supported only by the subscriptions of their adherents, since the public revenues were in the hands of the British.  Finally, de Valera escaped from jail and, disguised as a stoker, reached the United States in the late winter of 1919.  Here, and in Canada, Central America and South America, he sold 6,000,000 dollars of bonds to descendants of Irish immigrants and to other sympathisers with his cause. These bonds were not issued by a Government which was recognised by other nations or which had any legal standing at the time.  To many, the struggle in Ireland was merely another of the long series of rebellions against British authority, all of which had been failures. Rarely has an issue of bonds had less apparent investment security. Within a couple of years, the Irish and British drew up a treaty of peace, but the republican forces split, civil war followed and it was not until a number of years later that the de Valera forces triumphed.  Meanwhile, the external loan sold in this country was not recognised, although following litigation, an American court ordered the 2,500,000 dollars which had been left on deposit in this country, distributed <i>pro rata</i> to the original subscribers, giving them 58 cents on the dollar.  A very large number of the original subscribers&mdash;in fact, two-thirds of the total &mdash; failed to put in any claims for the 58 cent award.  However, the Government now in power in Ireland, decided to open a repayment office in New York and to advertise in practically every State that it was prepared to offer those who had never put in any claims for the 58 cents a total of 1.25 dollars for each dollar subscribed, while to those who had received <Col N="901" /> their 58 cents, it stood ready to pay 67 cents more.  Now, it must be kept in mind that a great many of the subscribers regarded their subscriptions, not as an investment but as a gift to old Ireland.  Only two persons subscribed for as much as 10,000 dollars and only four for 5,000 dollars.  But there were 28,000 who subscribed for 50 dollars each, and no less than 237,000 who gave ten dollars apiece.  Though great numbers of subscribers never expected any return, it can be said truthfully that the repayments have been made at a time which was extremely convenient to most of the recipients.  That, however, is not the point.  What matters is that this small country has met its debt of honour and set an example which more than one great world power might well observe and meditate upon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is only a sample of the manner in which our offer to repay this loan has been received by the American Press. The fact that we have made it and the extent to which it has been availed of has undoubtedly enhanced our credit with the American public.  It is clear that, owing to some oversight, possibly some circumstances over which they had no control, because it is now almost 17 years since the subscriptions were originally made, many of the people who did subscribe originally were not made aware in time of the offers to repay.  Accordingly, in all these circumstances, we feel it is our duty to ask the Dáil to extend the final date to the day mentioned in the Bill and to give these people a last opportunity of applying for repayment.  In addition to providing for an extension of the date in this way, the Bill also provides for the audit of the accounts relating to the repayment of the loan.</P>

      <P>We would like to hear from the Minister the total amount of money that would be repayable in this case if the full claim was made.  We would also like to hear in respect of the 10,000 odd claims that he says already have been made, the total amount to which these claims would come to.  The Minister felt it was becoming and desirable to place, <Col N="902" /> on what he called the permanent records of the House, an expression of appreciation on the part of at least one American newspaper, as a sample of American Press, in relation to what an honourable and magnificent thing it was for the Irish Free State to recognise its indebtedness with regard to this loan and proceed to pay it, not only in full, but with interest.  It would be interesting, too, to have on the permanent records of the House, as also reflecting on the credit of this State, the reasons why, when a previous Administration many years ago, when the State was first set up, having decided to repay this loan in full to the persons who subscribed the loan and, with a view to doing that, and because it was accepting that responsibility, claimed the outstanding amount of the money that was available in the United States, the Minister and, as he then was, Mr. de Valera, resisted the claims of the State at that particular time, stepped in and prevented the State shouldering that responsibility and repaying that debt and embarked upon legal actions in the United States, challenging the responsibility or the authority of this State to repay this debt, challenging the authority of this State to claim the moneys that then existed and, by a long-drawn-out legal action, squandered a very large amount of the money that was then lying on deposit in the United States and belonging to this particular stage to interesting at this particular stage to place also on the permanent records of the House a statement of the reasons why the responsibility and authority of the State was challenged at that particular time in respect of this loan and to have recorded the amount of money belonging to the people of this country, borrowed for them, which was squandered in the United States by the action of the Minister and his President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give that at the moment.  We have provided in this year's Estimates a sum of £400,000.  I am not in a position to say what is the amount of claims outstanding.  We are extending the date to the 30th June. On an average the 15,000 claims which have been made&mdash;I merely give this as a rough figure&mdash;might represent £60,000 more.  Other claims may come in between now and the 30th June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said there were at least 200,000 people to whose attention this matter was drawn.  We were told that 100,000 have made claims and an extra 15,000 probably have made claims.  What is the total amount that may be claimable under this Bill in respect of the <Col N="904" /> external debt and what is the total amount that the 100,000 claims make up?  The Minister hardly comes and asks the Dáil to extend the date without having made some kind of estimate as to the extent to which the 100,000 claims will go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that we have made provision for a certain amount.  We have provided £400,000 this year.  That is the estimate we formed when we were preparing the Budget last year on the basis of the claims which had been already received.  There were at that time approximately 15,000 claims which were late.  I am making a guess at the estimate, because these 15,000 claims have not all been examined and, on that basis, I say that £50,000 or £60,000, or maybe even less, would cover those claims.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that a considerable number of subscribers who have not yet claimed may take advantage of this offer.  If they do, I cannot say, of course, what our liability might be but, at the worst, if everybody who subscribed availed of the offer, it would cost the State about £1,000,000.  I do not think it is going to cost quite as much as that, and I think it will cost possibly not more than half.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £14,627 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1936, for Stationery, Printing, Paper, Binding, and Printed Books for the Public Service; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; and for sundry Miscellaneous Services, including Reports of Oireachtas Debates.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is wholly due to the increase in Departmental demands made in connection with new and extended services within the year. It is due largely to the requirements of the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Local Government and Public Health, arising out of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, and the Revenue Commissioners. I do not think there is anything more to say on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate provides for an additional £10,000 for extra supplies of paper and envelopes for new and extended services.  The Minister says that these are required by the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and in connection with widows' and orphans' pensions. Leaving out the question of widows' and orphans' pensions, in respect of which, so far as we can gather from complaints, most of the envelopes and stationery was used in writing back to people who made claims to say that they were not going to get any pension, we get something of the measure of the interference on the part of the Department of Agriculture with the farmers' work of carrying out their own business and on the part of the Department of Industry and Commerce, with the commercial life of the country.  It is a rather interesting commentary on the extent to which that interference has gone on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know a certain amount about the interference, but the commercial community are even more docile than the farmers under the attack that is being <Col N="906" /> made on them.  We would expect that there would be a great development in respect of the opening of a new factory for waste-paper baskets if this interference is going to grow.  The Minister is looking for £380 more because of additional expenditure incurred on distribution, cartage and freight charges. I should like to ask the Minister if that is evidence that there is at least one section of the population who have benefited by an increase in wages during the last 12 months?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I could say it is due to anything more than the fact that the volumes of the Oireachtas Debates are now heavier and cost more to transport, a circumstance with which I suppose the Deputy's Party shares responsibility with the Party on the Government Benches.  I certainly could not say that it could be ascribed wholly to an increase in wages on the part of those who are engaged in the transport trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea is that there are more volumes of the Oireachtas Debates knocking around than were expected, and a lot more cartage in connection with them.  Do I understand that what happened then was that the Government estimated that the Dáil would have been shut down for six months this year which the President suggested some time ago would be a good thing?</P>

      <P>There is one item&mdash; miscellaneous office supplies&mdash;in respect of which the Minister estimated that £7,500 would meet the requirements of the year.  He finds now that he wants 40 per cent. more.  One of the arguments, as the Minister will recollect, which his Party employed in order to get into office was that they were going to run this State very much more economically, and that they were going to save a couple of million pounds in <Col N="907" /> connection with the ordinary Estimates without interfering with anybody. Here we have an additional Estimate for extra supplies of typewriters, accounting machines, office requisites, and so on.  Would the Minister give us some information as to what those accounting machines are for; what amount of the Estimate is absorbed by the purchase of those machines; whether they will be of any use when the Government leaves office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;how many persons are employed in using them; whether it was an inspiration since the beginning of the financial year that caused these accounting machines to come into somebody's mind as a means of saving money; and how is it that he was so far out in his Estimate as to require an extra 40 per cent. inside 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy in his last two sentences has answered his questions.  It is true that we are modernising the Civil Service, and sometimes expenditure in this way is the best form of economy.  There are one or two Departments where old and obsolete methods prevailed when we came in.  We are changing that and, consequently, there is increased capital expenditure on accounting machines and typewriters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give us any information as to what Department of State they effected any economy in, because every one of them seems to be expanding, so far as its outgoings are concerned, and, not alone is there no prospect of the £2,000,000 saving, but each one seems to be increasing.  For instance, we have an Estimate in respect of the Civil Service Commission, which is costing one and a half times at least what it used to cost, and now we have a modernising of the whole system.  Does modernisation mean more expenditure?</P>

It is the duty of the Attorney-General&mdash;I do not think he will deny my statement, as to <Col N="909" /> what the duty of his office is&mdash;when a Department acts in an improper or illegal fashion, to test the legality in a matter where he considers that an illegality has been committed.  There is one matter where, I submit to the House, the Land Commission have been guilty of very grave illegality indeed, and I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether it is his intention to allow that illegality to stand, or whether he intends to take action in the courts to test the action which the Land Commission have taken in one particular case which I have already brought before the notice of the House.</P>

I want to know if this Supplementary Estimate &mdash; this additional £2,500&mdash;includes fees that are going to be spent upon the investigation of this particular case.

On that analogy the Deputy, or any other Deputy, would be justified if illegalities, or what he considered to be illegalities, were alleged to have been committed in bringing them up on this Estimate.  That would surely not be in order.

I suggest to him that before a matter involving a serious charge against a public Department is raised in this House, and before it is suggested that I have been guilty of a breach of duty, and that a great Department of State has been guilty of a breach of duty, he should take the course which is frequently taken of formulating a complaint and submitting the facts which, he says, call for action on my part.  I suggest that this is not the best way to raise the matter if he wishes to have it considered.

      <P>This Vote is for £11,300, but is offset to some extent by Appropriations-in-Aid.  It is customary on the introduction of even <Col N="917" /> a Supplementary Estimate to give some explanation of the reasons why the extra money is required.  The items are considerable.  Witnesses' expenses have gone up from £8,700 to £11,400; Fees to Counsel, from £9,500 to £12,000; and General Law Expenses, from £3,200 to £7,900, an increase of £4,700.  One item, Defence of Public Officials, has increased from £400 to £1,800.  There are various points in connection with the Estimate on which the Minister or the Attorney-General ought to take the House into their confidence.  The same explanation cannot be given on this Estimate as was given on the last one.  It was for modernising a Department of State.  If this is for modernising the law, it is expensive modernising.  It would appear as if the administration of the law was much more expensive than the Minister anticipated 12 months ago. The additional expenditure on General Law Expenses amounts to £4,700.  It is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation of the expenditure of this £11,300 on law.  We were advised when this Ministry was coming into office that we were going to have a regular outburst of peace all over the country&mdash;such peace as was never known before.  Is not that a reason why there should be an explanation for the people who are being taxed to the extent of £11,000 extra for the blessings of peace?  The last item is, I suppose, a token Vote every year&mdash; Defence of Public Officials&mdash;representing a few hundred pounds.  It is gone up to £1,800.  What unfortunate accident has happened during the year calling for £1,800?  Have we been committed to the cost, or is it only an estimate?  Generally in connection with Estimates that come up here the best or the worst is said for them. Nothing has been said so far for this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will agree that, so far as the reason for the expenses of the State is concerned, there has been a dual responsibility. Naturally, we do not want to spend money on law costs, but when the law has to be vindicated, as it had to be during the past 12 months, the State, as well as the other parties to <Col N="918" /> suits had to pay.  A large part of the general law expenses, and the increase in sub-head E, arises from what is known as the Ballisodare fishery case, in which the cost to the State amounted to well over £1,530.  That arose entirely out of a question of title, for which neither the present Administration nor the preceding Administration could be held accountable.  It was public duty to intervene in this case, and costs were awarded against us, though we merely came in as representing the general public, and in no other capacity.  Then, of course, two actions were instituted by Cork and Louth County Councils, in which in deference to an opinion expressed to us we have agreed to bear the costs of both parties.  These two cases very largely account for the increased expenditure under sub-head E.  I think the Deputy will admit that we had no responsibility for initiating the proceedings in the fishery case, or the proceedings brought by the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the increase under sub-head F, I do not think it is true to say that in other years the amount provided under this sub-head was merely a token figure.  For instance, in 1931-32 the amount actually expended under that sub-head was £671.  In the present year the cost is likely to be about 50 per cent. more than that, due to certain actions which were taken by gentlemen who were formerly associated with the Deputy's Party, in which it was held that the strict legal requirements of Constitution (Amendment) Act No. 17 had not been complied with by officers making arrests.  I gather that they followed in that regard exactly the same procedure as was adopted by our predecessors. As the Deputy is aware, there have been heavy increases also in the amounts which had to be provided for expenses of the State, and the expenses under existing legislation of accused persons in certain murder trials which took place. As the Deputy is aware, it is customary in the case of a poor person for the State to assign counsel.  When the State assigns counsel naturally it has also to pay the cost of the prosecution.  In general, there <Col N="919" /> may be other details, but these are the principal items which account for the increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the people of Cobh, for instance, have been waiting ever since legislation was guaranteed to them by the Minister for Justice on the 12th July, 1932, in this House, as reported in volume 43, column 762, of the Official Reports, when he stated that the Executive Council intended introducing legislation to deal with the grievances of ground rent tenants.  I should like to point out to the Minister that ground rent tenants have waited from 1932 to 1936, and if they continued waiting we would be as far away from the matter as ever.  It is only by the efforts of public men in their own constituencies in working to relieve these grievances that we can get them relieved.  If we were waiting until Bills were put through this House and sent to the Seanad and held up for 18 months and then sent back again we would be a long time waiting.  The only manner in which it can be done is by action of that description.  The Minister for Justice on that occasion definitely pledged himself to the introduction of this legislation.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I tell the tenants of Cobh and elsewhere something that they can absolutely rely on&mdash;that the Government drawn from the Party that espoused their cause so warmly in opposition will not forget them on these benches and that everything in reason that can be done for the tenants of Cobh and the tenants in <Col N="922" /> the other towns of this country to remedy substantial grievances and to restore all the equities as between two parties will be done at the earliest opportunity by this Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the statement by the Minister for Justice.  It was only when we realised, in my constituency, at any rate, that the people could not continue to bear that burden that Deputies from both sides of the House had to step in and successfully remedy that grievance by getting a reduction amounting to 33? per cent. of the ground rents.  I grant that is not sufficient&mdash;that the burdens on the people of Cobh will have to be relieved to a far greater extent.</P>
    <P>Since I spoke on Wednesday last I had the cases of the tenants of the town of Charleville brought before me where a whole bundle of writs for the Circuit Court were lashed out without any consideration whatever. However, by timely interference the lawyers were deprived of the fat they were going to draw from landlords and tenants in these cases and the matter will, I hope, be settled by arbitration.  I can quite understand the difficulty of the Government in dealing with a matter like this and the anxiety of the Minister for Finance in reference to it.  There is a large revenue derived from income tax on ground rents.  I suppose that has something to do with his anxiety about it.</P>
    <P>But Deputy Anthony would now add another vested interest to the vested interest that the Government would naturally have in ground rents from the viewpoint of revenue. Deputy Anthony would now add to the other vested interest.  The local authority who would be deriving a rate on moneys received from the ground landlords if this motion were accepted and passed into law.  Naturally in such circumstances the local authorities would not have any anxiety whatever in seeing these ground rents reduced for their rates would also be reduced.  That is what would happen if Deputy Anthony's motion were accepted.  To my mind the town tenants have already <Col N="923" /> enough to fight without fighting the local authority.</P>
    <P>Some remedy should accrue to the town tenants but this motion is going the wrong way to remedy what undoubtedly is a crying injustice. Down in my constituency we have taken, I admit, rather a crude way of remedying it, but it is a fair way. A number of men met around the table and they settled the matter by arbitration.  At all events it has proved successful.  Naturally with the law against our taking any untoward action, we are in the position that our hands are tied, so to speak, and we have to accept what we get.  I do not consider that a reduction of 33? per cent. on those ground rents was too bad to receive. In every case where that reduction was got it was passed on directly to the occupying tenants.  As a matter of fact in one instance I gave here a considerably larger reduction was passed on.  I would give other instances showing that not only was the reduction passed on but far larger reductions were given by the arbitration court to the occupying tenants.</P>
    <P>I suggest to Deputy Anthony that if he has in Cork City any particular cases like the ones I have mentioned he should endeavour to settle them by the same means that we have settled them.  I suggest furthermore that he should endeavour to find some other means of helping the unfortunate town tenants besides raising up another vested interest which would undoubtedly tell against the tenants in the future.  I mean the vested interests of the local authority. I want to point out to you, Sir, and I submit there is every reason for believing it, that what has told against the introduction of legislation in this matter up to the present is the fact that income tax is drawn by the Government on every £ of ground rent.  That is a matter that must naturally be considered by the Minister for Finance.  Every £ paid in ground rents means 4/6 or 5/- to the revenue.  If you are going to add to that the power and influence of the local authority towards protecting <Col N="924" /> its rates and its revenue, you are going to raise up another bogey against the town tenants.</P>
    <P>I submit that the grievances are such that the Government should find an immediate remedy.  This matter can be very easily settled by setting up fair rent courts.  The section of such a Bill is already there in one of the old Land Acts.  This would be a court in which the leaseholder could bring in the ground landlord where the matter would be threshed out before the judge.  I admit that I have found a more effective and speedier way than any other, but I would point out to Deputy Anthony the danger that is before him.  If he is going to allow a body like the Dublin Corporation, the largest ground rent landlords in this country, to get an interest in these rents, he will make the case worse for the town tenants.  I would remind him of the statement delivered here in the Dáil by a responsible member of the Dublin Corporation.  That will show him the danger of making use of a matter like the ground rents to enable a body like the Dublin Corporation to dabble further in real estate and to reap enormous profits.  We had it in the debate last week that they buy land at £200 an acre and sell it at £9,000.  If the Deputy is going to give a body like that the right to levy rates on ground rents, he will find that they will be the strongest opponents of the town tenants and the most conservative force towards keeping those unfortunate tenants down for ever.  That is one of the dangers I see in Deputy Anthony's motion.  I do not wish to delay the House further beyond just putting those facts fairly before them.</P>
    <P>I would be glad if the Minister in his leisure time&mdash;if he has any leisure time, which I very much doubt&mdash;would read the statement made by the Circuit judge in Cork when those ground rent tenants were before his court.  I would suggest to the Minister that he would read the appeals made by the judge to the landlords to have at least a little Christian charity and to realise that in grinding down those unfortunate tenants they were killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  I suggest to every Deputy in the House to read <Col N="925" /> those statements.  They would then realise what an intolerable burden is being borne by the town tenants.  In the majority of cases this money is going to landlords living outside this country altogether, men who never spent one shilling to help those people out of whom they are drawing their large revenues.  These men let a piece of rock or a piece of virgin soil, as Deputy Belton put it, to the unfortunate people who built the houses on it. People must get somewhere in which to live.  This landlord let a piece of virgin soil in Cobh for £10 or £12 at the start.  A man came along and built £9,000 worth of property on that piece of ground.  As soon as the lease fell in the landlord came and grabbed the whole of that property.  If that is not confiscation, I do not know what confiscation is.  Any means of compelling that landlord to deliver up that loot is, to my mind, at any rate, justifiable; it is justifiable by any means.  We saw down in Cobh cases that were so glaring that the Circuit judge adjourned the cases three times and made an appeal for a settlement.  That was because he realised that the unfortunate tenants could not pay.  It was up to somebody who had the interests of his constituents at heart to step in and see if he could knock anything off that landlord.  Then we hear Deputies like Deputy MacDermot speaking softly here and accusing me of using intimidation in order to cut down these ground rents.  As reported in column 593, volume 60, No. 2, of the Official Debates, Deputy MacDermot said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I submit, Sir, that what Deputy Corry is saying is perfectly relevant &mdash;he is opposing this motion and pointing out that intimidation would be much more effective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the opinion of Deputy MacDermot, in his abyssmal ignorance, of the joint action of Deputy William J. Broderick, chairman of the Cork County Council, and myself. That was his opinion.  That shows how much Deputy MacDermot knows of the people of this country, or how they live, or where they live.</P>

      <P>Or how long they live. That was Deputy MacDermot's challenge. I submit, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that when you are faced with this condition of affairs, when you have cases adjourned time after time by the Circuit Court judge, who realises that the people cannot pay, as the burden is too heavy for the people to bear, and when Deputies step in to relieve that burden to the best of their ability, I think it is very bad taste to get this kind of thing from a Deputy like Deputy MacDermot.  I consider, a Leas-Chinn Comhairle, that the grievance is one that must be remedied, and remedied at once.  I respectfully suggest that this matter of ground rents is one which should be immediately taken in hands by the Executive Council, and that legislation should be introduced to deal effectively with it.  I, for one, realise that the actions of a Deputy&mdash;hand-tied and hog-tied as this matter is by law and legal proceedings, and all the rest of it&mdash;are very small and must be in the main ineffective.  You cannot get all you want from those people.  If, for instance, we got any kind of fair justice from the gentleman who grabbed and robbed the tenants of Cobh out of £12,000 worth of property, we would bring him back to the old £12 for which he originally let the property, but we realise our inability to secure that at the moment.  I consider that steps should be immediately taken to remedy the position.  I do not think that Deputy Anthony's motion as it stands here is a step towards remedying it.  I grant this much&mdash;that Deputy Anthony's motion may relieve the general community in that particular town of some of the burden in the shape of rates, but at the same time it is going to set up, in the shape of that local authority which gets its rates in that manner, another vested interest against any reduction in ground rents for the unfortunate tenant.  It is going to do that.  I would suggest that the matter of ground rents is one which should be dealt with quickly by the Executive Council.  I do not wish to delay the House any further, except to say that the quicker it is dealt with the better, before the people are driven out of <Col N="927" /> house and home in many cases by rents that were put on at periods when the people had no redress. Now that we have a national Government in power here it is their duty, and their bounden duty, to relieve them, and to relieve them at once.</P>

      <P>Probably at my time of life, and with my experience, I should not be surprised at anything, but I was surprised this night week at the wild west speech of Deputy Corry, more especially at his remarks concerning the Dublin Corporation's transaction in buying an acre of land for £200 and selling it for £9,000. Every time he mentioned that&mdash;and he mentioned it five times in his speech &mdash;he looked over fiercely at me, as much as to suggest that I am sitting on the £9,000 here.  The gates of the City Hall were scarcely open the next morning when I was down there.  I was losing no time.  I went to the officers who had charge of this matter of the city estates, and I told them of the remarks made in this Assembly on the previous night by Deputy Corry, quoting a speech made by Deputy Belton, in which he stated that an acre of land was bought for £200 and sold for £9,000.  He emphasised that by telling all and sundry that he was chairman of the Estates Committee and knew what he was talking about. I think I am quoting him absolutely accurately.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; a letter from Mr. M. A. Harvey, Hon. National Secretary, Irish Leaseholders' Association, 29 South Terrace, Cork.  He stated in that letter that his executive had noted the recent Dáil discussion on ground rents, and would draw public attention, particularly leaseholders' attention, to some points therein.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Anthony's suggestion for the implementation of local revenue would seem to be nothing more than another `5-4ths valuation,' described recently by a Government Minister as a `tax on ground rents.' This suggestion, if adopted, would be of no assistance to leaseholders, if it did not actually worsen their position.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>From Cork.  I regret very much that those statements were made concerning the corporation. It has been a mark for abuse, insult and defamation for years and years, but there never has been yet, in my experience of it at any rate&mdash; and that experience extends over nearly 40 years &mdash; a definite charge <Col N="929" /> proved against them.  All sort of corruption and deception and all that class of thing have been insinuated over and over again, but never proved.  When the corporation was suppressed some years ago by the late Government a great outery of joy took place in the English journals. Several of them were sent to me at the time and this was their general opinion: &ldquo;There you are.  We have held this corrupt corporation up to public odium for years, and when their own people get charge of the government their own people vindicate our opinion by suppressing them.&rdquo;  The Government had established a public sworn inquiry into the affairs of the corporation previous to its being suppressed, but they never published any report or gave any justification for their action. We ought to remember that Dublin is the capital city of Ireland, and any reflection cast on it injures it.  It is the only place now to which young men and young girls, especially from the Free State, can look in order to get decent positions.  Emigration to America is finished with, I am glad to say, but where else can young men and young women look to for positions except Dublin?  The land, even though it is well worked, cannot afford to support all of them. These young men and young girls must look to some place to get positions and, surely, Dublin is the proper place to look to.  As a matter of fact, thousands of them do get decent positions here, so that anything that is stated against the city injures it, and should not be stated unless it is absolutely true and can be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin is on the map since the year 180.  Where was Cork then?  It is supposed to be the largest county in Ireland, according to the map, but who made the map?  Mediæval mapmakers came over here, whether from Holland, Italy, France, England or Germany.  If they happened to find their way into a place now known as Cork and met Deputy Corry with his arbitration committee, and were asked: &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; The reply would be: &ldquo;We are making <Col N="930" /> maps.&rdquo;  If asked: &ldquo;What are they for?&rdquo; the reply would be: &ldquo;To show the extent of your county.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry and his arbitration committee put enough of Cork on the map, embracing parts of Waterford and Kerry.  That is how they got the largest county in Ireland. Here is the position so far as Dublin is concerned.  There is a city estate and there is a sub-committee of the corporation appointed to manage it for the time being.  The control of the city estate is just one of two or three items of municipal government that is in the hands of the members of the corporation and that is not in the hands of the City Manager.  They control it.  The city estate consists of ancient revenue given to the corporation after what is known as the Reformation took place.  When the suppression of the monasteries took place, Henry VIII gave the lands of All Hallows Monastery to the Dublin Corporation and, in the reign of Elizabeth, the Dublin Corporation presented to the newly-founded College of the Holy Trinity some of the finest and most valuable land in Ireland.  The city estate&mdash;the All Hallows possessions&mdash; extends away all over the County Dublin, embracing Clonturk, Drumcondra, Baldoyle and quite a large amount of land all around the county, all of which is vested in the corporation and could not possibly be sold under any circumstances except by legislation.  The corporation cannot barter a single acre of that land.  It must always hold it for the benefit of the citizens and, consequently, Deputy Belton's statement that an acre of city <Col N="931" /> estate was sold or bought&mdash;whichever way one likes to put it&mdash;for £200, and then sold for £9,000, is absolutely inaccurate.  There was no such transaction in connection with the city estate.</P>
      <P>There are only two instances of city estate being sold.  One was at Baldoyle where, under some Land Act or other, it was necessary to part with some land for the purpose of enabling a cottage to be built, or something of that kind.  There were some acres of city estate sold there.  The corporation got £60 for an acre of it.  There was just one other instance.  Portion of the lands of Clonturk was sold to the parish of Fairview, of which the late lamented Canon Flanagan was the parish priest, for the erection of a church and two schools on Griffith Road on the Marino Estate.  Four acres of that land was sold for that purpose, and the parish of Fairview paid £375 an acre for it.  That is a long distance away from the £9,000. Evidently, what Deputy Belton had in his mind when speaking of this matter &mdash;his figures I may say were quite wrong, and if he were present in the House I could ask him about it&mdash;was the housing estate which is under the control of the City Manager, and of the Housing Committee which is only an advisory body.  All these transactions of the City Manager in connection with the housing estate are very often brought before that committee simply for advice, so that the acre of land that probably Deputy Belton spoke of would be an acre of land, or a less quantity, sold at Crumlin for the erection of shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Crumlin Estate consists of 224 and the one-tenth of an acre.  The corporation paid £47,300 for it.  They developed it at a cost of £260,000, so that the total cost of the estate at Crumlin comes to £307,300, the average cost per acre to the corporation being £1,371 per acre.  The corporation disposed of one acre and the one-eighteenth of an acre of that estate to the Dublin Building Operatives at a total annual rent of £74 15s. 0d., or £70 16s. in all, to the acre.  That gives the value of the rental, taking it at 16 <Col N="932" /> years' purchase, at £1,133.  That is the only sale of an acre of land belonging to the corporation that I can find any record of, and upon that is built a charge of corruption.  There is no such thing.  We have other lands which were set for similar purposes.  There is a great deal of competition for these sites when the corporation takes virgin soil and creates new small towns, if you wish.  I would remind Deputies that Crumlin is going to be as big a town as Drogheda.  In fact, it may be bigger.  It will possibly be as big as Dundalk.  We have already 1,000 families there in possession of houses. When there are 2,000 or 3,000 more families there it will be a regular town in which you will have three schools and a church.  The strips of land there, which cannot be worked into the corporation housing scheme, are very valuable and much sought after by people who wish to erect shops with dwelling-houses attached.  That was the competition that Deputy Belton had in his mind when he made his foolish statement here, a statement which he emphasised by saying that he was chairman of the estate committee.</P>
    <P>I may say to Deputy Corry and others who advocate doing away with these excessive ground rents that I am in sympathy with them.  I think this leaseholders' organisation have done very well by saying that they will not trouble the Dáil at present, but that they will go on with their work and show, if a remedy can be applied, how it should be done.  Deputy Belton said that the Dublin Corporation were the largest possessors of ground rents in Ireland.  They are no such thing. There are larger possessors of ground rents than the Dublin Corporation. Let us look at the other side of the picture, and see what the Dublin Corporation have to pay themselves for the benefit of the people in those areas about which we had so much discussion here this evening&mdash;the slum areas.  Listen to this: Mary's Lane, where three acres were acquired for clearance, the average price paid by the corporation was £4,448; in Hanover Street, where six acres were acquired, £4,580.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, as the Deputy says, you could hardly beat that in Cork or anywhere else for that matter. I can read out ten more cases, all averaging in or about £4,000 an acre for slum clearances.  Just imagine what the citizens of Dublin have to pay for these improvements, and when we are able to get some rents from people who want to take the ground for speculative purposes, if they have to pay a substantial price for the portions we do not use or could not use, can you blame us?  Just consider what we have to pay ourselves.  Then, take the virgin soil sites that I have already given.  Crumlin cost £1,371 an acre. In Kimmage, a site of 11½ acres, the price was £802 an acre.  In Drumcondra the price was £884 an acre, and so on.  Here are these awful prices that have to be paid in slum areas where the Corporation have to buy out head rents that are perhaps six deep, beginning with the original owner perhaps two or three hundred years ago, who may have got it for nothing, and who then let it to somebody else, who let it to somebody else again, and so on down through the centuries; and when the corporation have to buy them in order to wipe out the rotten slums and buy decent houses for the people, we have to pay these enormous prices principally to redeem these head rents.  That is a position of affairs that should not exist, and how can we expect to get rid of the slums, especially in Dublin, when such excessive prices have to be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have explained, as well as my abilities will allow me, the exact position of affairs, and I think I have made it plain that Deputy Belton was not right in the statement he made. There is no such transaction in the city estate as he mentioned.  There <Col N="934" /> were transactions of the nature I have disclosed in connection with our housing schemes, but there was nothing at all in connection with the city estate. I only wish to repeat what I said before, that we, in our capacity as legislators and representatives of the people, ought to be very careful in making statements in connection with our local bodies.  I have been associated for a long time with the local bodies of the City of Dublin.  I know that they are human&mdash;very human.  I know that occasionally men get in there who are &ldquo;on the make.&rdquo;  I know that.  I think that that will always continue, but I know also that the great majority of the men I have met with in a representative capacity within the local council here were men who were not &ldquo;on the make.&rdquo;  The great majority were decent, upright and honourable men, who tried to do their best under tremendous difficulties, and very few know the difficulties that have to be met by the representatives of Dublin on the local Dublin Council.  The same applies to the local councils all over the country.  The great majority of their representatives will always be upright and honourable men who will try to administer the trust given to them in the best possible way for the people they represent. I believe that, and therefore I have never made, and will never make, any reflections on the integrity of the representatives of local bodies, because anybody who knows the work they do will realise that what should be given to them is credit for their excellent work under great difficulties rather than insinuations with regard to their honesty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said, Sir, that the Minister apparently did not consider this a serious matter, and he has questioned that statement of mine, but he immediately proceeded to prove that he is not prepared to consider the matter seriously by the conduct he indulged in just now.  This is a serious matter, and a very serious matter, and I can tell him that, if he does not consider it a serious matter, most of the members sitting behind him think that it is serious, and most of them have given voice to their views on this matter down through the country.  There are men sitting behind him who have committed themselves on this matter, and some of the men who sit on the Front Bench with him committed <Col N="936" /> themselves, and committed themselves to far more than what Deputy Anthony or I have in mind with regard to the problem.  Now, I suggest to the Minister that Private Members' time is given in this House in order to enable ordinary Deputies, who are not members of the Government, to bring before this House, and to ventilate in this House, matters which they consider are of great public importance.  When Private Members of this House, in carrying out their duty to their constituents, go to the trouble of putting down motions on the Order Paper&mdash; and waiting sometimes for two years to get an opportunity of putting their views before this House &mdash; they are entitled to be treated with respect, even by the Minister for Finance; and if he does not agree with the views put forward by any member of this House, he can at least listen to them and then state his own views in opposition to them when it comes to his turn.  That is the least we are entitled to from the Minister or any other Minister in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, this is a very important matter.  It has been shown in this debate that it is a matter that extends very widely, a matter that affects a very great part of the people of the country.  It is, perhaps, one of the most important matters that could be considered by the House.  That consideration is all we ask for, and when we ask for that, I want to enter my protest as a member against any sneer from the Minister, or from anybody else.  If the Minister does not agree with the case made for the motion, he can state his views on it.  Deputies have commented on the wording of the motion.  Some say it is too narrow, and other that it is too wide.  Still more say that it calls for immediate legislation. So far as I am concerned, I am not terribly concerned with the method adopted to deal with the matter, provided we can convince the House that it is a matter that should be dealt with, and that the Government should provide the machinery.  So far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am sure I can speak for Deputy Anthony also&mdash;all I want is to have the matter ventilated, and to endeavour, as far as I possibly <Col N="937" /> can, to convince the House that here is a case that needs investigation and legislation to put it on some sort of proper basis.  I do not want to make the discussion very wide.  I know it is a very wide subject, but I do say that a case can be made that those who are getting very large sums out of property which has been made valuable by money spent out of local rates and by services provided out of local rates, should contribute at least something towards these local rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister, by way of interruption, expressed surprise at certain cases that were given.  He asked for specific cases.  I am informed on very good authority that a few years ago the Pembroke Urban Council reclaimed part of the foreshore from Sandymount to Irishtown.  What happened?  Immediately the lord of the soil, after the foreshore was reclaimed and roads were made, proceeded to lease different parts of the reclaimed foreshore, to the reclamation of which he had never contributed a penny, for the building of houses.  I do not know whether the Minister knows anything about that. I do not know whether he will say that it is unfair to ask the gentleman who gave these leases on the part of the foreshore reclaimed, to contribute to the local rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know whether that is true or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I say I have been informed on reliable authority.  The Minister will agree that nobody can have personal knowledge of everything. The Minister has to depend on information given to him very often.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mentioning the facts, and I am stating the name of the district where it happened.  If the Minister is interested, and if he wants to ascertain whether it is true or not, it is quite easy for him to do so, and he ought not to question me, if he has some doubt as to its truth.  I got the information and I accepted it as absolutely true from the gentleman who gave me the information.  Is the <Col N="938" /> Minister aware that in and around the City of Dublin and in other towns through the country, when leases fell in, in the last few years, leases under which the rent was £5, the landlords would not renew these leases until, in the first place, there was a considerable amount expended on the property, and then the rent demanded for the renewal of the lease was not £5, but £25?  Is the Minister aware that that is quite a common thing, that it is happening in the City and County of Dublin, and that information to that effect can be got by the Minister or anybody else interested?  Is the Minister further aware that it is quite general when leases fall in, and when people go to seek a renewal of the leases, they are immediately asked to spend so much money on the property? Very often these people cannot do it because they have not got the money. It might not be so easy for a man to get a couple of hundred pounds to spend on property.  In many cases they are asked to do this by people who never put a brick on the property themselves.  The ground landlords or their predecessors simply let the virgin soil to some person to build houses on it and develop the site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton spoke as if every landlord was a man who had developed the site and built roads on it himself, whereas the Deputy knows, or should know, that very few of them have done so, that it is only in very recent years that has been done by ground landlords. We know quite well what is responsible for the very high rents for building leases.  While I agree with Deputy Tom Kelly that Dublin Corporation had to pay high rents, I do not agree with either Deputy Belton or Deputy Kelly that the corporation or any other body has a right to take advantage of the shortage of houses and the difficulty of getting proper sites to make a profit out of anybody who wants to build a home in this country.  If the Minister for Local Government were here he would agree that the difficulty at the moment, so far as housing is concerned, is that in rural areas, in towns and villages, you have not houses of a certain type built by private people, houses in which they could live themselves, because if <Col N="939" /> they look for a site for these houses, they are asked a price which is out of all reason.  There is no Deputy who does not know that is true.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the case. I do not want to talk about confiscation or anything of that kind.  I do not believe in that, but I do say that this is a very serious matter that affects the whole country.  It is unquestionable, as far as these ground landlords are concerned, that their property was made valuable, not by any action of their own, but by the efforts of the community to whom they have contributed nothing.  That being so they ought to be compelled to give something back to the community. The Government may say that they cannot accept the motion, that it deals with a very big matter.  I admit it does.  It is a matter that embraces a great many interests.  You might have, as Deputy Kelly pointed out, different interests concerned in the one piece of ground, but if the Government are prepared to say that they are willing to have an investigation without delay into this whole matter of ground rents, that they are prepared to do something towards the protection of householders, and that whatever commission they appoint to inquire into it will not be merely a commission to hold the thing up I, for one, would be perfectly satisfied.</P>
    <P>I see that it would be a difficult matter for the present Government or any other Government to introduce forthwith legislation that would deal with this problem in any satisfactory way.  As I say, the main purpose of the motion is to have the matter ventilated, to give us an opportunity of putting our views on the matter before the House and to try, if we can, to convince the Government that it is a matter that should be tackled and tackled fairly soon.  If the Government has any desire to deal with the matter then, as I say, I am satisfied, but I do submit that here is a problem which should be approached in a serious way.  This is a matter that affects tens of thousands of people in this country, and it is only fair to those people, if not to those who have raised <Col N="940" /> the matter here, that it should be brought up in this House, and treated in a serious way.  I am just saying to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister, of course, is notorious for the way in which he treats people, certain people in this House, and we know the reason for it.  The Minister will have to face up to his responsibilities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  As I was saying on the motion, it is the Minister's duty in this House to listen to debates and to the various speakers. If Ministers and members of the Opposition were to listen only to what they considered good speeches, this House would be very often empty and perhaps never so empty as when the Minister himself would be speaking.  I think that would be nearly the unanimous decision of all Parties.  But when the Minister refuses to listen to me or any other member of the House, he is refusing to listen to those people who are leaseholders in this country. I am trying, however badly, to put their case in this House and as a representative of the people I am entitled to a hearing.  The Minister may have his own opinion about myself, but that does not matter.  It is as a representative of the people that I am entitled to a hearing from the Minister; I am entitled to be treated in a courteous manner, treated to the same courtesy as he would extend to any other member of the House, because of my representative capacity. As to what he thinks of me personally, that is neither here nor there. Perhaps I would prefer the Minister should hold his present opinion of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the subject-matter of this motion, it is a matter which in my opinion should be investigated.  So far as the debate has gone, and considering we have had only a few speakers, I think we have at least established that there is a case to be investigated. I would be sorry to think that the Minister's attitude here conveys a true impression of the Government's mind on this matter or the mind of the Fianna Fáil Party.  If we were to judge the mind of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="945" /> Party and the mind of the Government as a whole from the exhibition given by the Minister, I would be very sorry to believe that that accurately represents their attitude.  I do not believe it does.  Therefore, I hope the Government will take action and, if they decide to do so, if they agree there is a case to be investigated, then we are quite satisfied to leave the machinery in the hands of the Government.  I agree that it is a big problem, but if they are prepared to investigate it I am perfectly satisfied, and that is all I have to say about the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Candidly, I am disappointed with Deputy Morrissey's speech.  I came into the House this evening hoping to get enlightenment on this subject because, like my friend and colleague, Deputy Tom Kelly, I lean with very much sympathy towards the attitude of Deputy Morrissey on the matter of ground rents.  I think it is a pity that an otherwise interesting speech was more or less spoilt by some of the interchanges which took place. I am disappointed from another standpoint. Surely, if this question has been three years before this House, some facts ought to have been ascertained during that period, and the seconder of this motion should have provided himself with these facts and given them to us this evening.  I rose more or less out of compliment to Deputy Morrissey, but he gives a brilliant example of courtesy in this House occasionally, too.</P>

      <P>I do not know if Deputy Anthony, when closing this debate, will have any more data than Deputy Morrissey.  He referred simply to one particular estate, the Pembroke Estate, but anyone living in Dublin could get the kind of general statement <Col N="946" /> that Deputy Morrissey submitted here.  I should have thought that he would have a long list and that he would have been able to back up that list with facts and data that could not be answered except in some direct fashion.  The extraordinary thing, however, is that most of the detailed statements came from this side. Deputy Kelly produced his facts here and read them.  Deputy Corry produced his documents here and read them.  Any real contributions that have been useful in this debate have come from the Government side.  Deputy Morrissey said a moment ago that if the Government undertook to have a committee appointed to investigate this matter, &ldquo;we would be satisfied.&rdquo; I presume he is referring to the proposer of the motion and himself, but there is one Deputy in the House whom I should very much like to hear on this question of ground rents.  I am sorry he is not here, because he is an authority on the subject.  I should like to here a speech from the leader of the Opposition on ground rents, particularly as applying to the City of Dublin, because we might then get some valuable information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I recognise that this is a serious matter.  I recognise that we might be striking at some fundamental if hasty legislation were introduced.  While recognising that, I agree with those speakers who pointed out the amount of cash that is extracted from the people and put into the pockets of people who have made no effort to make the lands valuable and who reap a harvest thereby.  It is an awkward position for anybody to be in and it is an awkward state of mind in which to find oneself.  All the enlightenment that can be given on this subject before any legislation that will meet the Bill could be put through is absolutely essential, and, as I have said before, I do not know anybody more capable, anybody with better general knowledge of the subject, than Deputy Cosgrave.  Personally, I would be delighted if he came along, as he will, I am sure, and took part in this debate.  We will then have his views as leader of the Opposition on this important matter.  It is one of the <Col N="947" /> things for which I am waiting and for which I hope I will not wait in vain.</P>
    <P>After all, any of us could take up one of these Official Reports.  Deputy Corry did so and he read an extract from a speech made by Deputy Belton to the effect that land bought for £200 in Dublin was valued for £9,000 later on.  That is a wild and sweeping statement and I know that if Deputy Belton were making his speech now he would not make that statement in view of Deputy Kelly's reply to it.</P>

      <P>Advantage has been taken of those remarks.  Deputy Kelly described them as the foolish remarks of Deputy Belton&mdash;to create a wrong impression, to create something that otherwise would not have existed.  I hope that when Deputy Anthony is closing this debate he will not act as Deputy Morrissey has acted.  I understand from a source I have reason to believe that certain documents are pouring into the House from various parts of the city dealing with the Pembroke, the Fitzwilliam and other estates.  I hope we will hear something about these famous documents. I am certain that my authority would not tell me an untruth about it, and I should like to hear something myself about head rents in connection with the Fitzwilliam Estate in Fitzwilliam Square.  I should like also a little more information about the Pembroke Estate.  I happen to be slightly interested in that matter, and before a Deputy makes a statement, such as Deputy Morrissey has made here, he should have gone a little farther and got for us details proved beyond yea or nay.  The only front bencher present at the moment is Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney.  He was Minister for Justice and there is no better authority, if he does not mind my saying so, in Ireland to-night on the question of head rents than he.  Can we have any contribution from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney?  Deputies like myself, to whom this subject is more or less foreign, look to him and to Deputy Cosgrave, even though we disagree <Col N="948" /> with them in Party politics, for advice and enlightenment on this subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the views of the Executive Council on the matter, or, at least, I think I do.  I know what each member of the Executive Council thinks, or I believe I do, but I should like to hear the House being informed by the Opposition Front Benches as to their attitude towards these ground rents.  That is not an unreasonable request and I expect we will get that information.  I see no reason why we should not.  Frankly, I am in the position at the moment that I sympathise to a great extent with the motion, but believe it is not going to get us anywhere.  Even at present, Deputy Morrissey is running away from the motion.  When it was tabled three years ago I take it that there was a keener public opinion on the matter which inspired Deputy Anthony as proposer and Deputy Morrissey as seconder to get it on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It is nearly time you began to recognise that we did anything at all.  You used to say the same about housing and you swallowed that very gracefully this evening too. When this motion was put on the Order Paper I do not know that there was a keener public opinion on the matter than possibly there may be now, and, what is more, I know that even quite recently a number of people went to a sale in the city where head rents were being auctioned and broke it up.  There is a feeling against them and for that reason it is a serious matter.  If legislation is to be introduced it must be on proper lines, and there is no use in Deputy Anthony or Deputy Morrissey trying to get a little popularity by tabling motions such as this and then practically running away from them.  Why not try to introduce private legislation in connection with this matter, if you are in earnest about it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey is one of the members of the official Opposition.  Deputy Anthony is a free lance and can do what he likes.  Presumably, he can get somebody to introduce private legislation.  He is amenable to no whip, but it would be pleasant if three postmen had to go to his door in Cork to-morrow morning with cards of congratulation, when all this talk of elections is in the air.  I will go so far with Deputy Morrissey as to say that he might steal some of our promises in the hope of getting back. I am giving you that to console you to-night for the awful, wretched exhibition you have made of yourself in putting a resolution down and then running away from it.  That is what it amounts to.  The two Deputies concerned are perfectly well aware that <Col N="950" /> legislation will not be introduced as a result of this.  Did you not know that before it was tabled?  Yet Deputy Morrissey, who put himself down as the seconder, gets up without any authority whatever from his own Party to create&mdash;and I do not use this phrase in any offensive way&mdash;a false impression in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I do not expect to get any pats on the back from the Minister when I am done.  In dealing with this matter I hope I have come much nearer to the question of finding some remedy for the grievance of people in connection with ground rents than has Deputy Morrissey.  But I want to hear something definite in connection with this matter.  I want to hear some of the leaders of the Opposition give their views on the subject.  I should like, for instance, to hear Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and to learn what his attitude is.  I am very anxious to hear him and so I shall conclude in order that he may be able to give his views to the House.</P>

      <P>I am not in the least bit afraid to express my views on this question.  Deputy Donnelly has been very kind, and courteous, to me in the course of this discussion.  He told us that he was very disappointed with the speech Deputy Anthony made.  May I, in all gentleness, say to Deputy Donnelly that I was frightfully disappointed in the speech he made.  We all saw that he was not making a speech of his own.  We saw the pump handle working when the Minister for Finance was pressing Deputy Donnelly to make the speech that he, the Minister, would like to have made.  I was waiting, and was on the <i>qui vive,</i> to know what was the speech that was to be made, that is the speech that Deputy Donnelly was put up to make, the speech that he was forced to make. What did I get as a result?  Nothing. He simply said &ldquo;I am a poor ignorant fellow.  I do not know the first thing about this and I should like to get somebody to put me right&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I have got up without the least bit of reluctance because this matter of town tenants legislation is one that I have gone into, perhaps more deeply than any other member of the House.  I spent a very considerable number of months, when I was a Minister, dealing with one of the most thorny questions that any Minister could be asked to deal with and that was the relation between landlord and tenant in the matter of ground rent property.  I introduced a Bill which was debated and carried through this House with fewer divisions than any Bill of its importance that was ever passed.  That Bill, dealing with a large and thorny question, my successor in office has left completely and entirely untouched, so that I can apply to myself some of the nice things which Deputy Donnelly said about me, believing that that piece of legislation was as good as could be introduced.  It dealt, to a certain extent, with the problem of ground rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go any further in this discussion, I should like the House to understand what a ground rent is, because it is pretty obvious to me that Deputy Kelly was using the term in a different sense from the sense in which a ground rent is usually and properly used.  Deputy Kelly talked of seven or eight different interests that had to be dealt with when the corporation is purchasing land.  There may be seven or eight, or 50 or 100, interested in a ground rent, but there can be only one owner of a ground rent.  A ground rent is a rent payable for the soil, as distinct from the house that is erected on the soil.  The fee-simple owner of the soil is the owner <Col N="952" /> of the ground rent, and there can only be one fee-simple owner of the soil at a time.  When I say there can only be one fee-simple owner I want to make that clearer.  There may be five or six joint owners, but there can only be one fee-simple interest.  There may be joint interests but there can only be one owner.  There may be joint tenants but there can only be one interest.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the question of ground rents the first thing we ought to consider, and bear in mind, is that a ground rent means a rent paid for the soil upon which a house is built and has nothing to do with the value of the bricks and mortar erected upon that soil.</P>

I take it that Deputy Anthony and Deputy Morrissey meant by ground rents, the ordinary and correct meaning of the term, that is, rent payable out of the soil.</P>
