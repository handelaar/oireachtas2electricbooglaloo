      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1) when it is proposed to deal under the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, with claims where the amounts have not been agreed on, and (2) whether any rules as to reference to arbitration of unagreed claims under the Act have been made.</P>

      <P>I have no function in the matter of claims under the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1935, which is one for the Electricity Supply Board. The Act provides the manner of dealing with claims, including references to arbitration.  I understand that all of the claims that have arisen so far are actively engaging attention.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations were made to him regarding the unsatisfactory character of the bus service provided in Dublin between O'Connell Bridge and certain areas in the Rialto district; whether he has taken any, and, if so, what action to secure for the citizens affected an adequate service; whether he is aware that the service is still very unsatisfactory and is causing much hardship, and whether it is his intention to take any further steps to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the citizens in this respect.</P>

      <P>No representations have been made to me regarding the <Col N="1622" /> character of the bus services provided in the Rialto district.  In consequence of representations made by a deputation representative of residents in the Inchicore and Fairbrothers Fields districts which waited on me on the 25th March, I communicated with the Dublin United Tramways Company, following which steps were immediately taken to restore in these districts modified bus services in lieu of those temporarily withdrawn.  I have been assured by the company that the services in these districts will be progressively improved accordingly as additional vehicles become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any special facilities given to those importing oranges from Spain who avail of the direct Irish shipping service established between this country and Spain.  The Orders under the Control of Imports Act dealing with the orange quotas require that oranges forming the special quota allotted to Spain shall be shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been produced in Spain and consigned to the importer from that country.  In <Col N="1623" /> addition, during the current quota period, which is the third quota period in respect of the orange quotas, the following condition has been attached to each licence for the importation of oranges forming part of the special quota in favour of Spain, viz.:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This licence is issued subject to the condition that the goods to be imported thereunder shall be brought by ship and without transhipment from the port of loading in Spain to the port of landing in Saorstát Eireann.&rdquo;</P>

Do I understand from the Minister now, that he gives no facilities other than those contained in the latter part of his answer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish shipping service established between this country and Spain is available to any importer who chooses to use it. Twenty-five per cent. of the total quota is fixed, the distribution of which is at the discretion of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and in allocating that portion of the quota consideration is given to those who have guaranteed this special shipping service to Spain.</P>

      <P>There were just one or two other matters to which, in reply to criticisms on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government and Public Health, I should like to refer. One was the question of the treatment of tuberculosis.  Deputy Dr. Rowlette and others asked a number of questions about the subject.  I would refer Deputies to the Annual Report for 1933-34 of the Department of Local Government and Public Health in which, on page 93, a tabular statement sets out the incidence of tuberculosis and the rate of mortality of people from tuberculosis. At the end of the table there is a paragraph to this effect:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As compared with the years 1912-14, the reduction in mortality from tuberculosis for all age periods together is 44 per cent.  The greatest decrease&mdash;65 per cent. less than in 1912-14 &mdash; occurred at ages under five.  The decrease in other age groups, as compared with 1912-14 was: five to ten years, 63 per cent.; 10 to 15 years, 61 per cent.; 20 to 25 years, 26 per cent.; and 25 to 35 years, 38 per cent.</P>
      <P>The highest tuberculosis mortality rate in 1933 per 1,000 of the population were as follows:&mdash;Dublin County Borough, 1.80; Cork County Borough, 1.62; Louth County, 1.50; Dublin County, 1.48.  The lowest rates were as follows:&mdash;Cavan County, 0.73; Monaghan County, 0.78; Roscommon County, 0.80; Waterford County, 0.81.</P>
      <P>As set out in my opening statement, in the last period for which we have figures there has not been any change over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> The Department have a policy on the question of tuberculosis treatment and the officials have been examining the subject in consultation with the members of the Hospitals Commission for some months past.  They have not elaborated in detail the plan that is being worked out between the Department and the Hospitals Commission, but Deputies might be interested if I gave them a rough outline of what is in mind.  It may be useful from the point of view of getting criticism.  I know that not every medical authority or medical expert on tuberculosis in the country is satisfied that everything that could be done is being done.  I have heard criticism from time to time and have heard that people are dissatisfied, but unquestionably in the last 20 years very big advances have been made, and there has been a great improvement and a great reduction in the rate of mortality from tuberculosis. The treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis in the various sanatoria established all over the country has, in all probability, materially helped in the big improvement that is evident.  This is a very rough outline of what is being discussed at present as the basis of a plan for dealing with tuberculosis:&mdash;</P>
    <P>A person who is suspected or suspects himself of being affected by tubercular disease of some kind visits a central or branch tuberculosis dispensary.  After examination, the tuberculosis officer classifies the patient as (a) early or moderately-advanced pulmonary T.B. case capable of cure or improvement; (b) surgical T.B. case of similar class; (c) observation case; (d) clearly advanced or chronic case for which no improvement can be expected; or (e) non-tuberculosis case.</P>
    <P>The T.B. officer recommends cases classified as (a) and (c) for admission to a chest hospital where accurate diagnosis is made by X-Ray and observation, and any necessary surgical intervention is carried out.  The patients are then drafted, according to their classification, either to a central sanatorium, where the most up-to-date treatment is available, or to the local tuberculosis institution for <Col N="1632" /> advanced and chronic cases.  Cases needing major surgical operations from time to time are transferred from the sanatorium to the chest hospital when the operation is necessary.</P>
    <P>The class at (b) are to be dealt with at an orthopædic centre, or, where minor surgery only is called for, they may first be admitted to a county hospital for the purpose, and subsequently transferred to the orthopædic centre, which is to be associated with an orthopædic school or instructional centre.</P>
    <P>It will, therefore, be necessary for every applicant for treatment, whether for a first or subsequent course, to be drafted through a chest hospital for classification unless his clinical and physical symptoms are such as indicate that he has reached the chronic or hopelessly advanced stage of the disease.</P>
    <P>The advance case hospitals at present used as local sanatoria are to provide bed accommodation for both pulmonary and surgical cases in the advanced stages.</P>
    <P>The units required for the new tuberculosis schemes will be as follows:&mdash;(a) For each county and other district, central and branch tuberculosis dispensaries may be required; (b) a central chest hospital in Dublin, and a wing or block in regional hospitals so located as to serve conveniently groups of counties, etc.; (c) central sanatoria fully equipped to provide the most up-to-date treatment for early and moderately-advanced cases of pulmonary tuberculosis; these institutions to be so located as to serve conveniently groups of counties; (d) a central orthopædic centre or group of co-ordinated institutions to deal with surgical cases of tuberculosis&mdash;county hospitals to be utilised for minor surgery in such cases; (e) advanced case hospitals.</P>
    <P>These proposals would probably require for efficient operation legislation to secure compulsory notification of all types of tuberculosis with power of compulsory removal to an institution and the retention therein of all tuberculous patients in an infective stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1633" /> That would be for discussion at a later date, of course, but I thought it might be of interest to those who raised the question of tuberculosis and its treatment on the Estimate, and others outside who are interested in this question, to hear what we have in mind, even though what I have said now only gives a rough outline of the plan in mind.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke of the question of reform of county homes.  That is a matter in which I am deeply interested myself, and I know that the officials of the Department have been doing all they can to try and improve county homes, and in some cases to carry the reform of county homes so far, you might say, as to blot out the county home as we know it, the old-fashioned institution, altogether.  I should like to draw Deputies attention to an institution that has been in existence now for about three years outside Mallow &mdash;the Nazareth Home.  I invite any Deputy who finds himself in the vicinity of Mallow, and who is interested in this subject, to visit the Nazareth Home and see how the old and infirm people are treated in that institution. That type of institution for the care of the old and infirm is to be commended, and recommended to every local authority which has charge of the old and infirm.  I understand that the Meath Board of Health are arranging with the Nazareth Home nuns to set up a similar institution in their county, and I think other counties have discussed the matter also with a view to taking similar action.  On the whole, the question of the reform of the county homes has been slow, and I would like to see greater progress made.  Even where the boards of health do not wish to introduce this Order, or where for some reason or other there may be difficulties about it, they certainly could pay a visit to these institutions I have mentioned and see how they are run; they could observe the great improvement in the treatment and in the lives and health and appearance of the patients, and that, perhaps, would give them many a headline that would be useful to them even in the old county homes, such as they are, as long as they have to exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly of Cork mentioned the <Col N="1634" /> subject of waterworks and sewerage schemes, and I think he said, if my memory is not at fault, that there are 60 schemes ready for carrying out in County Cork.  I hope that is true, but I am rather inclined to doubt if there would be anything like 60 schemes ready.  Anyhow, whatever number of schemes are ready, they will be all welcome. The plans will be welcomed in the Department, where we are anxious and willing to help, not alone the boards of health in County Cork, but boards of health everywhere, to go ahead with their plans and schemes for waterworks and sewerage in every urban area in the country.  I am hoping that in this financial year we will have a considerably increased sum available in the way of grants-in-aid for these waterworks and sewerage schemes, and I would invite local authorities, any of them that have been disappointed in the past with regard to grants&mdash;I do not think there have been many&mdash;again to take up the matter with the Local Government Department, and so far as we can we will assist them in getting their plans through rapidly, and we will assist them also with the usual generous grant for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rowlette contributed interesting and constructive criticism. He mentioned the subject of the unmarried mother and the illegitimate child.  I think he may not be entirely aware of all that has been done already to help to deal with the problem.  We have established in recent years special homes in County Cork, County Tipperary and County Westmeath, to deal primarily with the mothers of first-born illegitimate children. The important features in these homes are the ante-natal and maternity departments and individual attention is given to the mothers of the children. One of the lady inspectors is occupied almost wholly in dealing with this matter.  I am happy to be in a position to assure Deputy Rowlette and other members of the House that everything that we can do to look after these unfortunate people is being done with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked questions about their own counties and what arrangements <Col N="1635" /> were being made to deal with hospitalisation in their areas.  I have not a complete return here, but I have some notes in relation to institutions in different counties, with the stage of advancement of hospitalisation of different kinds, and perhaps I could refer to some of these for the information of Deputies who asked questions on the matter.  As regards works completed, we have Tralee county hospital and Mullingar county hospital.  These two hospitals are completed.  In the case of Tralee, it has been in operation for some time, and Mullingar will probably be in operation in the next week or two.  Works have been completed on district hospitals at Kenmare, Ennistymon, Millstreet, Clifden, and also in the case of Swinford fever hospital.  These are works that were financed very largely out of the Sweepstake Funds.</P>
    <P>Work is in progress on county hospitals in Mayo, Monaghan, Ennis, Nenagh, Cashel and Mallow; on district hospitals at Ballina, Belmullet, Swinford, New Ross, Gorey, Charleville, Youghal and Midleton; and on fever hospitals at Ballina, Belmullet, Swinford, Abbeyleix and New Ross.  Plans have been approved for county hospitals at Kilkenny, Sligo, Portlaoighise, Roscommon and Tullamore; for district hospitals at Killarney, Listowel, and Boyle; and for fever hospitals at Killarney, Listowel, Naas and Boyle.  Other works in progress include the reconstruction of Carrick-on-Shannon workhouse for use as a county home for Leitrim; improvements at Thurles district hospital; the erection of a nurses' home at Kanturk hospital, and the erection of a maternity wing at the Home, Tuam.  Extensive improvements to Dublin workhouse have been carried out and are still being executed.  There are a great number of works contemplated and constant discussions and communications between the Department and the local authorities, boards of health, etc., have been proceeding.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of work has been done in the case of mental hospitals all over the country. Perhaps I had better read out a few <Col N="1636" /> notes on this subject.  In the case of Ardee, a new mental hospital has been completed to accommodate 370 patients, with rooms for 16 nurses, a flat for the assistant medical officer, and a house for the resident medical superintendent.  The approximate cost was £138,000, apart from the purchase of land.  A new chapel is almost completed at a cost of approximately £5,000.  In the case of Ballinasloe, a chronic block, a tuberculosis block, and an admission block to accommodate 387 patients and 26 staff are being constructed. The estimated cost is about £200,000.  In Castlerea a new auxiliary mental hospital is being constructed to accommodate 450 patients.  The estimated cost is £220,000.  At Castlebar male and female wings to accommodate 331 patients are being constructed and there are various other improvements also being carried out. The estimated cost is £120,000.  In Kilkenny the purchase of furniture and the installation of laundry machinery and equipment and the carrying out of various improvements were estimated to cost £41,000.</P>
    <P>In the case of Killarney, an extension is being constructed to accommodate 132 patients, in addition to providing heating, dental surgery and laundry equipment, all at an estimated cost of £77,000.  In Letterkenny a new chapel, a nurses' home, the reconstruction of an old chapel, etc., will cost £34,000.  We are constructing an admission hospital at Limerick, together with male and female blocks and an isolation hospital to accommodate 310 patients.  We are also constructing an assistant medical officer's house.  Heating and lighting and various other construction work are being carried out.  The estimated cost is £128,000.  In Mullingar there is a male and female chronic block, and a hospital block to provide accommodation for 478 patients, together with a nurses' home and various reconstruction works in the kitchen, laundry and workshops.  The estimated cost is £173,000.  In Portlaoighise, furniture and equipment are being provided at an estimated cost of £8,000.  Proposed works include accommodation for county home cases and modernising the sanitary annexes at an estimated cost <Col N="1637" /> of £64,000.  In Sligo, a considerable sum is to be spent on additional buildings, heatings, lighting and a house for the resident medical superintendent. As regards other mental hospitals, we are in active consultation with the committees of these institutions with regard to improvements which will be put in hands at an early date.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Seámus Moore who asked about the fines for breaches of the Road Traffic Act.  Almost 50 per cent. of the prosecutions were dismissed or disposed of without penalty, while a large proportion of the remainder was dealt with by imposing small fines.  Of the 2,288 cases of using unlicensed vehicles, slightly over 25 per cent. of the convictions resulted in fines not exceeding 5/- each.  Generally, the return indicates that the fines imposed are inadequate as a deterrent for this offence.  That is the view of the Gárda Síochána, and it is the view of my Department with regard to the question of fines imposed for certain breaches of the Road Traffic Act.</P>
    <P>One other point, before I sit down, and that is with regard to the Gaeltacht Order which Deputy Mulcahy raised on Friday.  It seems to me&mdash;I may have got a wrong impression&mdash;that Deputy Mulcahy was displeased that I introduced my Estimate by speaking for some time in Irish.  I do not know why that should displease him, or why he should be so cranky about it.  He rather suggested it was to cover certain sins of omission or commission of a grievous kind to him in the work of my Department, so far as the use of the Irish language generally is concerned. I know Deputy Mulcahy is sincerely interested in the furtherance of the Gaelic language, but I thought it might not be unreasonable to expect that he would give others credit for a little sincerity, too.  We are not always prating about it, but we try to do what we can in practice and by example as well as by precept.  I think the Gaelic Order which the Deputy brought in during his period of office has done good.  But in certain areas, with regard to certain individuals, I have found it practically impossible to carry it out to its fullest logical extent. There were several hundreds of people <Col N="1638" /> who came in under that Order and were appointed to posts in areas scheduled as Gaeltacht.  During the last seven or eight years many of these did qualify in the time allowed, but a goodly number did not.  There are a number of people of mature age, 50 or 60 years old, some of them in minor posts, who were subject to the Order but who failed to qualify and who never could qualify, and the question now for me is: am I to give an order that would mean the expulsion of these people from their position?  I think there would be 300 of such people scattered all over the country, and I do not feel like doing that.  I am as anxious as anybody else to see the language promoted and people encouraged to take it up, but I would like to be reasonable.</P>
    <P>I have been discussing this question of the Gaeltacht Order with people in my Department for the last six months. I have not yet arrived at a solution of the difficult problem of those people who did not qualify and who could have qualified, but I hope to have something to offer as a sort of substitution for the Gaeltacht Order, and perhaps to improve on it in so far as it will be more workable and more practical and not in any way hurtful to the language.  I think that is all I have to say at the moment.</P>

I think Deputies in this House, and people in the country who followed closely the change made in National Health Insurance some time ago, when it was proposed to amalgamate 65 National Health Insurance societies into one organisation, thought that the argument advanced was to the effect that a reduction in expenditure was urgently necessary and would take place.  It was held that the system which was to be replaced was wasteful, unsatisfactory and extravagant, and that the new centrally co-ordinated system of National Health Insurance societies would do away with a lot of unnecessary expenditure without curtailing or restricting in any way the rights of the insured persons under the scheme. I submit that the change made did not do anything of the kind, and that this Estimate affords proof of that fact.  The cost of the central service in the Minister's Department relating to National Health Insurance&mdash;and, incidentally, I may say I am very <Col N="1641" /> glad that service is maintained in an efficient way, because I think it affords protection to insured persons from any encroachment on their rights&mdash;instead of being reduced has been very substantially increased.</P>
      <P>The Estimate before us reveals an increase from £75,200 to £82,614, the figures being for the years 1935-36 and 1936-37.  There has been an increase of £7,400 since unification became effective, because the two years I have mentioned cover the period since unification became effective.  Minor staff changes have taken place but the expenditure remains as I have stated. The one striking fact that emerges from an examination of the Estimate is the increase I have mentioned. There is probably a definite reason for that increase.  The Minister's view as to the reason for the increase might be different from my view.  I think that the increase has been necessitated by the administration of the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be evident to officials of the Minister's Department who deal with the administration of National Health Insurance that there is very serious dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Unified Society is being managed.  It must be evident that a great many of the difficulties of the central staff who deal with National Health Insurance have been accentuated or increased by the attitude taken up by the society in regard to the payment of benefits.  There have been frequent complaints of delay.  In many cases this has arisen because of some technicality which has been resurrected.  In my opinion there has been an attitude of, to some extent contempt for the claims of insured persons.  I came across a case recently of a man who had been in hospital and who left hospital for two or three months, having notified the officials of the Society.  Afterwards he received a letter, through the Minister's Department, to say that only a few days before did the society ascertain that the man had left hospital several weeks before.  There should be some understanding of the position of a man who spent several weeks in hospital during which he could not receive benefit and who had left hospital several weeks <Col N="1642" /> before the Society admitted that they had information of the fact.  I am aware that letters&mdash;I could substantiate this in some cases&mdash;addressed to the offices of the Society containing applications for membership and a request for the official form were not even acknowledged.  In one case several weeks have elapsed since that application was made.  The fact is that this society is extremely unpopular with a very large section of insured persons throughout the country, and that unpopularity seems to be gathering strength, instead of waning, in several parts of the country.  I think that it is the duty of workers' representatives in this House to call attention to that, and to point to the fact that, in their opinion, as in my opinion, the increased expenditure on this whole service is due to the policy of the society, which necessitates a more close and vigorous watch over their activities than would be required if the society were administered along the lines a National Health Insurance society should be administered.</P>
    <P>There has been a saving in other directions, and the nature of that saving is very striking.  It is estimated that about 15,000 persons come into insurance each year.  This year, the grants-in-aid for the various benefits provided under National Health Insurance have been reduced.  The reduction is a very striking one.  The State grant for 1935-6 was £188,000. The estimated expenditure in the current year is £173,000, or £15,000 less, for sickness, disablement and maternity benefits than last year.  It must be remembered, at the same time, that there will be 15,000 extra persons in insurance this year.  Working out the reduction in relation to the amount given by the Minister's Department in aid of benefits&mdash;two-ninths&mdash;it is found that the total reduction in benefits anticipated under this Estimate is about £67,000.  There we have the secret of the inquisitions that go on on the merest pretence in regard to claims for benefit.  I wish the officials of the Society would get out of their heads the idea that seems to prevail that a very large number of the people who apply for National Health Insurance <Col N="1643" /> benefit are just impostors&mdash; people who are malingering.  That seems to be the attitude in a very large number of cases, and were it not for the machinery that is adequately, humanely and properly maintained in the Minister's Department, this story would be a much sorrier one.  I am glad to admit&mdash;I think that it is right this should be said&mdash;that a great number of general applications for National Health Insurance benefit would be rejected were it not for the subsequent proceedings by arbitration.  These proceedings are long and wearisome to sick people waiting for benefit.  In a very large number of cases, as a result of arbitration, which involves two or three months' delay, substantial awards of benefit have been made to the insured persons in flat contradiction of the view taken by the Society.  I had hoped for a change in the whole policy associated with National Health Insurance.  I had hoped that some of the schemes outlined in the beginning for the development of National Health Insurance and kindred services, as well as schemes to supplement the present system of National Health Insurance would be the things to be discussed on an Estimate of this kind rather than their defects.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that when unification was set up it was stated to be for the purpose of making substantial progress along the road of social reform, in which National Health Insurance and services of that kind must always occupy a central position. I hoped that we would have had an opportunity of discussing progress of that kind rather than harking back, as we have to from time to time, to this subject.  I think the present position is entirely unsatisfactory, and that I have established in fact that one of the claims made for the promotion of the scheme originally, that a certain amount of expense in the central services associated with National Health Insurance could be saved, proves to be groundless.  In my constituency, in Cork City and other places, I think there is a great deal of dissatisfaction with the present service on the part of the Workers' Council of <Col N="1644" /> Cork and various trade unions which have voiced dissatisfaction with the whole system as it prevails.  There is one ray of hope in the whole position, and that is that before we come to discuss this Estimate again a new committee of management will be elected. I sincerely hope that the election of that committee will result in a very considerable change in the administration of the society, and that a more humane and progressive view-point will eliminate from the control of National Health Insurance in the Unified Society the outlook that obtains at the present time.  Whatever view may be taken in regard to certain aspects of this service, we have to admit that it is unsatisfactory, and that nothing we have seen or heard recently has caused us to change that opinion.  The whole position is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I want to enter a very emphatic protest against a position that reveals a possible reduction of £67,000 in benefits for insured members during the coming year.  They are not in the position to have their claims substantiated in a court of law with due publicity given to the manner in which they were treated.  They have to avail of the machinery laid down in the Act and to conform to requirements which, in some cases, are difficult for them, and in any case involve very considerable delay.  A great many have had their points of view and their claims vindicated, because they were dealt with not by officials of the society, but by officials of the Minister's Department, who, in my opinion, constitute the only protection that a large number of insured persons have at the present time from the policy of hostility very often adopted towards their claims.  I object as strongly as I can to the very substantial reduction in benefits that is contemplated.  I think that can only be enforced if a wrong is done to insured persons.  You cannot have a very substantial reduction of that kind carried out, while at the same time 15,000 new persons come into national health insurance, without loss in some way, and I object to a system under which the scale and cost of administration is higher while there is an endeavour to get it where insured persons are concerned, <Col N="1645" /> and who are in a worse position to defend themselves.  I hope the Minister will be able to throw some light on a position which is an unpleasant one, and that we will have some indication that the policy of the society, as we have seen it for a considerable time past, is likely to undergo a very much wanted change in the immediate future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>In my opinion there is no foundation whatever for 99.9 of the complaints made by the Deputy as regards national health insurance.  As far as I know there is no foundation for them.  If there was the widespread dissatisfaction that he spoke of I ought to know something about it, and I ought to have heard the complaints.  I did not hear them.  I know this much, of my own personal knowledge, that I do not get one in four or maybe one in six of the letters that I used to get in previous years.  They do not come to me now.  Every week I get one or two letters, but taking the average over the whole year it might not be more than a dozen in a week.  I do not think I get any more than that.  Every complaint, whatever its nature, is fully inquired into.  I think it is not altogether fair to make wholesale charges of inefficiency, want of humane treatment or proper treatment against a staff that has only now, so to speak, got into its stride.  The period allotted to the new organisation for taking over the 63 or 65 National Health Insurance societies that formerly existed has come to a close, and wonderful work in the way of reorganisation and in bringing about unification has been already accomplished. There was not time for the staff, much less the committee of management, to do much more than to give close attention to the work of bringing the new organisation into existence and supervising the reorganisation of a very big institution which I hope has a great career of usefulness before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another point that Deputy Murphy raised he was mistaken, when he suggested that the cost of National Health Insurance has gone up.  As a matter of fact it has gone down.  I <Col N="1646" /> will not use the word &ldquo;considerably,&rdquo; but effective economies have been made.  The reason for the increased cost is the extra cost of administration owing to the institution of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. The staff for widows' and orphans' pensions is amalgamated to a certain extent with national health insurance. The controller of National Health Insurance is also controller of the widows' and orphans' pensions' and the staff likewise supervises the work of the widows' and orphans' pensions. Up-to-date there have been the following economies made: Two junior executive officers, 10 clerical officers, and six writing assistants in the National Health Insurance scheme.  The full effect has not yet been felt, while it is anticipated that further economies will be made later.  There was a considerable increase in staff when the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act was brought into operation, and that accounts for the increased cost of staff and administration as shown in the figures set out in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>In 98 per cent. of the claims, the Society issued a cheque in respect of the benefit claimed on the day following the receipt of the evidence.  About 28,000 claims are dealt with weekly. That is an improvement on what was true a year or two ago.</P>
    <P>I have some figures here which might be of interest to the Deputy in view of the remarks he made as to the payment of benefit.  Taking contributions first, the value of the contributions for employers and employees for the five years from 1931 to 1935 was as follows:&mdash;1931, £580,600; 1932, £592,600; 1933, £602,000; 1934, £628,800; 1935, £651,600.  The amounts paid in respect of benefits for the five years from 1931 to 1935, inclusive, were as follows, in cash and non-cash additional benefits, respectively:&mdash;1931, cash, £710,406; non-cash additional benefits, £38,265; 1932, £702,682 and £33,582; 1933, £731,374 and £29,795; 1934, £751,018 and £30,934; 1935, £724,853 and £26,406.  The number of persons in receipt of sickness and disablement benefit at 31st December, 1935, was 26,437.  It may be assumed that the average number of persons in receipt <Col N="1647" /> of these benefits weekly was 26,691. The number of confinements in respect of which maternity benefit was paid during 1935 was 24,990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point as to the payment of additional sickness and disablement benefit for the coming year, it is true that a number of societies that have now been amalgamated did pay additional benefits in the past.  These additional benefits will terminate this year.  At present we are making the quinquennial examination&mdash;the working for the five years of the individual societies.  That is the subject of the usual scrutiny.  It is not anticipated that, when the actuaries' report is published, a surplus will be disclosed.  That means that the additional benefits will terminate&mdash;for the time being, at any rate, there being no surplus.  If a surplus is disclosed&mdash;as I say, it is not expected that it will be disclosed&mdash; additional benefits probably will be paid, but then a Supplementary Estimate would have to be brought in to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any question but that that was the general tendency, unless we asked the taxpayer to come to the assistance of the general insurance fund.  The reduction of £14,000 in the Estimate for 1936-7 is mainly accounted for by the fact that no provision has been made for State grant on additional benefits after the 5th July next, when <Col N="1648" /> the existing additional benefit schemes will terminate.  It is not expected that the fourth valuation which is at present being carried out will disclose a surplus available for additional benefits.  The reduction on this account is approximately £10,000.  During the year 1935, the number of medical certificates issued was 1,373,000 as compared with 1,410,000 during the year 1934, and this was reflected in the expenditure on benefits by the society.  The valuation on which we are working at present is a valuation for the period ending 1933, and therefore it is, practically speaking, the working of the old societies which is being examined, and not the working of the present Unified Society.  That examination will disclose what, in fact, was the position of National Health Insurance at the end of 1933.  Then there can be no question between Deputy Murphy and myself.  We shall know definitely from the actuary what the position was, whether the societies were in good financial standing, were in a bankrupt state or were likely to be in the bankrupt state that was forecasted by me, and on account of which it was absolutely necessary, in our view, to arrange for unification.  I hope that with the new committee that will take control of the organisation&mdash; this huge machine for the welfare of the working-class community as far as National Health Insurance is concerned &mdash;there will be satisfaction.  There will hardly be more opportunity for voicing complaints than at present, but probably it will encourage people to send in complaints when they have their own direct representatives to speak for them on the committee of management. That is all to the good.  Speaking for the Department and those in control of National Health Insurance, we welcome complaints.  We investigate them and we do everything possible to see that justice is done between the society and the individual member, but I think it is known, to some of us at any rate, that there is a disposition at times with people when they are dealing with public moneys not to be as careful as if they were dealing with their own moneys.  Sometimes, in the case of people who make demands on National <Col N="1649" /> Health Insurance and things of that kind&mdash;I do not say it is wholesale or widespread&mdash;you do get that disposition. If they can get away with it people will make declarations which are not in accordance with the facts.  You must, therefore, have staffs of inspectors and agents to examine these claims.  That is human nature, and it is not restricted to one class of society.  It is a tendency which pervades all classes of society in Ireland as in other countries. If we were living in an ideal State and had an ideal people to deal with, such things as supervision, the close watching of claims and inspectorates might not be necessary, but as we are dealing with people who are human, this machinery is still necessary to ensure that claims will be scrupulously examined.</P>

      <P>In connection with this Estimate, I would like to know from the Minister what progress has been made for dealing with the cases that have been referred to the referee.  I am referring to cases where a certain view has been taken officially as to claimants' means.  I know that a fairly large number of such cases have been referred to the referee, and I would like to know what progress has been made in dealing with them, having regard all the time to, what the Minister himself must recognise, its manifest imperfections. This represents the only complaint that I know of in connection with the administration of the Act.  I am not putting it forward as a complaint because I know that the preparations necessary to bring the Act into operation involved a pretty big undertaking. It involved the creation of a lot of new machinery, and I admit that it must take some time to get the scheme going smoothly.</P>
      <P>I would like to say, by way of contrast to what I have said in connection with another Vote, that the officials dealing with this service seem to me to be extremely prompt and efficient in supplying information in connection with claims.  As regards cases that have come to my knowledge, the investigation officers through the country seem to me to be not only courteous but sympathetic in dealing with them.  We must, of course, all the time bear in mind that the benefits of the Act are only apparent in a very limited way due to the extraordinary restrictions surrounding it.  There is the fact that thousands of people through the country who would be regarded as very deserving cases are, for the moment, excluded from its benefits. The provision for non-contributory pensions is, in individual cases, small; but that is not the main source of complaint as much as that thousands of people are, for one reason or another, excluded from the benefits of the Act.  Therefore, in a large number of cases hardship is felt.  One frequently finds cases turning up where a bread-winner was dead before National Health Insurance became a fact in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> I realise that I am not permitted on this Vote to advocate changes in the law, but I would hope that the Minister himself recognises that the last word has not been said in this House on pensions for widows and orphans, and that he will lose no opportunity that presents itself to introduce amending legislation to improve the position.  I am glad to be able to say that the benefits of this Act, limited and all as they are, are extremely welcome to the people concerned.  There is a feeling in the country which, I am sure, will not be falsified that this Act, imperfect and all as it is, is only the first step in making more ample provision for widows and orphans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy has just said about this Act, which was introduced and put through both Houses of the Oireachtas by me last year as being only a first step in bringing into operation a scheme for widows' and orphans' pensions in this country is I think correct.  I hope that in the days to come amending legislation will be brought in that will embrace at different times and in ever-increasing number all deserving cases of widows and orphans in the total number of those who will become pensionable.  The Deputy and other members of the House may be interested to have the following details with regard to the operation of this measure.  The total number of claims received up to 17th April, 1936, was 25,457 of which 24,738 were widows' claims and 719 were orphans. Claims by the widows and orphans of men who died on or after the second appointed day, namely, the 6th January, 1936, number 381.  The total number of claims in which pensions have been awarded up to the 17th April, 1936, is 10,422 and the rejected claims (including claims withdrawn) amount to 10,366, giving a total of 20,788 decided cases out of 25,457 received.  Of the rejected claims for widows' pensions which number 10,046, 3,828 have been rejected on the grounds of age.  It will be remembered that the Act provided that non-contributory pensions are not payable <Col N="1652" /> to widows who have not attained the age of 60 unless they have at least one child under 14 years of age or a child over 14 and under 16 who is attending school or is mentally or physically incapacitated.</P>
      <P>In 3,281 other cases it has not been established that the late husband of the widow was insured under the National Health Insurance Acts at date of death.  This condition is essential except in cases where the late husband was the occupier of a small holding not exceeding £8 in valuation. Claims had also to be rejected where the valuation of the holding exceeded £8, or where the widow was not resident on the holding.  The number of rejections in &ldquo;smallholder&rdquo; claims is 1,551.  In 1,175 cases, where the widow's net weekly means exceeded the maximum rate of pension payable, the claims had also to be rejected.</P>
      <P>The undecided claims number about 4,670, of which about 2,300 are in the hands of investigation officers for local verification of claimants' statements and for assessment of means.  Approximately 2,370 cases are under examination or awaiting replies to queries. The next point is one which the Deputy specially mentioned.  About 2,230 claimants have appealed against the decisions on their claims, and arrangements are now being completed by which the appeals will be decided by referees appointed under the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has already appointed a panel of referees.  The necessary regulations have been made, and the consideration of these cases will be taken up at once.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  For the past four years the Government has been actively investigating the possibility of substituting a supply of home-produced fuel for imported coal.  That investigation has ranged over all possibilities, and, as Deputies are aware, an active expert examination of our own coal deposits is at present proceeding.  It appeared <Col N="1653" /> to us, however, from the beginning that the most likely possibilities of early development rested in increasing the use for turf as a fuel for household purposes.  To that end we took steps designed to secure a substantial increase in the production of turf and in its use in various parts of the country. Measures designed to secure an increase in the production of turf were successful to some degree in the year 1933, when organised production first took place through the medium of co-operative societies formed for the purpose, and the turf produced was disposed of without great difficulty. In the year 1934, however, during which there was a substantial increase in the production of turf by the co-operative societies, a difficulty arose in the matter of marketing.  The response of the coal merchants to the requests of the Department to make turf available for sale to their customers, and to assist our efforts to get people to use it, was disappointing. Out of some 2,250 coal merchants in the country, only 470 have applied and been appointed as approved turf distributors.</P>
      <P>It became evident in 1934 that the Turf Development Board, which came into existence in that year and took over the activities formerly carried on by the Department, would require a very considerable increase in the sales of turf to enable it to dispose of the quantity produced by the co-operative turf societies and on their hands for the 1935 season.  That failure to dispose of all the turf produced in 1934 had a very direct reaction upon the quantity of turf produced in 1935.  For other reasons also the production of turf in 1935 declined.  Because, however, of the increase in the price of coal which took place towards the end of last year, all the turf on the hands of the societies, whether produced in 1935 or carried over from 1934, has been disposed of during the course of the present season.  If, however, the circumstances to which I have referred were not there, and if there had not been that decline in production in 1935, consequent on the failure to dispose of the 1934 crop, it is not improbable that a large surplus of turf would still remain to be disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> During the period in which the co-operative turf-producing societies were being brought into existence, and the Turf Development Board constituted, a very considerable amount of work was done on the development of bogs in order to facilitate and encourage the production of turf. Large sums of money have been made available from the Exchequer for that purpose.  The value of turf to the producers has been fully demonstrated, and all those societies are now in a position to reap in full the advantage of that development work to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We have encouraged those turf societies to increase their production for the 1936-7 season, and various additional measures designed to facilitate the operation of the whole turf scheme have also been applied.  The Turf Development Board has been authorised by the Department to provide the co-operative societies with compounds for the ricking of turf and also with sheds which will render the societies largely independent of weather conditions during the marketing season.  It is anticipated, therefore, that in the present year production in the areas in which those societies operate will show a considerable increase over production during 1935.  The Turf Development Board will dispose, at the recognised price of 11/6 per ton, of good quality turf produced by the societies, provided that the turf is ricked in approved compounds in conformity with the instructions of the board; that it is placed in sacks and delivered on rail or canal or elsewhere as directed by the board; that the turf is delivered in such a condition as will satisfy the officers of the board as to the quality of the turf; and further, that the societies conform to such rules and regulations as the board lays down for the welfare of the turf industry and for the producers and consumers of turf.  The demand for turf up to the present, however, would not enable the board to dispose of the production which is anticipated during the present year, and if steps were not taken to secure and guarantee a market to the producers, all the efforts of the <Col N="1655" /> board to stimulate production would be of little avail.</P>
    <P>It is in order to guarantee a market to the producers that it has been decided to introduce this Turf (Use and Development) Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for promoting the more extensive production of turf for domestic and household purposes.  One of its principal provisions, which requires in approved areas the compulsory inclusion of a proportion of turf with each ton of coal sold for domestic purposes, will ensure that turf producers will not be discouraged in future by any fear that their turf, when properly harvested, will be left on their hands.  It is, perhaps, unfortunate that this Bill is introduced now after a campaign in certain newspapers for some time, which grossly misrepresented its provisions and the purposes behind it. We have had a number of fantastic statements published as to the intentions of the Government in respect of turf, and the manner in which it proposes to use the powers to be conferred by this Bill.  I should explain that it has been found necessary to resort to compulsion in the use of turf for several reasons, but the primary reason is to ensure that the utilisation of fuel in the country will be done on a more economic basis than heretofore. It is intended that the compulsory powers will be used so as to avoid causing hardship, particularly upon those who are least able to bear it, that is, the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The first principle upon which the powers proposed to be conferred by the Bill will be applied is that compulsion will be resorted to only where the cost of turf, value for value, compares favourably with the cost of coal, and in areas in which compulsion is to be put into operation, that condition can be satisfied without any difficulty whatsoever.  Compulsion will be applied in the areas which are well served by suitable bogs, and in districts where the cost of the turf, having regard to its value as a fuel, will prove to be more economical for domestic purposes than coal.  The degree of compulsion which it will be necessary to resort <Col N="1656" /> to will be very small.  A very small quota of turf in relation to coal will dispose of the complete production of turf societies for some years to come. The <i>Irish Independent</i> has been harrowing its readers with tales of the alleged intentions of the Government to require the use of two tons of turf for every cwt. of coal purchased by a householder.  I have no hope that we will get to that stage for a long number of years to come, but it might be interesting to reflect upon the fact that if we succeeded in doing that, we would also have succeeded in abolishing unemployment in this country entirely.  It would take the labour of all the unemployed persons in the country to produce the quantity of turf necessary, if we were to make an order requiring the use of two tons of turf with every cwt. of coal.  I think there are very few people in this country who would not be prepared to contemplate that possibility if it were to lead to the abolition of unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it would lead to that.  If so, why does he not do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to the Deputy is that we hope to do it in due course, but it will take a considerable time and an amount of organisation, as well as the use of the powers proposed to be conferred in this Bill, to get to the stage at which that can be done.  In fact, the object of the Bill is to give the turf industry a sound basis over a period of years to enable it to develop, and, in time, to produce sufficient turf to meet the requirements of those persons who can use it economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts have also been made to misrepresent this Bill as likely to impose hardships on the poor, and particularly the poor of the cities.  I have explained, however, that it is intended to use these powers for the purpose of ensuring the use of turf to a greater extent in the areas where it is more economical to use turf than to use coal, and in those areas, as Deputies are well aware, the poorer classes of the community always use turf at present.  It is, therefore, entirely wrong to represent the Bill as being <Col N="1657" /> designed to impose additional hardship upon the poorer classes.  We have had reference also to the physical difficulties that may arise if an extended use of turf is required, due to the greater bulk of a ton of turf than a ton of coal and the difficulty of storing turf in quantities in the smaller classes of dwellings.  I can assure the House that the Government is fully alive to all those difficulties, and that the use of the powers in the Bill, or of other powers of the Government, will be directed in the light of that knowledge.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the subject of compulsion in connection with the use of turf generally, it is, I think, necessary to stress the fact that turf as a household fuel is in no sense in the experimental stage, and particularly in those European countries where the deposits of turf are considerable. Turf has its place in the industrial life of two of the most highly industrialised countries in the world, Germany and Russia, and we are entitled in this country to look forward to a similar development.  The Bill proposes that retailers of coal for domestic purposes and the purchasers of such coal shall be under an obligation to include with every ton of coal sold or purchased some proportion of turf, and it contemplates the fixation of certain areas within which it shall operate.  These areas will be selected by the Minister for Industry and Commerce after consideration of the availability of large quantities of turf, either situated in the district or so situated as to allow of its easy transportation to the district.  Moreover, the quantity of turf to be sold per ton of coal will vary having regard to the conditions in particular districts.</P>
    <P>In any area scheduled for the purposes of the Bill, all coal retailers carrying on business in that area will be required to register, and only such registered retailers will be permitted to sell coal in that area.  Penalties will be attached to any persons selling coal except those registered in the register to be set up under the Bill, and also to any person who buys coal for household purposes from retailers other than those so registered.  The turf to be sold by these registered retailers will <Col N="1658" /> have to be obtained from an approved source, that is, from the Turf Development Board or a co-operative society authorised by the board, or, in the case of turf bricquettes, a limited company approved of by the Minister.  These provisions are considered necessary to ensure that the Bill benefits organised production and that the turf supplied with coal by retailers will be subjected to supervision and be of the desired quality.</P>
    <P>The winning of turf by mechanical methods, as practised at present in Russia and Germany, was recently investigated by a delegation which went on behalf of the Government to those countries.  The results achieved by mechanical methods are so favourable that plans are in contemplation for a similar development in this country.  To facilitate that, the Bill proposes to confer on the Minister for Industry and Commerce powers to acquire land and provide transport facilities on the recommendation of the Turf Development Board, so as to enable the board to acquire large bog areas for the purpose of winning turf by mechanical methods. Several extensive bogs have been surveyed with a view to ascertaining which of them present conditions most favourable for extensive machine production and a decision upon that point is to be expected in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, the details of it, I think, require little explanation. Deputies will note that in the definition of coal we have used a form of words which have the effect of exempting sales of coke or of Irish coal from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 gives the approved sources of supply of turf under the Bill.  The supervision of the Turf Development Board over the operations of the co-operative societies will ensure that only turf of good quality is supplied to the coal retailers for resale to their customers.  Section 4 deals with the question of the appointed areas.  It is necessary to have these separate appointed areas for a number of reasons.  Firstly, because in a turf producing district a higher proportion of turf to coal would normally apply <Col N="1659" /> than would be appropriate elsewhere; secondly, it is necessary to curtail the length of haulage of turf so as to reduce transport charges.  During the past two years the railway companies have carried turf at a flat rate of 6/- per ton, irrespective of distance.  The railway companies state, however, that this rate has proved to be uneconomic. By making the compulsory provisions of the Bill apply to certain defined areas containing substantial stocks of turf, it will be possible to limit the average haul to comparatively short distances.  This will enable the railway companies to quote rates more in conformity with the requirements of the turf industry and more profitable to the railway companies themselves.  The present average rate of 6/- per ton expires in June next.  The position will then be reviewed in the light of the provisions of the Bill.  The fixity of the number of areas will also make it possible for the railway companies to organise road transport of fuel on a more satisfactory basis than has been found possible heretofore.  Thirdly, it is desired to apply the Bill gradually, commencing with those areas in which turf is a familiar fuel, and periodically extending its operations as experience in this work grows, and supplies of turf increase.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 to 9 deal with the arrangements for the registration of coal retailers.  These arrangements follow the lines for registration procedure laid down in a number of other enactments which have proved quite satisfactory in operation.  It is contemplated in Section 10 that a certificate of registration of coal retailers must be displayed prominently during business hours in the premises to which such certificate relates.  The arrangement is, of course, necessary; it is only coal retailers who have complied with the provisions of the Bill who can purchase or sell coal.  In section 12 there is a prohibition against the purchase of coal from unregistered coal retailers.  Section 13 makes it compulsory on the coal retailer not to sell to a purchaser more than 2 cwts. of coal for consumption without also selling to him the prescribed quantity of turf appropriate <Col N="1660" /> to that quantity of coal and to the appointed area where the fuel is to be consumed.  It will be noticed that there are provisions for exemption in certain circumstances; these exemption provisions are further dealt with in Section 17.  It is possible that the full insistence on the compulsory provisions of the Bill would create hardships in the case of hospitals and certain other institutions; there is power of exemption to meet these cases.  Section 20 and 21 make it possible for the Turf Development Board to acquire land for the sale and storage of turf, or to acquire land for any purpose connected therewith.  Power is proposed to be given to acquire land from the Land Commission by agreement, and compulsorily from any private person.</P>

      <P>Sections 22 to 26, inclusive, relate to certain records to be kept and returns to be made out by coal retailers.  It was necessary to have these provisions in order to ensure that the provisions of the Bill should be definitely carried out. Section 27 provides the necessary powers of inspection and examination. It has been thought wise to avail of the services of the Gárda Síochána for this purpose.  In the main they will be responsible for carrying out those duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recommend this Bill to the House for the reasons which I have stated. It is designed to facilitate and encourage the greater production of turf and its more extended use as household fuel.  I think there are few Deputies who will dispute the obvious advantages to the national economy of having a more extended use of turf instead of imported fuel.  If this substitution can be carried out to any important extent, not merely will there be a considerable reduction in our balance of payments and a greater security in respect of continuity of fuel supplies in unusual circumstances, but also a <Col N="1661" /> considerable amount of additional employment will be afforded here in the winning of that fuel.  The value of properly won turf for household purposes is well known.  Weight for weight, turf may not be the same calorific value as coal, but it is suitable for most domestic purposes.  It is true that in some areas and in some houses difficulties in its use may arise.  These difficulties will be due to the absence of suitable storage and the absence of suitably designed grates or ranges.  I may say that the Government, through the Industrial Research Council, has been carrying out intensive work upon the investigation of the most suitable type of range for the burning of turf; a very valuable report on that subject is at present with the printers and will be published in the near future.</P>
    <P>If any of the public should be alarmed at the prospect of being required compulsorily to use large quantities of turf in the near future, I assure them that there is no foundation for their alarm.  The actual quantity of turf which would be available this year, or next year, or for some years to come, no matter how successful our efforts will be to encourage fuel production, will be small in relation to our total fuel requirements.  The purpose of the Government in the use of these compulsory powers is to ensure that as far as possible turf will be used in the areas where it is most economic to use it.  There are wide areas in this country at the present time where the use of coal at the existing price is uneconomic as against turf at the present price.  It should be possible to absorb in these areas a very large quantity of our total turf production with advantage.  Then the matter of increasing employment with advantage to the people in these areas also arises. In a manner the operation of this Bill will avoid the uneconomic transport of turf over long distances to areas where the local production of turf may not be available.  There is, of course&mdash; always has been and always will be&mdash;a very large market for turf independent of any measures which the Government may take to stimulate its production or to encourage its use.  That market will also be supplied as in the past. The operations of the Turf Development <Col N="1662" /> Board through these turf co-operative societies, and the various steps which have been taken to standardise the quality of the turf and to ensure that it will be won and stored under appropriate conditions, will still continue.  Turf users include those who buy turf for their own use and those who use turf won by themselves from bogs in their own ownership.  The extended use of turf in areas where previously there has not been turf production, in areas where imported fuel was in use, will have very decided advantages for many parts of the country which are in real need of such an industry.</P>
    <P>I think it is correct to state that the development of the turf industry benefits those parts of the country which are most in need of assistance. The turf-winning areas are, as a rule, the poorest parts of the country, and the people living in those areas have a very severe struggle for existence under any circumstances.  The development of the turf industry will be a great boon to those people, giving them a new source of revenue which can be made permanent and expanding, and the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the new revenue which has been flowing into those areas, in consequence of the efforts of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Turf Development Board, will be made permanent and induced to increase to the benefit of the residents and the turf producers in those districts.  The Bill is a simple one.  Its provisions are obvious.  The need for it, I am sure, is appreciated by those who are familiar with the conditions and who appreciate the advantage it will be to the country and to the people of the rural areas if the plans of the Government to extend the use of turf are successful.  I recommend the Bill to certain Deputies in the House with confidence, and to others with hope.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that what has been done in the past for the purpose of turf development has been done in order to put the development of turf here on a sound basis.  As a matter of fact, all that <Col N="1663" /> has been done in the past is to endeavour to build up turf development on a basis of sound.  The only remarkable thing about the Minister's contribution this evening is the remarkable absence of sound about what he had to say on this particular subject. It is also interesting to note that the Minister has found out a day upon which quite a number of the Deputies of this House, who know, from seeing it at their own doors, what has been happening in connection with the turf development scheme, cannot be here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not like the Fianna Fáil clubs to see a notification in the Press to the effect that the President and all his Ministers were going to Punchestown.  However, so much for that.  The counties in the West that are so badly off, according to the Minister, require to be assisted.  Now, apparently, this Bill is a continuation of the experimental scheme that was started by the vote of money in June, 1933, for the provision of sacks and the organisation of co-operative societies for turf cutting.  On that occasion the Minister for Defence told us that it was particularly intended to assist the poor districts in the West and the congested districts, <Col N="1665" /> where £1 was as valuable as £10 when you compare their conditions with the conditions here in the eastern parts of the country.  Let us look, first, accordingly at the position from the point of view of these counties.  You could divide the country, by a line separating Monaghan from Cavan and then passing to the east of Longford, Roscommon, Galway, Clare, Limerick and Kerry, into two areas.  Let us call one the Western area and the other the Eastern area.  The Western area is the area that was particularly indicated by the Minister for Education when he was introducing the Estimate in 1932, and by the Minister for Defence when he was supporting.  It is the area in which by far the greatest amount of turf is cut.  There is not a county to the west of that line in which, in the year 1934&mdash;the last year for which the Minister has given us any figures&mdash; there has not been a smaller amount of turf cut than there was in the year 1931, before the Fianna Fáil Party ever spent the taxpayers' money on turf development, on sacks, and on the additional drainage of bogs that we have heard so much about.  In 1934 there were 108,842 tons of turf less cut in the Connacht counties west of that line than there were in 1931.  There were 62,988 tons less cut in the Ulster counties, that is Donegal, Leitrim and Cavan.  When we come to Munster we find that the people in Kerry were provided with 57,018 sacks under the Minister's scheme.  But in 1934 they cut 35,203 tons less of turf than in 1931, before they got any sacks or had any considerable amount of the Minister's money spent on opening up the areas. Let us see the amount of turf cut in these counties, as compared with the eastern counties.  In Connacht alone in 1934, 1,490,000 tons of turf were cut, or 108,000 less than in 1931.  The total amount cut in Leinster, which includes Offaly, Westmeath, Kildare, and those places where the Minister expects the machine cutting to develop, was only 488,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They got 31,614 sacks for the whole of Leinster.  The Kerry people got 57,008 sacks and they <Col N="1666" /> cut less turf probably than they ever did before.  At any rate, their cutting was down by 10 per cent. on what it was in 1931, and all that after a tremendous campaign had been carried out.  Let us see what was expected and what was done.  We must realise that this Bill, according to the Minister's explanation, is a continuance of the scheme enshrined in his sack policy and in his co-operative society policy.  The Minister himself got on to the turf question very early.  On the 11th May, 1932, when giving a review of all that was going to be done by the Fianna Fáil Party, which was at that time going to wipe out unemployment in eight months, the Minister turned aside in the middle of his litany to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We hope to give considerable employment in the production of peat as fuel.  At present our efforts have been concentrated upon the methods of winning and marketing a first-quality peat.  Considerable employment can be given in that direction, and a considerable improvement can be effected in the national accounts by reducing the imports of foreign fuel.  If various enquiries which we are undertaking at the moment into the possibility of marketing peat in another form prove that difficulties have been overcome and that a method of doing so has been invented, we will be able to establish an industry which will be by far the most important in the country, and which will provide us with a fuel not merely as good, but better than coal.  Those are some of the things we are planning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were some of the things they were planning in May, 1932.  We have had deputations sent to Germany and to Russia.  The Minister was talking about his plans.  He has not taken our peat industry as a whole, and indicated the extent to which his hopes even go in the matter of the mechanical cutting and drying of turf; the position that co-operative societies may be expected to occupy in the full peat development; the position that is to be occupied by the ordinary cutters of peat, on whom the country to a large extent has had to depend up to <Col N="1667" /> date for the turf that they can buy and that they can burn.  The Minister in no way attempts to review the industry as a whole although, as I say, he started, within a month or two after taking office, to place the importance of the peat industry in the particular perspective indicated by that quotation from the Dáil Debates.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, acting for the Minister, in introducing an Estimate in 1933 stated that they were going to have a Press campaign, that they were going to supply sacks and to develop co-operative societies.  In view of the fact that this Bill, according to the Minister's statement, is a continuance of the scheme that has been in operation, it is well to see how the scheme was attempted to be developed, and what exactly has taken place.  At the first start-off, the Minister's attitude was that he was not going to ask the people to turn to turf as fuel until he had made arrangements, through coal merchants or other fuel merchants to have supplies for them when they looked for them. Having arranged that he arranged for facilities with the railway company, which, by the way, only apply to co-operative societies and do not apply to the ordinary turf cutter in the country.  The co-operative societies, for whom grounds are being bought and sheds put up, have facilities provided for them by the railway company. But the ordinary turf-cutters, on whom the people in the greater part of the country have to depend for turf, get no such facilities.</P>
    <P>Then a Press advertising campaign was started and in October, 1933, the taxpayers' money was being used to tell the people that turf made the sweetest-smelling and the most healthy of all domestic fires; that it was the ideal fuel for the living-room and the bedroom; and that if they used turf they would find it would mean better fires and smaller fuel bills, and particularly that it gave more employment. By December, 1933, after people had been able to contemplate the first touch of advertising enthusiasm by the Press, they were beginning to be infected and we have it reported in a Dublin daily newspaper that it was <Col N="1668" /> surprising to many that turf was so clean and economical, that there was almost no waste; that it burned considerably longer than other fuel; and that, of course, it was the most Irish of all the industrial enterprises.  That meant, I suppose, that it was not run by Matz, Gaw, Yaffe, Mendlestein, or any of these industrialists.  In addition, a large quantity of money was voted to distribute free turf.  A sum of £13,000 was voted for the distribution of free turf to the poor in Dublin. I can only take it that that was part of the advertising campaign, because we have just passed through one of the most severe winters that anybody has remembered, and there has been nothing done to provide free fuel of any kind for the poor of Dublin.  So that we must regard the money spent in the winter of 1933 on the distribution of free turf as part of the advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>Some newspapers were getting infected with enthusiasm even earlier than December, 1933, because in November, 1933, we have a Dublin newspaper reporting that turf sales were booming.  In January, 1934, the propaganda was continued.  In reply to a Parliamentary question, the Minister told me one of the reasons why the Board of Public Assistance in Dublin could not get turf to supply to poor people except at a cost greater than that at which the Lord Mayor of Dublin was providing coal to the same people.  The propagandist in the Minister's Department said, in the course of a reply to a Parliamentary question, that &ldquo;the substantial demand for turf created by the Government scheme for encouraging its use has produced the position that the only source from which large quantities can at present be obtained for regular delivery in the City of Dublin is the Turraun Peat Works in Offaly.&rdquo; I can only regard that as part of the subtle publicity campaign in connection with turf.</P>
    <P>By March, 1934, turf, according to the Government advertisements, was becoming popular in the towns and cities as the national fuel, and we have the statement: &ldquo;The demand for turf this winter is reported as being unprecedented, and the prophecy is made <Col N="1669" /> that the demand will be greater next winter&rdquo;&mdash;that is, in the winter of 1935. In the beginning of 1934, about this particular time of the year, it was announced that President de Valera would cut the first sod and inaugurate a turf-cutting competition which had been planned to be carried out on an extensive scale at Allenwood, Robertstown, County Kildare.  All the members of the Free State Executive Council, as well as Deputies of all political Parties, we were told, &ldquo;have signified their intention of being present.&rdquo;  Shortly afterwards the advertisements started attacking the coal-using families.  The Government advertisements said: &ldquo;The coal-using families are not helping the nation's economic recovery.&rdquo;  Now we have to try to buy coal in order to keep the bit in the farmers' mouths.</P>

      <P>The turf-cutting industry is an important industry.  The people who are depending on it are people who want all the help and assistance that can be given to them to enable them to make the best of the turf resources that they have around them.  The Minister has indicated in his own statement how important they are&mdash;that is, in his previous statement he indicated it.  There is very little in his statement to-day to indicate the importance of the industry or to indicate what the Minister is going to do for it and its development, except to push more money down into the kind of sink that he has prepared for the taxpayers' money in respect of this bog business that he has been messing about with so much.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán O'Grady, speaking in Ennis in October, 1934, said that in his particular area an experiment of an unprecedented nature was being conducted. In October, 1934, the historical instincts of the people were being appealed to.  We had advertisements reminding the people that countless suns had crossed the sky since the elk roamed Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are, and they are treading on people's toes just as the elks long ago, according to the Government propaganda, trod on whatever was lying there at the time &mdash;trod the earth of Ireland into the sweetest-smelling, the most useful and the loveliest fuel that ever was made. The representatives of the Turf Development Board had to go on the Radio, and we were told how turf was formed through the countless ages by the tramp of Finn MacCool and his countless legions, by gallant Red Hugh and his legions.  In fact, the people were encouraged to buy turf even for literary purposes, because as the smoke went up the chimney it might bring back to one all those great old stories about our ancestors.  So, nothing was left undone or unsaid by the Minister and by the Party to try to make a success of the scheme that they had put in front of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot say that this scheme was not criticised when it was first put up.  The Minister for Education, acting for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the 22nd June, 1933, when dealing with this matter when the Estimates were first introduced, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I should like to emphasise in the beginning that this peat scheme is entirely experimental.  It has been subjected to a great deal of criticism, indeed, to a regular barrage of criticism.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was criticised by Deputies from every part of the country.  The Minister was warned where he was going in so far as development was concerned, and where he was going in so far as the expenditure of money was concerned.  But all this propaganda went on, and I deal with it at such length now, because this use of taxpayers' money and the long drawn-out campaign that was gone on with in this particular way affected such critical representatives of public opinion as the daily Press.  We had the daily Press in their leading articles and in their special articles showing an intoxication from Government advertisements at a time when less turf was being cut in the country than was cut before the Fianna Fáil Party came into <Col N="1671" /> office.  We had the daily papers in Dublin arguing, in relation to the Government's scheme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From a general point of view, indeed, the turf campaign is the most reasonable and the most deserving of success of all its experiments for the development of the nation's internal resources.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, of all the Fianna Fáil Government's experiments.  Again, we have the comment&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and it is a high tribute to the Government's campaign that in so short a time it has contrived to increase the use of Irish turf to so substantial an extent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anyone believe that was written on 6th October, 1934, the year in which Fianna Fáil tinkering had reduced the cutting of turf by £219,000 below the figure it stood at before they came into office?  That was written at a time when 180,000 tons less were cut in Connacht.  That particular type of thing was continued until the Minister's new proposals come along. When the Minister's new proposals come along the Press take it up and say that the Minister's Bill is intended to give his second thoughts on the subject; that he is changing his policy; that he is going in for a greater development of turf winning by mechanical means.  Considering the possibility of the new development arising out of the second thoughts of the Minister, we find this written:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Must we even write of the efforts of Mr. Barton and Mr. Andrews and their colleagues on the Turf Development Board, as sheer and irrecoverable losses?  Not, one hopes, by any means! Overhead wires apart, there will remain a big field for native fuel consumption; and, when we get to work on our peat-fired generating stations, we shall be much wiser, though possibly somewhat sadder, advocates of native power resources. Satisfied to complete our education in the bitter school of experience, we may survive to be grateful not only to the big and far-seeing men who showed us the main highway&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that has to be shown yet&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;but possibly to have a stray word <Col N="1672" /> or two of gratitude for others who showed us `how not to do it.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>We wakened up in March, 1936, to find that the highfalutin things about the Minister's scheme being unprecedented and about the use of turf being greatly on the increase, and these intoxicating things sent out in Government propaganda in their advertisements and through the radio amounted to nothing more than to show us how not to do it.  But the process of showing us &ldquo;how not to do it&rdquo; has cost a very considerable amount of money.  The total amount spent up to the end of the year 1936 on travelling expenses, development and publicity, and other expenses, including sacks, amounted to £50,193; the total amount expended on relief amounted to £85,624.  There was a considerable fall in 1934 in the cutting of turf and as the Minister remarked the work of the co-operative societies showed that they cut less in 1935 than in 1934.  Yet the Minister's proposal is to continue increased expenditure on the work of organising these co-operative societies and in developing the turf industry with that particular kind of machinery for doing it.  It has been shown that the co-operative societies last year only cut 150,000 tons&mdash;that is the statement of the members of the Turf Development Board.  Public money is to be expended and the employment situation, so far as turf is concerned, shows, with regard to the rates of cutting under that type of organisation, that out of 3,309,000 tons of turf available they only cut 150,000 tons and that by people who got special recognition and special facilities from the railway company.  The Minister, in my opinion, was doing nothing but disgracing his office when he appeared before the Dáil with a proposal of that particular kind, and is now, again, appearing before the Dáil with this proposal as a contribution on the subject this year, leaving so many blanks as he has left in his proposal. A certain number of people are registered in certain areas.  I think the Minister should change his language in this matter, or should change his pronunciation of the word &ldquo;register&rdquo;. <Col N="1673" /> He should call it &ldquo;re-ges-ter&rdquo; to distinguish it.  He should say the new scheme has members on the &ldquo;re-ges-ter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister prepared to give local option to such people as have centuries of tradition in regard to the use of turf?  The Minister has indicated that, to some extent, his first line of approach, in putting this Bill into operation, is to prevent coal being used in parts of the country where turf is available. Is the Minister going to give local option, either to the people using turf or to the people who represent them on their local bodies, before he puts into operation an order of that particular kind?  He already indicated that if he had to introduce compulsion, and he was thinking of it, he would prevent coal being used in certain areas where turf suitable was available. If we are to put any interpretation upon his remarks we can understand from him to-day that he is going to begin now.  He is not quite sure how he stands with regard to places like the cities of Dublin and Cork.  I ask him to take us into his confidence.  The Minister is introducing a Bill with very wide powers for interfering with industry, and that an industry upon which some of the poorest parts of the country are depending.  If he has got information with regard to the industry he is setting up in other parts of the country, he declined to give any information as to the number of industries set up in the Gaeltacht areas in <Col N="1674" /> Mayo, Clare, Donegal, Cork and Kerry.  These are areas, which, to a large extent, as the Minister for Education explained, were depending on the turf industry because they could not get other industries.  The Minister is interfering with the indus try of that particular class.  He is reducing their output.  He is robbing them of their market by diverting it to specially organised co-operative societies, and he is interfering in the ordinary domestic economy and domestic conveniences of the people. When doing a thing like that he ought to tell us the steps he proposes to take, or if he is only going to begin in certain areas and prevent coal being sold there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the next type of order he will make?  Is it to apply to smaller towns like Tipperary and towns in Offaly and places in the West of Ireland where turf is available, or is he going to regard Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford as places that will provide the biggest market?  Deputy O'Sullivan asked the Minister to explain a particular section in the Bill which implies that bell-men in Dublin are going to be made buy turf with their coal.  If the Minister does not contemplate, in the very near future, the application of this provision to the City of Dublin, why is that section put into the Bill now?  If the Minister does approve of extending it to the City of Dublin sooner or later, will he explain how the bell-men are going to dispose of their turf if coal can be bought from them in smaller quantities than turf by their particular purchasers?  The whole situation is going to be nothing but tyrannical.  But if we fell into the hands of anything like an efficient tyranny we might say there is some compensation.  But if the tyranny is going further to interfere with industry and the ordinary life of the people through the incompetence which the Minister and his turf officials have shown since they started upon this business in 1933, then he is asking too much and making too great demand upon the patience of the people.  It was explained some time ago that the Turraun people were not able satisfactorily to dispose of the turf they <Col N="1675" /> were cutting, and the explanation given was that there was a preference in the country for hand-won turf.  A statement was published in October, 1935, in some of the papers to this effect:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dublin is to have no more turf from the country, according to the latest decisions of the Peat Development Board.  Coal merchants will, in future, distribute dearer machine-made turf from the Turraun Peat Works, and next season the Board will be in a position to provide supplies from its own bogs within easy reach of the city.  Hand-won turf, after the experience of last year, apparently, must stay in the country, and the Board is to make an effort to dispose of the available stocks in the districts in which the turf is cut.  Writing in this column on the slow progress of the scheme (38/1/'35), I stated that people who bought turf with enthusiasm during the early stages of the campaign had made up their minds to stick to coal owing to the consignments of wet sods which had been delivered to their homes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, apparently, the product of the co-operative societies.  I have heard complaints from people who endeavoured to buy turf in some parts of the country that they could not get suitable turf from the co-operative societies and that they had to go to the ordinary people who traditionally cut their turf and sell it in the small towns around.  Nevertheless, the Minister introduces this Bill.  Notwithstanding the complaints made with regard to co-operative societies, the co-operative society scheme is the scheme which is to have his approval. Judging by the statement which has been made, no turf will be regarded as bought, for the purpose of this Bill, except it is got through the Turf Development Society or through one of his co-operative societies.  The Minister is disgracing his office when he deals with what he considers an important matter in the way in which he is dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>On the only occasion when I had the pleasure of speaking to Deputy McGilligan, except <Col N="1676" /> through those exchanges across the floor of the House which Deputy Dillon might call &ldquo;discourtesies&rdquo; if he could apply such a word to University representatives, my colleague said one of those good things with which he regales the wide circle of his admirers.  Referring to the relative proportions of his and my contributions to debates in this House, he said: &ldquo;You and I speak as much as any other two Deputies in this House.&rdquo;  The joke, I need hardly explain to an intelligent audience such as I have here, is not on the Deputy's own eloquence but rather on the restful silence with which I, through so many hours, supported by my friend, Deputy Tom Kelly, kept a quorum in the House. Up to the present the arrangement has worked very well and, while my colleague has won admiration for his brilliance, I have won a considerable amount of goodwill by my want of it.  Unfortunately it was made plain to me last week that there are dangers in the partnership or, at least, in a new interpretation of its terms by Deputy McGilligan.  Last week the Deputy set out to make my speeches for me.  If I make any speeches in this House, I want to make my own speeches and I want, especially, to make my own speech on this Turf Bill, because it affects very intimately the interests of women, and I speak as a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I had read the terms of the present Bill I felt like the &ldquo;would-be gentleman&rdquo; in Moliere's comedy which is to be produced this week-end by the Taibhdhearc Players in Galway.  When this individual set out to be a gentleman, he got some masters to teach him the fashionable accomplishments, amongst others, that of talking prose. To his astonishment, he found that he had been talking prose all his life.  I felt somewhat like that when I read this Bill, because I have been following its injunctions all my life.  I was born &mdash;I am sorry to recall how many years ago, but I was forcibly reminded of their toll in filling in the census form &mdash;in an old house, where for 100 years the turf fires had never died out except on those occasions of domestic cataclysm when the sweep came. During my childhood and girlhood, I <Col N="1677" /> knew of no other fires than turf fires. Deputy Donnelly knows the house to which I refer and he is aware that turf fires burn there still.  The pleasantest memories of my childhood are of sunny afternoons when the man and woman of the house gathered us children on the outside car and drove us to the &ldquo;Mountain&rdquo; to buy a stack of turf&mdash; a great bastille or fortress of turf which would serve the house during the winter season.  It was not necessary then to have a Bill to deal with our transport problem, because on a certain day our friends from the &ldquo;Brae Face&rdquo; sent their carts, or came themselves with their carts, to the number of 40 or 50, and brought home our turf.  You might have met on the Glen Road a long procession of carts bringing the turf to our big turf-shed. Then we had a dance in the evening. That is the sort of thing I think of in connection with turf fires.</P>
    <P>When I got married, 30 years ago, I viewed the problem in a slightly different way.  I remember saying to a friend, who was interested in poetry, that before I got married, May day suggested to me, May queens and May flowers and hedges white with May blossom.  Later, I rather associated it with the fact that milk comes down that day in price 1d. a quart.  In the same way, I had to approach the fire problem in my little house.  Still, I stuck to turf&mdash;as the most economical and satisfactory fuel&mdash;though mostly, as the Minister's Bill seems to recommend, in conjunction with coal.  After 30 years' experience, I find that the most satisfactory fire is obtained from the union of turf and coal, with a good backing of slack.  It is not necessary for anybody to recommend to me the use of turf but I think that many people, to whom its use was new, were rather put off it by one or two things&mdash;one is that the average household ranges are not at all suitable for the use of turf and neither are the grates in the sitting-rooms.  In this connection, might I point to&mdash;this was my chief object in rising to speak&mdash;some extraordinarily interesting experiments that are being made.  The Minister spoke of what was being done by the Industrial Research Council.  In Galway we <Col N="1678" /> had, in connection with this problem, an extremely valuable lecture delivered under the aegis of the Chamber of Commerce by Dr. Henry Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I should like to read a quotation from the speech which appeared in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> of Saturday, March 14th:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is very good reason to believe that turf can be produced by mechanical methods in suitable bogs in this country in large quantities and at a price which will enable it to be delivered over wide areas in the country, and possibly over all areas, at a price more favourable to the consumer than the price of imported coal.  There is, unfortunately, a considerable prejudice against the use of turf for domestic purposes against its powerful rival, coal.  There are some grounds for this prejudice, owing to the design and construction of ordinary grates and ranges.  These apparatus represent a miracle of inefficiency as far as the use of coal is concerned, but for turf they are still worse, because the problem of turf is very different from that of coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the important part:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are in a position to say, however, that with new apparatus of recent design the problem of the combustion of turf has been solved in a very satisfactory manner.  I have personal experience, in my office and in my home, of a new type of slow combustion stove, totally enclosed, which operates with extraordinary efficiency, cleanliness and economy. The cleanliness is remarkable; there is a complete absence of ashes or dust, as the ashes are caught in an enclosed ashpan, which is removed once a day or once in two days.  In my home the stove burns continuously, day and night, the draught being reduced at night to minimise combustion.  The stove ran for 100 days before the new year on two tons of turf.  That represents very economical heating indeed.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I may say that the efficiency of these stoves reaches the figure of 80 per cent to 85 per cent., as against <Col N="1679" /> 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. in the ordinary open fire.  As regards cooking, equally satisfactory results have been obtained.  A fairly heavy cooking programme has been carried out with a consumption of about 4 lbs. of good turf per hour.  These results are extremely satisfactory, and it can be safely said that with such stoves and ranges heating and cooking can be carried out with greater efficiency, greater cleanliness and greater economy than with the usual coal-burning appliances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he goes on to deal with central heating boilers.  I am confining my few remarks to the point of view of the housewife in the modest middle-class house.</P>
    <P>Although I have spoken up to this as a woman, I cannot forget I am a Galway woman.  I have lived for 25 years in Galway, and I cannot but be interested in an industry that would have such beneficent economic effects upon Galway.  The Minister stated that the turf scheme is now well in hands, and I regard this Bill as a step in the right direction, not only for increasing the production of turf as a source of revenue for the people, but for the money that will circulate in Galway. Connemara with the help of this Bill will &ldquo;keep our home fires burning&rdquo; in more senses than one.</P>
    <P>Inherent in this Bill is a great programme of the national work, such as the draining of bogs, the making of bog roads, and small harbours&mdash;on coast or river bank&mdash;for turf boats, all of which will bring work to districts where, as the Minister pointed out, it is most needed.  For these reasons I give my hearty support to the Bill, and I am very glad that the Minister has introduced it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mrs. Concannon spoke not merely as a woman, but in one particular sentence spoke as a very generous-hearted woman indeed, when she referred to the illuminating introductory speech of the Minister.  That is one thing his speech was not.  Listening to the Deputy when she came to what she <Col N="1680" /> described as the important portion of her speech, the one conclusion to come to was that there was no necessity for this Bill, and for the compulsory powers in it.  She gave us an account of this wonderful stove that was capable of doing all the things she outlined.  It is quite obvious that we are beginning at the wrong end.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon must say, as I expect any intelligent Deputy would say, that we are beginning at the wrong end.  We should start in using compulsory powers with the stoves because, as far as turf is concerned, they would not be necessary if we started at the right end.  There would then be no need to refer to a prejudice against the use of turf.  There is not a prejudice. There is only a prejudice against the use of turf where people are convinced that it is not suitable.  I know numbers of people in the country and in towns who would prefer a turf fire if they had the chance of having one as against a coal fire.  The prejudice does not exist except where people by experience learn that in the houses in which they have to live and the stoves they have to use, there is a considerable disadvantage in having to use turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, Deputy Mrs. Concannon has undoubtedly made an important contribution, but the conclusion from it is that this Bill should be postponed until there are proper grates and a reconditioning of houses.  There is a big reconstruction scheme going on at present as far as housing is concerned, and this turf business has been before the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party for a number of years.  Have they allowed their two sets of ideas to come into contact&mdash;the necessity for using turf and the getting of suitable grates for its consumption in the houses that have been erected as a result of that house-building policy? Has there been any evidence of that? It is quite obvious there is no plan, that the question has not been thought out.  I welcome the very valuable contribution of Deputy Mrs. Concannon, because it proves&mdash;I think she will be fair enough to admit it&mdash;that the question has not received the consideration or the study we should expect it would <Col N="1681" /> receive if the industry is of the importance that the Minister stated. He spoke of important investigations&mdash; of epoch making investigations.  These investigations and plans of the Government are often stated in a very striking manner, so as to lull the senses and to suggest that they are trying to get proposals into operation, but disaster follows the attempts to make them operative.  What was the principal reason given by the Minister even as an attempt to justify this Bill?  Practically that he had to introduce it to get a number of people who had got into an economic mess out of it by compulsory powers, people who were doped, as the Party was doped, and as a certain number of people in the country were doped by the propaganda of the Government in favour of the use of turf, without proper investigation being made beforehand.  As a result these people produced turf for which there was no market.  Is not that the situation?</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the value of the production of turf had been demonstrated. What value?  Not the selling value, because one of the reasons for this Bill is the fact that there was not a market, that there was higher production than there was a market for on the part of the companies or the Turf Board.  That is practically the main reason for the Bill, apart from the general aspirations of which we always have experience from the Government Benches.  As a result of the efforts of the Government, as a result of the subsidies they gave, and of the success that attended these efforts, there was no market for a certain amount of the turf that was produced, although, as Deputy Mulcahy demonstrated, from answers given by the Government to questions put in this House last month, in 1934 there was considerably less turf produced than in 1931.  Deputy Mrs. Concannon spoke not merely as a woman, but as a Galway representative.  I have no doubt she was perturbed that as a result of the Government's effort Galway had 39,000 tons of turf less produced in 1934 than in 1931.</P>
    <P>If it is possible to produce a stove or grate suitable for turf not merely in the country, where you have open <Col N="1682" /> hearths, not merely where you have the kind of grate that is quite suitable, as you have in many country towns in rooms, but if it is possible to produce a stove or range for the use of turf in cities, why not push that end of the question?  Why not make the use of turf really attractive and economic to the people?  The proposition is there according to Deputy Mrs. Concannon but the Government blandly ignores it.  Instead of taking the obvious step of doing that, they prefer their old method of compulsion.  Listening to the Minister, we were bound to conclude that his policy of voluntarily promoting more production of turf had failed, that the voluntary system, the propaganda and various other efforts made by the Government, on the whole had broken down and that he is now compelled to substitute what he recommends to the House as the more efficient method, the method, shall I call it, of limited compulsion.  But then, the organ of the Government stated as recently as the 18th March last:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is nothing new in the principle of the Bill for the compulsory use of turf.  It might be said that it has been in the forefront of the Government programme for years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The discovery of grates and all these new investigations do not influence the development of their ideas.  Then the organ goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The attempts which have been made to put it into force on a voluntary basis have proved signally successful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is so, what is the justification for the steps taken by the Minister? This is not the <i>Independent</i> which we have been told misrepresents the Minister and which incidentally merely dealt with the powers which are actually in the Bill.  This is the Minister's own organ.  Signally successful ! Yet the Bill according to the Minister is only to operate very gradually.  What is the purpose of the Bill if this statement is true?</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of misrepresentation and wanted to allay fears and <Col N="1683" /> so on.  Will he read over his speech and see if anything he said has allayed these fears?  Did he give us any indication as to how the Bill was going to be worked beyond the most universal and vaguest of generalities &mdash;the vaguest generalities so far as the areas were concerned, with no indication as to the proportion of turf people would be compelled to use? The only time he became really definite was when he justified the charge made against him up to the hilt.  He made the statement that anybody in this country would be glad to pay the price of using two tons of turf to one hundredweight of coal if that would rid the country of unemployment. Immediately before that he had said that it would rid the country of unemployment.  What are we to conclude from that?  It is his main business to make the beginning of an attempt to carry out his promise to rid the country of unemployment.  He says that the compulsory use of turf on a large scale would rid the country of unemployment and that the country would be delighted to pay that price for it.</P>
    <P>Then, listening to him in some other portions of his speech, one found that he has no intention of doing that.  It is only in small quantities the medicine is to be given to the people.  The compulsory drug is so strong that it dare not be given in large quantities.  All through his speech, if he examines his statements, he will find that he has blown both hot and cold.  Possibly the nature of his subject is responsible for that.  At one moment you have him saying that there were immense revenues to be raised, that it was a tremendous contribution to the economic life of the country, a tremendous contribution to the relief of unemployment, a contribution that would help to set the balance&mdash;I presume the balance of trade&mdash;right.  But then in order to meet the fears of the poorer classes of the population, it is only very gradually and on a small scale that the Bill will operate.  It was impossible for anybody examining the Minister's Bill to find out how he intends to use the enormous powers that are entrusted to him and to the <Col N="1684" /> Government.  It is to that the Minister should have devoted himself&mdash;to clearing up these points.  He gave us the reason for the decline in production in 1935&mdash;I presume he means production by co-operative societies&mdash;in comparison with 1934.  Well, their experience of the year 1934 was that they had produced more than they could get rid of, but in that same year, 1934, according to the official figures, there were some 200,000 tons less of turf produced in the country than in the year 1931. It was not, therefore, altogether a question of decline in production by co-operative societies.  You had it all over the place.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there was a number of important matters that the Minister might have cleared up&mdash;the important investigations going on in Germany, in Russia and here&mdash;so far as grates are concerned.  Having regard to all the compulsory powers which they are seeking, they will probably finish up by compelling the people to eat the turf and burn the beef.  They are going very largely in that direction already. Very shortly they may seek to prove that they can make clothes out of turf. As I say, they may attempt to make us eat the turf and burn the beef.</P>

      <P>If it is an economic fuel in certain circumstances, why has not more use been made of it? There is no prejudice against it.  If the advantages are there, I am convinced the people would use it.  Nobody that I know in my native county objects to the use of turf.  I am sure that Deputy Mrs. Concannon would thoroughly agree with me that if they can use it people will use it.  Most people in this country prefer a turf fire in the grate to a coal fire.  I say that is universal. Why then are they not using it? Because, under certain circumstances, it is uneconomic and because it is, from <Col N="1685" /> many points of view&mdash;as things are now and as houses are now built&mdash;unsuitable. After the speech that we have listened to from him, the Minister has no right to complain of the misleading statements which, he says, appeared in the newspapers about the Bill.  If the newspapers which criticised the Bill wanted any justification for their criticism they could get it in the speech which the Minister made here to-day.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity of answering a question that I put to him earlier with a view to clearing up what the exact position is.  I gather that the position under the Bill is this: that in the case of quantities of turf sold by a retailer of less than 2 cwts. the provision either as regards the sale or the buying of turf does not apply.  I take it I am correct in assuming that.  I presume that has been introduced to meet the case of poor people who buy small quantities of turf from bell-men. That being so, how is that provision in conformity with Section 19 of the Bill?  My difficulty is this: the bell-men have to buy from a coal merchant, and, according to Section 19, they are in the same position as anybody else buying more than 2 cwt. of coal in that they must buy turf with it.  Therefore, bell-men, in order to be able to sell coal to the poor people, must also buy turf, but there is no method of their disposing of that turf because the coal they buy they can sell without any turf being sold with it.  Is not that the position?  For the moment, at all events, that position seems to require clarification.  You are compelling people to buy turf, and there is no provision made as to how they are going to get rid of that turf in the course of their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the same position when we come to the areas.  I do not know precisely what areas the Minister intends to apply this Bill to.  He did not give us any instances.  He spoke in a general fashion.  Areas, for instance, where you have large supplies of turf may be poorly populated, and the turf from them will have to be disposed of elsewhere.  But take the case of the ordinary country district where you have a certain supply of turf in the neighbourhood&mdash;within a <Col N="1686" /> distance of eight or ten miles&mdash;of a country town.  What is to be the position there?  What is the practice at present?  The small farmer brings in a donkey rail or a horse rail of turf and he sells it to some person in that town.  He can do that in future, I admit, but as far as I can read the Bill, if that townsman buys coal, as in most cases he must for ordinary domestic purposes, if he has a range in his house, he must also buy turf from one of the sources mentioned in Section 2&mdash;either the board or the co-operative society.  If he buys coal, then in order to fulfil the provisions of this measure he must buy the necessary quantity of turf from one or other of these two sources.  But, as I read the Bill, if he buys his turf in the way that he has been accustomed to buy it up to the present, he will not be complying with the provisions of the Bill.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>That is right. Has the Minister thought of the effect that that is going to have on quite a large number of poor people in the country?  He has not.  Has he thought at all of the unfortunate people who have to sell the turf off their bogs? They are now practically cut out, and all for what?  So that we can have the triumph of mechanisation.  As the Minister quite properly said&mdash;I do not like to say that he slipped into saying it&mdash;this is a Bill to promote the organised sale of turf at the expense of the ordinary individual who goes into a country town and sells a donkey rail or a horse rail of turf. It is going to hit him to the extent that it is enforced: that is, in so far as it is a real Bill and it becomes really operative it is going to hit him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that, as regards the production of turf, very successful experiments in the way of mechanisation had been made in Germany and in Russia.  Not merely has the use of mechanisation been successful in Russia in the production of turf, but it has also been successful, its advocates hold, in the case of farming.  The same example can be adduced by the Minister <Col N="1687" /> to apply to farming as a whole as well as to turf cutting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has that got to do with it?  The question is this: mechanisation on a large scale will be more economic.  That is the argument.  Following the example of the country cited by the Minister, that applies to farming&mdash;where you have instead of small farms, farms of 1,000 acres run on the co-operative mechanised principle.  Mechanisation applies there as well as to turf cutting.  Because you have got that successful example from Russia, you are proposing to follow it here in the case of turf, and you thereby hit the individual&mdash; the small man who brings a donkey rail or a horse rail of turf to the country town.  We have been told that, so far as accommodation and other difficulties are concerned, the Government are fully alive to them.  I wish we could believe that.  Nothing that the Government have done in their various spheres will convince us that they are fully alive to the difficulties or to the dangers of any problem. Even Deputy Mulcahy, in the course of his speech, brought forward a number of examples of the fanfare of trumpets with which the Government introduced their previous scheme as far as turf is concerned.  Anybody at the time of the earlier scheme who doubted that the scheme was destined to be a complete success was greeted as a bad Irishman who wanted to run down Irish products.  The same people who were so prolific in their promises and in their boasts at that time of what their scheme would do have now come forward with an entirely new scheme because the previous one failed.  It failed from the commercial point of view, namely, in the selling and disposing of the article.  The same people now expect us to take the word and the prophecies of the Government as a guarantee that the present scheme will be more successful: that it will be more sensibly worked than the one that failed.  I have no doubt that the Minister can <Col N="1688" /> reply with the confidence on the support that he will get.  It does not matter what he brings in, he will get the support of his Party for it.  If he were to bring in a Bill to make the use of British coal compulsory in this country as distinct from Continental coal, he could even get the support of the Fianna Fáil Party for it.</P>
      <P>If he brought in a Bill to make the use of British coal illegal in this country he would get the unanimous support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Each step would be for the salvation of the country! We are always told it is for the salvation of the country&mdash;that a new and untapped source of immense wealth is open for the country.  We have been familiar with those particular slogans for the past four years, but we do not see the results.  We do not see the results as far as the turf business is concerned, at all events. It is the organised industry that is to be helped&mdash;helped in every way&mdash;but unfortunately helped at the expense of the unfortunate small man in the district. What has been the result of the Government's efforts up to the present? The result is shown in decreased production.  The heat value has been referred to.  In the last couple of years I have asked a number of people in the country about it&mdash;people who use turf and coal.  A large number of people in the country towns do that; it is quite a common practice.  Generally they use turf in their living rooms because the grates there are suitable for it and they like it, but in the kitchen-range they have to use coal.  The size of the house, possibly, and the absence of prior investigation on the part of the Government are responsible for it, but the people are compelled to adopt that practice.  None of those people could tell me, with any kind of exactness, the relative heat values of turf and coal.  They prefer turf&mdash;every one of them.  They prefer even to go to a little more expense in using turf, but they will tell you they do not believe that 20/- for 20/- you get as much heat value out of turf, even in the living room, as you get out of coal.  That is the view of a large number of people who, as I say, are in no sense prejudiced. They are people who use turf and will continue to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> Suppose this Bill happens to be effective in some of the areas in which the Minister in his carelessness will put it into operation.  I must say I do not quite know what is in his mind in regard to this particular matter.  As he did not explain it, it is very hard to come to any definite conclusion.  There is, as I say, a tendency in the country to use turf if possible.  Practically speaking, the farmers in my part of the country are thrown back on the use of turf; it is practically the only fuel they use.  I know that conditions are different in other parts of the country. There are parts of the country in which the farmers are accustomed to use coal, but that is not so in my part of the country.  My particular area, being eminently an area which is turf using, would be one of the areas scheduled, I presume from his statement, by the Minister. The only indication he gave as to what areas he intended to schedule was to say that they would be areas where turf is now used.  That, of course, may not be his intention.  That may have been said merely in order to calm the fears of people here in the city, and to prove how baseless were the charges made by certain newspapers against him.  That may not be his intention at all, but I think the Deputies in the House will agree that the only indication he gave us as to the principle on which he would select the area was that naturally he would start with the areas which are already turf consuming.  In that case, take the ordinary Kerry area.  How is he going to deal with that?  It is pre-eminently a turf consuming area.  A large amount of turf is used in the towns wherever the people can use it.  Turf is used universally by the farmers, but there is a certain amount of coal used in the towns.  He is now going to increase the amount of turf used there, if that is one of the areas in which he will put the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>Kerry is eminently a turf producing and turf consuming area.  The farmers are finding it rather difficult to get turf in some of their bogs owing to the present sale of turf in the towns.  There are farmers who have to go eight or ten miles up to the top of mountains in <Col N="1690" /> order to get turf.  That is no easy matter.  The bogs are going further and further away from them, in the sense that they are being cut away in many cases.  Before a process of that kind is accelerated, I would ask the Minister to pause a little.  If you artificially stimulate the use of turf in such areas, you may easily have a situation created in some parts of the country where the bogs will be cut away, and in 10 or 15 years the people will be left without a suitable fuel.  I am speaking now of what will happen if the Bill is operated and successful; I do not know whether or not it will be operated, but there are areas in which that danger may occur, and remember that the Minister spoke of those areas as areas in which he would enforce the Bill.  I do not think there is any necessity for enforcing it in those particular areas.  We had an introductory speech from the Minister in which he carefully avoided giving us any really relevant information, except the fact that the Government had induced companies to produce turf and had been unable to find a market for it.  The Minister referred amongst other things, to giving tremendous employment.  If the Bill is to be introduced as gradually as the Minister suggested in one half of his speech, it is not easy to see where the tremendous increase in employment is to come from.  He cannot have it both ways.  He cannot, on the one hand, try to allay the fears of a number of people&mdash;fears arising owing to the drastic use he may make of the great powers conferred on him by this Bill&mdash;by pretending that for a long time to come there is no cause for panic in that respect.  That is more or less what he said; it was to be very gradual.  If it is to be so very gradual, where then is the tremendous increase in employment to come from?</P>
    <P>In another portion of his speech he was comparing the <i>present</i> economic value of coal with the <i>present</i> economic value of turf.  One did not know whether the Minister was legislating for a distant but glorious future, when we are going to be self-dependent and no coal would be introduced&mdash;that day, he told us, would come&mdash;or whether he was dealing with the present; one did <Col N="1691" /> not know whether or not he intends to operate this Bill to a reasonably full extent.  If he does, then the fears expressed are undoubtedly well-founded. If he does not, what is it all about? Where is he to get the additional employment?  Where is our rectification of the balance?  Where do you get it from?  You can take either of those opposite conclusions&mdash;whichever you like&mdash;from the speech of the Minister. The Fianna Fáil Deputy will probably take both, according to the person to whom he is speaking.  If he is speaking to a poor person in the City of Dublin he will say: &ldquo;It does not mean anything.  It will not operate.  He said so.&rdquo;  If he is speaking to people in counties where they have more bog than they can utilise at the moment, as in the centre of Ireland, he will say: &ldquo;It is going to operate to the fullest extent, and British coal is to be driven out.&rdquo;  Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party will be in the happy position that they can make one speech in Dublin and another down the country. As Deputy Donnelly knows perfectly well, that is an ideal position for a Fianna Fáil Deputy to be in.</P>
    <P>We heard about righting the balance. Is that serious?  If it means anything, it means that there is going to be a considerable diminution in the amount of imported coal used in this country. It either means that or the Bill is not going to be worth anything.  If it means a diminution in the amount of imported coal used, what about the effect on the new coal-cattle pact? Co-operative societies may benefit because they will sell their turf, but the farmers will have so much less of a market for their cattle.  The Department dealing with housing did not consult the Department of Industry and Commerce when laying down conditions for houses; did not, apparently, know that there was this turf scheme, and made no provision in the houses that are being built so rapidly all over the country&mdash;it is not only a question of the old houses, but the modern houses, where provision has not been made.  The two Departments, the Turf Branch of Industry and Commerce and the Housing Department, were operating on two entirely unconnected lines, <Col N="1692" /> each blind to what the other was doing. But apparently, also, the Department of Industry and Commerce, with regard to turf, is quite blind to the coal-cattle pact, which is supposed to affect so beneficially the cattle trade of this country.  It is no answer to tell me that it will not affect the amount of coal and, therefore, the amount of cattle, because its purpose is to affect the amount of coal, and the success of the Bill depends on the extent to which turf is substituted for coal.</P>
    <P>This is a typical Bill of the Government's, introduced to give hasty remedy to errors they have made.  As the Minister confessed, certain societies were induced to go into the turf business. They produced more than they could sell, and the Minister says that was a satisfactory experiment.  I think his exact words were that they saw the value of turf production.  What is the value of a commercial proposition when you cannot sell the goods?  They were unable to sell the goods, and now, after the event, the Minister comes along and tries to remedy that position by his old method of compulsion.  As Deputy Mrs. Concannon could tell him, the proper procedure was altogether different&mdash;if you are applying compulsion at all, apply it to the building of houses and the other will follow as a matter of course.  I think that when I pointed that out as a sequence from, as something that could be inferred from the Minister's speech, I had, if one may judge by physical appearances, the approval of Deputy Donnelly for that argument.  He may feel bound, in Party loyalty, to deny it, but he knows perfectly well it is true.</P>
    <P>This is a typical Bill, hastily introduced to patch up for the time being the previous mistakes of the Government and relying, as usual, on the old principle of compulsion.  You cannot get the people to do it otherwise, and you cannot persuade them, although I gather from the organ of the Minister&mdash; the organ of the Government, if not of the Minister&mdash;that the attempts made to put it into force on a voluntary basis have proved signally successful. That is the type of propaganda that pays no reference to facts at all, and it is the kind the Minister can heartily approve of.  &ldquo;Signally successful&rdquo;&mdash;<Col N="1693" /> and the proof of the signal success is a compulsory Bill to try to infuse a little success into a plan that failed.</P>

      <P>I really intended rising only to ask the Minister a few questions, and also to have the presumption to make a few suggestions, but, having listened to Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan, I am tempted to join in the debate to a certain extent because of some of the comments they have made.  It is perfectly obvious that these Deputies have absolutely no opposition whatever to this Bill, and it is further obvious that they have no case at all, because, after all, these two Deputies were two responsible Ministers in the Administration which had charge of the affairs of this country for about ten years, and their contribution to the debate to-day is proof positive that, during all the years of their administration, they never once gave turf, or turf development, any consideration whatever. The only consideration that turf development in this country is getting now is as a result of the efforts of this Government to deal with it. Deputy O'Sullivan amazed me when he more or less said, as his definite view, that we should not proceed with development of the use of turf because, very shortly, we would rue it when we found the farmers had no turf left to burn themselves, and when the country would be bereft of all bogs, particularly in his own area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's statement amazes me for the simple reason that I always had the idea that we had tremendous resources of peat in the country, and that, for many generations to come, if we had no other fuel but peat, we would not be worried about ultimately running short of peat as a fuel.  I am amazed to hear a responsible member of the Opposition say &ldquo;Be careful; do not use too much peat; do not be in too much of a hurry, because, if you do, you will have no bogs left in the country and no peat in a short space of time.&rdquo;  The Deputy, to a certain <Col N="1694" /> extent, has the same view as his colleague on certain matters.  The chief objection which Deputy Mulcahy has to the turf development scheme is the fact that sacks are used under the scheme.  Several times during his speech he indicated a great objection to the sack.  I am wondering if that is not as a result of the fact that on one occasion in an election campaign of ours we had a heading on one of our bills, &ldquo;Give them the sack,&rdquo; and that, consequently, the Deputy does not like the word &ldquo;sack.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan argue that in spite of the scheme the use of turf has fallen, the amount consumed has fallen, and so forth.  I could take this argument as an illustration of how wrong they are. During their administration they involved the country in huge capital expenditure to develop a scheme for the production of our own electrical power.  The main argument in its favour was that it was to generate electrical power from our native water power, or native fuel, and eliminate the importation of coal, and I could point out to the Deputy that, as he is well aware, notwithstanding the fact that the scheme was put through at enormous cost, the consumption of coal in the generation of electricity has gone up considerably.  I would, however, be most unfair if I left the argument there, because it is obvious that, side by side with the increased amount of coal consumed in the generation of electricity, a great deal more electricity has been used all over the country.  I could, therefore, argue in that manner and leave it, as they left it, an unfinished argument, and say that the whole Shannon scheme was wrong because it did not set out to accomplish what it was intended to do, namely, that the development of electrical energy in this country should be brought about from native fuel or native water power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy amazed me further when he said that another of his main objections to this scheme was that the Minister was going to interfere with the domestic economy and <Col N="1695" /> convenience of the poor people.  I took down those words because they amazed me coming from the gentlemen who at one time took a shilling off the pensions of the old age pensioners. He did not consider that that was an interference with their domestic economy and convenience. These are the sort of arguments we get against this Bill.</P>
    <P>But I want to get back to a few questions in connection with the Bill. There are a few suggestions that I have to put to the Minister.  I want to know if he is aware whether the Turf Development Board has given any serious consideration to the use of turf in connection with the development of industries in the country. In that connection I would like to ask the Minister if the board has taken any serious view of the matter.  It is obvious that we are now building up industries and that these industries will become useful and operative in our midst.  It appears to me to be rather peculiar that, if we are to get our industries established, these industries should have to depend on the use of fuel absolutely outside a source over which we have no control. For the last few months I have been reading literature with regard to peat in industry.  There is a very useful volume translated by a professor of the National University on the question of peat in industry.  This was the work or the production of a great many research workers in a special field of research over a great number of years.  These men had become possessed of the idea of peat being used to a great extent in industry where coal had hitherto been used. It is suggested that peat could be used in this way by utilising it in generating gas for fuelling boilers, or, on the other hand, to enable these industries to instal boilers suitable for the burning of peat, provided of course that the Turf Development Board could show or argue that in the making of the gas, from the calorific value point of view the gas would be equal to coal gas, or if not, that the Government would subsidise it to the extent required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1696" /> One of the things I missed from the Minister's speech is the matter to which I am now about to refer.  I would ask him to go into the question, either now or at a later stage&mdash;can he give to the House an approximate figure as to the amount of peat that would have to be consumed to give a certain number of weeks' employment to a workman?  In other words, how many tons of turf would have to be won and put into use as fuel to give employment to one man for 52 weeks?  In that way we would have an approximate figure and we would get an idea as to what a certain tonnage of peat won and consumed would mean in the matter of employment.  I believe if the board were to give some consideration to peat as fuel in industry, and concentrate on it in such a manner that peat could be supplied from the bogs adjacent to that industry&mdash;thus eliminating freight&mdash;that that would bring down the cost of peat as fuel to something that would be considered economic for such industries.  I would also like to suggest that the Government should seriously consider getting subsidised or highly protected industries to use peat for a number of years.  In that way those industries would be made independent of foreign fuel, and at the same time the increased use of peat would cut down our coal imports. I have been thinking these matters over in my mind, and I thought they were good until I heard Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, with all the authority of an ex-Minister, saying that we have no peat resources at all.  I then began to think that I would get no answer to this question from the Minister.  On the other hand, if our peat resources are as large as some of us had been led to believe, then, undoubtedly, we have resources in the country which would be of great use to the people in the future.  Deputy O'Sullivan wound up his speech by saying that this Bill is unnecessary and silly, because, he said, if you reduce the use of coal imports you are going to reduce the sale of your cattle in the British market, which, after all, he said, is an important consideration. Now I would like Deputy O'Sullivan to look up the statistics and to see the increasing amount of coal consumption over a number of years. <Col N="1697" /> If the Deputy goes back over these statistics he will find that the coal imports have been going up quite a good deal.  That being so, an increased use of peat would not make much difference in the sum total of the imports, but the use of the turf would make a good deal of difference in the matter of the employment connected with its winning.  The development of the industry, if sponsored and kept going by the Government, as it will have to be in its initial stages, will mean a great deal of additional employment. I would be very glad if the Minister, when he is replying, would give us an approximate idea as to the number of weeks' employment that a certain tonnage of peat would represent. Perhaps he would say whether the Government is prepared to consider some scheme whereby our industries, subsidised and protected as they are now, will be made as far as possible to use peat fuel.  Certainly a great many of us feel that these industries should not be dependent for their power upon the supplies of foreign fuel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech of Deputy Briscoe rather amazed me. His cry of &ldquo;back to the bogs&rdquo; was surprising.  I never thought that the day would come in this country when a Bill would be introduced into our Parliament purporting to solve unemployment by turning the people's eyes to the bogs of Ireland.  During the days of our youth the great curse was &ldquo;to hell or Connaught.&rdquo;  In other words, we had this curse of Cromwell&mdash; back to the bogs.  That was the curse that once fell on our countrymen.  But now in this Bill we are all heading for the bogs.  I notice that Deputy Briscoe wants a lot of information.  He is desperately anxious to know many things.  However, when Deputy Briscoe himself heads for the country he does not head for the bogs.  The Deputy heads for somewhere where he thinks there is something more valuable than turf.  He told us that the last Government did not give any consideration at all to the development of peat.  The Deputy now wants to know the power of turf to produce heat, and he wants to know from the Minister how far its winning would go to solve the problem <Col N="1698" /> of unemployment.  I thought that one of the main planks of the Deputy's Party in the General Election of 1932 was the solving of the question of unemployment.  I think they promised to solve it in 12 months, but still it remains unsolved.  They had a plan, they told us, to solve it.  I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Sullivan say that the Government had not any plan in regard to the peat scheme.  At any rate, I remember Deputy Briscoe and his Party had plans for making this country a land of milk and honey, but I remember, curiously enough, that in that plan there was not a word at all about turf.  Does Deputy O'Sullivan think what would have happened to the Fianna Fáil Party if in the 1932 General Election the Fianna Fáil Party had put forward a plan for the solution of unemployment, and that that plan was heading towards the bogs?  As a matter of fact, the most hysterical part of the community were the people of the bogs.  But they were not hysterical on the question of solving unemployment by heading for the bogs.  These people were all to be placed on the ranches or they were to gets jobs in Dublin.  They were to be given land on the plains of Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Limerick and Tipperary. I know this, that in Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim or any of the poorer counties there were no promises made by Fianna Fáil as to solving the unemployment question through work on the bogs.  Not likely! I should like to see the Deputy or man, looking for votes in 1932, going to Donegal in order to solve unemployment on the bogs, and see how many votes he would get. Deputy Donnelly never mentioned it in 1932.  Not he! Deputy Donnelly is too astute a politician to be guilty of such an error.  Apparently, however, this is a ramshackle attempt now to mislead the people in these areas into thinking that there will be something for them as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at this matter.  In the parish in which I was born an attempt was made some time last year, or at the end of the previous year, to form a co-operative society to deal with this question of turf. Of course the society never was <Col N="1699" /> formed.  A Government inspector was sent down&mdash;I see, by the way, that there were some £50,000 paid in connection with this thing in salaries and wages last year&mdash;to tell the people to cut turf at 11/- a ton.  This was told to the young men who were told in 1932 and 1933 that the day of emancipation was at hand, and who were told in 1935-6 that the whole problem of the future was solved. that the whole problem of unemployment was solved.  They were told that they were to deliver turf at 11/- per ton.  Of course, the Government can do it.  The Government has got the people in such a vice that they can use a sledge-hammer.  They can start a peat scheme and they can instruct the local labour bureau to tell the people that they will have to go out and work on the bogs, or else that they can stand idle and there will be no assistance for them.  Is that what is behind this miserable thing?  How has this matter been approached in this Bill, or how has it been approached in this House?  Has the problem been approached in a business way?  Deputy Mrs. Concannon dealt with a small part of the problem; but as a business proposal, how has it been approached?  There was not one word as to the extent of the bogs in this country or their potential value, or how they can be developed economically.  How long are these bogs going to last?  What, for instance, is the position of vested estates, where the bogs on such estates are in the hands of trustees?  This Bill proposes that the bogs can be acquired compulsorily, but can they? Are trustees to be asked to commit a breach of trust?  Are they parties to a breach of trust?</P>
    <P>Now, in 1936, after four years of this Government's administration, we get this thing to solve unemployment. This Bill will not solve any unemployment. The amount of employment given in connection with turf is very small.  In my constituency, for example, it does not touch the question of employment at all.  In that district the cutting and winning of the turf is performed by members of the family.  The moment the turf is <Col N="1700" /> cut or thrown out by the men, the younger members of the family do the rest of the work.  They toss the turf up, and it is handled and rehandled until it is dry.  Children do that part of the work, and yet, according to the Minister, this Bill is going to do a lot to solve the question of unemployment in regard to our poorer people.</P>
    <P>There is a way in which the Minister can do something for these poor people whom he and his Government have ruined and left in poverty. These people live by rearing sheep and cattle, and they are now in poverty as a result of the prices they are getting for their cattle and sheep. They and their children are suffering as a result of that, and yet this Bill is what they get as compensation.  Let us take a few concrete examples of this, and test it.  Take a man who sells 200 sheep.  Let us assume that he is a man with a large grazing mountain and he sells 200 sheep annually.  There is a tariff of 10/- per head, which means that he loses £100.  That is on sheep alone.  Will Deputies on the opposite side tell me how much turf that man will find it necessary to save in order to earn £100?  He loses £100 on 200 sheep. That discounts the price of the sheep right away.  It is a dead loss.  Then, take his cattle, for example.  These cattle are not value for sale until two years old.  They are then bought up, and up to this year there was a tariff of £6 a head on them.  Take the case of a man with a large mountainy bog farm, say, with a rent of £3 or £4 on it.  Let us say that he rears ten stores annually for the past two years.  At £6 a head of a tariff, that means that he has been losing £60 annually.</P>

      <P>I do not want to discuss it at all, Sir, but the Minister raised the matter of unemployment and employment in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and that is why I introduced the matter.  I have no desire at all to raise the matter, but the Minister himself raised the question of solving the unemployment problem, and accordingly I thought it was better to get at it.  However, I did not wish to introduce it, and I do not wish to press the matter at all. It was a curious thing that, despite all these inspectors and organisers trotting up and down the country to various other constituencies as well as my own, there has been a remarkable falling off in the cutting and consumption of turf in those areas. For instance, in my own constituency a considerable amount of work was done during the season by the young members of the family in the saving of the turf and carting it off to be sold in the country towns, but now it appears that this interference by the Dáil has killed this business entirely &mdash;this business of having to put the turf in sacks and having to deliver it at 11/- a ton at the station.  It would appear that that has reduced the price in the local towns accordingly.  In 1934 it appears that there was a falling off of 54,000 tons less of turf <Col N="1702" /> cut than in 1931, and I know that the inspectors went down to my constituency. What is that falling off due to?  Is it that everything that this Government touches seems to have a blight on it?  Is it that people seem to think that there must be something wrong in it, or was it because the price there was 11/- a ton and that the price to the consumers here was 30/- a ton, and that the people said to themselves that they would not allow themselves to be tools for the middlemen? They have seen that kind of thing taking place in regard to other commodities every day.  For instance, quite recently potatoes in my constituency were £3 a ton on the farms, whereas here in Dublin the same potatoes were £8 a ton.</P>
      <P>It would be much better if the Government left this thing to other people.  For the last two or three years we have been told every month that it is going to be a success.  The only people I see who are doing well out of this are the people drawing salaries and wages and travelling expenses and the people looking for contracts.  I see that on the 21st June, 1933, the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Press</i> wrote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am able to reveal to-day details of a huge scheme, involving £160,000, which is at present being examined by the Government in connection with the proposals for the development of the peat industry.  Professor Purcell, the well-known authority on engineering, has returned from Copenhagen, where he was sent by the Government some weeks ago, with encouraging accounts of the progress made by Denmark in the manufacture of peat briquettes. Simultaneously, a combine of British and Canadian industrialism, including a British peer, have been preparing plans for the starting of a similar industry here.  These plans have been presented to the Department of Industry and Commerce. The matter was considered so important, in the light of the views of Professor Purcell, that a special meeting of the Trade Loans Advisory Committee was convened for Friday last and the project was discussed <Col N="1703" /> for several hours.  Mr. C. Andrews, director of the Government's peat development scheme; Professor Purcell, and a representative of a London engineering firm, Messrs. Babcock and Wilcox, who gave an estimate for the installation of plant, gave evidence.  The Government, it is reported, has been asked for a trade loan of £140,000, practically all of which would be used for the acquisition of plant and machinery.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is rather significant, is it not? £140,000 for plant and machinery, and a representative of Messrs.  Babcock and Wilcox present at the inquiry and giving evidence.  There was none of that going to the bogs.  I wonder who is getting the loot there?  £140,000 worth of machinery and plant to be bought and at the inquiry was a representative of Messrs.  Babcock and Wilcox of London, the big engineering firm.  I wonder did somebody get a tip about the shares.</P>
    <P>All this thing reads like a fairy tale. We are told that this is going to solve the question of unemployment and compensate the poorer parts of the country and the poor people of the country. Does anybody believe that?  Will any Deputy tell his constituents through this House that this Bill is going to solve the question of unemployment? I do not see that this Bill will confer any benefit on my constituency. Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the possibility of the exhaustion of the bogs. That is the first question that will have to be approached as far as my constituency is concerned.  Huge areas are already running short of turf and the people have to go long distances for turf for their own use.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to look at this Bill.  There are 33 sections in it, and I am sure 32 of them deal with compulsory powers of some kind or another &mdash;with the thumb screw&mdash;to make the poorest parts of the country and the poorest people in those parts prosperous. Probably the way in which that compulsion will be applied is that machinery will be set up in the bogs somewhere.  The people will be ordered to appear there on a Monday morning and, if they do not appear, their names <Col N="1704" /> will be struck off the unemployment register.  Of course that is not set forth in the Bill.  Deputy Donnelly will not mention that when he goes down to his constituency on the eve of a general election.  He will say to the people: &ldquo;Line up for the bogs, your salvation has arrived.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a way of doing this successfully, and that is by cutting out the enormous profit that the middleman insists upon and gets.  I can never understand how it is that the people who really do the work on all our basic products get only a nominal return and that the middleman can make these huge profits.  You can buy a ton of potatoes in Donegal for £3 10s., while they are selling in Dublin at the rate of £8 per ton.  How is it that the poor people in Donegal can only get 11/- per ton for turf put in sacks and delivered at the station, and that in Dublin it costs from 30/- a ton upwards?  If this thing is to be made a success the only way to do it is to give the people who produce the turf a fair return for their labour.  If they are to supply turf at 11/- a ton, they will not do it.  Their names may be struck off the lists at the labour exchange and left idle and hungry, but they are not going to work at that price&mdash;they could not be expected to.</P>
    <P>Why has not the whole of this question been gone into thoroughly?  There has to be considered, first, the area of turf available and then the possible length of time before the bogs are exhausted.  Then there is the acreage of bog that can be acquired, even by compulsory powers, under this Bill.  I referred already to the vested estates, where the bogs are vested in trustees for the use of the people on the estates.  How are these trustee deeds to be violated and broken?  Will care be taken to commence operations in a county where there is a considerable amount of bog, which will not be exhausted within a reasonable number of years?  There is a big bog in the centre of Ireland and also in County Mayo.  I do not know of any other county where there is a bog capable of being used for commercial purposes without imposing enormous hardship on the people occupying the lands in <Col N="1705" /> future generations.  Assuming this scheme is gone on with without proper consideration, without a proper plan, and without taking a long view, what is going to happen to those people who will be dependent upon the bogs for their fuel in 100 years' time?  I expect there will be some people living in these counties in 100 years time.  How will they be expected to supply themselves with fuel?  They will not be able to buy coal out of the money produced on the farm.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 and 21 of this Bill empower the Minister to acquire from the Land Commission any bogs they may have.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell us the area of bog held by the Land Commission and which they have at their disposal. That is one of the first things that should be considered in approaching this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 21 sets out:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, if and whenever he so thinks proper, on the recommendation of the board purchase by agreement or compulsorily from any person for and on behalf of the board any land which is required by the board for all or any of the following purposes, that is to say, the production, the preparation for sale, or the storage of turf....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know estates in my constituency where the turf is vested in trustees for the exclusive use of the people on the estate.  If an inspector reports to the Minister that there is a quantity of bog there that can be used for the purpose of this Bill, can the Minister acquire that property?  Sub-section (2) of Section 21 states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every officer of the board authorised in that behalf in writing by the Minister is hereby authorised and empowered to enter on any land which is required by the board... for the purpose of making thereon any inquiry, investigation, or examination preliminary or incidental to the purchase of such land by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently this thing will be entirely at the discretion of an officer.  Will that official make minute inquiry as to the local resources of bog available <Col N="1706" /> for the people on the estate?  Those people purchased their land, and rents were fixed on the supposition that permanently there would be a supply of turbary for the use of the tenants. There may be a huge block of turbary vested in trustees for the tenants of the estate.  Will all the facts be taken into consideration when the board's official visits the locality?  Will he take into consideration that the turbary is vested in trustees for the tenants of the estate or will he act arbitrarily and say &ldquo;It does not matter; I am taking over this property in order to develop it&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>In so far as this aims at developing our native fuel resources, I welcome it, but I wonder how far we can go? In the case of several counties of which I have knowledge, it cannot go very far.  It certainly will not go any distance in regard to solving the unemployment problem.  It certainly will not do much to relieve unemployment in my constituency.  I know the entire county well and the capacity of the bogs and I know this Bill will not do much to relieve unemployment.  I am not going to mislead the House or my constituents by asserting that it will.  The Minister made it clear that he is anxious to assist the poor people and that this Bill aims at doing so by giving them employment.  I declare that it will not touch the fringe of the unemployment problem, at least so far as my constituency is concerned.  The whole thing is only a fraud from that aspect.  If native fuel can be developed elsewhere, that is all to the good.</P>
    <P>Is there any co-ordination at all between the different Government Departments?  The Minister for Agriculture is agreeing to a tax in order that we may import more coal and export more cattle.  The Minister for Local Government is building new houses and he has given no consideration at all to the provisions of this Bill. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is endeavouring to compel people to burn turf and he does not consider at all whether their economic position will permit them to do so.  Has he given any consideration to the numerous people of very moderate means? Does he realise what it costs to take <Col N="1707" /> out the existing coal ranges and fit new ones for the purpose of burning turf? It would not be possible to erect a stove suitable for turf burning for less than £12.  The old range when it is taken out will be worthless.  Have the Government given any consideration to the losses householders will suffer if this Bill is enforced?  Apparently if the people cannot do these things economically they have to bear the loss.</P>
    <P>Anyone who understands what it means to burn turf will realise that one would almost require a stoker shovelling it on the fire from morning to night.  The fact of the matter is that the heat is too concentrated and the turf will not last any time.  Apparently that fact has not been considered at all.  No assistance is going to be given to poor people who will have to take out their ranges and put in stoves in which to burn turf.  I believe that in numerous cases in cities and towns people will not be financially in a position to do that and they will need some assistance.  It may not be apparent to the House why there is such a huge fall in turf cutting in Donegal.  In a period of three years there has been a decline of 64,353 tons.  One reason is that many people have put in ranges and are burning coal; and there is another reason, and it is that our young men there were expecting something better.  They were driven to such an hysterical state in 1932 that they were expecting something great would happen in this country, that there would be an end to all slavery in the bogs, an end to looking after sheep and cattle and saving turf.  The young man of to-day is not going to bother himself wasting his time in the bog. He is suffering from a fit of depression, the result of Deputy Donnelly's activities for a couple of years prior to 1932.</P>
    <P>If this Bill will help to reduce the imports of English coal I will welcome it.  I would have no compunction at all in using every means to reduce English imports but in my opinion, what with coal and cattle pacts and other things, this is part of the general mess and I suppose it will <Col N="1708" /> not be any greater mess by throwing into it a few tons of turf.  In my opinion something will have to be done to make turf-cutting more attractive so as to bring it to the stage it had reached when this Government came into office.  The young men in the bogs expected something better from this Government.  They have come to the conclusion that they will cut no more turf because the Government have deceived them.  This Bill is going to impose great hardship on the people in the towns because no provision is made for granting assistance where people have to renovate their kitchens in order to burn turf. It would be nothing short of cruelty to ask poor people who have no means to pull out their good ranges and put in new stoves in order to burn turf.</P>
    <P>I visualise one result of the Bill in Dublin will be that you will have people installing coke-burning stoves where they do not want to burn turf. This is really an economic proposition. Your economic laws will override any legislation we pass.  You can use all the coercion you like in your 32 sections, but you cannot defeat economic laws.  I would not be surprised if two years from now the trade returns show that there is a falling off in the consumption and the cutting of turf.  You cannot make people use a fuel that costs more than they can afford.  There is no use in the House trying to do that.  You will have all the people who can afford it buying the stoves the Gas Company are supplying in order to burn coke.  You will have all the ranges pulled out and these coke-burning stoves put in.  The people will save a considerable amount in that way.  This Bill will not compel the people of the Saorstát to utilise a fuel that they cannot afford to use. This Bill is, I think, more a piece of camouflage than anything else.  The Government, by its policy reduces the income of the people and increases their cost of living and, now, they expect them to buy turf under a compulsory section of this Bill.  It cannot be done.  Experience will prove that that is true.  It may be unpopular to say that, but it is right to say what is true whether it is unpopular or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the five Deputies in this House representing one of the greatest peat producing constituencies in Ireland, Leix-Offaly, in which is situated the Bog of Allen. I had not the slightest intention of intervening in the debate, and would not have done so, but for the admiration I felt at the valiant attempt made by Deputies on the Opposition benches to find fault with, and to say something against this Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan led the van, and now he has been backed up by Deputy McMenamin.  I was wondering whether this Bill would go through without some references being made to the Fianna Fáil programme, and plans, and without the House being told of how the Fianna Fáil Party deceived the people The extraordinary thing in the speeches of Deputies opposite is the constant reference to our plans.  Apparently Deputy McGilligan has coached Deputy McMenamin and taught him that if he cannot oppose a Bill introduced by Ministers on its merits, then he had better give it a political twist and have a crack at the Fianna Fáil plans.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin says that no members of the Fianna Fáil Party took any interest in peat development prior to 1932.  I happened to be speaking on a Wednesday prior to the date on which a great turf cutting event took place in the country in the County Kildare.  It is quite obvious from Deputy McMenamin's speech that he knows nothing about the peat industry in this country.  If the Deputy would only travel 20 miles from the city of Dublin into the County Kildare, he will get sufficient information in a very short time to alter his views upon this matter.  When he says that the Government took no interest in the turf industry up to recently, he is of course quite wrong.  I saw the President and members of the Executive Council and, to their credit be it said, several members of the Opposition, present, at Allenswood on the occasion of a great turf industry display.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who knows Dublin City, and its environment, knows what an attraction it was years ago to see long lines of people with conveyances bringing turf to Dublin to sell to people in the <Col N="1710" /> back streets who could not afford to pay the price of coal at that time. That practically stopped, and would have gone, but for the efforts of the President and Ministers of the Executive Council in their successful efforts to put the industry again on its feet in the County Kildare.  It is not the biggest industry in the country, but it is there at all events.  They also put a stop to the hardship which formerly existed of people having to bring turf from long distances up to the City of Dublin and sleeping nights on their carts on the way.  That has ceased. Deputy McMenamin made many criticisms on this Bill, but, at least, before making some of his statements, he ought to have tried to find out whether they were well founded.  He ought to make himself up as regards the conditions prevailing in peat producing counties and not confine himself to West Tirconnail.  There is no analogy between the Bog of Allen and the County of Donegal.  There is more peat in the counties of Leix-Offaly than in the whole of Ulster.  Peat production is not something done in a haphazard manner in Leix-Offaly.</P>
    <P>As to the progress of the Government's peat scheme in this country, people could read in the papers how Deputies were sent to Russia to get what ideas they could, and to learn the latest methods from a country like that in the production of peat, and to get the best information possible as regards peat development.  That certainly torpedoed the argument that this scheme was launched without due reference to the consequences.  I listened to the arguments put forward to the effect that when housing schemes were being put into operation in the country provision was not made for peat fires.  If there is one duty incumbent on an opposition, it is the duty of introducing amendments to Bills which have been introduced into this House. The obvious duty of an opposition is to see flaws in legislation, and to try to correct them by amendments which they could introduce, but apparently their sole inspiration, wherever they got it on this occasion, is to take another course.  When a serious scheme like a housing scheme comes along it <Col N="1711" /> is not attacked on its merits, but when some Bill like this comes along, into which they think they can dovetail some criticisms out of their love of Ireland and their duties to their constituencies, they get up and say they do not think the Bill is for the benefit of the country now. They tell us that when the housing legislation was going through for the erection of houses in rural Ireland provision was not made for the consumption of turf in those houses.  When labourers' cottages were being built in rural areas in Ireland everyone knew that the class of fuel that would be used would be turf.  In the town of Birr it was mostly with the idea of the consumption of turf that houses were erected.  The same is true in regard to Leix.  While such argument may apply as regards Dublin, it certainly is not true on the whole as regards rural Ireland, and particularly as regards the smaller provincial towns where building is taking place.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin, also, said that I took good care to keep away from the turf industry scheme in 1932.  But the first education I got in turf development was one Sunday afternoon when the Minister for Defence and three or four other Ministers were speaking at Ferbane.  I did not make many speeches about it, but when the scheme was being criticised I often went down to Leix and Offaly and attended meetings there in connection with it.  There were people at those meetings who did not support me or the Fianna Fáil Party, and I told them of the schemes we would bring in when returned to power.  Supposing we did not bring in this Bill with a view to putting the turf scheme into operation one of the first things we would hear from the Opposition would be that we had turned our backs upon the promises we made in regard to our peat scheme.  I remember a question being put on the Order Paper by Deputy Davin some time ago.  It was in regard to sacks manufactured in reference to the turf development scheme.  I do not know whether the answer was satisfactory or not, but there was a number of these sacks apparently left on hand.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> I remember the afternoon the Minister for Industry and Commerce made that reply, and the interest it excited in the mind of Deputy Dillon.  It was to him a question of ridicule.  Somebody whispered in the Deputy's ear that there was no call for such a thing.  The Minister gave a reply as regards the number of sacks that have been made and Deputy Dillon said we could make bathing costumes of them.</P>

      <P>Cannot they transfer them to some other places where they are cutting more.  Deputy O'Sullivan did not say that in the speech which he has delivered.  We had the bell-men introduced during the debate.  They will be switched on to the coal stunt for which Deputy Mulcahy was responsible some time ago.  When he cannot get any kudos out of coal, it is justifiable for him to switch on to turf, just as Deputy McMenamin was justified in referring to 1932.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the effect of this Bill on the coal-cattle pact.  I cannot follow that argument.  He also dilated on the fact that this Bill would not solve the unemployment problem.  Nobody says it will.  No Deputy has ever told the people of the country that a peat scheme alone would solve the unemployment problem.  But if only six more men are employed as a result of this Bill, is it not better that they should be employed.  If we were to follow to its logical conclusion the argument of Deputy McMenamin, we should never attempt anything.  Here is, I suppose, the oldest industry in the country.  Yet, it is the youngest and an attempt is now being made to give a fillip to it.  I do not suppose that this Bill can be looked upon as a Party measure.  I do not know whether the Party opposite propose to vote against it or not.  I do not know what excuse Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy Lynch or Deputy McMenamin would give for challenging a division on it.  Deputy McMenamin would probably say that it fell far short of what was promised to the people of Tirconnail.  I do not know what promise Tirconnail got.  In Laoighis, where they are interested in <Col N="1713" /> the Bog of Allen, I know that I promised that something would be done regarding the drainage of bogs and that an honest effort would be made to have the turf industry developed and markets found.  The Minister for Defence and I spent an evening around Ferbane and the President himself visited the constituency.  I think that it is unpatriotic&mdash;to use a mild adjective&mdash;to sneer at any attempt being made by any Government to develop any Irish industry.  If one Department has justified itself&mdash;I hope the Minister, who is present, will not mind my saying this&mdash;it is the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>It is the courteous way of paying a compliment to the Minister, more particularly when one is backing him.  I do not agree with those people who find fault with compulsion. My grievance for many years has been that we have not had enough compulsion, particularly as regards the development of Irish industries, no matter what industries they are.  If there had been more compulsion, there would have been more industry in the country.  Deputy McMenamin has spoken in a silly, childish way about 32 clauses involving compulsion and one dealing with the acquisition of bog.  There has not been enough compulsion as regards Irish industry and many countries have had to use compulsion for the development of industry. If there is compulsion, I think it is justified and I hope that more compulsion will be used in a wise and prudent but not tyrannical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan talked about the mechanised age and said we were aping Russia.  It is no harm to be progressive. It is no harm to use processes invented by a mechanised age in order to go further, rather than adhere to systems which were out of date 50 years ago.  I do not subscribe to the doctrine that everything should be done by processes invented during a mechanised age but, if progress is to be made, I do not think that fault should be found with us for availing of these mechanical processes.  The <Col N="1714" /> analogy drawn by Professor O'Sullivan between Russia and this country was not, I think, a fair one.  The extent of Russia is one matter and the extent of this country is quite different.  I do not think that the Deputy was fair when he found fault with a system which is being tried out in this country, as compared with what is going on in Russia.  Perhaps I misunderstood the Deputy but I do not think the analogy was fair.</P>
    <P>I presume this Bill will go through. At all events, it will have my support. Deputy Cosgrave has now come in and I want to express the hope that, some day or other, it will dawn on Deputies opposite that they should stop twitting Ministers on the loyalty of the Party behind them.  Would it not be a grand thing for the Opposition if there were a greater element of loyalty amongst themselves?  We might then get a broader and more defined criticism of Bills.  This sort of criticism is not going to get them anywhere.  The final argument from the opposite side always is that the Minister has his majority behind him, that the Bill will go through and that the reverse will come about to-morrow.  They, themselves, do not believe that and it would be more advantageous to the Government if they had a more constructive type of criticism than that.  I appeal to Deputies opposite to stop that type of criticism and to help by constructive criticism schemes for the building up of Irish industry, no matter what industry it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One or two points of view ought to be voiced on this Bill if they have not already been voiced. This Bill is an interference with the citizen's ordinary right to purchase whatever commodity he requires.  If he wants a particular type of fuel, he is now going to be compelled, unless he lives in an area which is not an appointed area or gets an exemption from the Minister, to purchase, in addition, a certain quantity of turf.  A person may not have the necessary accommodation for the turf.  His household requirements may not be such as would enable him to use turf to advantage.  Nevertheless, he is bound to purchase it if he is in an <Col N="1715" /> appointed area, unless he gets an exemption from the Minister.  Another feature of the measure is that while a normal mistake which may occur can be rectified by the Minister or his Department, any mistake made by a registered coal importer is regarded as wilful and, otherwise, unlawful.  By no means the same provision is made for the convenience or defence of coal traders as the Minister makes for his own Department.  This is, more or less, on a par with provisions in other measures of the same type.  The Minister may correct a wrong entry in his register.  No such power is given to a coal importer to rectify a mistake made by himself or an employee.  The penal provisions of this Bill appear to have been so regimented as to have been taken almost out of the sort of law we would expect from Russia, Mexico, or some such countries.  You have this clause:</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister may at any time at his discretion by order revoke or amend an appointed area order and, in particular, may by any such amending order alter (whether by addition or subtraction or both addition and subtraction) as on and from a specified day, not less than one month after the date of such amending order, the area which is an appointed area by virtue of an appointed area order.</P>
      <P>Every possible precaution is taken to let the Minister out.  Applications for the right to be registered are dealt with by this peculiar form of phrase, &ldquo;paying the prescribed fee.&rdquo;  Every business in this country is going to be subject to the payment of certain fees which are to go into the Exchequer. The Minister is going to do a great deal for industry but, at the same time, he adds to the overhead charges on business by prescribing fees.  We had the same thing a short time ago in connection with butchers, a fee having to be paid on each animal that went to their premises.  A fee had also to be paid on licences in the case of cement and it turned out subsequently that that fee amounted to a tax on each ton of cement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> (2)  It shall not be lawful for any person to carry on, in an appointed area, the business of selling coal by retail at any premises or place in such appointed area other than premises in respect of which he is registered in the register kept in pursuance of this Act in respect of that appointed area.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every person who carries on the business of selling coal by retail in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister knows that where penal enactments such as these are provided there is always a greater attempt at evasion than there would be if only nominal penalties were imposed. Why is it necessary in a case of that kind to put the maximum at £50?</P>
    <P>(1)  It shall not be lawful for any person to purchase in an appointed area any coal from a coal retailer who carries on, in that appointed area, the business of selling coal by retail unless such coal retailer is registered in the register kept in pursuance of this Act in respect of that appointed area.</P>
    <P>The next sub-section provides:</P>
    <P>(2)  Every person who purchases any coal in contravention of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding one pound for every ton or part of a ton of coal so purchased.</P>
    <P>There is a later section from which it appears that it is not part of the business of the purchaser to find out whether or not the coal retailer was registered.  Yet here is a sub-section which says that the purchaser may be liable.  Is a purchaser to ask the coal retailer to produce the register for inspection before he makes a purchase? That will not occur in many cases. This goes a step further, and there is regimentation, not only of coal <Col N="1717" /> retailers, but of coal purchasers, and in addition it is implied that if a purchase is made from a person who was not registered the purchaser is liable to a fine not exceeding £1 for every ton or part of a ton purchased. That is the kind of regimentation that Deputy McMenamin referred to, when he pointed out that most of the sections in the Bill were concerned with compulsory powers and penalties.  In prosecutions, in order to show the safeguards that the Minister has instituted on his own behalf, you have this clause:</P>
    <P>(c) the court may, if it so thinks proper on the application of the prosecutor or of such coal retailer, amend the statement in such notice of any of the said matters of fact or of the quantity of turf which such coal retailer is required by such notice to obtain, and where the court so amends such notice, such notice shall for all purposes have and be deemed always to have had effect as so amended.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the Minister or anyone on behalf of the board going into court would have had proof of the case properly arranged and it ought not to be necessary to make all these amendments in cases of that sort.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are in making exemption orders in respect of persons purchasing turf.  If it means arbitrary power it is bad law.  It means that there is a regular procedure to be outlined and that should be set out in the Bill.  When it is not it is a great inconvenience to Deputies who get requests from constituents and people in business, either asking for exemption or making applications in respect to concessions.  These matters should be regulated in such a manner that every citizen's application would receive the same consideration. Deputies might be otherwise employed than writing to Departments about such matters.  As the section stands it would appear that the Minister has arbitrary and absolute powers in respect of exemptions.  Whether the Minister intends to exercise them or whether he has a certain scheme in <Col N="1718" /> his mind, I think the House, people in the trade and the general public ought to know what the scheme is.</P>
    <P>There is power to take lands, and there is the further power to take them compulsorily.  The general impression amongst the people was that the bogs were regarded as conveniences for those engaged in the agricultural industry, and that they were needed for the supply of fuel for that industry.  The mechanisation of that fuel may have some bad effects upon resources to which normally the agricultural industry might look.  It may be that the Minister desires to ensure a larger quantity of turf being taken&mdash;such quantities as were taken before, and his Ministers brought a blast on the sound national economy there was in this country&mdash;and that he means to make up the leeway lost through his policy and that of the other Ministers.  If that be so, we ought to be told.  On the other hand, if the acquisition of land in this case means that an inroad is to be made on the capital quantity of turf in the country that ought to be conserved to the agricultural industry, then we have a new situation.  The proceedings in respect to the acquisition of such property has another feature, as the Minister can negotiate with the Land Commission.  One Department of Government negotiating with another for public property may be all very well, if the property is going to be used for the public interest, but if it is going to be sold, as in this case, for the benefit of a particular Department or sub-Department set up by the Government, we have a new situation.  There is a board and other than that board, as far as I can judge from the Bill, no person is to be entitled to sell to coal retailers.  That is business conservatism, that is monopoly, and the Minister's desire in this case will be to ensure, if he can, that it will be a success.  He is not going to bother very much on whom liability for that success will fall, or, at least, the attempt made to make it successful, as long as it will not fall on the State or on his Department.</P>
    <P>If, then, it would appear that, in order to facilitate the business of the <Col N="1719" /> board, the property must be acquired at a moderate price, I should take it it would be to the Minister's interests to see that it would be.  As far as the public is concerned, it is entitled to have some better guarantee with regard to the sale of public property than that which is provided by one Minister negotiating with another.  Is there to be any consideration for the needs of the agricultural population around that bog?  Is there to be any advertence to the fact that the complement of turf in neighbouring bogs which are used by people of the locality may be nearing its end, and that it may be necessary to conserve the quantity of turf in local bogs in the interest of the people?  No such safeguards, as far as I can judge from the measure, are provided in the Bill.  There is every possible safeguard that could be thought of to ensure that coal retailers will obey the law and that they will be kept, by the various devices running through the measure, regimented in a manner in which no other business has perhaps been regimented up to this.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in some of the Sections which give power to an officer of the board nominated by the Minister, an inspector, or some other officer of the Gárda, or an officer of the Minister's Department to go to coal retailers during what are described as office hours.  The Minister has taken the precaution in connection with office hours to ensure, as far as he can, that these office hours begin with the opening of the officer in the morning and that they terminate at the hour of closing in the afternoon.  If, as the Bill stands, one of these officers attends at the closing hour&mdash;let us say one o'clock on Saturday&mdash;the coal retailer is bound to give him whatever information he is asked for at that hour.  I presume it is intended that the office should be kept open or at least that the coal retailer should remain there so long as is necessary to furnish whatever information is required.  In one sub-section it is provided:</P>
    <P>A demand under this section by an inspector, an officer of the board or a member of the Gárda Síochána, for the production of a record or document <Col N="1720" /> for inspection shall be deemed to have been duly made to the person liable under this section to keep such record or the record to which such document relates (as the case may be) if such demand is made verbally at such premises to any individual in the employment of such person.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it that if an officer of the board, a member of the Gárda Síochána or an official of the Minister's Department, applies to an office boy, that he must get any information about invoices or any other documents that might be required, and that so far as the scheme for prosecution is concerned, everything is copper fastened on the part of the Minister in respect to this business?  If that be not the intention, surely there is no necessity for drawing such a section as that.</P>
    <P>A further section states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may by order make regulations requiring registered coal-retailers to make periodical returns to the Minister showing the quantities of coal and of turf bought by them, the quantities of coal and of turf sold by them, and such other matters relating to the purchase or the sale of such coal or of such turf as the Minister shall think proper to specify in such regulations.</P>
    <P>Could there be anything more exhaustive in the nature of requesting information from businessmen than to make application for returns such as those? If the Minister intends to get those returns in anything like the form specified in this Bill, certainly the clerical staff in every coal retailer's office will have to be increased by at least one man in order to get the information which the Minister requires.</P>
    <P>I object to the Bill.  In the first place, if the Minister means to develop the turf industry and the sale of turf in this country, the attempt should be made on a different basis to one of compulsion.  It might be possible to make certain allowances, and by giving certain advantages to purchasers, to make the use of turf more attractive than it is at the moment, but to say that every person who buys a ton of coal must also buy a ton of turf, whether he has or has not accommodation to store it&mdash;unless he has sufficient <Col N="1721" /> influence with the Minister to get exemption from the Order&mdash;will mean that the time may come when people who are wealthy may have tons of turf piled up outside their residences and when those who are not wealthy may be faced with very serious inconvenience. Then there is the section under which business people are to be requested at short notice and under pain of certain penalties to give all sorts of information to an officer of the board, a member of the Gárda, or an officer of the Minister's Department.</P>

      <P>Deputy Donnelly when speaking indicated that he had not been able to gather from the speeches delivered from the benches opposite before he rose whether that Party was opposed to the Bill or not.  We have been informed now by Deputy Cosgrave that he objects to it.  I must say that I personally had come to the conclusion from the speeches of Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McMenamin that there was some opposition to the Bill from the Party opposite.  I think their position is that they are anxious to oppose it because it is a Fianna Fáil measure but, warned by experience, they are not quite sure that this turf scheme may not be a success, and they want to preserve a safe line of retreat if it is going to be a success.  Deputies will want to trim very quickly if they vote against this Bill now, particularly Deputies like Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McMenamin, who represent constituencies in which there are large turf areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly Deputy McMenamin or Deputy O'Sullivan will not go down to tell the people they represent what they tell us, that if we push this Bill through there is a danger of the turf supply being exhausted, and ask them what is to become of the poor farmers who are at present depending on turf for fuel if that happens.  The Dáil Commission into the resources of Ireland estimated that we had some 300,000,000 tons of turf available for <Col N="1722" /> development in the country.  If that is correct, we can leave it to our grandchildren's children to worry about the position that will arise when our resources in turf are exhausted. Certainly the question will not be one of immediate practical politics before then.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy started his speech by a reference to statistics.  One could have guessed that Deputy Mulcahy was bound to start with statistics.  As usual he got his statistics all wrong. An enumeration is made every year by members of the Gárda Síochána, as to the quantity of turf won in that year. That enumeration is a very casual affair as Deputies can well imagine. In each area, the member of the Gárda appointed to carry out the enumeration, makes an estimate of the quantity of turf won in that year.  From the aggregate of the estimates of all the enumerators a figure is prepared which is put forward to represent the quantity of turf won in that particular area or in the whole country in that year. That figure may be considerably wide of the actual production, and it cannot be relied upon as indicating, in relation to any one year, the precise quantity of turf won.  In so far as that figure is of any value it can be taken to indicate, in comparison with the corresponding figures for other years, a trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy proceeded to compare the figure for 1934 with the figure for 1931, but he forgot something that is axiomatic in the consideration of statistics.  There is one rule which constitutes the <i>pons asinorum</i> for anyone who wants to study statistics, and that is that two figures cannot indicate a trend.  Deputy Mulcahy compared the figure for 1934 with the figure for 1931. That comparison can prove nothing. Whereas that might be true in relation to any commodity, it is particularly true in relation to peat, because so many considerations determine the actual quantity of peat won in one year as compared with another that a comparison of the total production in one year with another has little significance. Weather conditions, and other considerations bearing upon the position of agriculture, and quite a <Col N="1723" /> number of factors operate to determine the quantity of turf won in one year as compared with another, and no conclusion can be made by comparing the total of peat produced as estimated in 1934 and in 1931.  But you can arrive at a conclusion if you take the figures for a number of years and find out from them what the trend is.  If Deputy Mulcahy had carried his investigations back a little further than 1931, he would have formed a much more reliable estimate of the trend.</P>
    <P>There has been a decline in peat production since the State was established. The total quantity of peat produced in 1931 was probably half the total produced in 1921, and that decline in the total amount of peat won has continued throughout that period, due to causes which can be taken into account such as the installation of different types of ranges in houses, improved organisation on the part of coal distributors, and, I think, particularly in the western areas, to the development of road transportation. All these factors operated to decrease the quantity of turf won.  We came in in 1932 with the intention, first of all, of arresting that decline, and, secondly, of securing the organised production for sale of greater quantities of turf.  We have succeeded in doing that.  A number of turf co-operative societies have been formed throughout the country.  The members of these societies, at least, fully appreciate the benefits which this turf scheme means to them.  These turf producers have been receiving, at periods of the year when they were in need of financial assistance, very substantial cheques from the Turf Development Board in payment for the turf produced by them and sold through the board.</P>
    <P>In 1933, as I have already mentioned, all the turf produced by these societies was sold before the end of the winter season.  The actual quantity sold direct by the Board, through coal retailers in Dublin, was only a small part of the total quantity of turf produced by the societies.  In 1934 there was a very considerable increase in production, but sales fell off.  They fell off for a number of reasons.  One, I <Col N="1724" /> frankly admit, was that the turf co-operative societies in certain areas put bad, wet turf on the market.  That went a long way towards destroying the goodwill which had been built up by intensive advertising and propaganda work in the previous year. There were perhaps other considerations also operating.  The Turf Development Board, which only commenced operations in December, 1934, took action to deal with these societies. The powers which the Board will have under this Bill, and the powers which have been given to it otherwise, have been used, and are being used, to ensure that only the best quality turf will be produced by these societies and marketed through their organisations. But the result was that there was a carry-over of a substantial quantity of turf from 1934 to 1935.  The carry-over did not worry us unduly nor is it to be regarded as a cause for the introduction of this measure.  It has all been disposed of since.  The quantity of turf carried over from 1934, plus the quantity of turf produced in 1935, has been disposed of already, and there is no surplus of turf now available.  We consider, however, that it is possible to get a much greater production of turf, and not merely to get much greater production but to organise on a much more economic and rational basis the distribution and utilisation of turf.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked a number of questions which I dealt with when introducing the Bill.  If he had been a little more interested in the turf scheme than he was in the turf club earlier in the afternoon, he would have heard the various points to which he referred dealt with.</P>

The fact, however, is that all the matters to which the Deputy referred, apart from the purely Committee Stage points which he raised, were dealt with by me when introducing the Bill.  There is this intention behind the Bill: to ensure that turf will be used, and used to the greatest extent practicable, in the areas where it is most economic to use it, and there <Col N="1725" /> are many areas in the country where it is much more economic to use turf&mdash; areas from which it is made available through the machinery of the Turf Development Board&mdash;than it is to use coal at the price at which it is available.</P>

      <P>I have indicated already that it is the intention to use the compulsory powers to be conferred by this Bill so as to ensure the rational utilisation of turf.  At the present time all the turf produced by the societies is distributed throughout the country at a flat rate per ton by the railway companies&mdash;an arrangement which proved unsatisfactory from their point of view.  It is, on the face of it, irrational, because turf was being hauled long distances from the West of Ireland, and on the way up was passing trainloads of coal going down. We think we can arrange to secure the disposal of all the turf that is likely to be produced in this year and next year without any hardship to anybody, probably entirely in the areas where the utilisation of turf is widespread, and particularly where the poorer classes of the community use turf entirely.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave, of course, objects to the use of compulsory powers at all.  It is an interference, he said, with the ordinary citizen's right to purchase whatever commodity he pleases.  Deputy Cosgrave is still pussyfooting with the principles of Victorian liberalism.  Where has the ordinary citizen the right to purchase any commodity he pleases?  In what country on the earth has the individual that right?  From what does he derive the right?</P>

That is particularly so when we have available here resources in peat which, if they existed in any other country in Europe, would be the foundation of a great national industry.  There are only a few countries in Europe where there are large peat resources.  In Germany and in Russia, as I mentioned already, those peat resources, which are in quality and in extent far inferior to ours, have been made the basis of great industries of importance to those countries.  In Russia alone they are producing from peat electric power to several times the extent of the total consumption of electricity in this country.  In Germany, not merely are they producing electric power from peat, but there is a number of industrial concerns where peat is used entirely for power and heating purposes.</P>
      <P>In those countries, they have developed the mechanical winning of peat to a much greater extent than we have attempted.  We are only now developing the mechanical winning of peat.  It is going to take some time before we can develop it to an appreciable extent, because the preparatory work which has to be done upon the bogs takes a long time.  The peat briquette factory in Kildare, to which reference was made, commenced operations down there in 1935, and it was only I think last week that they produced the first briquette.  The work of preparation in the bog, which gave very widespread employment in that area, occupied all the intervening period.  Any Deputy who wants to get a picture of what can be done in the development of a large bog for the mechanical production of peat should take a trip down there and see what has been done.  Through the Turf Development Board, we hope to commence in the very near future a scheme for the mechanical production of peat on a still larger scale and by a somewhat different method, but I am informed that it is going to take at least until 1939 to carry out the necessary drainage and preparatory work upon that bog before peat won from the bog will be available for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1728" /> A number of Deputies were concerned about the individual who wins peat from his own bog and takes it into the nearest town for sale.  That individual is not going to be affected to any extent by the provisions of this Bill.  There is, of course, nothing in the Bill itself which prevents any individual seller of turf from carrying on in the future as he has done in the past.  It is true that to some extent the market which he has been supplying may be reduced by the operation of the measure, but the extent will be negligible.  The people to whom such individual turf hawkers have been selling turf in the past are people who use turf almost entirely, and to whatever extent they use coal at all they will use a much smaller quantity of it than of peat.  When purchasing that coal, if they have to purchase some turf as well, the limitation upon the market available for the individual seller will be so insignificant as not to matter. In fact the great majority of those individuals will benefit directly and indirectly by the extended use of turf which will result from the operation of the measure.  Deputy Mulcahy made a long speech but I am not quite sure what it was about.  He read out a number of advertisements published by the Department and by the Turf Board urging people to use turf, and he tried to make some jokes on the basis of those advertisements, but what the purpose of the whole business was I do not know.  I think Deputy Cosgrave would be well advised to shut down that department in his Party's organisation which supplies those Press cuttings.</P>

      <P>They think they are getting a ready-made speech handed to them, but Deputy Mulcahy would have made a far better speech if he had ignored the Press cuttings and come in here and said what he wanted to say. Instead, he read Press reports dating back to 1932, and where he was leading us I do not know.  The logical conclusion, <Col N="1729" /> if Deputy Mulcahy has a logical conclusion, is that he was merely killing time in order to try to justify the propaganda section of the Fine Gael organisation which had carefully preserved those cuttings and advertisements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention to prevent the use of coal in parts of the country where turf is available. No doubt, the use of coal will be limited, but it will be a long time before we can completely prohibit the use of coal in any area, nor do I think that the quantity of turf which we are likely to produce this year will affect seriously the amount of coal we purchase for the purposes of the coal-cattle pact.  The anxiety displayed by Deputy O'Sullivan as to the effects of this Bill upon the coal-cattle pact was the most amusing thing in the debate. I can also assure him, and the other Deputies who referred to the matter, that there is no lack of co-ordination in respect of Government policy.  It happens that the negotiation of trade agreements, as well as the investigation of new methods of producing grates, ranges and other housing materials in the country, and the encouragement of the production of designs suitable to our needs, together with the implementation of the turf scheme, are all the functions of one Department, and there is not the conflict between Ministers to which Deputy McMenamin referred at such great length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill, as I have said, is to secure that we will have, to whatever extent we can secure it, native fuel instead of imported fuel for household purposes.  We can achieve that <Col N="1730" /> end by developing our coal resources, and these coal resources are being developed.  There has been a very considerable increase in the production of coal here and we are, at the present time, spending large sums of money on the expert investigation of the coal deposits in Leitrim and in Tipperary. Whether these investigations will reveal the existence of coal in sufficient quantity to justify their commercial working on a large scale I cannot yet say, but, in any event, there is here in turf a fuel well worth developing and one to which our people are well accustomed. I think Deputy O'Sullivan was correct when he said that over a large part of the country the people would prefer to use turf instead of coal, and, that being so, there can be, I am sure, little objection to a Bill which is designed to increase its production.  I want Deputies to understand that the main purpose of the Bill is to secure an increase in the production of turf, because, arising out of the experience of the past, the organisation of these turf societies, and the energy which the societies will put into their work, will depend very largely on the passage of this measure and the guaranteeing of a market for the turf they produce which will arise in consequence.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, not appropriate at this stage to attempt to give, as some Deputies have asked, a general picture of our plans for the future in relation to turf.  The development of turf production is necessarily a slow business. Nobody ever represented on behalf of the Government, as Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy O'Sullivan contended, that we would get all the turf production we required, and all the employment given in turf production, in a period of eight months.  In any case, the opening up of a new bog for the production of turf, whether by hand or machine, involves at least a couple of years, preparatory labour, and an extension of the measures which the Turf Board is carrying out in order to increase production and spread it over a larger number of years is going to take time. It will be a slow business to increase appreciably the amount of turf won for sale, but the work is proceeding, and it is because we desire to see it proceeding upon a planned and rational <Col N="1731" /> basis that the powers proposed to be conferred by this Bill are necessary, so that not merely will production be encouraged, but distribution can be arranged upon a sensible and economic basis.</P>
    <P>We see in these co-operative turf societies an essential part of the turf scheme for a long number of years to come.  It is true that we are encouraging a private company to develop this patent of theirs for the production of turf briquettes, and it is also true that the Turf Development Board are at present concentrating to a great extent their energies, and are spending sums of money, on the investigation of the best methods of securing production on a large scale.  But having regard to the period that must elapse before the first of these mechanical schemes comes into operation and having regard also to the total quantity of fuel which is required in the country, and, perhaps, the difficulty in finding suitable bogs in every area for the type of mechanical production that may be deemed best, it will be as long as any of us are likely to be interested <Col N="1732" /> in turf production before the utilisation of turf co-operative societies for the production and distribution of hand-won turf will become unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have encouraged the societies to go ahead; we have assisted them with financial grants to enable them to get over difficulties; and we are arranging for the erection of sheds for storage purposes, for the provision of sacks, ricking compounds, and so forth, at the present time, because it is upon them that we must rely for the greater volume of turf production for many years to come.  Therefore, this Bill is recommended to the House as an essential part of that scheme.  Even though it may not be necessary to use these compulsory powers for some years to come, or, at any rate, to use them in any drastic way, nevertheless, the existence of these powers, the knowledge that the Government has the means to secure that the turf produced will be sold is necessary to encourage the turf societies to go ahead with the vigour with which we want to see them proceeding.</P>

      <P>In moving this Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, it is difficult to contemplate giving anything like a detailed review of the work done by the Department during the course of the past year except one were to make a very long speech involving a number of detailed particulars.  The function of the Department of Industry and Commerce extends over a very wide field and its activities are very varied; attempting to deal with them all would be a very big task.  I do not think it has been the practice of the Minister to do that.  On some occasions in the past it was generally understood that the occasion of this Estimate would be used for the purpose of debating some particular aspect of the Minister's policy and on other occasions the discussion ranged over a very wide field. On this occasion I note that a motion to refer back the Estimate has been tabled.  But I have not been informed that any particular aspect of the work of the Department is responsible for that motion.  I take it that it is desired to discuss any matter that may seem pertinent to Deputies.  I am quite prepared to contemplate such a discussion but Deputies will understand that it is not possible for me in advance to give in relation to particular branches of the Department in which they are most interested the information they desire, because I have not been informed what these branches are.  There are, however, certain broad aspects of the work of the Department which are, I am sure, generally understood, and it is in connection with these that I propose to give that review of our work during the past year which is customary on these occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major function of the Department at the present time, as Deputies know, is to stimulate and develop industry.  Although the Minister for Industry and Commerce has functions of various kinds, he is, in the public eye at any rate, primarily Minister for Industry, and his principal function is to stimulate industrial development and, generally, to secure the establishment of the conditions which will permit industrial development taking place as rapidly and as satisfactorily <Col N="1735" /> as possible.  The progress made in industry during the course of the past year has been at least not less than in the previous years.  On this occasion last year, when moving the Vote for my Department, I gave at considerable length a review of the position in respect of many branches of industry. I do not wish to repeat that performance on this occasion, although I intend giving a sort of general review, first, because it is my duty on this occasion to give such a review, and secondly, because I know it always annoys members of the Opposition. Since this programme of intensive industrial development was put into operation in 1932, there has been established in the Saorstát a large number of new concerns.  It is, however, necessary to repeat here what I have said before, that the measure of our industrial progress is not the number of new factories opened, because, to a much greater extent, that progress took the form of the extension of existing concerns, the increase in their production, or additions to their plant and equipment. For some reason, however, some people seem to regard as the index of our industrial development the number of new factories established.  It is not easy to give a precise figure for that.  There is, of course, maintained under the Factories and Workshops Acts a register of factories and workshops, and every factory and workshop opened in the Saorstát must be entered in that register.  Since March, 1932, the number of new factories and workshops opened in the Saorstát and recorded in that register is over 700. Of these 700 new factories and workshops, 532 were opened in protected industries.  That figure, I think, is satisfactory and is indicative of a considerable extension in production, even if one were not to go to the other sources of information for the purpose of finding out what has happened.  For the information of Deputies, and particularly of those who have been expressing themselves in public upon the nature of the employment given in factories and workshops of the Saorstát, I should like to point out that, of a total number of 70,000 persons employed in protected industries in the <Col N="1736" /> Saorstát, over 81 per cent. are adults. Only 19 per cent. of those employed are under 18 years of age, and 81 per cent., or more than four out of every five, are adult persons, and of these adult persons, more than 56 per cent. are males. There is there indicated a comparatively high percentage of female adult labour employed, and that figure may be of interest to Deputies who will remember our discussions upon that matter during the occasion of the passage of the Conditions of Employment Act.  Persons, however, who have been led to believe that Irish industrial progress has taken the form of the employment of juvenile labour in small factories will be interested to get that figure which I have given them&mdash;a total of 70,000 people employed in these industries, of whom 81 per cent. are adult.</P>
    <P>Taking the various industrial groups one by one for the purpose of examining the position, one finds that, while a very considerable amount of progress has been made, we are by no means at the end of the road that we have set out to travel.  There is still considerable room for development in many of the groups of industries which exist here, apart altogether from the new industries that may possibly be established in the future.  In the apparel group&mdash;the industries interested in the production of men's and women's wearing apparel other than hosiery or boots and shoes&mdash;employment at the 1st of September of 1935 was over 19,000 persons. That figure, I think, represents in a very striking way the progress which has been made in that group of industries.  In 1931, the goods in the apparel group which were imported were valued at over £5,000,000.  In 1935, that import of apparel had been reduced in value to something less than £2,000,000.  There is, nevertheless, almost £2,000,000 worth of one class of apparel or another being imported. That figure will give an indication to interested parties of the extent to which there is room for further progress in that group of industries.  The boot and shoe industry has continued at an accelerated pace the progress which we were able to record in previous years.  There are now 22 boot and shoe factories operating in the <Col N="1737" /> Saorstát, of which six commenced operations during the past 12 months. The employment afforded by the industry is over 4,500 persons.  Arrangements have been made, and are in fact in an advanced stage, for the establishment of five additional factories in various parts of the Saorstát in the immediate future.  Certainly, the production of goods from these factories will commence during the present year. In the hosiery group there is also room for further development.  Last year our imports of hosiery goods were valued at £300,000, and although that figure should be compared with the figure of £1,000,000 for 1931, there is still evidence of room for further development.  Employment in the hosiery industry is now over 4,000 persons.</P>
    <P>In the group of industries which come under the general heading of food, drink, and tobacco, employment in September of 1935 was over 16,250. Most of the industries in that group have reached the point at which further expansion is not to be expected.  They are supplying in full the requirements of the country, and a further increase in employment in the industry is not likely, although there was an increase recorded during the past year of over 200 as compared with 1934.</P>
    <P>In the textile group of industries&mdash; those factories that are concerned with the manufacture of textiles of one kind or another&mdash;employment in September of last year was 5,700.  In that group there is perhaps more room for new development than in any other.  The importation of textile goods of one kind or another during the past year was very considerable, and, in fact, because of the development of other industries &mdash;particularly of the apparel industries &mdash;our importation of textiles has been increasing very substantially during the past few years.  Arrangements have been made, however, for the increased production on a large scale of cotton goods and also of various classes of woollen and worsted goods not now produced in the Sarstát.  We hope that by the end of next year there will have been very substantial improvement in the position in respect of that industry; that is, a very considerable <Col N="1738" /> reduction in imports and an increase in the employment afforded here.</P>
    <P>The various metal manufacturing industries employed over 8,000 persons on the 1st September last year, a number which represented an increase of about 12 per cent. on the previous year.  As Deputies will have read in the Press, arrangements have been made for the establishment of new industries in that group, arrangements which are now being brought into operation, and a further expansion in the production of these industries and in the employment given by them can be expected in the near future.</P>
    <P>During the course of 1935 there were a number of new industries established, that is industries of a kind which did not previously exist in the Saorstát. Perhaps I may be excused if I refer briefly to the nature of these industries for the purpose of indicating the variety of them and because of the fact that we have been fairly successful, on the whole, in securing that these industries were established in different parts of the Saorstát and not concentrated in one or two of the larger cities and towns.  The establishment of a mill for the production of cloth for cotton flour bags was effected at Slane, in County Meath.  Bakelite products are being manufactured at Nenagh, in County Tipperary, and in Bray, County Wicklow&mdash;household goods in the first instance, and electric equipment in the second instance.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that five new boot and shoe factories have been established. These are in different parts of the Saorstát. The manufacture of rubber boots and shoes was commenced during the year in Cork.  The development of the boot and shoe industry made possible the establishment of a number of subsidiary industries for supplying goods required by the boot and shoe manufacturers. The manufacture of boot and shoe lasts of wood was commenced at Newbridge.  Boot and shoe laces and elastic are being manufactured at Ennis in County Clare.  The production of calcium carbide was commenced at Askeaton.  Arising from that, a factory was established in Dublin for the production of industrial gases&mdash;oxygen <Col N="1739" /> and acetylene and similar gases.  New factories were set up for the production of card-board containers.  There is still a not inconsiderable import of card-board containers, mainly of a specialised type, but some factories recently established for the production of these will, we hope, cut in on that import figure to a substantial extent during the course of the present year.</P>
    <P>The production of shot-gun cartridges was commenced at Galway.  During the year some firms in Dublin commenced the assembling of clocks, both ordinary and electric, from imported parts.  The drawing of copper tubes, for the production of copper tubing for housing purposes, was commenced at Galway and Deputies who attend here regularly are well aware that the manufacture of cotton thread was commenced at Westport.  A factory was established at Newbridge for the production of cutlery, and dairy engineering equipment is being manufactured at Dublin.  At Bray, in the County Wicklow, a new factory for the production of electric lighting bulbs came into operation and is at present working to capacity.  At Tralee, a factory was established for the manufacture of enamel-ware.  Fibre suit cases and similar goods are being manufactured in a new factory at Portarlington in Laoighis.  The production of felt-base floor coverings was commenced by a new concern at Tipperary town, and a factory has also been established at Tipperary for the production of skin gloves.</P>
    <P>There were two new hosiery manufacturing establishments commenced at Dublin, a mineral oil refinery was established at Cobh, County Cork, and a vegetable oil refinery at Drogheda, County Louth.  Bitumastic paints are being manufactured at Dublin and lead pencils and similar goods are being manufactured at Mullingar.  The production of soda crystals was commenced at Galway, and at Dun Laoghaire the production of marble terrazo was commenced.  A factory has been built and will soon be coming into production at Portarlington for the manufacture of sports goods.  Children's toys are being manufactured on <Col N="1740" /> a commercial scale by a new concern at Tralee.</P>
    <P>During the course of the present year, it is hoped that we will succeed in getting a start made with the establishment of industries for the production of a number of other classes of goods.  I can mention art silk fabrics, asbestos products, buttons of a kind not now produced in the Saorstát; cement, cotton piece goods, flour improver, fire-clay products, foundry products of a class not now produced here; plate and sheet glass, felt hats, upper leathers for boots and shoes, wire nails, wood screws, wrapping paper, and perhaps also certain other classes of paper; springs and axles for motors and other vehicles; wireless sets, and worsted dress materials. There are also a number of other goods, which it is hoped will be produced here during the course of the year, to which for various reasons it is not now possible to refer.  In giving that review of the industrial progress that has been achieved in the past year, and which we hope to effect in the course of the present year, I wish to draw attention to the fact that there is still a very considerable field open to people with initiative and enterprise who desire to engage in industrial work here.  The impression may have been created in some minds that all the industrial possibilities of this country have been fully availed of, and that any person now engaging in industry here would have to reckon upon the market he hoped to supply being catered for by some firms as well as his own.  It is obvious to anybody who studies carefully our trade and shipping statistics and gets the more detailed information that can be made available through my Department as to the nature of the goods still imported, that there is substantial room for further progress, and the function of the Department of Industry and Commerce, a function which I hope we will continue to discharge at least as well in future as we have done in the past, is to assist and encourage any person who desires to avail of whatever possibilities there are.</P>
    <P>In dealing with industrial policy, it is not infrequently alleged that, while <Col N="1741" /> it is true that progress is being made in the mere matter of increasing the volume of production, the conditions under which that production is taking place are unsuitable and open to criticism. Apart from the function of my Department to encourage and promote industrial development, there is the obligation on it also to ensure that factory conditions are such as would meet with general approval, and we have powers under various statutes to deal with such matters.  It is, perhaps, appropriate that at this stage I should indicate in some brief and general way what we have done during the past year to ensure that factory conditions in the Saorstát will be what everybody desires.  Of course, one must mention in that connection, primarily, the enactment during the year of the Conditions of Employment Act.  That Act became law some two months ago.  It has not yet been brought into operation, however. As I informed the House last week, I hope to have it in operation before the end of this month.  The various arrangements which are necessary to enable that to be done are being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible. It is an Act which will effect very considerable changes in the conduct of a number of industries and, consequently, a considerable amount of preparatory work has to be done before it can be brought formally into operation.  Apart from that Act, there are other statutes bearing upon industrial conditions.  The first code of legislation in this respect is what are known as the Trade Board Acts.  Under these Acts we have power to establish trade boards for unorganised industries where, because of the absence of organisation amongst the workers or employers, it is not possible to get wage agreements in the ordinary way.  In such industries, trade boards may be established, and these have the right to recommend to the Minister the fixation of a minimum rate of wages and, on such a minimum rate being ordered, it becomes illegal for any employer to pay less than the minimum rate.  There are 13 of these trade boards functioning at present. During the last year we established two new trade boards, one for the button-making industry and the other <Col N="1742" /> for the handkerchief and household piece goods trade.</P>
    <P>The inspection of factories for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Acts fell off during the course of the past two years, due to the inadequacy of our inspectorate staff.  We had to take certain factory inspectors and put them on other work when, during 1932-33, the expansion of the activities of my Department outran the additions to its personnel.  We have, however, been making up the arrears of inspections. The total number of premises on the factories and workshops register is 11,370.  The joint percentage of inspections carried out under the Factory and Workshop Acts and under the operative trade boards during the past year represent approximately 60 per cent. of the premises on the registers. It is desirable we should have 100 per cent. inspections and, to enable that to be achieved in the course of the coming year, we have sought and obtained sanction for the appointment of additional inspectors.</P>
    <P>Under the Apprenticeship Act three committees are now functioning, one for the brush and broom trade, which committee covers the whole of the Saorstát; one for the furniture trade in the City and County of Dublin, and one for the hairdressing trade in the City and County of Dublin.  At an early date we hope there will function a committee for the house-painting trade for the whole Saorstát. Consideration is being given to the establishment of apprenticeship committees for the electrical engineering trade, the manufacture of waterproofs and for dental mechanics.  The Apprenticeship Act was passed in 1931, but there was some difficulty in having it brought into operation, a difficulty which anybody who reads the reports of the debates upon the Act will understand; but it has now been got over and, as the facts I have stated will indicate, the co-operation of all parties in the establishment of these committees in trades where it is necessary to have them is being secured.</P>
    <P>I think I should mention the function of my Department to supervise the control of prices, which is <Col N="1743" /> exercisable under the Control of Prices Act by the Prices Commission and the Controller of Prices.  I admit straight away to any Deputy who cares to make the point that the powers conferred under the existing Control of Prices Act are not adequate.  That Act was a makeshift measure.  It was introduced early in 1932.  It was the subject of considerable controversy in the Seanad and, in July of that year, I was faced with the alternative of accepting a number of amendments which were inserted in the Seanad or having the Act suspended for 18 months.  I decided to accept the amendments and we got the Bill made law, but a large part of its effectiveness had, in my opinion, been destroyed by the amendments. It will be realised that at that time there was not amongst all Parties in the House the same appreciation of the need for prices control legislation which, judging by speeches and questions we have heard put recently, now exists.  I hope to have the question of the amendment and improvement of that Act taken up actively during the course of the present year.  So far as the work done under the Act is concerned, I refer Deputies to the published report of the Prices Commission, which is available in the library.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might refer at this stage to another measure that the Department is partly responsible for the administration of&mdash;the Tobacco Act. It is merely because it comes in at this stage in my notes, and also because there is some information, that I think Deputies interested in that Act may like to have that I refer to the matter now.  The total harvest of tobacco, for 1934, amounted to 682,861 lbs. and this quantity was distributed in accordance with the terms of the Act amongst the different manufacturers. The price they paid for it totalled £41,147.</P>
    <P>At this stage perhaps I should mention that one of the functions of my Department is the prevention and the settlement of industrial disputes, and that function occupied a very considerable amount of the time of the <Col N="1744" /> officers of my Department during the course of the past year.  During that period my Department intervened in 100 disputes, many of which were tedious and called for a number of prolonged conferences.  The prevalence of industrial disputes for some time past has caused grave concern, not merely to members of the Government, but to everybody who is interested in this country's development.  There can be no doubt that widespread and continuous industrial unrest is destructive of stability and the sense of confidence which progress demands.</P>
    <P>Examining the disputes which occurred during the past year, one is forced to the conclusion that a very large percentage of them were avoidable. I know that Henry Ford, who is a very large employer, has stated his opinion that every strike is evidence of bad management in the concern affected, but I am not sure that that general statement, or any general statement of that kind, can be true in every case.  It certainly does not apply to the cases of dispute of which we have had some examples during the course of the past year, where there was no question of wages or conditions of employment involved and where the stoppage of work was due to inter-union disputes which the employer was powerless to influence or resolve.  In fact, in quite a number of last year's disputes, the element of inter-union rivalry was present, even where the direct cause of the stoppage was not dissatisfaction with the rates of wages or conditions of work.  There can, I think, be no question that industrial stoppages due, directly or indirectly, to competition between rival trade unions to increase their membership is evidence of defective organisation of the trade union movement, which it should be the concern of responsible trade union leaders to rectify.  I was pleased, therefore, to see in the Press reports which indicate that the Dublin Trades Council, and the Irish Trade Union Congress, are taking steps to set up machinery intended to prevent such inter-union disputes from arising amongst their constituent unions.  It must be clear to everybody that if industrial disputes, <Col N="1745" /> due to inter-union rivalry, should proceed, the Government could not remain indifferent; but I think it is equally clear that it is most desirable that action to deal with that position should originate within the trade union movement itself.</P>
    <P>The coming into operation of the Conditions of Employment Act, providing, as it does, effective machinery for the regulation of working hours and other conditions of employment in industry, as well as machinery for registering and enforcing wages agreements, should remove the incentive, or the necessity, to resort to the weapon of the strike or the lock-out in many cases which occasioned the use of such weapons in the past.  However, I know many people consider it is practicable to make strikes illegal, and to institute some system of compulsory arbitration or establish some form of industrial tribunal.  I have made some research in the matter and I have not been able to find any case outside those States with a dictatorial form of Government, such as Russia or Germany or Italy, where such a system, when attempted, proved workable.  I do not think that, in present circumstances, it is possible to operate any system of compulsory arbitration in the Saorstát.  It is much preferable that rates of wages in industry should be regulated by agreement between employers and representatives of the workers; and it has been the purpose of my Department to institute permanent conciliation machinery for different trades wherever, and whenever, possible.  There are now in existence some 12 of those conciliation boards, composed of representatives of the employers and the men engaged in the different industries.  Meetings of these boards were held, at fairly regular intervals, in the course of the past year and, through them, many differences, which might have led to stoppages of work, were composed.</P>
    <P>In passing, I desire to refer to the fact that legislation relating to trade unions in the Saorstát is in many respects old, while all of it was inherited from the British Parliament. It is, perhaps, not entirely applicable to our circumstances here.  The question <Col N="1746" /> of the revision of that legislation is bound to arise in the near future. In any event, I think we should have our own code in such matters and not have to work upon legislation designed by another Parliament for another country.  As, however, the matter is one of great complexity, I shall welcome the views of responsible bodies and, particularly, trade union bodies, as to the action which should be taken.</P>
    <P>Another section of my Department which has been particularly busy in the course of the past year is that which deals with foreign trade.  The increased work which devolved upon that Department was a consequence of the nature of the trade treaties now being negotiated.  In the past, trade treaties to which this country was a party were, in the main, based on most-favoured nation clauses.  That form of treaty has now been entirely superseded by trade agreements providing for exchange, as between one country and another, of set quantities of specified goods.  As Deputies can well understand, treaties of that kind involve a much greater amount of staff work both before their negotiation, and afterwards, because of the necessity of keeping in continuous detailed review their operations during their periods of currency.  During the course of the year, treaties of that kind were effected with Germany, Spain and Belgium, while a trade arrangement was come to with Great Britain.  As all these matters have already been discussed at length and on many occasions here, I do not think I need refer to them further.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, there was also particular activity in the section of the Department dealing with mines and minerals.  I am not now trying to prejudice the report of the Committee that sat in the course of the year but the mere existence of that Committee did not prevent the important work of my Department on mines and minerals from proceeding.  We have received, up to date, under the Mines and Minerals Act, 61 applications for mining leases.  Of these, 19 have been granted.  The remainder are in different stages of progress.  Under the relevant section of the Mines and <Col N="1747" /> Minerals Act, two grants of mining rights have been made and other important cases are about to come before the Mining Board.  It may interest Deputies who remember the discussions upon the Mines and Minerals Act, in 1931, to know that, in practice, it has been found that few mining rights applications proceed to finality, for the reason that persons against whom the application is made find it in their interest to come to terms with the applicants.  About 50 grants have been made out of relief funds for the purpose of mineral exploration and development.  The total of these grants during the past three financial years is about £42,000. The principal mining and quarrying industries assisted out of these grants were those concerned with the production of coal, slate, limestone, marble, brick-clay and silica.  The grants have been instrumental, in almost all cases, in bringing about increased or more efficient production.  In accordance with the usual requirements of the Government in the administration of relief fund moneys, the percentage of the grants which went in payment of wages to workers ranged between 85 and 100.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, two definite investigations of mineral deposits were undertaken by the State. I have already referred to those in an earlier debate this afternoon.  They related to coal and iron in the neighbourhood of Arigna, County Leitrim, and to coal deposits in Slieveardagh, County Tipperary.  The actual operations under these explorations have extended over the last two financial years.  In the case of the Arigna area, five bore-holes have been carried to varying depths, and three cuttings were also opened for the purpose of examining the occurrence of coal and iron in the area.  The work was undertaken by a group of French firms which combined as &ldquo;the Associated Contractors (Ireland).&rdquo;  The actual boring and other operations on the site have been finished for about a month or six weeks, and analysis of the cores and other specimens obtained is in progress.  I expect to have that report before the end of the present <Col N="1748" /> month.  In the case of Slieveardagh, certain borings are being made by a firm of contractors, and drifts are being driven under the supervision of a resident engineer employed by the Department, the whole scheme being prepared, advised upon and supervised by a firm of consulting mining engineers of London.</P>
    <P>I might mention in this connection a group which has become interested in the copper deposits in the Bunmahon district of County Waterford.  That group has obtained certain leases from private interests, where the minerals are in private ownership and certain mining rights, under the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931, where the rights are also in private ownership, and it has not been found practicable to make arrangements for a lease.  The group is also in negotiation with the Department with a view to leases in areas where the ownership of the mineral rights is in the State.  Assuming further exploratory work, which this group has in contemplation, to justify it, the group has in mind large-scale development of the copper resources of the district.  We have been discussing turf, under the Turf Bill, during the greater part of the evening, and in consequence I do not think that it is necessary to refer at length to the work of the Turf Development Board, although that is a matter which arises on the Estimate, as provision is made in the Estimate to defray the expenses of the board's work.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in a general way to the figure in the Book of Estimates of expenditure to be incurred under the Industrial Alcohol Act.  The total provision in the Estimates in connection with the industrial alcohol scheme is £226,510.  Of that amount, £134,600 is in respect of expenditure of a capital nature and includes £80,000, part cost of the erection of five distilleries, and £49,600, part cost of the plant and equipment, including a lump sum payment of £5,000 in respect of the use of certain patented machinery installed, and £5,000, royalties estimated to be payable under the contract with the technical advisers employed.  Provision for management and working expenses amounts to £91,910, of which £52,185 <Col N="1749" /> relates to the purchase of potatoes. Against this expenditure it is estimated that there should be receipts of about £80,000 from the sales of alcohol and the residual wash, which will be brought to credit under the Exchequer &ldquo;extra receipts.&rdquo;  These receipts fall short of the expenditure, as Deputies will have noticed, but account has to be taken of the circumstance that there must necessarily be some quantity of alcohol produced at the close of the present financial year and not yet distributed or paid for by the local distributors. If credit were taken for this production, it is estimated that there would be a surplus.  When the Estimate for the financial year 1935-36 was introduced, it was hoped that the erection of the five distilleries would have been carried out during the past financial year.  Owing to difficulty in procuring suitable sites, and other circumstances which delayed the arrangements for the contract for the buildings beyond the season when building work could be expeditiously carried out, it proved to be impracticable to begin the works at a date to enable them to be completed in time to deal with the 1935 potato crop.  The distilleries are now in course of erection, and it is contemplated that they will be finished and equipped to begin operations by next September.</P>
    <P>In consequence of the delay the only expenditure falling on to the Vote for 1935-36 in respect of buildings and plant will be about £55,000.  The total cost of the distilleries and plant under contracts entered into amounts approximately to £185,000.  That figure is in excess of the original estimate, alterations having been made for greater efficiency and more economical working. It was originally intended, for example, that the alcohol from the five distilleries should be brought to a central rectifying station, whereas it is now provided that each distillery will rectify its own alcohol.  The cost of copper and other materials has advanced considerably since the original estimate was framed.  With regard to the cost of buildings, as revealed by contracts entered into, the remote situation of the distilleries, with the consequent difficulties of transportation and supervision, have also had <Col N="1750" /> some bearing on the increase over the estimated cost.  The whole scheme is of an experimental character, and its success will have to be tested by results.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps refer to the work of the Industrial Research Council during the course of the year.  There is published each year a report of the work done by the Council.  The report for last year was published in June, and made available for Deputies.  I would like to refer to some of the investigations which the Council have in progress, and which have aroused some interest.  The first of these relates to the extraction of waxes from peat. The research to develop a commercial process for extracting from peat, waxes suitable for industrial purposes, is being continued at University College, Cork.  Plant has been erected and is in operation for the production of waxes on a semi-commercial scale.  The experimental work has been mainly concerned with the removal of the small amount of impurities present in crude wax.  The Industrial Research Council is very well satisfied with the progress which has been made on that particular item of research.  The same applies also to investigations upon which a considerable sum has been spent, on the utilisation of sea-weeds and which has been carried out under the auspices of the Council.  I have referred already to the work which has been done bearing upon the efficiency of classes of turf-burning apparatus. That report will shortly be available. Investigations have been carried out on the utilisation of skimmed milk powder in bread and on the china clay deposits in Portacloy, County Mayo. It will be necessary to have adequate geological trials there to prove the distribution of the deposit before determining the degree of uniformity of the material, and also to obtain data for costings purposes before a definite recommendation can be made on the commercial possibilities of the deposits. A detailed report is in course of preparation on the investigation of the possibilities of the commercial use of the colloidal clay at Cloyne, County Cork.  There are a number of other matters upon which investigations have been made, and particular researches <Col N="1751" /> were undertaken for commercial firms. The usual information on these matters will be made available to Deputies when the report is published.</P>
    <P>I think I need not refer at length to the work of the statistics branch. As Deputies know, this is a very important year for that branch, because the census is being taken, not merely the census of population, which is at present in progress, but also the complete industrial census which is being undertaken this year, as distinct from the partial census taken in previous years. The work of the statistics branch has increased considerably, apart altogether from its special activities upon the census, because of the changed nature of our trade and shipping statistics and of our trade required much more activity on the part of the statistics branch staff than was formerly necessary.  I do not know that I need refer at any great length to the work of the transport branch.  It has been engaged in the course of the year in carrying out the duties of the Department under the transport legislation of 1933.</P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, refer to the work that has been done in the development of civil aviation, but I think it would be better to leave that over until I am moving a Bill dealing with civil aviation which will shortly be introduced. That will be a more appropriate occasion on which to indicate the various arrangements made or in contemplation. I had hoped that the cross-Channel air service would have been in operation by this, but certain legal difficulties arose which delayed that slightly.  There has been, however, no alteration in the plans and the service should commence in the very near future.</P>

There are other activities in the Department, as Deputies are aware, certain branches of which I have referred to.  It would not be possible, as I indicated when commencing my remarks, to cover all the various phases of the Department's activities without occupying the time of the House for a much longer period than I think is desirable.  If there are any other matters that Deputies wish to have discussed or to know more about, then no doubt they will indicate their wishes in the course of their remarks which, I trust, will be as brief and to the point as mine, and I will deal with them when replying.  I have every confidence in moving this motion and in recommending acceptance of the Estimate by the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken at a certain amount of length but it was often very difficult to see the point.  He gave us again in his opening remarks another of what I call the litanies&mdash;a factory here, a factory there and another factory some place else.  The Minister asked what information the House would like to have.  He said there were plenty of opportunities for further industrial development in this country. The Minister's general attitude and policy, the spirit that prevails over his Department on every type of information given to the House, very seriously prejudices the carrying out of that further industrial development.  He asks us to say what we would like.  I asked the Minister before, and I ask him now, why, if he is able to give us these annual litanies of where and what factories have been established, he cannot give us the information that has been asked for; that is, the number of new factories established, the number of new persons employed and the amount of additional wages paid under these industrial headings in each of the four provinces, or three provinces and a bit.  We used to have held up to us in the early days of Fianna Fáil the magnificent example of Italy, where every new acre of wheat grown was chronicled and brought to the notice <Col N="1753" /> of the people, so that they might be inspired by the work being carried on. The only type of inspiration which people have got from the Minister is as to whether there were 100 or 300 factories established by October, 1932, and the various scrappy litanies we have got ever since.  Why cannot we have in respect of each province the number of industries established under the various industrial groups, the number of workers employed there, and the weekly wages?  It seems to me that there is no reason in the world for not having that information except that the Minister does not want to show what exactly is happening, with the country in its present condition and suffering from the general Government policy that afflicts it.  If the Minister wanted to give confidence both to the people and to persons who would put their money into industry he would give more systematic and more detailed information than he has given.</P>
    <P>The Minister's whole attitude here is, I might say, one of deceit.  In any question discussed or brought up here, the Minister's attitude towards requests for information is such as reeks with deception.  The Minister spoke of the trade agreements that his Department had concluded last year. At question time to-day he told us that he was dealing further with a Spanish trade agreement.  Recently we discussed a Spanish trade agreement, and at the end of the period over which apparently the agreement ran, the Minister, introducing an Order dealing with the importation of wines, declared that the Spanish trade agreement was one of the factors that had reduced our national trade balance, and that it dealt with a market that was more valuable than the British market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, as reported in column 1000 of the Official Report of the debates on the 20th February, 1936:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The second point is that the egg market in Spain is a valuable market which shows very great possibilities for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> Then he went on to say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the Spaniards are willing to pay us more for the eggs, there is no reason why we should not sell them to the Spaniards instead of to the British.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister said, but the Ministerial propaganda was more explicit in stating that the Opposition Party were minimising and despising a market that was better in its possibilities than the British market to-day.</P>
    <P>If we take the details of the Spanish agreement, we shall get some conception as to the spirit that presides over the consideration of our foreign trade. The Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary question to-day, said that during the first three months of this year the Spaniards had bought eggs from us to the value of £1,317, and that Great Britain and Northern Ireland had bought eggs from us during the same period to the value of £236,291. Nevertheless, the pretence is made if not explicitly by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the allegation that it was explicitly stated by the Minister, but it is implied in what the Minister said.  It has been stated explicitly in the Ministerial Press that the Spanish market was more valuable than the British market for eggs.  Now we are told that in the first quarter of this year the Spaniards took from us £1,317 worth of eggs, and that Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the same period took from us £236,000 worth.  In return for the purchase of £1,317 worth of eggs, we took from the Spaniards during the same period oranges to the value of £57,389.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the orange side of the question. The Minister told us that if our people did not import oranges from Spain, they would be importing them from somewhere else.  The fact is that when our people were not purchasing oranges from the Spanish market, they were able to get more satisfactory conditions in other markets, and the import of oranges from Spain was being reduced, until the Spanish agreement was made.  We import something like 360,000 cwts. of oranges in the year, and before we went into the Spanish market these oranges cost us about £250,000 or £260,000 per annum. The latest quota which the Minister has made for Spanish oranges over a short period is for 170,000 cwts. of oranges.  Obviously the quota for the whole year would be much more, and we are supposed to take two-thirds of our total imports of oranges from Spain in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the beginning of January, about the 7th of January, certain types of extra selected oranges were sold in Covent Garden at 11/6 and 12/6, per case of 240.  Three days before that they were sold in what is now very well known as Connolly-Shaw's Auction at 24/-, 26/-, 26/6, 27/- and 29/- per case.  There was a difference between the price in London and the Dublin price in the middle of January of something like 14/6.  In the beginning of this month, on the 7th of April, I think, the same state of affairs continued to exist.  On the 7th of April, cases of oranges, of the type of 240 to the case, were sold at Connolly-Shaw's sales at 21/- and on the same day in Liverpool oranges of the same quality <Col N="1756" /> were sold at 11/6 per case.  The discrepancy in price is greater than would appear from those figures.  There is a duty of 3/6 per cwt. on oranges imported into Great Britain at the present time, that is about 3/- per case. It would take about a shilling in freight, to bring a case of oranges from Liverpool to Dublin and when we make allowance for the duty on oranges entering Britain&mdash;3/6 per cwt. or 3/- per case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 10 per cent. for part of the year.  When we take off the duty of 3/- per case and add 1/- for freight, the comparative prices in Dublin and in Liverpool on the 7th April, were: Dublin, 21/- per case; Liverpool, 9/6 per case.  I said that we imported about 360,000 cwts. of oranges before we were forced to pay the Spanish prices on the Connolly-Shaw market.  As a result of being forced, to the extent to which we are by the quota, into the Spanish market and into the Connolly-Shaw market, our people are going to pay something approaching £200,000 more every year for the oranges they consume in consequence of the Minister's Spanish agreement.  Some of that is going to go to the Spaniards, and some is going to go to the ring formed here by the Minister&mdash;in the same way that his policy has formed a coal ring and the one operating in the matter of cement &mdash;perhaps more definitely in respect of oranges than of any other thing.  The Minister told us that the benefit we get from Spain over Great Britain is the increased price of eggs.  I wonder has the Minister given any consideration to the price that we do get from Spain.  We got less from Spain for our Irish eggs than the Chinese get from the British for Chinese eggs.  Not only that, but we have to pay bounties to get our Irish eggs over to Spain, and to get them there at a price which is less than the price that the Chinese get for their eggs in the British market.</P>

      <P>The Chinese are able to get and did get on the average over the whole of last year, 7/9 a great <Col N="1757" /> hundred as the import price for their eggs from the people in Great Britain. We got from Spain, over the quarter for which the Minister has given us figures to-day, 6/2 per great hundred. That is to say, we got 1/7 per great hundred less from Spain for our eggs than the Chinese got for their eggs from Great Britain, and we had to pay on the average 1/8 in bounties towards that price.</P>

      <P>It is the fact, and if the facts of the situation here are good propaganda for the present type of Government, then our people are a lot more ignorant and foolish than anyone ever gave them credit for. The Minister talks of the better price that we get from the Spaniards as compared to Great Britain.  We got 3d. a great hundred more over the average price we got last year from Great Britain because our general conditions were reduced to this: that whereas we got from the British, over last year, 5/11 per great hundred&mdash;that is, taking into account all kinds of eggs&mdash;the Australians were able to get 11/4.</P>

One could wax eloquent on it at considerable length, but is it not sufficient to remind the Minister and this House that the taxpayers of this country provided money to send him, the Vice-President and the Minister for Agriculture to Ottawa to sit down as co-equals in council and argument with anyone who came there to argue for a proper position in the British market for those eggs that we had to sell: a market that we had been supplying for such a long period.

      <P>We have the Minister telling us that last year he made an agreement with Spain, and that his Department which is growing more and more expensive and himself are engaged at the present time in hammering out a further trade agreement with Spain.  The position is that we are selling eggs to Spain for less than the Chinese get in Britain, and that we are buying oranges from Spain at a price that is going to involve our people, if they continue to eat as many oranges as they normally ate in the last three or four years, in anything up to £200,000 more.  The amount of that additional expense on oranges is, I submit, going to swamp entirely the whole of the amount that Spain is supposed to be paying us for eggs and a very considerable amount of it is going to find its way into the pockets of the ring deliberately created by the Minister.</P>

I must say that I do not understand that any precedent requires, when a motion is put down to refer back an estimate, that I should give notice to the Minister.  I am dealing only with the position as regards eggs and oranges.  I do not understand the Minister's reference that he should have got notice of this. The Minister had a certain amount of notice in some questions that were put to him, and should not run away from answering the points made in regard to the Spanish agreement by saying that he got no notice.  The Spanish agreement was discussed here in February last, and the Minister ought to have examined his conscience and the facts after hearing some of the things that were said to him on that occasion about that particular agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the facts brought out in the Spanish agreement, and what they implied with regard to the mentality of the Minister, warrant us in looking at the facts alone.  I put these figures to the Minister without any eloquence and without any waxing. I withdraw all these if they engender heat in his mind that <Col N="1760" /> obscures from him what in fact the figures represent.  I would be glad to see him studying in a detached and thoughtful way what the figures do represent.  The Minister often talks of the work that has been done in developing industry here.  The fact that it is possible to reduce our people to the condition that they have been reduced to: the additional cost in respect of oranges, the frightful losses in respect of the sale of eggs by farmers who have eggs to sell, as well as the further loss to the taxpayers in providing the money for bounties to push these eggs out of the country, are all symptomatic of the reason why industry cannot develop here.  The Minister is simply fooling the people with regard to the development of industry as he is fooling them in other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He could not but establish a certain number of new industries here behind the 75 per cent. and 100 per cent. tariffs, and inside his wall of quotas, but it is one thing to establish an industry and it is another thing to get that industry to serve the people among whom it is established.  Industries which have to be bolstered up and protected to the extent that the Minister is protecting them with exorbitant tariffs and quota restrictions, cannot serve a people whose purchasing capacity has been so reduced as the purchasing capacity of our people here has been reduced by the way in which the agricultural industry has been hit.  The Minister tells us that the cost of living is very little different from what it was, and he speaks of the defects in the machinery that has been provided by the Oireachtas for controlling prices.  The Minister cannot run away with the idea that he was not warned here that his general policy was excessively raising prices for the people, and that the policy of the Government of which he is a member was preventing the people from being able to pay even the normal prices chargeable for those commodities.  We do charge him with very serious neglect in the matter of prices.  If he were serious in his desire to control prices or to examine effectively into the causes that were raising those prices, <Col N="1761" /> he would have presented this House a lot quicker with his proposals for increasing his power to control prices. The only reason that the Minister can have for the delay in presenting the House with his proposals along those lines is that he knows that serious examination into the prices would disclose things which he does not want to disclose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why it was that the price of coal so increased since the quota was put on coal, and the agreement was made with Great Britain in respect of coal, and the tax of 5/- was transferred to practically all the coal coming into this country.  He does not want to have shown up the fact that putting an unnecessary scheme of licensing on coal coming in from Great Britain has created a coal ring here, and has increased substantially and unnecessarily the price of coal here. That is one thing he does not want to have examined as far as prices are concerned.  He pretended here in this House that the committee he was setting up to negotiate and take decisions and advise as to the prices to be charged for coal by the British collieries to the importers of this country was going to have some power to influence or review the price that was being charged for coal by the importers to the people here.  The Minister does not want to have that question examined.  The Minister does not want to have examined the question as to why the price of cement went up by 6/- a ton between the beginning of November of last year and the beginning of February of this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a duty to destroy the delusions or the illusions of any Deputy in this House or of any class of people in the country who suffer from delusions that are injurious to commercial confidence and industrial stability here.  When we are spending a very considerable amount of public money on building houses, and using a large amount of cement&mdash; cement is being pushed in many cases by the Minister for Local Government, as against brick&mdash;we are entitled in the first place to have this information so that we may consider it.  A rise of 6/- in the price of cement means raising the price of cement by one-sixth at a time when, as I say, we are spending a very considerable amount of public money in building houses and using cement for them.  Again I should like to ask the Minister if the Controller of Prices has ever directed his attention to the cost of tea?  Every quarter, the Minister publishes in his Trade Journal information with regard to the retail cost of many items that influence the cost of living.  Has the Minister ever examined the price of tea as indicated by his own figures, and ever asked the Controller of Prices to examine the situation and tell him what is wrong? Since the duty was put back on tea by the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister's figures disclosed the fact that the price of the cheapest tea throughout the country has risen by 10¾d. per lb., while the price of the dearest tea has risen by 1¼d. per lb., at a time when the import cost of tea was reduced by some small amount.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>My explanation is that the ordinary poor people are paying a lot more, and that the burden of the tax on tea is falling completely and only on the poorer class of consumer throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, with machinery very well sustained in the <Col N="1765" /> matter of getting any money he wants, has the means of investigating the cost of all these things and he has allowed a situation like the tea situation to grow up under his nose, without, so far as we know, paying any attention to it or taking any steps to redress it. It furnishes one of the explanations as to why, in spite of what the Minister might say, there is obvious evidence that the purchasing capacity of our people has very considerably diminished. Last year, I pointed out that when the figures for production in 1933 were examined, very considerable reductions in consumption had taken place in boots, shoes, hosiery, soap and candles, furniture, jams and sugar confectionery and clothing.  It is quite easy to understand that where you had a situation in this country in which £11,000,000 was the total amount paid in wages in industry, and that £11,000,000 was the home market for our agriculturists, and that we got £30,000,000 from agricultural markets abroad, when these agricultural markets abroad were cut off by more than one half, the purchasing power of our people would very substantially decline and there would be a very considerable reduction in the consumption of industrial products here.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am picking the last year for which we have information from the Minister.  That is the year 1934.  We are in the position that, in spite of the fact that the Minister regards himself as carrying out intense industrial development here, we have not yet got figures in respect of the production of four or five items.  We are yet waiting for the figures of production in respect of bricks, fertilisers, motor cars about which the Minister is speaking, coach building, hosiery, and there is probably one other item in respect of which we have not yet got from the Minister's expensive Department information as to their production in 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is very particular, seeing that his Government did not publish any such figures until 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might find a lot of things that would provide explanations for that, if he went back to the year preceding 1929. We did not boast, and we did not run a great campaign that we were carrying out an intensive industrial development here.  We just carried it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Where?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We carried it out in a very substantial number of our important industries, and increased the employment in these very substantially, with no excessive tariffs, with no quotas, and with no excessive cost to the people.  The work, as I say, was carried out, but we are in the habit of hearing a lot of talk as to the industrial development that is going on here. We are being preached at as to how important it is that the people should know all about it, but the greatest possible care is taken to see that the people will not know anything about it <Col N="1767" /> until a couple of years afterwards.  I pointed out, when dealing with the Turf Bill to-day, that, by the assistance of bluff, by advertisement and by the use of public moneys, even to the extent of voting large sums of money as a kind of boost and not expending them, it is possible to induce a feeling in the responsible Press of this country that an enormous development has gone on and that unprecedented quantities of turf have been cut at a time when the actual fact was that there was a substantial reduction in the cutting of turf.</P>
      <P>In the same way, the Minister is simply boosting, by many devices, the fact that a big industrial development is being carried on in order to tide him over some queer thin ice on which he knows this country is skating, and on which it will continue to skate until the entire general policy which destroys our agricultural industry has been changed, so that the Minister must excuse me if, when dealing with facts and wishing to deal with facts alone, I am restricted in the matter of time when making comparisons, and that, although this is April, 1936, I can only make comparisons between 1934, three years after the Fianna Fáil Party came into office, and 1931, the year before they came into office. Even in respect of those years, I am not able to make a comparison in respect of a number of things on which I should like to make comparisons. Comparisons, however, can be made in certain things.  Last year I drew attention to the fact that the consumption of boots and shoes in 1933 was £256,619 less than in 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers were greater for the reason that 120,000 dozen pairs of rubber shoes&mdash;I do not want to quote the figure, but I believe they were about 7d. each&mdash;were imported into this country during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to paint the situation in terms of prices, then do not let him say that the people of this country used 120,000 dozen pairs of shoes and let it be thought that these were shoes of standard price and quality, when they were shoes imported at a cost per pair of something like 7d.  The figure is something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were rubber-soled shoes, sold at 1/6 to 2/- per pair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy stated a minute ago that there were less boots and shoes used, and he quoted the figure of the prices of boots and shoes. That was a deliberate misrepresentation, for, in fact, there were more boots and shoes used in the latter year &mdash;though they cost less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I do not think anyone else would put that interpretation on it.  I told the Minister that in 1933 we consumed £256,619 worth less boots and shoes than we consumed in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>More boots and shoes were used in 1933, though they cost less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, something like 120,000 dozen pairs of these boots and shoes were worth, according to the import list, something like 7d. per pair.  I do not stand for that as being <Col N="1769" /> the exact figure.  The Minister can give us the exact figure, and I have no objection to his stating it.  I think it is an appalling thing to have to make a statement like that in a country where we used 120,000 dozen pairs of boots and shoes of that kind. I am going to discuss this matter of boots and shoes on the basis of prices. The element that is involved in prices is the element of the man who gets his weekly wages; it is the element that the woman has in her purchases; it is the element that the farmer lacks in respect of millions of pounds in his lost markets abroad, and it is the element which chiefly has resulted in the reduced capacity of our people to buy the necessaries of life.  The reduction in the matter of the expenditure of our people on boots and shoes was greater in 1934 than in 1931.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
