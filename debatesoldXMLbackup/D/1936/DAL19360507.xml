      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state the number of appeals in respect of claims for blind pensions lodged by either claimants or pension officers during the year March 31st, 1935, to March 31st, 1936; how many of these appeals are still undecided and when it is proposed to have them determined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>During the year ended 31st March, 1936, the number of appeals received in respect of claims for blind pensions was 1,670.  The number of such appeals at present awaiting decision is 772.</P>
      <P>There has been some delay in determining appeals due to the fact that the post of medical inspector for blind pension purposes became vacant on 1st February last.  Steps for filling the post are well advanced and it is hoped to be in a position to make an appointment shortly.  The appeals will be determined as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply, could the Parliamentary Secretary give any information as to what the nature of the delay was in filling such an appointment?  Was it not possible for the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission to insert an advertisement and to adjudicate as between the applications for the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.M. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will consider the advisability of introducing such legislation as will enable claimants for old age pensions, in case that their claims are disallowed by the local pension sub-committees or rejected by the Local Government Department, to appeal to either the district justice or the Circuit Court judge of the area in which the claimants reside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>There does not appear to be any need for such further provision in regard to old age pensions appeals as is suggested by the Deputy. Old age pensions procedure is designed to be as inexpensive as possible to claimants.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are no stocks of this commodity available in Saorstát Eireann, and that it is a commodity exclusively used by the poorer section of the community; and, in view of these facts, will he not issue licences to import it, even on the basis of a quota of last year's imports, pending some final decision as to what the ultimate policy of the Government is going to be regarding cotton textiles?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is anticipated that supplies of striped flannelette of Saorstát manufacture will be available in the course of a short time, and, in any event, it would be inequitable at this stage to commence to issue licences, having regard to the fact that there are numbers of persons with huge stocks of flannelette on hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, how can he justify issuing licences for the importation of flannelette to a number of merchants during a period when he was refusing to issue similar licences to other merchants who had to trade in competition with the traders to whom licences were issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assumption is incorrect.  Licences are being issued to boot and shoe manufacturers for small quantities of flannelette required in the manufacture of boots and shoes.  The licencees referred to are boot and shoe manufacturers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that when he was issuing licences for the importation of shirting to saddlery manufacturers for the purposes of their trade, these shirtings were habitually sold by the importers to ordinary merchants in the country and that a situation arose in which you had two merchants in a town, one buying shirting through the ordinary channels and paying the duty upon it, and another buying it from the importers, who were allowed to bring it in duty-free under licence?  Is he aware that his refusal to grant a licence to country retail shopkeepers has resulted in an increase in the price of flannelette of, approximately, 3d. per yard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all the Deputy's questions, with the exception of the last, is in the negative.  So far as the last question is concerned, I am aware that there has been an increase in the price because an import duty has now to be paid upon flannelette.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister justify the levying of a revenue tariff of 3d. per yard on flannelette, which is almost exclusively used by the poorer sections of the community?  Is he aware that no one amongst the wealthier <Col N="2376" /> classes of the community buys striped flannelette or uses it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>By far the greater part of the flannelette used by poorer persons can be imported without an import licence as it is not liable to duty at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply to my supplementary questions, is he not aware that flannelettes of less than 4½ ounces are not one-fifth of the quantity used by the poorer sections of the community? At least 70 per cent. of the flannelette imported is over 4½ ounces, and, as a direct consequences of the putting of a tariff on this flannelette, these people are now paying a revenue duty of 3d. per yard on the clothes they have on their back.  I ask the Minister how can he justify the levying of that amount on a class of material which is exclusively used by the poorer sections of the community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To conclude, the position is that flannelette has had to be made liable to duty in advance of its production in the Saorstát because a situation existed in which the duty on textiles of various kinds was being evaded, and because they were being imported as flannelette after they had been subjected to a certain process. In order to make the duty on these textiles fully operative, a duty had to be placed on flannelette at a date earlier than we had intended.  As I have already explained to the Deputy, it is anticipated that supplies of Saorstát manufactured flannelette will be available within a short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not illegal importations.  The goods were so put up that they could be described as flannelette, and they had to be passed by the Revenue Commissioners although it was intended that textiles of that description should have been subject to the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Revenue Commissioners have, under <Col N="2377" /> the Finance Act, ample power to refuse to pass any commodity as something which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, it is not truly described?  I am aware that the backs of certain kinds of cloths can be dressed in order to give them the appearance of flannelette, but is it not perfectly possible for the Revenue Commissioners, within their powers, arbitrarily to differentiate between these types of cloths and those cloths which are genuinely described as flannelettes?  Can the fact, that these cloths have been imported free of duty, be taken as any excuse or justification for imposing a revenue duty of 3d. per yard on flannelette which is used exclusively by the poorer section of the community?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt yesterday evening with some of the principal items that had been raised in the discussion on the Estimate. I have still to deal with a few items, some of them of minor importance, and some of them rather important items.  Before I get to the body of the material, I should like to refer to one question raised by Deputy Davin with regard to the number of objections and appeals lodged during the last two years.  There were, in 1934-5, approximately 150 objections, and and in 1935-6, 230 objections to the acquisition of lands.  There were before the Appeals Tribunal in 1931-2, 19 appeals, and in 1932-3, 18 appeals. In 1933-4 there is no record of any appeals as the 1933 Lands Bill was not yet really operating then.  In 1934-5 there were 123 appeals, and in 1935-6, 196 appeals.  A number of Deputies, including Deputy Mulcahy, raised questions with regard to the statistical information which could be secured from the Land Commission.  Deputy Mulcahy had several questions some time ago on this matter, and at the time I asked the Department to see in how far we could improve our statistical information.  Deputy Roddy was here last evening, and he endorsed all that Deputy Mulcahy said.  It occurred to me that it was rather interesting, and strange perhaps that this question of statistics in the great detail in which the Deputy wishes them, was not raised many years ago. However, that is merely an side.  I personally am in favour of having the maximum amount of analyses and statistics available, not only for Deputies but for the public generally, and for the guidance of the Department. <Col N="2379" /> I have a minute from the Department which I shall read out. Perhaps it will explain, at any rate, what we hope to do.</P>
      <P>The statistics of the Land Commission in regard to the division of untenanted land have been regulated by the practical difficulty of securing detailed information without unduly occupying the time of the officials actually engaged on the work of resale schemes.  The information recorded was limited to such details as were likely to be of primary interest to the public and of value for Departmental purposes.  It was only in the Land Commission Report for the year ended 31st March, 1935, that the allotment figures were first shown under the separate heads of new holdings and enlargements of existing holdings.  In the same way, the records of improvement sanctions and expenditure were kept by estates as a whole, and not segregated under the heads of new holdings and enlargements. A practical difficulty at once arises in attempting such a segregation, as on estates divided there is necessarily considerable expenditure for general improvements, such as drainage, roads, etc., which would have to be apportioned in order to ascertain the total cost of the creation and assignment of new holdings.  The apportionment might be calculated on the basis of proportionate area allotted, but such a proportion is notional rather than actual, and moreover, such calculations would add to the work of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be realised that in the endeavour to expedite to the fulleset possible extent the work of land division, the staff available for the recording of statistics has been kept at the absolute minimum, and the effort has been to concentrate on the essential statistics and disregard more detailed matters.  It is proposed in the current year to elaborate the Land Commission statistics so as to include as much information as possible in regard to the classification of new holdings and the cost of their creation and equipment. No information which was readily available has at any time been withheld from Deputies but, of course, <Col N="2380" /> the Department must take into consideration the time and labour involved in compiling detailed particulars not contained in normal statistical returns. Now, I hope, that will satisfy the House.  With regard to the research that would be necessary to go over all the schemes for past years, I do not think it would be a practicable proposition.  I can only say that, from the 1st April, the statistics will be carried out in detail as far as it is humanly possible to do it.</P>
    <P>Now, coming to the matters that were discussed, I would like to refer for a moment or two to the remarks of Deputy Bennett who made the suggestion, which was endorsed by certain Deputies here, that the Land Commission should go out and purchase land in the open market.  I think, on the face of it, that does not seem to be either reasonable or wise.  We all know what would happen after the first few actions had been held, and when it was realised that the State was bidding for land.  What would happen?  We would have false prices: we would have what are called down here, I believe, &ldquo;puffers,&rdquo; and what are called in the North &ldquo;auction-sweeteners.&rdquo; The proposal to me seems neither practicable nor wise.  I was more concerned with the Deputy's references to the houses that are being built by the Land Commission and the criticism which he offered to the type of house that we are building.  I agree, if we could afford it, that it would be better to build artistic houses or, at least, more artistic houses than we are building, but I have not yet heard any serious complaint with regard to the method of building, the quality of the building or the quality of the materials that are being used. Personally, if I had my way I would like to see a certain percentage of the Land Commission houses built on the old model with thatched roofs and, of course, properly protected from the point of view of the ceiling and the rest.  Unfortunately, we cannot afford these.  They would be somewhat of a luxury, but it would be desirable, if we were thinking of the aesthetic qualities of the country, that that should be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bennett and others raised <Col N="2381" /> the question of land prices which I have already dealt with.  Deputy Donnelly raised the question of the Luggacurran area, and it was interesting in that connection to get the Fianna Fáil reaction to the Land Commission's work.  We remember what Deputy Donnelly said.  He suggested something on the Chicago model.  I will pass that by.  We are, however, doing something with regard to Luggacurran.  It is a peculiar district, linked up as it is with the Wolfhill colliery area.  The land there is of a mixed quality.  We have acquired and schemed 288 acres this year. Schemes are being prepared for an additional 260 acres, and there is at present under review 740 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scattered over a number of areas in the district. Deputy Wall and Deputy Curran spoke on the question of embankments, and I think they really misinterpreted sub-head P, which deals with this matter. We set aside a certain sum, the interest of which goes to the maintenance of particular embankments on holdings. The owners of these holdings repay us by means of an addition to their land annuities.  If we spend by way of a free grant, the money has all to come out of our improvement Vote. All this matter of coast erosion and of embankments&mdash;I have given it a considerable amount of thought and so have the Land Commissioners&mdash; is we feel in the nature of public works in many cases.  Certainly, in regard to reclamation the Land Commissioners themselves have been sitting on this question and have been investigating it.  They feel, and I feel with them, that large schemes of drainage should precede proper reclamation, and if work of that kind is going to be effective and well done it is something that might be considered on the basis of public works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2382" /> Deputy Wall suggested that there was undue pressure on annuitants to pay.  Well, this, of course, is a frequent cause of complaint.  It was last year and it still is&mdash;not so much as it was, but it still exists.  Now, I want to make it clear that sympathetic consideration is given in every case where there is justification, that is, where there is any untoward incident in a family, such as a death, where some heavy loss has been sustained or the like.  But what we are faced with is the type of person who will make no effort, and has made no effort in the past, to pay.  I have had representations made to me even by members of my own Party asking for time.  I pass these on to the collection Department asking for their opinion and for their consideration. In some cases a report comes back that the particular person referred to never paid: that certain arrears were funded and that certain other arrears were written off.  The difficulties are there, but I want to assure the House that the collection Department gives sympathetic consideration in every case where it can be done. I do not think any Deputy will be able to bring forward a specific case where a reasonable proposal&mdash;because that after all is the essential thing from the collection branch point of view&mdash;asking for time, and indicating when the amount would be paid, was turned down.  I know of no such case, and I do not think any Deputy will be able to quote one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Holohan raised the question of the system under which we are working in regard to the allotment of holdings.  The first people who are considered are the employees losing their employment through the acquisition; the next would probably be evicted tenants, then congests, then suitable landless men in the vicinity and then migrants.  In all those cases national service gets preference. Apart from that, of course, the inspectors and commissioners must judge the cases on their merits; they must assess the probability of the applicants making good, whether they have a certain amount of capital, whether they have been working on <Col N="2383" /> the land, and so on.  Deputy Davin brought up the question of wages, and this was also referred to by Deputy Everett and Deputy Corish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, as a matter of fact I was not allowed to proceed with the questions I wanted to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It applies equally to this Vote and the Forestry Vote, and as both are really under the Land Commission, I want to indicate our difficulties in regard to this matter. Deputies know that the rate of wages is fixed by the InterDepartmental Committee under the Minister for Finance, and with the best will in the world they have got to consider the difficulties that may confront the agricultural employer who wants labour; the rate they fix might make it difficult for him to secure labour.  That is the main factor in this business.  Personally, I should like to see a flat rate for all our labour.  Apparently that is not possible, and for very good reasons. What has been done is this; all labour under 24/- per week has been raised to 24/-; those above 24/- are being left as they are, and all wages will be reviewed when the arbitration committees are set up under the new Agricultural Wages Bill which is about to be introduced in the Dáil by Dr. Ryan, Minister for Agriculture. We have, of course, quite a number of rates of wages above 24/- per week.  We have in some cases two different rates in the same county. That is anomalous, but it is due to the fact, as Labour Deputies know, that the agricultural wages committees themselves have a difficulty in regard to this problem.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin talked of the hold-up of improvement works; I should like to get details of any particular <Col N="2384" /> cases he has in mind.  The Land Commission policy is that once they take on the work it has to go right through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases where hold-ups have taken place it is invariably found that they are not due to the Land Commission; they are due to circumstances.  I had a case recently in County Mayo, where houses for the congests are very badly needed.  The grants have been provided, and a great deal of the stripping has been done on the land, but we could not get agreement with regard to the sites being accepted by the people.  The plain fact of the matter was that they wanted to build the houses on the old sites, which are unhygienic and unhealthy, and we will not agree to have the money spent there.  That is the type of hold-up you will get.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin asked if I was reasonably satisfied with the duties performed by the staff as at present organised, and asked me to give my opinion, as a person who knew a little about industry, as to whether an industrial concern could stand it. As far as that goes, I am satisfied that our staff is well organised and is under very competent heads of departments. I cannot imagine any men working more zealously or more efficiently than the heads of those departments, and the state of the organisation of the various sections is quite satisfactory to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that, and I am going to defend it.  The present Land Commission suffers from the old reputation and the old tradition of the Land Commission.  I should like Deputies to clear their minds entirely of the idea that the present Land Commission is in any sense&mdash; either in personnel or in anything else &mdash;on the same basis as the conception that the public have of the old Land Commission.  I think that conception is unfair to those of our own native people who have gone in there, from the secretary down, who are in charge of departments and doing good work, and who realise that they have got to live down that old tradition.  I should like that old tradition or reputation should disappear, because there is no justification whatever for it.  With regard to this question of correspondence, the heads of sections are in no better position and no worse position very often than the Minister. The type of question that is asked from the Land Commission is invariably of such a nature that a reply the not be given.  That is really the position.  Certain information is sought about acquisitions, certain <Col N="2386" /> information is sought about schemes and so on.  Very often the officials are not in a position to give this information, but where it is possible the information is given.  I would say also that probably the record mail in the country is the Land Commission mail. I find it almost impossible, even working all day, to reach all my own mail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite; we bow to that.  As I was saying, the speech I was most interested to hear was Deputy Roddy's.  He was my predecessor in the Land Commission, and I know the genuinely good work which he put into the Land Commission when he was there, but I was rather surprised to hear him contrasting the proportionate cost of Land Commission activities now with the cost in his last year, namely, 1931.  The Deputy either had not time to study, or did not study, the actual figures.  Within the Land Commission Estimates.  If he did, it is hard to understand how he overlooked certain obvious factors. What is the position?  In the last year of Deputy Roddy's control of Land Commission work, 1931-1932, his vote for the Land Commission was £578,900 and, in that year, there were divided 32,259 acres amongst 1,689 allottees. In 1935-36, last year, our total expenditure <Col N="2388" /> was £1,445,000 but if Deputy Roddy really read, or understood how to read, the Estimates he would find that under sub-head R there was an expenditure of £560,000 paid by the Land Commission to make up the deficiency to the Land Bond Fund in respect of the halved annuities; in other works, the Land Commission is paying the half which the tenants no longer pay.  Under subhead V, there was an additional £9,000 for the same purpose, so that the real position is that, from the amount spent last year, a sum of £569,000 must be deducted to get the amount spent on actual Land Commission work in the comparative sense.</P>
      <P>That would amount to £876,000 against Deputy Roddy's comparative Vote, and, on this amount we divided 102,942 acres amongst 8,070 allottes, in other words, although we did not quite double the expenditure, we divided more than three times the amount of land amongst almost five times the number of allottees.  I dislike making these comparisions, but in view of the comparisions misinterpreted and stated here by Deputy Roddy last evening, I have no alternative but to point to the fact.  I know that figures do not mean everything, but in regard to returns, the figures do mean the actual work which the Land Commission put through. Deputy Roddy was on very unsafe ground in approaching the matter and I was rather sorry to find that he either did not read the Estimates or did not interpret them as Estimates require to be interpreted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Roddy also raised the question of taking over holdings before allotment.  I may say with regard to that that there is no change in policy whatever.  We naturally try to take over land to-day and divide to-morrow. We do not want any loss in revenue for the transition period that might elapse between taking over land and giving it out.  What we invariably aim at is to have acquisition completed a day or so before distribution takes place.  Deputy Roddy raised the question of having the exact figures.  Of course, we have the exact figures, but there is a certain final check made of <Col N="2389" /> those figures before they go into the report, that is, before we allow them to be published as definite and absolute. The figures at the moment are 102,942 acres, which approximates to the 103,000 I mentioned last night.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brodrick and several other Deputies referred to our acquisitions and to information leaking out of the Department with regard to what our intentions were.  I would point out that all our acquisitions are published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and any Deputy can go into the library and see exactly what has been acquired, and he may assume that, if it has been acquired, it is going to be divided.  I do not propose to labour any defence of the Land Commission as regards its alleged Fianna Fáil activities, except to say that, in many parts of the country, I get the usual accusation that nobody can get land in the Land Commission but Blueshirts, and, in other areas, that nobody can get land but Fianna Fáil, the fact of the matter being that they all stand on an equal basis and get a fair run for their money with the Commissioners who decide.</P>

      <P>Deputy Belton dealt with the migration problem, and Deputy Brodrick and the Meath Deputies and Deputy Ben Maguire answered him very effectively.  I am not going to repeat the answer I made on this question yesterday, but Deputy O'Higgins made the plea that these people should be given a chance, and that, I think, is the reasonable spirit in which to approach this problem.  We do not want to bring these people into a certain district and leave them derelict there.  It is an experiment, and an experiment that I think is well worth while, and if one took the trouble &mdash;if Deputies from County Dublin, from County Kildare, County Meath, and all the other midland counties, <Col N="2391" /> took the trouble&mdash;to take a trip down along the western coast, and if they saw the conditions prevailing there and the small farms and the work that is put into these farms, as well as the efforts made by these people, I am sure that they would feel that these people really are a first charge on us to see what could be done for them.  I am not speaking now from the point of view of the development of Irish only; I am speaking only from the social point of view, and I hold that every effort should be made, apart from the Irish language altogether, to do what we can to relieve the position in that congested area.  We have gone to some expense&mdash;some considerable expense&mdash; in doing this job, and we are going on with another experiment.  The first experiment was, as you all know, made up of people from Connemara.  The next experiment will be made up of people from three counties, equally divided into one colony&mdash;from Kerry, Donegal and Mayo.  It will be interesting to see and compare the results of this experiment, and that should be a guide to us in the future.  However, I ask that a fair chance be given to these people.  There is one thing that I may mention here&mdash;and I think it well to take this opportunity of doing so&mdash;and that is that, while we do not want to be in any way repressive on these people, we would be happier if they were allowed to develop as farmers rather than that they should be regarded as, and allowed to develop into, school &ldquo;centres&rdquo; for summer holidays.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of coast erosion.  The position is that the Land Commission may apportion the annuity between the part permanently submerged and the rest of the holding, and the tenant only pays on the part apportioned as &ldquo;the rest.&rdquo;  There is a condition, of course, that the submerging is not due to the fault or the neglect of the tenant.  With regard to the question of giving grants or otherwise for coast erosion, it is not within our Vote and would have to be regarded as a matter of public works or relief works, or something in that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2392" /> Deputy Brodrick raised the question of sports fields and cow parks.  Our experience with cow parks has not been satisfactory on the whole.  We found that, in many cases, we had to break them up again and divide them.  With regard to sports fields, I think that last year we gave away a great many sports fields or allotted them at a very nominal figure so that a hurling ground would be available in the areas concerned. I have not the exact figures at the moment, but these, I hope, will be published later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán MacEoin raised the question of the hardships on people who bought at £6,000 and sold at £2,000.  That is a hardship, but it has not happened in land alone, as most of us know who know anything of the drift that happened after the war and the slump in prices, and so on.  Deputy MacEoin also mentioned that he was interested in the increase in the Vote under sub-head F.  The increase in that Vote is due to the cost of advertising sales of defaulters' holdings, owners' costs of appeals when appeals are upheld, stamping deeds, increase in Estimates largely due to the increased number of appeals, and sheriffs' fees. Deputy MacEoin made a typically frank and decent analysis, with one exception, and that was with regard to the people in the Gaeltacht colony.  However, as that has been discussed adequately, I do not think I need refer to it further.  I have already referred to the question of the houses, which was also raised by Deputy O'Reilly from Meath.</P>
    <P>Well, I think that that has covered the main points and most of the minor points that have been raised in the debate.  I tried to go in some detail into these, because I feel that every Deputy in the country is interested in the work of the Land Commission.  I feel that we had a reasonably good year&mdash;in fact, a very good year&mdash;and I can only hope that it will be maintained and that the work that was done during the year in the division of untenanted land can be maintained.  I should like to stress one point before I conclude, and that is the possibility of concentrating more on the congested <Col N="2393" /> districts.  As I said last night, it is a question of staff, and of an experienced staff, and what I want to do is to try to divide the work and see whether we can spread it as far as possible over the most needy parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister one question before he concludes?  I raised the point of the Halpin case, and I do not think the Minister dealt with it at all in his speech.  The point I raised was the question of the costs which the sheriffs have taken, very improperly, in my opinion, from the persons concerned.  I should like the Minister to give an answer to that.  If the Minister is not in a position to give me a definite answer now, I could put down a question later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I covered that point by my statement that&mdash;as I thought the Deputy should know&mdash;the Land Commission have really nothing to do with what sheriffs' fees are collected. The Deputy, as former Minister for Justice, surely remembers that the control of sheriffs was entirely in the hands of the Minister for Justice, and I am rather surprised that the Deputy has put that question to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to remind the Minister that the decision in Halpin's case was that the sheriff does not act in his capacity as sheriff, but simply as distraining agent for the Land Commission, and is only entitled to a fee of 2/-, whereas they have been charging £1.  I know, of course, that the money has not gone into the coffers of the Land Commission, but still, as it has been coming under the Land Commission, I think it is only natural justice that the Land Commission should return this money.  Otherwise, if there was a series of actions against the sheriffs, the courts would be flooded out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as I have stated, but if the Deputy wishes me to do so, I shall go further into the matter either with the Department of Justice or the Land Commission. However, my advice is that we have nothing to do with, and no control over, the sheriff in these cases.</P>

I have been hammering away at this matter for the last couple of years, and it is not easy to get through our work and to give more attention to correspondence than has been given.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly) Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total net Vote for the year is £154,439 which, it will be observed, is £76,071 below the sum provided last year.  This reduction does not imply that planting operations, or the programme generally, is being curtailed. On the contrary, there is provision made for very considerable expansion. Last year it will be noted that we provided £109,500 for the acquisition of lands for forestry purposes and the unexpended balance of that amount remains in the hands of the Department and will, it is expected, prove adequate for our purchases in the current year.  It may be well to explain that money provided under this sub-head is by way of grant-in-aid and does not revert to the Exchequer at the end of the financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 15,000 acres were acquired during last year, which brings the total acreage available for State forestry up to almost 100,000 acres. This amount would have been considerably greater, but certain temporary difficulties of an administrative <Col N="2396" /> nature arose in regard to the clearing of title.</P>
    <P>The number of forest units is now increased to 69, six new units having been established during the past year, viz.: Stradbally (County Leix), Dromore (Kenmare, County Kerry), Lough Derg (County Donegal), Stranorlar (County Donegal), Glenfarne (County Leitrim), and Baronstown (County Westmeath).  It is hoped that it will be possible to establish an additional new centre in County Sligo during the current year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A, £11,719&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances.&mdash;There is an increase on last year of £915 under this sub-head.  During the year the post of director was filled, and five new posts were created for temporary assistant junior forestry inspectors. These appointees will work under the permanent forestry inspectors and, when they have acquired sufficient practical experience, it is hoped that they will qualify to be absorbed in our permanent inspectorate staff. Provision is made for the expenses of a short course of training abroad for any of them who may merit selection.</P>
    <P>It may not be out of place to mention that these posts were created so that the Department might be in a position to assimilate those who had graduated in forestry through our home universities.  The new director took up duties in November last and is now engaged in getting a detailed knowledge of all the operations of the forestry division and familiarising himself with all the areas, nurseries, conditions, etc., of these throughout the State.  The director, I may say, was chosen by a selection board from about 70 candidates from 12 different countries, and his experience in the German State Forest Service, where he occupied a very important controlling position, should be valuable, not only in expanding forestry operations, but also in ascertaining what can be done in those areas in the west and south which present the real difficulties.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B provides £2,000 for travelling expenses and subsistence allowance.  The amount required under this sub-head is practically the same as last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2397" /> Sub-head C (1), Acquisition of Land, £1,000.&mdash;This may be treated as a token Vote.  As I have already explained, we retain within the Department the unexpended balance of this sub-head.  It represents a Grant-in-Aid and as the accumulated funds under this amount to £118,931, we will have more than sufficient to meet all our needs for the current year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (2), £142,581&mdash;Cultural operations, Maintenance, etc.&mdash;This sub-head is the really significant one of the Estimates, representing as it does the actual development and expansion of forestry operations.  In the provision for this year, the increase is £32,847 above the amount voted last year.  With the growth of operations there is, of necessity, a corresponding increase in the number of foresters and foremen and an increase in the amount of money required for supplies of plants, seedlings, fencing and other essential materials.  It will be noted that increases have been made in the staffs of foresters and foremen, but further increases will be necessary and it is our plan to recruit these from our own trainees.  At the present time we have five trainees in their third and final year; 12 in their second year and 12 in their first year, making 29 trainees in all.  It is from these trainees of our own school that we will secure our future foresters and foremen.  Proposals for further recruitment to be made by the Civil Service Commissioners during the coming year are under consideration.  It will be observed that within this sub-head we estimate and have made provision for £102,500 to be spent on labour alone, of which £22,500 will be allotted to maintenance and the remaining £80,000 for cultural operations.</P>
    <P>The amount required for the purchase of seeds, seedlings and transplants is £12,500, as against £9,000 provided last year.  Whilst it is true that the main sources of supply for planting work are our own nurseries, and whilst these are being extended as quickly as possible, they are not yet adequate to meet the demands of the greater area now being planted.  During the year about 2,000,000 transplants <Col N="2398" /> and 750,000 seedlings were ordered from Saorstát nurserymen who were, however, unable to supply all the requirements of the Department and purchases from outside the country were necessary.  As a matter of fact, last year there was a general shortage of supplies and this considerably restricted us in our planting work.  As a result we were only able to plant an area of 6,400 acres.  This was an increase of 900 acres over the previous year, but was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,500 acres less than we could have planted had plants and seedlings been available.</P>
    <P>Though the Department's nurseries have been more than doubled and are being still further expanded, the effect of the expansion will not be felt for some time, as plants require on the average about three years in the nursery before they can be used in the forest.  Still larger purchases of plants will, therefore, be necessary during the current year to meet the planting programme and plan that has been laid down.  This programme will aim at the planting of 10,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Though a quantity of seed is extracted at home, most of the seed used in the nurseries is imported. Last year's purchases were 12,512 lbs., compared with 6,876 lbs. in the previous year.  Germany (5,180 lbs.), Holland (5,000), Denmark (690); Scotland (600); Canada (502); Austria (300) and United States (240) were our supply sources.  Larger purchases of seed will be necessary during the present year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (3), £2,718&mdash;Timber conversion.&mdash;There is a decrease in the amount required under this sub-head. The Department has two sawmills operating, one at Dundrum, County Tipperary, and the other at Emo, near Portarlington.  The mill at Emo is very small, but the sawmill at Dundrum does a considerable amount of work.  The question of reconditioning this mill is under consideration. As time goes on and our forests are producing standing timber the whole organisation for the proper and economical handling of the produce will require more and more attention.  The Department is fully alive to this <Col N="2399" /> aspect of its work and the necessary plans and provision will be made.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (1), £600&mdash;Grants and advances for afforestation purposes.&mdash; This sum is required to meet the cost of the Department's scheme for grants for planting work by public bodies and private owners.  Payment is made at the rate of £4 per acre, of which £3 is paid as soon as the work has been done to the satisfaction of the Department and the balance of £1 after five years, if the Department is satisfied that the plantation has been properly maintained in the meantime. The total amount has been growing slowly since it was started in 1931 and, though some public bodies have availed of the advantages of the scheme, it is felt that public authorities and private persons might have used it to a much greater extent than they did.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (2), £600&mdash;Arbor Day.&mdash; Arbor Day was held during the month of March, and the same arrangements were made for the supply of plants to schools as in the previous year, when the Arbor Day movement was revived.  The number of schools participating was about 900.  A difficulty which prevents many schools from participating in Arbor Day is that there is no ground available around the school where trees could be planted.  The Department is satisfied that so long as interest in the care and preservation of trees can be stimulated amongst the rising generation the experiment can be justified.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (1), £1,201 &mdash; Forestry Education.&mdash;Under this sub-head money is provided (1) for a scholarship in forestry in the National University, (2) for the special courses held every year for foresters and foremen, and (3) for the cost of the school at Avondale. The forestry school at Avondale was reopened in July last year after having been closed for many years.  The premises have been renovated and a household staff with a matron has been provided.  The arrangements for the housing and care of the trainees and apprentices are very satisfactory and the Department is satisfied that the school will be in a position to give an <Col N="2400" /> adequate training in all branches of forestry.  The school will have from 18 to 21 trainees when in full swing.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (2), £50&mdash;Exhibits at Shows.&mdash;This is a provision for occasional exhibits at various shows where demonstrations of proper methods of planting and occasional lectures on forestry may be given.  Sub-head F, £10&mdash;Agency and Advisory Services.&mdash;This is merely a token Vote.  Sub-head G, £200&mdash;Incidental Expenses.&mdash;The same amount is proposed under this sub-head as last year. It covers cost of telegrams, telephones, advertising of sales of timber, lettings and sundry expenses.  Sub-head H, £8,220 &mdash; Appropriations-in-Aid.  &mdash; This sum represents the estimated income from all sources, the principal source of income being the Dundrum Sawmill, sales of timber and grazing, shooting and cottage rents.</P>
    <P>That covers the various activities of the Department and I am hopeful that the way has now been prepared for a rapid advance and expansion in forestry development.  Whilst I had hoped that the acreage planted last year would have been greater, it will be remembered that, as indicated last year, the primary steps would begin in our nursery development.  As I have already said, it takes a minimum of about three years before the expansion of the nursery results in an expansion of the forest.  It was hoped to make up for this by purchases of seedlings and plants, and we purchased all we possibly could through our own commercial nurserymen at home and as much as we could of suitable plants even from outside the country.  Last year seemed to indicate a general shortage of supplies.</P>
    <P>I have conferred with the director and the technical staff of the Department, and they are reasonably satisfied that, assuming all goes well in our own nurseries and we are able to get the necessary additional supplies of suitable plants, an area of 10,000 acres of planting should be possible during the current year, though this would certainly mean extreme pressure on a staff which needs an increase of trained hands to deal in the ordinary manner with a 10,000-acre programme.  From that on I see no reason why we should <Col N="2401" /> not gradually increase the annual planting programme to approximately 20,000 acres until such time as the necessary amount of national reafforestation is carried through.  I feel that we are well on the way, that our foundations are being well laid, and that it is now a question of time&mdash;time for the nursery development and time for the development of our own technical and scientific forestry staffs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, yesterday we were treated to what seemed to me the rather disagreeable spectacle of the Minister, Senator Connolly, putting on a halo and brushing up his wings.  He became so sanctimonious and virtuous during some of his observations in regard to the Land Commission that I was about to give a signal of my disapproval. Perhaps I might say to the Minister that such exchanges might be avoided if he would learn that amongst the many vices of the members of this House sanctimoniousness is not one, and perhaps I might be allowed to suggest that the Minister would be less irritating if he would model himself on his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who appears here in the role of political buccaneer.  It would be well if the Minister did not give us these exhibitions of his sanctimoniousness.  It is only when the Minister attempts to do so that it is difficult to hear him with patience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister reminds us that he has a very substantial sum on hands.  He told the House that he has actually purchased 15,000 acres this year for the purpose of forestry, and that a further tract is in process of acquisition. Perhaps when concluding he would let us know how many acres he has in mind which he is actually prevented from acquiring owing to legal difficulties. The Minister referred to several new centres of forestry which have been established recently by the Department.  He mentioned two in Donegal, one at Lough Derg and another in Stranorlar.  I expect that Lough Derg does not refer to the place to which people go on pilgrimage.  I take it that Stranorlar is right in the centre of the county, but in a more fertile part of the county than that in <Col N="2402" /> which one would expect activities of this kind might be carried on.  I know that on the occasions when the Minister was approaching Donegal with torchlight processions the people of Donegal were led to believe that forestry would spread widely through the highlands of Donegal.  I understand that there are technical difficulties about the planting of forests on bog lands, and that while one may get a good growth one year, experts tell us that forests planted under these circumstances will perish.  But are not the mountain areas in Gweedore and on the road from Glenties to Gweedore eminently suitable for afforestation? If they are it seems that a great deal of what is now a virtually derelict area might be profitably used for the production of timber, while at the same time it would enhance the scenic beauties of the county.  These new forest lands would lend an added charm to the beauties of this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I think it would not be amiss if the Minister would state the technical considerations that have to be borne in mind when choosing suitable sites for new forests.  There is no doubt whatever that a great many of the public imagine that the more barren any particular piece of land is for agricultural purposes the more suitable it is for forestry.  That as we know is not true, and it would be well to set out what are the essentials of successful forestry and to explain why it is that certain naked tracts of country cannot be clothed with forests owing to the technical difficulties which arise.</P>
    <P>I was much surprised at hearing the Minister setting forth the difficulties about getting seedlings and young trees last year.  I had heard complaints from certain nurserymen that they were willing and ready to supply seedlings and young trees but that they found the Department was extremely anxious to get their supplies from no other source but from their own nurseries.  From what the Minister said to-day it would appear that not only did he exhaust his own nurseries but the commercial nurseries in the Saorstát as well and even then he had to go outside the country.  I shall take occasion to <Col N="2403" /> address myself to the commercial nurseries and ascertain from them whether they could give assistance in the supplying of these seedlings and young trees.  I would be glad if the Minister would tell us now if it is the intention of the Department to extend the Department's nurseries to such an extent as will provide seedlings and young trees that the commercial nurserymen are in a position to supply.  It would be an extremely dangerous thing to spread Departmental nurseries to such an extent that the commercial nurserymen would be cut out altogether.  The commercial nurserymen have occupied a very useful position in the commercial and agricultural spheres of the community's activities.  I suspect they have materially lost in respect of their trade with Great Britain.  That is something over which the Minister for Lands has only indirect control. But such losses as have been suffered might very fairly be compensated for by increasing the Department's purchases from these commercial nurserymen now.  If these nurserymen are fixed with notice that it is the intention of the Government to increase the capacity of their nurseries until the commercial nursery is no longer required, then I think the business of these men might be very seriously interrupted, material damage might be done, and useful employment might be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Government nurseries, if they were very largely expanded now to meet the entire requirements of the Department during an intensive campaign of reafforestation, probably would not require to be so large once the initial stages were overcome. There would be normally a contraction in activities when we got to the stage of doing no more than replacing forests that were cut away.  Therefore, from the point of view of the Government, and from the point of view of the nurseries, it would be undesirable to expand unduly.  I would hope, after we had established forests adequately throughout the State, that for the purpose of replacement we would depend principally <Col N="2404" /> upon the established commercial horticulturists who have been supplying the requirements of forest trees and seedlings for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to sub-head E (2), which deals with exhibits at shows.  I think it is a very desirable departure to conduct propaganda of any kind, such as Arbor Day and exhibits at shows, with a view to encouraging the younger generation to understand the beauty and use of trees and to deter them from irresponsible interference with trees when they come across them.  Has anybody seen the Department of Forestry's exhibit at the Royal Dublin Society Show?  I think there is some small exhibit there at present.  Because, taking that exhibit and the various exhibits of the Department of Agriculture as representing the rural section of the Royal Dublin Society Show, I think a very striking lesson may be learned.  The Royal Dublin Society Show, the Spring Show particularly, was originally a fixture primarily designed to interest the rural community, and the country people from all parts gathered to Dublin for that occasion and saw an exhibition of the most modern equipment, of the experimentation that had been carried on, and of the highest classes of agricultural stock.  It also served the useful purpose of bringing before the city folk the kind of activities going on in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Deputy Lemass became the Minister for Industry and Commere, Deputy Dr. Ryan became Minister for Agriculture, and Senator Connolly became Minister for Lands and Forestry and Gaeltacht Services, and the rivalry began between the industrialist and the agriculturist.  That rivalry has proceeded.  The unfortunate agriculturist has fallen back and fallen back at Ballsbridge, until now you must wend your way through forests of potted meat and aluminium even to see a heifer.  It is one of the most striking things that ever happened in this country.</P>
    <P>I remember five or six years ago if you went to the Spring Show the impression you got was that you were attending an agricultural show. <Col N="2405" /> Everything in the show oriented to its application or impact upon agriculture. Go out there now and it is like a trade exhibition.  Every decent hall is occupied with trade displays.  As I say, you have got potted meat, aluminium, kettles, pots, steel, boots and shoes.  Everybody who wants a tariff is bound to go out and take a stand at the show in order to give the Minister for Industry and Commerce a boost, and the unfortunate Minister for Lands, the Minister for Forestry, the Minister for the Gaeltacht Services, is cowering in semi-darkened rooms at the far end of the grounds, and the poor Minister for Agriculture is chased off the scene altogether.</P>

I deplore that and suggest that he ought to assert himself and that he ought to exhort his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, to assert himself and insist that the important exhibits that they are charged to show shall take pride of place in displays such as the Spring Show is, and that they should insist, if they are to go on exhibiting, that the Spring Show shall revert to its primary purpose of an agricultural display and not as an advertising boost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned the considerations which I thought arose under sub-head E. (2), and I do not wish to trespass on your patience any further than the reference requires. There is one matter which arises out of the appropriations-in-aid here in <Col N="2407" /> connection with which I think the Minister could do really valuable work in the restricted sphere of his Department for the country as a whole. Paragraph 4 of the appropriations-in-aid deals with grazing, shooting and cottage rents.  So far as my information goes a good deal of these cottage and shooting rents arises from lands in the possession of the Department of Forestry which are stocked with game of one kind or another.  I believe that a great many of these lands might very profitably be used, not only to provide shooting amenities for prospective tenants, but also as nurseries for the development of the game population in the particular areas in which they are found.  It is the Minister's duty to render these as attractive as he can with a view to getting revenue from them by way of rents from prospective tenants.  I believe that, within the ambit of that activity, by generously restocking lands over which he has shooting rights which he intends to let, he might confer a great benefit on the whole of the surrounding neighbourhood and develop miniature Scotch moors in the neighbourhood where he holds these lands. This would have the enormous advantage of making a very material contribution to the small holders all around, who might in time take in guests who would come there for the unique free shooting this country provides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>Is this on forestry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on paragraph 4 of the appropriations-in-aid.  The Minister has a number of lands which he lets for grazing, shooting and cottage rents, and derives an income of £800 a year from that.  I suggest he might derive a more substantial income by making that country more attractive. I am not putting that from any narrow point of view of his own Department; but I am suggesting that he might make a greatly increased balance for the Department of Forestry while, at the same time, doing useful service to the district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grouse population could be increased and the woodcock population could be increased.  I do not know whether you could attempt to <Col N="2408" /> increase pheasants because they are an extremely incalculable brood needing very careful preservation.  It may be, perhaps, too extravagant a suggestion. But, so far as grouse and woodcock are concerned, something material could be done.  I am not quite certain whether the woodcock is a migratory bird, and whether technical difficulties would arise in respect of that class of game.  But, certainly, as far as grouse are concerned, valuable work could be done on the moors to make them very much more attractive to sportsmen who would come over here.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that Scottish shooting is mainly a rich man's shooting and attracts Americans able to pay gigantic rents. We have a very substantial English population coming here for free fishing. If we could add rough free shooting I think we would draw a middle class tourist population who would assist very materially to swell the incomes of people living in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself said that he went round the Gaeltacht in the course of his duty as Minister, and that he would fence it in if he could. He would put up a wire fence round it, take the people out of it and forbid anyone to live in it again.  May I suggest such drastic remedies for the Gaeltacht would not be necessary if a programme of evolution rather than revolution is decided upon.  This suggestion of mine would be one for making the present hopelessly inadequate holdings in the Gaeltacht fit to live on.  If people there were enabled to improve their houses by housing grants so as to provide for shooting parties coming from Great Britain or America as they very well might to shoot over the land they would be enriched by such a scheme. The Minister, in introducing this Vote, set a model in brevity.  I wish to follow his example.  I content myself with setting out four or five considerations upon which I would be glad to hear his views when he is winding up this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated on having presented an Estimate towards which Deputy Dillon could address no adverse criticism.  Those of us who have <Col N="2409" /> experience of Deputy Dillon must admit that for the Minister to be able to get to that stage, indicates remarkable efficiency indeed; because if there could be adverse criticism directed towards this Department, Deputy Dillon would be able to do it.</P>
      <P>I rise to ask a question or two in regard to the appropriations-in-aid. First let me say a word in regard to the latter portion of Deputy Dillon's speech as to exploiting tourist resources and sporting rights that might be associated with forestry. There are many people interested in that question who would be entirely in agreement with Deputy Dillon in that, and who believe that there could be an immense amount of development in that respect.  Naturally I hear a lot about that because West Wicklow from Blessington to Baltinglass is one of the areas where forestry has been developed, and where there is considerable sport in the way of shooting. Quite a number of people in that area believe that there could be a big development on the lines Deputy Dillon has described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My real purpose in rising, however, was to ask a few questions with regard to those large sales of timber in connection with which £2,000 is expected to be realised this year, the same amount as last year.  Evidently there is sale of timber apart from the timber utilised at the sawmills. Would there not be a greater return from that timber if sawmills were erected in the vicinity where the timber is ripe for cutting?  Apparently we have this position: That in certain places they utilise the timber that is ripe for cutting in sending it to sawmills; in other places they sell the timber unprepared.  The amount of timber sold in this undressed way is obviously considerable. The sales this year are expected to realise £2,000, the same as last year.  Would it not be advantageous to have sawmills in the vicinity of the area where that timber is to be cut down?  Incidentally, I would like to know from the Minister is that timber being sold at an entirely uneconomic price, or is it expected that these sales will, in time, pay for the cost of growing?  A question one <Col N="2410" /> is often asked is how long it will take the Forestry Department to become self-supporting.</P>
    <P>Further, has the Department in mind, with regard to these supplies of timber, whether there could not be appropriate industries established to utilise such timber?  I think there was, some years ago, an idea that in areas most thickly planted the Department would endeavour, as timber became ripe for cutting, to establish manufactures of wood in close proximity to the areas where timber is available.  Naturally we would like to hear a good deal about the future of the Forestry Department, and the possibility of making the fullest use of the trees grown, so that we may be able to see how far these trees will not merely supply timber for ordinary commercial purposes, but will be helpful in the way of woodwork and woodturning industries similar to what are to be found in forest areas on the Continent. That is, roughly, the question which I was eager to put to the Minister.  In respect of the general Estimate, he is to be congratulated on the considerable progress which has been made in tree-planting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that I am rather a trespasser in this discussion. So far as my county is concerned, and so far as my province is concerned, the Minister for Lands and Forests in the Irish Free State might as well be the Minister for Lands and Forests in Kamschatka.  This is an entirely theoretical matter so far as Connacht is concerned and it is purely theoretical as far as my constituency is concerned.  As there is no hope of an invasion of Connacht, except, possibly, in respect of one of the units of which the Minister spoke, I feel that I can be regarded as an outsider in this debate.  It is interesting once a year for a person like myself to hear that there is a Forestry Department. It is interesting once a year to be made aware that there is a Vote of £154,000 for this Department.  So far as Connacht is concerned and so far as the Gaeltacht is concerned, that is the sole evidence of the existence of the Forestry Department.  Deputy Moore is in a very happy position.  He <Col N="2411" /> can get up here and talk of the lovely trees that are springing up, bit by bit, in County Wicklow.  We are in a completely different position.  I want to know from the Minister when this question of the afforestation of the West of Ireland is going to be seriously tackled.  Why is not the Gaeltacht the first place in which this forestry programme, or any forestry programme, is put in force? It is all very well to say that there are difficulties about planting the Gaeltacht.  There are difficulties about planting every place. If you do not put down the right type of timber it will not thrive.  If you go to some of the most remote parts of Mayo you will see where trees were planted at one time, or where they are now being planted by private enterprise, and where they are flourishing and flourishing exceedingly.  What is the reason for this complete concentration on other parts of the country and this complete neglect of a part of the country which should not be neglected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, I know that poverty is stalking all over the country.  Poverty is stronger and more vigorous&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;in the Gaeltacht than it is elsewhere.  Yet, there can be a considerable amount of money spent in wages in connection with this Department in certain parts of the country and not a single penny spent in those areas which, in my humble judgment, are the areas which should be first planted.  Though I am only theoretically interested in this matter, and will for a considerable time continue to be only theoretically interested in it, still, as a member of the House, I should like to get some information less vague and less indefinite than that contained in the very bald and entirely unsatisfactory statement with which the Minister introduced this Estimate. This is not the first time I have drawn attention to the Minister's method of introducing this Forestry Estimate.  We are told absolutely nothing save that, in a certain area, a certain number of trees were planted.  We are given absolutely no particulars.  Have they any theory on this matter in the Department of Forestry at all?  Are they proceeding like blind men in the <Col N="2412" /> Department or have they intelligences? Are they using those intelligences? Have they any plan?  What particular type of trees are they planting?  Are they planting hard-wood or are they planting conifers and what is the proportion? What is their view as to the subsequent user of the timber they are planting?  No intelligent person plants for this generation.  The man who plants now must plant largely for the needs and wants of 30 years or 40 years hence in the case of certain classes of timber, and for a much further period for another class of timber.  We get no information on that subject.  We want trees and we are planting trees, and one would imagine that the Minister had no idea that there was more than one variety of tree in the world.  I wonder if the Minister knows that there is more than one variety of tree.  Is he able to distinguish between the deciduous and evergreen tree and can he not give us some idea of which class is being planted?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister or his experts formed any views as to the trees which will be required some years ahead? Have they said that there will probably be a demand for larch poles 30 or 40 years hence and that they will put down so many larch?  Have they said that there will be a demand for deal boards and that they will put down so many spruce, or that there will be a demand for Scotch fir for egg boxes? Have they made an estimate of what is the consumption of timber now in this country, and have they arrived at the conclusion that, in all human probability, the same proportion of timbers will be required 30, 40, or 50 years hence?  They should work upon some intelligent basis; but there can be no intelligent basis behind the Minister's policy because he does not seem to have any policy.  He says: &ldquo;I shall try and grow a tree in my nursery.&rdquo;  It does not seem to matter what sort of tree.  If the Minister has any policy he should tell us what he is planting for.  Two years ago, I asked the Minister if he was trying any experiments in regard to the growing of the modern poplars&mdash;the new, quick-growing poplars which created rather a sensation.  I asked whether any of these trees were being <Col N="2413" /> grown in any of his nurseries and what classes of the more modern types of tree were succeeding in this country.  These are questions with which one would expect the Minister to deal in his opening statement if he knew the first thing about his work.  So far as one can gather, the Minister knows nothing about his work.  If he does, he is certainly keeping the knowledge carefully shut up in his own mind.  As was shown by the various statements of the Minister here, he is not a person to hide his own light under a bushel.  We heard him taking credit to himself for the distribution of land although he subsequently had to own that, in that regard, he was a complete outsider and had nothing more to do with any of the reserved services than any member of this House.  Yet he could try to take unto himself yesterday a glory he did not deserve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree. Now I come to the darkness and the obscurities of to-day, which I am contrasting with the light which the Minister tried to seize yesterday.  The darkness of to-day is this, that, if he has any principle at all lying behind the work of this Forestry Department, he has not put that principle forward or let us know what it is.  If there were any such intelligent plan behind the work of the Department, and any intelligent ideas in the Minister's head, I do not think he is the person who would conceal these intelligent ideas in the bald and very unsatisfactory statement he made. He complained that he had difficulties about the title to land in some cases. I do not see how that could have kept back the work of his forestry programme, because he admits that he has got unplanted areas in his possession. Whether or not there are difficulties about title which affect what he will spend two or three years from now, that cannot possibly affect the planting of areas to which title has been made, and that are now vested in fee simple in the Land Commission. He admits that he has not kept up the <Col N="2414" /> pace that he should keep up, and put forward as an excuse that he was unable to get sufficient trees.  He told us of the type of trees he could not get.  If young trees are bought, I cannot see that the cost of 1,000 10,000 or 100,000 would be very high.  If there is to be a steady pace in connection with forestry work, I cannot see the slightest reason why we should not import seedlings over and above the number which we are prepared to grow in any year, or that any nurseries or seedsmen here could grow.  If the difficulty is that seedsmen here cannot at present provide requirements the Department could look forward&mdash;if the Minister ever does look forward&mdash;for two or three years by indicating to nurserymen that they would want supplies of larch, Scotch fir, spruce, ash, beech or oak, and ask them if they would be able to supply them in two or three years' time.  I do not think the Minister would have the slightest difficulty in getting full requirements if that was done.  Even without the home nurseries, I believe full requirements could be got at the present time.  I cannot see what objection there can be, if planting is held up, and if employment is not being given in areas that are ready for the planting of seedlings, to importing 20,000 or 30,000 Scotch fir from the home of the Scotch fir, from some big highland nurseries like Wiseman's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore, to a certain extent, touched upon the appropriations-in-aid. The Minister's statement was very unsatisfactory there.  He should let the House know what the position is.  A sum of £2,000 is mentioned from sales of timber, but that is evidently guesswork, because it coincides with the sum mentioned in 1935-36. We do not know how much actually was received in 1935-36 from sales of timber.  The Minister might tell us what was derived from that source.  Regarding &ldquo;small sales of timber and thinnings,&rdquo; I should like to know what thinnings are being put on the market, what price was got, and what thinnings are coming along.  I should also like to know at what age thinning out is done, and if a profit is made out of it.  Were <Col N="2415" /> the trees that were thinned out ten, 15 or 20 years old, and over what area was the work carried out?  The House would also like to know if the price got for thinnings makes up for the initial cost, and for replanting. That is information that one would expect from the Minister, if he had thought out the problems to which it is his duty to give attention.  I have seldom heard a less satisfactory statement, one that gave less information, than that made by the Minister. Still it is something to know theoretically the result of planting in other parts, so that when our part of the country is planted we may be able to profit by experience derived in areas that are somewhat similar.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise one thing before concluding.  We have heard a great deal too much about the ridiculous suggestion that the Connacht mountains cannot be planted.  The Connacht mountains can be planted. They bore trees at one time.  Where trees grew once they can grow again. Trees have been planted there by private enterprise, even in very small areas, and are doing all right.  Even in the most windswept place in Connacht trees have been planted and are flourishing quite well.  The suggestion that trees will not do on bog land is disproved by experience.  Anybody who goes around the country will notice that a tremendous amount of timber has been cut down.  Indeed the only forestry going on in Connacht at the present time is the cutting down of trees.  The very fine timber that was cut down within the last ten or 15 years indicates that that timber was grown upon bog land. I do not suppose I will get any information from the Minister as to the policy behind the Department, or what its hopes for the future are.  I am asking for the information, but I dare say it is very much like asking for the moon, or really asking for less.  Although it might be difficult to get the moon from the sky, at any rate the moon is existent.  I am afraid unfortunately that the other thing is non-existent.  Even though I am asking for a miracle, for the <Col N="2416" /> production of a non-existent thing, at the same time, it is not bad for the country to know that there is no such thing as a Ministerial plan for forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I also visted the forestry section in the exhibition at Ballsbridge, but unlike Deputy Dillon I had no difficulty in finding it.  Anyone visiting that Exhibition, and examining the charts showing the proportion of timber grown in the various counties, must admit that this is one of the most important Votes we have to consider. There are one or two matters in connection with it to which I should like to refer.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney as to the class of timber we should try to produce. Recently I had occasion to go through woods and to examine quite a large acreage in looking for a certain class of timber.  I found that practically all the spruce had been cut down and the Scotch fir left.  I think it would be advisable that as much spruce as possible should be grown.  It is about the most valuable of the soft woods and I think there is a greater future for it than there is for the Scotch fir.  We have in our area a considerable amount of Scotch fir and we find that it is almost unsaleable. I do not know if sufficient care is taken to control the cutting of timber in the country at the moment.  Portable sawmills are being taken into the woods, and in many cases whole woods have been cut away.  That is a pity because after all if we do not leave a considerable amount of standing timber, the timber we are planting at the moment will not afford sufficient shelter in the country for 20 or 30 years to come.  I think some check should be put on the wholesale cutting of timber which is being carried on at present in various parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that every effort should be made to utilise land for forestry purposes that may be useless for agricultural purposes before we plant timber on land that might be usefully devoted to agriculture.  I have in mind a considerable acreage <Col N="2417" /> of woods planted on ground from which people were evicted 80 or 90 years ago.  The timber which has grown on this land is not the best timber.  Timber grown on land which would be useless for agricultural purposes &mdash; craggy, waste land&mdash;is far better timber.  It appears to be harder and to grow straighter.  Such land appears to give much better results in timber growing than land which could be more profitably devoted to agricultural purposes.  I sincerely trust that every effort will be made to avail for forestry purposes of the land described by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney.  Like him, I should prefer to see the waste areas of the country availed of and every effort made to plant timber on them before the more sheltered and more valuable portions of the country from an agricultural point of view are planted. In many cases the reason given for not availing of such land is that it is too exposed.  Would it not be possible to try an experiment in this matter?  It is rather hard for one who knows very little about agriculture to put forward these suggestions, but it struck me that it would be possible to plant shelter belts first of all.  After a few years, when these shelter belts would be sufficiently high it might be possible to make the land available for the planting of other timber.  I throw this out as a suggestion because I think it has been done in other countries where these wind-swept areas have been made available for planting by these means.</P>
    <P>As to seedlings, when the Minister was speaking it occurred to me that I know a private nursery in my own constituency where seedlings were thrown away.  They were offered to the neighbouring farmers going home in the evening.  They could get all the seedlings that they cared to take home but thousands of them were literally thrown away.  It struck me as peculiar, therefore, that the Minister should have this difficulty about seedlings. This nursery is, I think, still working. When the Minister spoke of the difficulty of getting skilled labour it occurred to me that on many of the estates&mdash;well administered estates in <Col N="2418" /> the old days, where the owners were really interested in forestry and carried it on in many cases on a scientific basis&mdash;you still find skilled men.  You find labourers who are accustomed to planting, and foremen and foresters who are really skilled men.  There is a danger that with the passing away of these estates this skilled labour will also disappear. There is not very much private planting being done at the moment.  If it were possible to get the assistance of these men before they disappear, some of the difficulties experienced in obtaining skilled labour would not arise.  After all, it takes some little time to train competent foresters or even the ordinary man to plant trees.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not present when the Minister made his opening statement on the Estimate. There are just a few matters on which I should like to get some information if the Minister has not already made them clear to the House.  Under sub-head C (1), the Estimate last year was £109,500.  This year it is £1,000.  There is an explanatory note at the bottom of the page to the effect that the balance of the sum voted last year at the 31st March of this year was £109,000.  I do not know, as I say, whether the Minister gave an explanation of that in his opening speech.  If he did, I do not want to go into it now, but I hope it was a satisfactory explanation.  I hope the Minister was able to explain to the satisfaction of the House what change took place in the policy of the Department, which thought apparently last year that it was necessary to provide a sum of £109,500 and afterwards spent only £500 on that particular service.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that that is not so.  Unfortunately I was not here when the Estimate was introduced, but I should be glad to hear the Minister again, if he would be so kind as to make the matter clear <Col N="2419" /> when concluding the debate.  This is, by the way, one of the main services which was to absorb so many of the unemployed in the country.  This was the service, we were told, that could be developed if there was a party in power which had a policy to deal with the afforestation of the country.  We were told that it would be one of the most valuable services we would have so far as employment was concerned. Yet there has been very little increase in the number employed in this service in four years and at the present rate of progress, I am afraid we cannot depend very much upon this particular Department to reduce in any substantial way the number of persons unemployed in the country. Under one sub-head there is an increase of eight, under another an increase of 15 and all the other sub-heads remain the same.  I suppose it would be difficult to give the number of what might be called ordinary labourers employed. That would probably be temporary labour.  There is a round sum given for wages, but so far as I can ascertain from the Book of Estimates, there has been practically no increase in the number of people employed in forestry. There has been no substantial increase, certainly, no increase that would make any impression whatever on the number of unemployed.</P>
      <P>So far as we can see from this Book of Estimates, any activities which the Department may engage in for the coming year are not likely to give much additional employment.  While I am on that question, I would be glad if the Minister would give us an idea as to the wages paid to the labourers employed by the Forestry Department, whether there is a fixed rate of wages or whether the wages paid vary in different parts of the country.  I would also like to know what are the wages paid to the permanent labourers employed by the Department, and the wages paid to the labourers employed temporarily.  I want to call the Minister's attention to sub-head C (3), and to protest against the wages set out there as the wages that are being paid to those in charge of the sawmills: those who are doing the actual sawing in that mill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I think, has some personal <Col N="2420" /> knowledge himself of the work that has to be performed in a sawmills. He knows that it is hard work and, sometimes, dangerous work, particularly when the sawmills are in a wood or a forest where timber of all shapes and sizes is brought to the mill, and has there to be handled and squared before being converted into scantlings of different sizes.  That, as I have said, is not only hard and laborious work, and to an extent dangerous work, but it is skilled work. As the Minister knows, it is only skilled men who will get the full value out of a piece of timber that is brought into a sawmills.  In view of that, does he consider that 35/- a week is a sufficient wage to pay to men who are performing that class of work?  Would the Minister also tell us how the wages paid in the Department's sawmills compare with the wages paid to men in the same trade who are employed in sawmills run by private owners? So far as I know, the wages paid by the Department are considerably lower than the wages paid to men in the same trade in outside employment.  If we are to take it&mdash;and we have to take it as it is set out in this book of Estimates that 35/- a week is the inclusive rate&mdash;that the Department consider that a sufficient wage to pay the men performing the type of work that I have referred to, then we must conclude that the wages paid to the ordinary labourers, to the men felling, carting and cleaning timber must be very low indeed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has the figures available, I would be glad to have information from him as to the number of trees planted in Tipperary during the last year, and also whether the Department are still insisting that the minimum number of acres which may be taken over by it for planting is 200.  That used to be the regulation, but I do not know whether the Department is adhering to it or not.  If they are, I think it is time that they departed from it, because there are many places in the country covering not, perhaps, quite 200 acres which, in my opinion, could be very usefully planted both from the scenic point of view and the point of view of getting ahead with reafforestation in the country. <Col N="2421" /> I would also like to have information from the Minister as to what extent, if any, the replanting of trees is being insisted on in the case of persons who get permits to cut down timber.  I am afraid that requirement is not being observed at all, certainly not to any great extent.  Even at the present time a considerable number of trees are being cut down in the country, and I am not at all sure whether permits are obtained in every case.  I do not know whether the law in that respect is being enforced.  The position would not be so bad if people were made comply with the law and replant a tree for every one they cut down.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk as to the classes of timber that the Department should concentrate on having grown in the country.  We must assume that the officials of the Department are good judges of the classes of timber that are most suitable for growing here, and that are likely to give the best and the quickest results.  At this time, when we hear so much talk about self-sufficiency, we ought, when considering the classes of timber that are being planted, to have our eye on the day when we will be able to produce here at home all the different classes of timber that will be required for whatever woodwork has to be done.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he has given any directions to his Department in that respect?  Some of the timber that is being grown in the country is practically useless except for firewood, and some of it is not even good for that.  If hard woods can be grown in the country, and grown successfully&mdash; it is doubtful, I think, whether they can be grown in a general way successfully&mdash;the Minister ought to let us know to what extent hard woods can be grown, and to what extent his Department are being advised as to the necessity for planting and growing them.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, I would like to have an explanation from him in regard to what I consider the low wages that are being paid for the class of work that is being done in the sawmills and also as to the rate of wages paid to the general body of <Col N="2422" /> workers employed by the Forestry Department.  Would he also say whether he is in a position to tell us if it is likely that his Department will require a greater number of men this year in dealing with the activities of the Department than they did last year, and, if so, what is the extra number of men that he hopes to be able to give employment to in the coming 12 months?</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in winding up his rather critical speech, made the remark that the opening statement of the Minister was unsatisfactory.  I would like to know, incidentally, what statement of any Minister under any possible circumstance, or set of circumstances, would be satisfactory to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney? No doubt that question has not much to do with timber, but still I think it is relevant.  Now, I would like to pay a tribute to the Minister.  The charge of vagueness has been levelled against him.  I think there is no man in this House less deserving of having that charge made against him.  I think he is as direct as any man could possibly be.  By training and tradition he is admirably fitted with those qualities of incisiveness which ought to mark the occupant of the Ministry of Lands and Forestry. I sympathise with him.  He meets with very great difficulties in his present post.  Deputies are sometimes asked, for instance, to get certain areas planted.  They are deluged with inquiries as to whether this or that area can be planted, and they are rated in no uncertain terms by people who want those areas planted.  We all know that lands which are generally allocated for forestry are not so good for anything else.  Very good land does not grow good timber, and very medium quality and stony land certainly grows the best quality timber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average Deputy&mdash;I take it for granted the same is true on all sides of the House&mdash;is faced with certain difficulties.  When a constituent asks him to get a certain area planted and he puts that proposition to the Minister for Lands, and when the Minister for Lands in turn tries to make arrangements with the very <Col N="2423" /> people who want the areas planted, he is met with the most extraordinary and in some cases with the most ludicrous difficulties.  It is marvellous how shingly, stony land, which is only fit for growing timber, land which is numbered by thousands of acres in every county in Ireland, quickly becomes valuable when the Minister for Lands wishes to acquire it.  Land which people are only too ready to get rid of in order that they will not have to meet the burden of the annuities payable on it, and in order that they will not have to pay the rates on it, land which is practically worthless in those people's eyes, develops a marvellous value when the Government sets its eye on it with a view to planting it, although the people who live in those areas have been most insistent in their demands for planting up to that.  I do not know how far the legal difficulties could be got over, but certainly when one is acquiring land the difficulties connected with title seem to be almost insuperable.  When the Government is acquiring large areas of land for the purposes of forestry, if there were some way in which the settlement of legal difficulties could be expedited to a greater extent than they are in ordinary transactions, it would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>As I say, my sympathies are with the Minister.  He is more than anxious and more than willing to do certain things, but the very people who put up propositions are the people who make matters hard for him afterwards.  As regards the quality of timber, it is not for the ordinary layman to interfere with the work of the Department of Lands and Forestry, who must be presumed to know their own business.  I think, however, that the prevalence of coniferous timber in this country, whilst it is valuable and whilst it comes to maturity very quickly, is not a good thing.  Planting of any kind must be looked at as a long-term investment, but as well as the monetary value attached to those things, there is also the cultural value.  If, instead of the old deciduous timber, the Irish ash and elm and oak, there is nothing but groves of coniferous trees studded over the country, I take it that our successors <Col N="2424" /> in time to come will see nothing but a miniature Switzerland, dotted with chalets here and there, with red concrete tiles and that kind of thing. I think the Irish oak and ash, with the farmhouses nestling peacefully amongst them, were much more in conformity with our landscape.  I think the presence of coniferous timber, although it matures very quickly, would not be a good thing in our Irish landscape if it preponderates too largely.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney spoke rather naïvely about timber not maturing for at least 30 years.  I do not want to misquote him.  As a matter of fact, I think everyone knows that people who plant larch trees can in 15 years' time hope to reap the result of their labours.</P>

      <P>I think no person need be deterred by that from planting timber, individually or collectively.  On the question of green timber, I should like to know from the Minister if any special provision has been made for growing ash by itself.  When we speak of green timber and mention ash in relation to it I think we are mentioning the most important deciduous&mdash;I think that is the correct term&mdash;timber of the lot.  There is a great scarcity of ash in the country now, and that is becoming more marked of recent years owing to the athletic activities of the G.A.A., who use terrific quantities of ash.  Without becoming in any way technical, I need hardly remind the House that in the manufacture of hurleys, or camáin as they are properly known, there is only one timber which could possibly be used, and that is ash. Nothing else is a substitute.  The supply of ash is becoming depleted more rapidly than anyone would deem possible, and I think if plantations of ash are laid down&mdash;possibly they are, for all I know&mdash;it would be as good an <Col N="2425" /> investment as possible for the future athletic welfare of the youth of Ireland. It is not a luxury; it is a necessity. I know it takes a long time to mature, but a beginning must be made some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kehoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose you would knock a couple of camáin out of it in about 10 or 12 years, although that is too slow, judging by the rate of demolition which any Deputy in this House can see if he pays a visit to Croke Park on any Sunday.  I think that if the Department could possibly arrange for lectures on forestry to be given in the schools throughout the country it would do a lot to make Ireland more tree-conscious.  No Ministry or no Government can help in this matter unless the populace at large are made tree-conscious.  In comparison with our neighbours across the Channel and elsewhere we are sadly lacking in that way.  We are not to blame, of course, because it is a legacy from an imperial legislature.  There is no doubt at all about that.  Those Gaelic Leaguers in the House who have heard the good old ballad, &ldquo;Seán Ua Duibhir a Gleanna,&rdquo; know that that lament arose out of the hearts of those who saw trees being felled in order that the houseless and homeless of the time would fall an easy prey to the English soldiery of that day.  Not alone in cutting the woods did they commit a flagrant crime, but they destroyed our national continuity to such an extent that the ordinary virtues, such as pride of culture in the sense of forestry, and other ordinary virtues of that kind, are largely missing from our Gaelic make-up of to-day. That is another thing for which we have to thank our friends across the Channel.  Our national continuity was destroyed.  Events such as have been alluded to by a Deputy here, where seedlings were given to different farmers and they did not plant them, would be impossible in an Ireland whose national continuity had not been checked.  I think it is the duty of the Department to build up that continuity <Col N="2426" /> as far as possible by giving lectures on forestry, showing lantern-slides in the schools and adopting other suggestions which no doubt will occur to the present Minister.</P>
      <P>With regard to the cutting of timber, I think a good deal of trees are cut and that there is no subsequent planting. Deputy Morrissey is quite accurate in that; trees are felled surreptitiously.  Of course it is the function of the Gárdaí to detect that. and I take it that if their attention is drawn to the matter, and pressure is brought to bear on them, they will spend more of their spare time in attending to it.  Of course in certain parts of the country there have been tragedies in regard to tree-felling, with no subsequent planting, which certainly would not occur in any other country in the world.  The only fault. I have to find with this Estimate is that there is not enough money allocated.  I presume there is a reason for that.  As I say, the Department know their own business.  This planting, after all, is the best long-term investment any country can have. Minor relief schemes, factories, and all those things, while excellent in their way, will not fill the rôle which planting and forestry will fill, because the day will come when it will be extremely valuable.  I think the House is at one on this subject.  It is a most gratifying symptom which does not often occur.  Unquestionably, there is a shortage of timber, and I am sure the Department are doing their best to make up that shortage in every way; but &ldquo;if all wood fail,&rdquo; we shall only have to fall back on the Opposition for material!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister if he has any scheme of planting for County Cavan?  I think that no county in Ireland is worse off in this respect.  During the period of the troubled times, promising plantations, scattered fairly generally throughout the county, were cut away. They were not much use to anybody, but since they have been cut away, the sites of these plantations are eyesores, and many districts are suffering from lack of shelter.  Cavan is a wind-swept county with high hills, especially <Col N="2427" /> in the western area, and there is a lot of inferior land which suffers by reason of want of protection from a timber belt.  I think the Minister should consider some scheme for planting these districts.  If the particular sites cannot be taken over for the purpose of afforestation, I suggest there should be some scheme to encourage the occupiers or owners to plant them.  The Minister should see that they be encouraged in some way to plant these waste lands, because they are not much good for anything else.</P>
      <P>The whole county feels the loss of these young woods which have been cut away.  Every part of Cavan is denuded of timber, and there is a great shortage of timber, and I suggest that the people should be encouraged to sell any of the matured timber that does exist; but the Minister should see to it that, when that timber is cut and sold, it is replaced by planting more than they cut down.  By doing that, the Minister would be serving a double purpose, because there is a shortage of timber and a shortage of young plantations.  What he should do is to encourage the planting of young timber and the cutting of the old, matured timber.  I know that, scarce as timber is, there is some timber which is becoming absolutely useless, because it is too old, and it would be a mistake to discourage the cutting down of such timber.  What is wanted is more general planting of young timber. Cavan is in a bad way in that respect, and I would ask the Minister to consider that carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 200 acre limit, I do not know if there is such a limit, but I think it is entirely too high. It may not be economical for the Minister's Department to undertake the planting of small areas, but if smaller areas were planted at shorter distances apart, they could be used as one plantation.  If 50 acre sites were taken up for planting purposes, within a reasonably short distance of each other, I believe it would be much more beneficial to the community generally, because shelter is very <Col N="2428" /> important and has a great effect on the climate of a district, and especially a mountainous district.  Parts of West Cavan are very mountainous, and they would require a large distribution of plantations.  One 200 acre plantation would not be one-quarter the benefit that four 50 acre plantations would be in a district.</P>
    <P>With regard to the quality of timber, I think larch would be very useful. There is one thing about larch&mdash;it comes into use in a very short time. In nine or ten years it is fit for general purposes, such as ladder poles and other purposes.  It is a hard timber that comes in early, and the thinning gives room to the rest to come on. It should be freely used in every young planting.  Another matter which I have learned from people who know more about timber than I do is that larch is not suitable for every sort of land, so that the quality of the land should be taken into account.  I need not stress that point, because I am quite sure the Minister has experts to advise him on such matters.  There are other rocky lands which are incapable of growing larch at all, and such timber could be left out of that sort of land whenever planting is carried out on them. There are other classes of land of an inferior sort, however, which will grow very good larch, and larch should be planted on such land, and the private people who are planting plantations should be encouraged to grow larch, mixed with other classes of timber, on such lands.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not forget County Cavan, because it is a hilly and very bare county which needs attention.  There is a great deal of unemployment there, and the provision of plantations would serve to relieve that unemployment to some extent, and would also be doing something to shelter the land of the county. It would also provide timber in the future.  It is actually very scarce at the moment, and it will continue to grow scarcer from year to year unless a scheme of planting certain areas is undertaken by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to see afforestation on a big scale, and, in my <Col N="2429" /> opinion, a much larger area of land should have been acquired than has been acquired for this purpose.  As against that, I realise that the Department was faced with certain difficulties, some of which have been referred to by Deputy Kehoe, such as people failing to agree on the prices offered, and other such difficulties.  The blame can be shared equally by those people and by the Department.  So far as our county is concerned, we were amazed to find that certain areas, which everyone regarded as being suitable for afforestation, had been adversely reported on.  I understand that one of the arguments put forward was that, by reason of certain acids in the soil, and one thing and another, these areas were not suitable for afforestation.  As against that, we can point out that extensive afforestation was carried on over these same areas in previous years.  These plantations were destroyed during the Great War period, thousands of acres being cut down and exported to England and other countries.  If that type of land was suitable for afforestation purposes over a century or two centuries, how is it that they are now adversely reported on?  I can state, with the knowledge I have of those areas, that some of the finest larch in Ireland, or probably in any other country, has been grown on these mountain sides and certain valleys between the mountainy districts in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the Minister has acquired the services of an expert who has a wide and varied knowledge of afforestation, we hope that our county will benefit by the scheme and that we will get special consideration.  I appeal for special consideration because our county is very suitable for afforestation purposes.  The climatic conditions down there are very suitable.  The mountain slopes are sheltered and, in my opinion, are second to none in this country. Perhaps I might be excused for referring particularly to one point, and that is that on the south coast of Kerry we have semi-tropical plants, and the only other place in the British Isles where you have a similar area, or an area that could produce such plants, is <Col N="2430" /> in south Cornwall.  Yet they tell us that our county is not suitable for afforestation purposes.  I think that this matter should be investigated again.  I believe that in certain areas the Minister should have compulsory powers to acquire land for afforestation purposes.  The scheme, as it stands at the moment, could not be suitable for counties like County Kerry.  When I say that, I mean that an area of land, to be economical and to be regarded as suitable for afforestation purposes, is taken to be a 300-acre plot, but in so far as certain portions of our county are concerned, that is impossible because of the nature of the county.  It would be difficult, for the most part, to get a 300-acre belt of land there, and I would suggest as an alternative that the Minister, if it were possible, should get the Department to agree to a grouping of areas; for instance, that there would be a fair-sized plot, provided it is otherwise suitable, of 100 acres or thereabouts, and that, within a radius of three or five miles, other plots could be worked in with it as a group, making a total of 300 or 400 acres.  To my mind, that would be suitable to mountain areas, and it would also be economical.  I would submit that to the Minister, so far as our county is concerned.</P>
    <P>We in Kerry certainly looked forward, not alone to this year, but for years back, to the hope that afforestation would be especially suited to our people.  Through our position, we are not able to avail of the industrial programme in this country.  As was said by an expert in the Department of Industry and Commerce, Kerry is at the dead end.  He meant that Kerry was not suitable or central enough as a distributing centre.  That meant, of course, that our hope of having a factory or some big commercial or industrial enterprise was very remote. Therefore, in view of all these factors, schemes such as the afforestation scheme are our great hope and outlook.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to know what has been done in regard to an area of land in South Kerry which I think has been taken over, or is about to be taken over, by the Minister's Department for afforestation purposes. <Col N="2431" /> I refer to the Colonel Hood estate.  I agree with what Deputy Kehoe said in regard to the people.  We have done our part as representatives of the people in so far as we have tried to induce every person with a parcel of land, that we thought would be suitable, irrespective of politics or anything else, to co-operate with us and assist us in availing of the afforestation schemes, but when inspectors came along, we found that these people, as Deputy Kehoe pointed out, suddenly advanced their prices and raised objections one way or another.  That, to my mind, is one of the big factors that has held us up.  The reason that I suggest that the Minister should have compulsory powers to acquire land for afforestation purposes is that, in certain areas where land is not suitable for afforestation purposes, but where there is a certain estate&mdash;there are two or three estates in our district, such as the Lord Kenmare estate, the McGillycuddy estate, and one or two others&mdash;and where we cannot find land suitable for afforestation purposes, the Minister should have powers to acquire compulsorily these lands from these vested interests or from the representatives of whatever landlord is concerned. I think that the same system should apply in that case as in the case of acquiring land for other purposes. and that the same system of compensation should apply.  It would serve a very useful purpose because, otherwise, a very useful afforestation scheme in that part of the county would be lost to the county.  Then, when other plots or holdings would be rejected, the Minister and the Department could come along and acquire these very suitable areas for afforestation purposes.</P>
    <P>I know myself that the Minister and the Department are up against tremendous difficulties, and as far as we are concerned we will try to make constructive suggestions so as to help the Minister and the Department.  We find, however, that in those areas the people themselves are to blame to a great extent.  They put up all kinds of objections in regard to rights of way and so on&mdash;objections of one kind or <Col N="2432" /> another&mdash;and thereby the whole scheme is held up.  I appeal to the Minister to have, at the earliest possible moment, a re-survey in regard to some of the areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>If this debate proceeds much longer the Minister, I am afraid, will be left completely in the wood.  It would be a very good advertisement for forestry if the House could be removed to Ballsbridge as part of the advertisement the Department have out there.  I feel somewhat like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on this Vote, but, unlike him, I am not completely without hope.  Deputy Dillon wanted to know the technical difficulties in the way of growing timber on bogland.  Is Deputy Dillon so innocent as all that, to be quite content with an explanation from the Minister or the Department as to what is the technical difficulty in growing timber on bogland? I do not suppose there has been a year since the House was instituted when some Deputy was told of those technical difficulties.  I do not want to say all the harsh things I could say in that connection.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have spoken from the Government Benches have been extremely kind to the Minister.  I remember that at the last two general elections afforestation was part of the plan.  Fianna Fáil were to employ all the unemployed; they were to keep them from emigrating.  The hillsides in my own constituency were to be covered with these men and no more would their eyes turn west to the Atlantic.  So infatuated did people become in connection with this portion of the Fianna Fáil policy that flappers were visualising that in a few years they would be walking through the forests, that they would be in a perfect dreamland.  As a matter of fact, I heard of people who had long passed the flapper stage perorating on the great advantages of afforestation. Whatever their views are now I do not know.  The flappers have got a few years older and the older ones have got still older and the only regret is that this policy was not even partially applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will say that the main objection even to partially <Col N="2433" /> planting a constituency like mine is because the mountains run from east to west.  I should not be surprised if he suggested to me that I should undertake the work of turning them round and making them run north to south so that he would have one side of the mountains sheltered in order to grow wood.  If I went to the trouble of turning the mountains he probably would tell me that I had not done it correctly, that there was some flaw and he could not proceed with the work. The fact is that we have these difficulties so far as the whole range from Donegal to Cork is concerned.  From the Department's angle the mountain ranges run from east to west and hence neither side is sheltered.  The Department tell us that timber cannot be grown on bogland and hence the policy of afforestation, which was to absorb the unemployed in this country, has disappeared.  The Department has landed itself in the County Wicklow, down in the dells of Avoca, down with Deputy Moore.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said with regard to the whole Western seaboard seemed rather overdrawn, but as a matter of fact it is literally true. The Minister said that they planted two nurseries in my constituency, one at Pettigo and one at Stranorlar.  They have done so.  As regards Stranorlar, they have taken over portion of the demesne land attached to the mansion house on the Drumboe estate, and they are planting trees there.  But that does not get us anywhere.  There were many more trees on the Drumboe estate prior to the period when it was taken over.  I am not suggesting that the Department should have prevented the cutting of the timber, but it is regrettable that the piece of land along the River Finn should have been denuded of its trees.  In former years it was a most beautiful piece of scenery, but now it is a horrible sight. I raised this matter before, and the Minister said it would cost too much to prepare the land for replanting.  I wonder is it going to remain an eyesore much longer?  It was a beautiful piece of scenery when the timber was there, but now it is a wretched, barren area.  One would think that huge bombs had been dropped on that area, so badly torn up is the place.  What <Col N="2434" /> will the Department do with it?  Are they going to leave it an eyesore?</P>
    <P>With regard to the technical difficulty of growing timber on bogland, it is quite useless for any technical adviser to tell me that timber cannot be grown on bogland.  I do not accept that.  Let the Minister put aside his technical advisers and try it.  I spent my life mostly on bogland.  I spend all my holidays on the bogs, over the moors.  Anybody who knows anything about these places is aware that it is quite possible to grow timber there. Let me recall the statement in the Government advertisement for turf about the period when the elk roamed over this country.  It is evident that very good and very large timber then grew in these places.  How did that occur?  Anybody who knows anything about the bog areas from Donegal to Kerry knows that huge timber at one time grew there.  Was it because the elk disappeared that the timber disappeared and that the land became no longer fit for growing timber?</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that it means work, but everything means work.  Of course it means draining these places, but the Government at least should do what they promised to do.  The people got enthusiastic about tree-planting, and everybody would like the thing to be done.  At the last two elections the Government came along with an oratorical campaign about afforestation, and everybody was glad.  The oratory has disappeared, but have the promises been kept?  Apparently nothing at all is to be done.  So far as Connaught is concerned, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that the Department might as well not exist.  He says the whole thing is purely theoretical.  Is not that a terrible reflection on the promises that were made to these people?  Is the Minister going to do anything for the large area along the Western seaboard? I am not so innocent or foolish or fantastic as to suggest that along that portion of the seaboard immediately affected by the Atlantic storms you can grow timber.  I know that that would be quite impossible; the trees would never come to anything But inland it is a different matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little raised the question of game.  There are one or two things <Col N="2435" /> which I would like to know about that £800 Appropriations-in-Aid from rent, shootings, grazings, etc.  I take it that since that calculation was made further areas that had been game shoots were taken over by the Department and are now about to be planted.  I am dealing with areas that had been planted in the past, those taken over last year as well as those about to be taken over. The Department is taking rents for them.  I would like to know from the Minister what service is being given for those rents?  Is it a question merely of taking rents and doing nothing at all about the preservation of those shoots?  Has that aspect of it been completely neglected?  Are gamekeepers being paid to see after those places, and are the vermin being exterminated?  I am asking these questions because possibly the Department may be overlooking that aspect of the matter.  The Department is taking over huge tracts, and if the game is not looked after we might find that in the course of a few years the entire game value of the place might be destroyed.  I suggest to the Minister and to the Department that attention might be paid to that aspect of the matter if it has not been paid already. I know they are taking over thousands of acres in the midst of valuable shoots belonging to other people.  When these places are taken over they are very heavily wired so as to prevent trespass on the plantations.  From that it follows that nobody except the foresters can enter there.  Such places might become a very safe preserve for the vermin in the forestry area itself as well as in the surrounding area.  Under these circumstances there would be the danger that in a few years the vermin would rapidly increase owing to the shelter given there, and thereafter their eradication would be very difficult.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question raised by Deputy Dillon of the stocking of those planted areas with game, I foresee some practical difficulty, not in the immediate future but later on.  Grouse can live on these areas for probably eight or ten years but after that time they will disappear because by then <Col N="2436" /> the trees will be too high.  Small red game from Norway would need to be brought in there.  The main question at the moment is that while the Department are taking rents for the shoots, it should do something in the way of protecting the game and it should be active in the destruction of vermin.  I hope that the inauguration of those two nurseries in my constituencies will be followed up with the inauguration of at least an attempt to see what can be done about those boglands on the sheltered side of the mountain, the lands that run from north to south irrespective of those running from east to west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with Deputy Kehoe in making a plea to the Minister that in all planting schemes of the Forestry Department a fair proportion of the trees planted should be ash.  The national pastime is dependent on the supply of hurleys for the youth of the country. As the game of hurling is becoming increasingly popular the quantity of ash required for the manufacture of <i>camáin</i> will increase as the population increases and as the game grows in popularity.  Representations on this matter have been made by the G.A.A. to the Minister whose attitude has been more than sympathetic.  I wish to emphasise the plea that was made by Deputy Kehoe and to reinforce the representations made by the G.A.A. I hope these representations will have the desired effect and that the officials of the Forestry Department will meet the wishes of the national organisation in this important matter.  There is a good deal of employment given in the manufacture of hurleys.  Ash is a very profitable timber and, from the point of view of giving employment in small industries here and there through rural Ireland in the manufacture of hurleys, there is a prospect of this becoming a useful national asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy McGovern to the 300-acre area which the Forestry Department regards as the base for planting operations in a district.  In many counties there is little difficulty in procuring the 300 statute acre area base.  But if small <Col N="2437" /> parcels of land in the immediate vicinity can be acquired, they could be worked by the forester in charge of the larger area.  I know from experience that it is not very economical to start forestry planting operations on an area of less than 300 acres if it can be avoided, but there are special circumstances and conditions sometimes obtaining in some counties which give force to the view-point expressed by Deputy McGovern.  I trust the Minister will give that its deserved consideration.  In some counties there is little difficulty in acquiring sufficient land.  In many places it is readily available and easily obtainable and there is no difficulty regarding the price.  People know the maximum price paid by the Department for land acquired for forestry.  As far as Kilkenny is concerned, there seem to be long delays in respect of the acquisition of forestry land by the Department in the past two years.  I know there are the usual legal formalities, such as securing title and so on.  I hope that steps will be taken to expedite the handing over of these lands to the Department so that planting operations may proceed more quickly. As we know, tree planting improves the climate and it increases the national wealth.  In addition, forestry operations have a very large labour content &mdash; practically 100 per cent. labour content, and the money that is involved in the acquisition of land for planting schemes generally goes back to the people and circulates amongst them.</P>
    <P>One reason why planting is not proceeding as quickly as some Deputies, and perhaps the Minister, would wish is because of the insufficiency of the supply of young stock.  That brings us to the establishment of nurseries. Judging from Deputy McMenamin's speech, I take it that it is the intention of the Department to establish nurseries in Donegal and in other parts of the country.  I am aware that a nursery has been established in Kilkenny.  It is very necessary to get seedlings and young stock.  I suggest that the Minister and the Department should concentrate immediately on the provision of nurseries, so that planting will go <Col N="2438" /> ahead at a reasonably rapid rate and that the programme laid down by the Department will be got through within a reasonable time.  References were made to the planting of some good land in Kilkenny County.  I made representations to the Department in respect of Castlemorris, and the reason they gave was that a nursery was being established there, that the parcels of good land in the Castlemorris demesne&mdash;the portions remaining with the house; the remainder was divided some years ago&mdash;were in and out through wooded portions and, consequently, it was not possible to distribute them amongst the neighbouring people who were looking for land, some of them perhaps uneconomic holders.</P>
    <P>I ask that the land which is so readily available in so many counties, particularly in County Kilkenny, should be acquired as quickly as possible, and that the legal difficulties which, apparently, stand in the way, should be got over with as little delay as possible.  As to the planting of a reasonable proportion of ash in all planting schemes, I know that will have the sympathetic consideration of the Minister and his Department.  I have nothing further to add, as this matter has been discussed at length and every aspect of it has been taken into account, and I know of the interest which the Minister takes in afforestation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the decrease in the amount of land proposed to be taken over this year and which is explained in the footnote that the Minister must have been confronted with unforeseen difficulties in the acquisition of land.  Forestry is a matter in which every Deputy is deeply interested, and there is considerable disappointment that there has not been more advance made.  Various difficulties lie in the way, but eventually this Government or their successors, or somebody else, will have to remove those difficulties, as they will have to be got over.  The basic 300-acre tract for forestry will eventually have to be departed from in some way.  The Minister and his Department, in my opinion, ought to direct their attention <Col N="2439" /> to finding a scheme which they can work, even though they do depart from that.  There are various tracts of land all over the country of from 50 to 100 acres that certainly ought to be planted.  It would, of course, increase the national wealth and improve the amenities of the country; it would possibly lead to better health and would, generally, be a great asset to the country.  Sooner or later that will have to be got over and perhaps the Minister and his officials will be able to set their minds to it and get over it.</P>
      <P>Another matter which has impressed me for a long time is that there are various hillsides in this country and other spots which would be picturesque if they were planted, and which are calling for plantation.  Possibly the acreage that would allow of planting would be small, but I know farmers who would be willing to give five or ten acres to be planted by the Department. I know the Department give a grant of a certain amount for plantation purposes, but it is not sufficient to meet the expenditure.  The Minister may say in reply that, if the trees are eventually to become the property of the farmer who gives the land, he ought at least to bear some of the expenditure on plantation.  The Minister or his successor, however, will realise that if this is to be done the State will have to do it.  After all, the farmer is giving up the use of a particular portion of his land.  It has struck me for a long time that this is something that ought to be done by the Forestry Department.</P>
      <P>We have in the neighbourhood of various towns all over the country hillsides, bogland, and quite good land, ten or 12 or 20 acres of which would be freely given by the owner to be planted.  Of course, I do not mean that he would hand over the ownership of the land to the Land Commission, but if they planted it and fenced it in, he could become the caretaker.  That is a thing that, in my opinion, will have to be done sooner or later if we are going to make this country what it ought to be, and I would specially recommend the matter to the Minister for his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2440" /> My attention was drawn recently to a district in the parish of Ballinlough, near Clonfad in the County Roscommon. The parish priest asked me if I could draw the attention of the Forestry Department to that district. I understand that there are about 200 acres of land there which, in the opinion of the Land Commission officials, are available for planting, but the Department, because it does not come up to the standard of 300 acres, will not touch it.  If we are to pass over 200 acres of land here, 250 acres in another place, and so on, and do not try to get it we will never get on with forestry.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to continue to insist on 300 acres as the basis of any forestry scheme, or if he intends to depart from that.  Of course, if you want to go in for forestry in a big way you will have to plant big tracts and put a forester in charge of them.  That is the Minister's idea and was the idea of his predecessor.  Sooner or later, however, you will have to get away from that, because you will not get these big tracts to plant.  Every mickle makes a muckle we are told, and if we did accept small portions of land, in my opinion in a very short time we would have this country in a fair way as far as forestry is concerned.  I recommend these points to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I can follow accurately all the different statements made and all the different queries made.  I will pass over altogether, I think, the remarks made by Deputy Dillon, mainly because I doubt if they were seriously meant, or, if seriously meant, that they ought to be seriously taken.  The questions that he raised, so far as they were relevant, I had already more or less but not completely dealt with in my opening statement.  I stated that supplies were sought from nurserymen in this country, that all the available supplies of the type we wanted were bought, and that we went outside this country to buy more, and exhausted what was available not only in Great Britain&mdash;mainly in Scotland&mdash;but also in Denmark and Sweden.  We got a <Col N="2441" /> considerable supply of plants from Germany which we would have difficulty in getting only that our new Director had contacts there.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon and several other Deputies raised the question with regard to the expansion of our own nurseries.  It is the usual policy of State Forestry Departments to raise the plants in their own nurseries, the main reason being that the foresters know exactly what they produce; they know the quality, and they know that in planting out their own stuff they are taking less risk than planting what was imported.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies referred to the question of the acquisition of land. I make no apology for the small quantity acquired so far.  There is no need for an apology, because we had acquired more land than we could hope to plant.  Coming to the previous figures, we took only this particular £1,000 token Vote under the sub-head for the purchase of land.  That was due to the fact that we had £109,000 last year, and we have a rise in our funds up to £118,000.  That money does not revert back to the Treasury. It becomes a purchasing fund with regard to forestry.  That deals with the question put by Deputy Morrissey. We acquired 15,469 acres at a price of £30,950.</P>

The balance as at 31st March, 1936, is estimated to be £109,000.&rdquo;  That is where you get your £500.  The actual fund at the moment is £118,000 because reserves are carried forward.  This is a fund which does not revert back to the Treasury, and so we have £118,000 in our Forestry Land Purchase Fund.</P>

      <P>We do not know what we will spend in the purchase of land. The acreage planted was 6,400 acres, and the number of trees planted was 12,000,000.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney made a speech&mdash;at least I presume I might call it a speech&mdash;but frankly, and with all patience, I want to say I do not think I ever heard more nonsense talked about forestry.  It was practically the same speech that he made last year.  It was very difficult to follow what he wanted to argue or what he wanted to put forward.  I certainly, with all the goodwill in the world, found it difficult.  There were one or two questions that emerged.  I would like to refer now to one reference he made last year.  He spoke about the difficulties in the West and about Mayo in particular.  I am glad to say we have our first centre in Mayo of 246 acres, and in Galway 489 acres, and in Leitrim and in Donegal we have a big increase in the areas there.  The largest portion is at Lough Derg, in which we hope to have from 2,500 to 3,000 acres planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the various grades of timber that were being planted.  Of hard-wood, such as oak, and other trees of that nature, approximately 1,000,000 were planted; of larch between 2,000,000 and 2,500,000; of spruce, 4,500,000, and of pines, 6,500,000.  That constitutes our total.  I am very anxious to get as much hard-woods grown as is possible.  Hard-wood trees <Col N="2443" /> are very slow in growing.  Those who plant them never enjoy the benefits, but it is desirable to have a considerable percentage of them.  The Department hold that the most they can use of hard-wood plants in economical forestry and otherwise is between 8 and 10 per cent.  That is the position with regard to the types of trees planted.  The only difficulty we have with regard to the acquisition of land when we come to deal with the vendor is delay in getting title examined.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that we should compulsorily acquire land, if we want to build up forestry, and that we should take power to do so.  I should explain we have these powers, and could exercise them.  But it is undesirable to use compulsion in forestry, if it can be avoided, and the reason is that forestry requires the goodwill of the people.  It can suffer very severely from interference, and unless you have the goodwill, and the good disposition of the people all around, all your fencing will be wasted.  That is one of the main reasons, apart from the general line of policy, why we do not want to introduce this method if it can be avoided, and particularly until we have reached the point that we have planted the acreage we can get without compulsion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sale, and future provision for the development of the sales of timber&mdash;and when I say timber I include round timber, standard timber and timber that has been processed in some form, even elementary form&mdash;I might first explain we do not get land containing a great amount of valuable standing timber.  The owners of prime mature standing timber feel they can get a better market for it themselves.  That brings up the question of giving them permits. We insist on application being made for a permit to cut, but if the timber is really prime and mature and due for cutting, then, naturally, as a commercial proposition we permit it to be cut. It has been suggested that we have been lax about the cutting of timber. I do not think that that is so.  Half-a-dozen files come before me every week <Col N="2444" /> for consideration as to whether we will prosecute or not, and we have recently become more drastic in regard to the felling of timber without a permit. To come back to the question of the use of the timbers, we have relatively little standing timber ready for cutting in our hands, and such timber as we do get is frequently of the scrap variety.  Land which has been stripped of its valuable timber is offered for sale, and we may acquire it with a view to cleaning up and replanting.  As time goes on our own forests will begin to produce, and plans have been thought out and are now in the preliminary stage whereby we shall be able to have travelling sawmills of our own going through the country.  We shall operate in the various larger centres for the production of cut-stuff timber.  Perhaps I should explain what I mean when I say that.  I have no desire to see the Forestry Department going into the competitive field with those who are legitimately engaged in the manufacture of timber, but I am anxious to see that the most is made of the timber we have got.  In my judgment the most suitable way in which these timbers can be handled is to have your travelling mill at your forest, have the timber cut down and have it sawn up in what is known in the trade as &ldquo;squares&rdquo;&mdash;say, 30 x 3 x 2, or 6×12×2, or what you will&mdash;so that the drying or seasoning process can be going on while the timber is in the Forestry Department's hands, because that is the only way the timber becomes valuable and the only way by which the most can be got out of it. That, as far as the Department is concerned, has all been considered and planned for the future.  I, for one, do not expect to be interested as Minister in the Forestry Department by the time the need for that operation comes along.</P>
    <P>Deputy Goulding referred to control of cutting and the planting of waste lands.  On that point, we may as well deal with the whole position with regard to the planting of waste lands in the West.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney seems to think that he is an authority on this matter.  He may be; I do not know.  If he is, he &ldquo;did not get his stuff across,&rdquo; if I may use an <Col N="2445" /> Americanism.  I am anxious to plant all the waste lands in the West.  I do not want to follow the example of two or three Deputies who made the same speech to-day that they made 12 months ago.  Our policy is to plant every area in the West we can plant. Deputy Brennan raised a point with regard to the acreage.  The standard unit has been 300 acres.  That is the economic unit but, in several cases, we made exceptions where the circumstances seemed to justify our doing so. We have not, however, got below the 200-acre mark and I do not think we can get below it.  It is a question of supervision and fencing.  I am pressing the Department on the matter and when the new director is operating he will have before him my views and the views of Deputies.  He has been reading the reports and he has ascertained the views of people throughout the country and I hope he will be able to work out a scheme whereby smaller units can be gathered together.  We have already made clear that if we can get a half-dozen units of from 40 to 50 acres, within a four-mile radius, to make up 250 or 300 acres, we will take it on, though it will not be so economic as the normal forest unit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey raised a question as to wages.  I dealt with that question earlier in the day arising out of the Land Commission Vote, and I do not want to bore the House by repeating what I then said.  If the Deputy looks up the Report, he will see what my views are and what the position will be for the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question of the capacity of the Forestry Department to absorb the unemployed was raised.  Of course, forestry gives a great deal of employment for from <Col N="2446" /> five to six months of the year.  Then it slackens off.  During portion of the planting season we had upwards of 2,000 people employed.  In the off season that number falls to about 500. We hope next year to be able to employ from 2,500 to 3,000 people, reckoning on a plantation programme of about 10,000 acres which I hope to see realised.  Whether we shall be able to do that, I do not know; it depends on many circumstances.  The wages of sawyers have to be related to the wages paid to the foreman and others in the Department.  Foremen get 40/- a week.  That is the position in the only place that really matters as regards the wages paid to our men&mdash; that is, Dundrum, Tipperary.  I agree that the rate is low.  I am prepared to admit that it is the lowest sawyers' rate I have ever known.  Whether these men are sawyers in my sense of the term or in the Deputy's sense of the term, I am not sure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn dealt with Kerry and with the acquisition of land.  The problem of the suitability or non-suitability of land was one of the big worries we had.  I am not so much worried about it now, but I would like to see a big reserve pool of forestry land in our hands, so that we would be able to make preparations and to give as much employment as possible.  It is a technical question. One of the reasons why we are trying to break with the old tradition&mdash;if it was a tradition&mdash;existing in the Department was that the Executive Council decided to ask the Civil Service Commission to throw this thing open to the world, to see if we could get a new view on it.  The tradition here certainly was very much what I call the demesne land type.  In <Col N="2448" /> Kerry we have Muckross going since 1933, where there are 1,290 acres approximately.  Last year we opened Kenmare, and the work will begin there during the current year.  It would be under way this year but for the scarcity of suitable types to plant.  I have a note of the matters that Deputy McMenamin referred to.  Our programme, as the Deputy stated, was fairly satisfactory in Donegal, but there again we have the difficulties of exposure and other things.  On the general question, I have asked the new director to make a special report on the Gaeltacht counties and the western seaboard, taking into consideration exposure, the general topography of the country, the nature of the soil and other things. I do not know whether we will be able to get a final decision on that. I hope we will.  As I said last year, the planting of trees is a risky business unless you have a reasonable assurance that they are going to grow. If there is a sporting chance that there will be relatively good results, then we will take it.  If I feel, on the other hand, that expert opinion is against the possibility of growing trees, then we will not take any chances.  I think I have covered reasonably well most of the points that were raised.  Another question was raised by Deputy Dillon about the letting of lands, and the maintenance of a stock of game, so that these places could be let in the form of shooting lodges.  We are anxious about that to some extent.  We have a great many shooting demesnes in the Forestry Department, but we are not always able to get people to take them.  The question whether we should stock them with grouse or partridge is one that I am not competent to deal with.  It is a new question as far as I am concerned, but I will have it noted and inquired into.</P>

      <P>The total net Estimate for the year ending 31st March, 1937, amounts to £82,204.  The Estimate shows a slight decrease on the figure for last year, but it will be observed that the gross expenditure estimated exceeds the figure for the previous year by over £6,000, or, if the economy effected by reorganisation of the administration is left out of the account, by over £7,600. This extra expenditure is divided between the rural industries, the marine products and the housing services of the Department.  It will be noted also that in our estimated receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid the return anticipated from net sales of products of rural industries is put down at £26,000 after deduction of wages to workers estimated at £12,000 and other payments amounting to £2,000.  In other words, we are reckoning on gross receipts from the rural industries of £40,000.  These figures, which show a substantial increase on former years are based on the prospects indicated by our trading experience up to the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now deal with the various sub-heads of the Vote in detail.  Sub-head A covers the salaries of the administrative staff other than that directly concerned with the housing section of the Department.  There is a substantial reduction (£1,294) on the amount voted last year following upon reorganisation of the staff.  This reorganisation and the resultant reduction so far from hindering the work of the Department has resulted in a greatly improved position as regards our work and efficiency.  Sub-heads B <Col N="2450" /> and C, relating to headquarters travelling and incidental expenses, show reductions amounting to £355, and have been estimated with due regard to future activities and in the light of our experience in previous years.</P>
    <P>Rural Industries.&mdash;Sub-head D (1), which relates entirely to the salaries of technical staff engaged on the production side of the rural industries, shows an increase of £431, mainly due to the appointment of a production manager, an organising officer and additional weaving charge-hand assistants, but partly offset by a reduction in the number of manageresses provided for. Last year provision was made for six centres which we had hoped to reopen and for which manageresses would be required.  It has been found possible to re-employ three of these.  At the start of the last financial year 23 centres were operating, one of these was closed down and one merged with an adjoining centre.  Six were opened or re-opened, so that at the end of the financial year there were 27 centres in production.  In addition to these we were successful in securing local groups to operate four others that had been closed down, and I am hopeful that these will continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>Additional centres were not opened for the weaving industry, but three assistant charge-hands were employed to help in the work of the Kilcar centre and to oversee the operations of weavers working in the Ardara and Glencolumbkille districts.  The output and development of the weaving industry has been particularly gratifying and has exceeded our expectations. Our designs and ranges of quality have been welcomed by the trade, and I am satisfied that we can look forward now to further expansion and that it may soon be possible to open some new centres for the production of tweeds or other lines of weaving.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (2), for assistance to convent classes, shows a reduction of £80 due to the occurrence of a vacancy in one convent, which it is not proposed to fill.  Sub-head D (3), for domestic instruction, shows an increase of approximately £50, due to the placing of the domestic economy instructress, whose services are well known to <Col N="2451" /> Western Deputies, on a scale appropriate to her services to the poor of the Western Gaeltacht.  Sub-head D (4), for travelling expenses, shows an increase of £100, due to provision for additional travelling expenditure by the production manager, organising officer, and by manageresses who are brought to the marketing depot for &ldquo;refresher&rdquo; training courses.  Sub-head D (5) covers the cost of the renewal and replacement of machines based on a scheme spread over a number of years, allowance being made for extra requirements consequent on improvement of types.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D (6) provides for the purchase of yarn and manufacturing materials and shows an increase of £1,500 on the amount allotted last year.  Due regard was given to existing stocks of approximately two months' supply of current ranges of yarns, an anticipated growth in the demand for our products and the possibility of higher prices.  Sub-head D (7), for general expenses in connection with production, shows a decrease of £300, due to the pruning of requirements and certain economies, but full provision was made for our probable commitments.</P>
    <P>Marine Products Industries.&mdash;Sub-head E (1), for salaries of outdoor officers engaged in connection with the marine products industries, shows a decrease of £170, due to the institution of revised arrangements and the decision that the short period of pressure in connection with the purchase of kelp could best be met by a temporary alteration in the duties of existing experienced staff.  Sub-head E (2), for travelling expenses, shows a reduction of cost for the same reason.</P>
    <P>Kelp.&mdash;Sub-head E (3) for kelp and other seaweed, other than carrageen, shows an increased expenditure under all items referring to current purchases and expenses incidental thereto, while last year's provision for expenses relating to purchases prior to 1934-35 ceases, owing to the fact that all such stocks have been realised.  We are basing our purchase of kelp on 2,500 tons from winter weed at an average of £3 per ton.  Transport, storage, shipping charges, and other incidental <Col N="2452" /> expenses account for the balance of this item and are based on our experience of past years.  Whilst we are prepared to purchase this 2,500 tons of kelp at the price mentioned, I regret to have to report that the position as regards the iodine market remains much the same as last year, and at the moment there seems little hope of an improvement.  I feel, however, that it is desirable to try to keep this industry alive by having the Department purchase the product of the winter weed.  We estimate that the price which can probably be realised for its sale for iodine production will approximately cover the price paid to the gatherers, leaving the State to bear all the expenses incidental to the purchasing and marketing arrangements (shipping, storage, and the like).  It is reckoned that under these heads the deficit to be met will be approximately £3,500.</P>
    <P>We have been considering all possible alternative uses for seaweed.  As a fertiliser, the question of the price at which it could be sold to the user is of first importance, and our efforts in that direction hold out little hope of success.  We have also been investigating the possibility of a market for ground kelp as an admixture for cattle foods.  There is a prospect of an outlet in this direction for a limited quantity.</P>
    <P>Carrageen.&mdash;Under sub-head E (4) provision is made for the purchase of carrageen for packing and marketing for food purposes, and it will be noted that there is a reduction in this Estimate of £615 from last year's figure. This reduction is not, I am glad to say, due to a falling off in either purchases or prices of carrageen from the gatherers.  On the contrary, the position in regard to both is satisfactory. Last year arrangements were made for the purchase of carrageen by the appointment of a commercial buyer in the business, whose conditions of appointment were that all operations, purchases, prices, etc., were subject to the scrutiny and check of the Department, the Department reserving to itself the right to go into the market at any time if it was felt that the rather stringent conditions <Col N="2453" /> under which the buyer was to operate were not being faithfully carried out.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the scheme is working out satisfactorily.  Over £3,000 worth of carrageen was purchased by this buyer during the year, and the prices to the gatherers have not only been maintained but are actually on the average 15 per cent. higher than in the previous year. The economy to the Department in so operating will be obvious.  Under the present method our only expenditure in regard to administration of the commercial carrageen is that involved in keeping an inspector on the work, whilst the results to the gatherers are even better than they were in the past.  Moreover, we still exercise the necessary and desirable control of the industry, and are able to ensure that the gatherers are fully protected against exploitation.</P>
    <P>Central Marketing Depot.&mdash;Subhead F (1) covers the salaries of staff engaged in the work of the marketing depot, and shows an increase of £560, due to the creation of subordinate posts found necessary for the efficient receipt and despatch of goods and the proper handling and care of stocks. A commercial manager has replaced the civil servant who was acting as manager, and the latter has returned to his normal duties.  Sub-head F (2) provides £550 for advertising costs, and is a reduction of £240 on last year's Vote.  This does not mean that advertising on an appropriate scale will not be carried out, but merely that we are acting with close discrimination and care on what is justified and what is, in our opinion, most productive of results.  Sub-head F (3) shows an increase for general expenses, due to improved demands for our products and increased activities in the rural industries.  In order to effect more efficient deliveries and to expedite transport of goods to and from certain of our more important centres in remote areas as occasion requires, it has been decided to purchase a motor delivery van.  I may say that will be mainly used in the weaving industry in Donegal, and then for service in the city here.  Sub-head <Col N="2454" /> G provides for possible loans for industrial purposes, and is approximately at the same figure as last year. Items (1), (2) and (3) are nominal, and call for no special comment.  Item (4) is provided in the Vote in case the occasion should arise whereby a suitable industry requiring a small amount of loan capital could be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Sub-head H (1) for salaries shows an increase of £668 as a result of the appointment of additional assistant housing surveyors for the purpose of speeding up inspection of applications and inducing grantees to complete the work necessary for the issue of funds. Sub-head H (2) for travelling expenses shows a decrease of £600 which it has been possible to effect notwithstanding the increase in travelling staff owing to the adoption of a scheme of fixed periodical allowances for travelling instead of mileage rates as heretofore in force.  Sub-head H (3) provides for an additional £5,000 for housing grants, bringing the Vote up to £50,000.  Last year the actual expenditure was approximately £44,000 on an estimate of £45,000, and it is hoped and expected that, with the additional surveying staff now recruited, we will be in a position to spend at least £50,000 this year in the erection, improvement and extension of dwelling houses etc., in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid.&mdash;The Appropriations-in-Aid are estimated to produce £36,200 net.  I have already referred to item 1, which is estimated to realise a net £26,000 after providing for £12,000 for workers wages and £2,000 for sales commission and other charges.  Last year we estimated for a net cash return of £17,000 after payment of £6,000 in wages to the workers.  I am glad to be able to say that actually our wages to the workers amounted to nearly £10,000, and our gross receipts were almost £35,500. Item 2, for kelp and seaweed provides for a cash return of £7,800, which is based approximately on the proposed purchase of 2,500 tons at £3 per ton. It bears no relation to the provision for last year as that year dealt largely with estimates of the amount to be realised on old stocks of kelp.  I may mention that we are now very doubtful as to <Col N="2455" /> whether there will be that much kelp available for purchase this year.  In any case if it is, we are in a position to purchase it.</P>
    <P>Item 3 provides for a cash return from the sale of packed carrageen for food purposes which does not vary much from that of last year.  Item 4 for loan repayments shows an increase on the provision for last year.  I am glad to say that repayments during the last year have on the whole been satisfactory, and exceeded anticipations. Items 5 and 6 refer respectively to receipts from rentals from teachers' residences and miscellaneous receipts, and call for no special comment.</P>
    <P>I have summarised as briefly as possible the details of the work of the Department, and whilst I feel that we are only now on a basis which will permit of healthy expansion, I am satisfied with the work that has been done during the year.  In my statement on the Estimates last year I referred to the state in which I found various sections of the Department.  I do not propose to go into that again except to say that the reorganisation is practically complete, and that we have in all our various activities got things into reasonably good shape, and I am hopeful that from now onwards we will go on progressing.  Our old stocks have been mostly cleared off and production has been developed to cater properly for the known requirements of customers.  The utmost care is being exercised in the purchase of raw materials and in the production of the right goods for the buyers, and general satisfaction is being expressed by the latter in the improvements both in goods and in service, and is reflected in the increased turnover that the rural industries are experiencing.</P>
    <P>The work of reorganisation has been extremely difficult, but I believe the work of the Department has been put on a firm basis.  Many necessary economies have been effected whilst, at the same time, the position of the workers engaged has been improved by the greater prospect of continuity of employment.  Apart from the rural industries there have been special efforts made to expedite all the work <Col N="2456" /> of the housing branch, and as the Estimate indicates, we hope to accelerate still more during the coming year. Last year I indicated that I hoped to have commercial accounts prepared for trading activities, so that Deputies and others could see the position and know to what extent the State had to assist the continuance of these branches Stocktaking was carried out at the beginning and end of last year.  The accounts are in course of preparation and will be laid on the Table of the House after the auditors have passed them.</P>
    <P>I also stressed the fact that the most important matter for the people of the Gaeltacht was to have the maximum amount of attention directed by all Departments to the special needs of the Gaeltacht areas.  During the year we have had the full co-operation of all the other Departments in an InterDepartmental Committee and I am glad to be able to express my own and the Department's appreciation of their help.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would state that I have good grounds for believing that, now that reorganisation is practically completed, the Department will go on expanding with increased efficiency and increased benefits to the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In rising to make a few remarks on this Estimate I would like to approach it, purely, from a business point of view; to examine it from that point of view which the Minister appears to agree to, because he says he is having commercial accounts prepared which will be laid on the Table for the information of members.  But, as the Government are increasing their commercial activities in various directions, they ought to be very careful, where they are running commercial concerns, that they are run on commercial lines, and that they are not claiming special privileges, which ordinary commercial people would not be able to avail themselves of, in adopting methods to avoid criticism which would not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, approaching this Estimate purely from a business point of view, let us imagine the Minister as the <Col N="2457" /> director of a company, if one may do that, presenting the accounts to the shareholders at their annual meeting. I suppose that analogy is not too far fetched on the present occasion, but if you do attempt to apply that analogy I am afraid it reduces the consideration of this Estimate to a farce. Now, imagine the chairman of a company saying to the shareholders who are examining the accounts: &ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, for the second time in the last few years we have not got the accounts ready; the stocks are not available for the year and the accounts are not audited, but, however, that does not really matter, because no matter what you say to me it will not produce any effect.&rdquo; I am in the position of having to criticise these accounts, of which I do not know what the stock was at the beginning of the year and neither do I know what the stock was at the end of the year.  That is not my fault, because on the 1st April last&mdash;I quote from Vol. 61, column 680, of the Dáil Debates&mdash;I addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands:</P>
    <P>Mr. Dockrell asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what is the value of the stock on hands of goods manufactured by the rural industries at the Central Marketing Depôt on 31st March, 1935, and on 31st March, 1936.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for Lands (Mr. O'Grady): The stock in question on the 31st March, 1936, is at present in course of ascertainment; but if the Deputy repeats his question after the lapse of a week, the full information required will be available.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was commendably modest about the stock on 31st March, 1935.  Surely that has been ascertained.  However, that information would not be very valuable without particulars of the stock on 31st March, 1936.  As I have said, examining these accounts without the stocks at the beginning or the end of the year, one sees that sub-head D (1) amounts to £4,796; sub-head D (2) to £452; sub-head D (3) to £171; sub-head D (4) to £430; sub-head D (5)&mdash; machines and plant&mdash;to £750; sub-head D (6)&mdash;materials&mdash;£1,500; and sub-head <Col N="2458" /> D (7)&mdash;general expenses&mdash;to £1,410, making a total of £23,009 for rural industries.  The total expenses for the Central Marketing Board amount to £4,972, making a gross total for both of £27,981.</P>
    <P>Now, these are what I may call some of the items on the expense side of the account.  When we turn to the Appropriations-in-Aid we see that for the year 1935-6 they are put down at £17,000, and receipts for 1936-7 are put down at £26,000.  Opposite these two figures there is this note: &ldquo;Receipts from net sales of products of rural industries after deducting payment of production wages estimated to amount to £12,000.&rdquo;  I suppose that a person finding that the stock was not ready might be pardoned for supposing that the £12,000 was the sum for both years. However, I think the Minister has stated that the payment for wages for 1935-6&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong &mdash;amounted to £10,000.  If you add the £10,000 to the £27,981, or call it £28,000, it amounts to a total expenditure on the expense side of, roughly, £38,000.  There are some general expenses which, in a business establishment, would have to be added.  I do not know what the Minister would like to add for them, but suppose, for the sake of argument, you put on 10 per cent., that would amount to £3,800, and that would bring the total to £41,800, or call it £42,000, on the expense side.  On the other side of the balance sheet you have £17,000, from which has been deducted £10,000 for workers' wages.  That amounts to £27,000&mdash;gross sales.  The position is, therefore, looking at it in a very rough and ready way from a commercial point of view, that £42,000 has had to be expended to produce sales of £27,000. If you look at it in the way in which the Minister appears to look at it, and I suppose the way we all look at it, namely that this is an industry which is run for whatever benefit the Gaeltacht people can get out of it, you will find that they have got £10,000 in wages out of this sum, and in order to get that the country has had to put up £42,000.  In other words, they have only got 5/- out of every pound that the country has put up.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2459" /> When you consider this from the commercial point of view, some very extraordinary things transpire.  I understand that so eager was this Department to get their stock taken that the Depot was closed for a week, and that it was like a beleagured city. People who wanted supplies could not get them for over a week because stock was being taken.  Imagine walking down Grafton Street and seeing on one of the large drapery establishments a notice board saying: &ldquo;This establishment is closed for one week while stock is being taken.&rdquo;  If you saw that I believe it would not be very long until it would be replaced by a &ldquo;to let&rdquo; notice board.  I do not think anybody could carry on a business on those lines.  I think the Government are suffering from a difficulty as to the lines on which they will run these rural industries.  When it was a very small question and a very small amount of work was being carried out it was possibly on right lines, but when it has been extended I am afraid one is faced with the parting of the ways, and the Department will have to make up their minds as to whether they are going to go on with the hand-loom system, or whether they are going to change over completely.</P>
    <P>I should like to offer to the Minister the following criticisms: I do not know whether or not he will agree with them all, and possibly it does not necessarily follow that they are all absolutely correct.  At the same time it is very clearly revealed that there is a difficult problem to be faced in connection with this industry. I understand that the designs and colourings are not up-to-date, and, with the exception of a few prints, are not changed often enough.  The consumption of hand-loom tweed is not likely to increase to any great extent for the following reasons: The prices are too high for the popular trade by comparison with machine-loom tweeds; hand-loom tweeds are made in half the width of machine-loom tweeds, and that is uneconomical and much more difficult for the average tailor or dressmaker to make up; the Gaeltacht hand-loom tweeds are no longer homespuns, as large quantities <Col N="2460" /> of imported yarns are used.  Having departed from the original intention of making genuine 100 per cent. homespuns, why not do the finer and more up-to-date weaves, and generally modernise their productions?  Why not go further and try to get on to the production of more popular cloths, which will give a greater volume of business and more employment?  I suggest that that is the real crux of the matter.  Having started an industry which is not capable of indefinite expansion, the Government are now faced with the problem of having to establish commercial enterprises and commercial industries in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that the present policy of the Government, while it may be conferring a certain amount of benefit on the workers to whom they paid £10,000 in wages, has taken away with another hand a considerable amount of money from another section. They have partly destroyed the reputation which has been won for them by private enterprise.  The ordinary manufacturers are now considering how far they can get protection from their own Government by registering trade marks that will guarantee a really up-to-date, home-made, and reliable article.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that that is an excellent commentary on the present position.  The Minister has protested that certain difficulties are inherent in the Department, and were there when he took it over, but he is at present continuing to run the Department on non-commercial lines.  Surely there must be something wrong when they have to give to the public for 13/4 what is costing the country £1.  That is the position over the whole of the Gaeltacht industries.  The products are being sold at a loss of practically one-third.  Surely it would be better to make up your minds that either you are going to produce up-to-date, homespun, and reliable goods, and sell those something on the lines of the Harris tweeds which are made on the other side of the water, or that you are going to leave the better end of the market to private enterprise and go in for production on your own side, which I admit would be exceedingly difficult.  The Government must make <Col N="2461" /> up their mind on this matter, because it is absurd, year after year, to be planking down £1 and selling those goods for 13/4.  The Minister protests each year that he has inherited certain difficulties, but he never seems to get away from the fundamental error that is inherent in, and underlying, the whole system on which these industries are being run.  I hope that he will adequately deal with this matter in his reply, and that he will not let it drift from year to year with the feeble protest that now that the difficulties are overcome, it will be all right.  If we are to judge the Government's commercial undertakings from the way this Department is run, it is obvious that more thought and more business methods must be introduced into this Department.</P>

I should like to congratulate the Minister on the very practical way he emphasises the tribute he paid last year in introducing this Estimate, and which he repeated to-day.  The item refers to the remuneration of a domestic economy instructress.  Last year we were asked to vote for salary and bonus, £168, and this year the amount is £215.  I feel that the House will very readily sanction this increase, and, indeed, will commend the Minister, who probably had a tough fight to wage with that hard-hearted Ministry, Finance, to get it submitted to us.  The Minister, however, was nerved for the fight by his appreciation, based on personal knowledge, of the great work done by the domestic economy instructress in question, in what Pearse called the desolate regions on the edge of Ireland.  He was also inspired by gratitude for what she did to overcome certain practical difficulties which arose in connection with the inauguration of the Gaeltacht colony in Meath.  This lady accompanied the women colonists and acted as a sort of guardian angel to them.  I am aware that guardian angels are usually represented as being of the masculine gender, but I think they are more often feminine. At least this lady is being looked on in Connemara as a guardian angel for the last 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2462" /> These poor people leaving Connemara for the first time, some of them over 70, and never a stone's throw away from their native rocks, and some young mothers with babies in their arms, found the terrors of the unknown made less terrible by her company, and found that the difficulties of setting down in their new homes were overcome by her practical and cheerful help.  I regret, however, that after the designation of this instructress in the book of Estimates we still find the word in brackets &ldquo;unestablished.&rdquo;  This means that, after 25 or 30 years of active service in a warfare which means as much to the nation as that which we have remunerated in other cases very generously, this lady will find herself in her declining years, when she is no longer able to continue her work, which is carried on under the most arduous conditions, without any provision. I think it unfair that this should be so.  It is a national debt that is being contracted, as the Minister has almost admitted, and it is not likely that the nation will go bankrupt in such a small sum as would be necessary.</P>
    <P>The House will perhaps understand why I feel so strongly about this matter if I say something of the circumstances under which this domestic economy instructress and her former colleagues&mdash;her former colleagues are absorbed in other services, but she is left alone&mdash;began their work, and of the spirit, as heroic and self-sacrificing as that of any missionary nun, which they brought to it, and the quality of the results they achieved.  I could speak of these things of my own knowledge, but it would bring more conviction to the House if I put into the witness box a great authority, no less an authority than the late Mr. Micks, Secretary of the Congested Districts Board, who was responsible for the new departure represented by the employment of these Irish-speaking domestic economy instructresses. It is not necessary in a House like this to recapitulate the historic causes which pressed the people of the Western Gaeltacht down to&mdash;I was going to say a level of existence, but <Col N="2463" /> it was not a level of existence; it was a subsidence, and it was not an existence, but a sub-existence.</P>
    <P>These causes weighed particularly heavy on women, depriving them not only of the material resources necessary for the making of a modest home, but of that domestic training and knowledge and that feminine initiative which might conceivably have replaced or evolved that.  Two very enlightened officials of the late Congested Districts Board realised this, and realised also that if something were not done about it, a great deal of the work they had undertaken would be undone.  The board could help people to get new houses, but it is only the trained woman who can make these houses into homes, and the women had to be shown the way.  It happened that Mr. Walker, to whom I would also like to pay a great tribute, was a trustee of the Dudley Nursing Fund and in that capacity he had realised all the good that intelligent and devoted women could do.  He pressed the board to give a substantial subsidy to the Dudley Nursing Scheme, and also to provide houses for the nurses. These nurses went among the people and did a tremendous lot of work, not only in nursing the sick but in teaching the woman of the house to nurse the sick, and still better, to keep the well well.  They taught them principles of hygiene and proper healthy home-making, and the experiment was so successful that Mr. Micks, who had been poor law inspector in the West, thought it should be extended. He suggested that at least one domestic economy instructress should go among the people and show them how to set up their homes.</P>
    <P>In his &ldquo;History of the Congested Districts Board,&rdquo; he has told in a very interesting way of the success of the experiment and he pays a tribute to the domestic economy instructress, whose rise of salary, much belated, we are voting, and for whose establishment I am pleading.  I would like to read it to the House.  I think it should go on the records of this House as showing what one woman has done.  I quote from &ldquo;The History of the Congested Districts Board.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This vote also includes housing, and we had better dismiss that first by saying that that Department has done great service to the Gaeltacht districts and has been very efficient and courteous, and has tried in every possible way to meet these people in regard to the construction of houses for the last ten or 12 years.  This problem that was raised by Deputy Dockrell is a serious one, and it lends itself to criticism, but criticism is barren unless there is something constructive about it.  A question that does arise is this.  Is there going to be a conflict between what we have known in the past as the home industries proper&mdash;that is the hand-loom cottage industries in the Gaeltacht&mdash;as distinct from the centralised manufacture of tweeds now by this Department?  Deputy Dockrell is right in that sense&mdash;that it is a new departure; that the Department has completely departed from what it was in the past, and that we will have to take that into consideration in approaching this problem of rural industries.  A few days ago, or within the last week, I saw that an organisation in town here has got an assurance &mdash;I take it that it is from the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;that they are going to get a trade mark for certain tweeds.  Now, I wonder are the tweeds that are going to be manufactured by this Department and sold at Beggars' Bush to be sold under this trade mark, or will that also apply to the hand-loom products that are produced in the cottages in the Gaeltacht? Is it the policy of the Department now, seeing that they have taken up this new departure of the centralising of the manufacture of tweeds, to cut across the hand-loom industries that were carried on in the cottages of the Gaeltacht?  If that is so, it means that this Department will have to go on a completely new footing, and it will have to become entirely a commercial concern run by this Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hitherto, under the Congested Districts <Col N="2467" /> Board, and since then, the Department bought the tweeds that were made in the cottages by the hand-loom weavers in the main.  Now, very important considerations arise, and I offer these statements to the Minister absolutely <i>bona fide</i> and in a friendly way.  The Minister is aware that private enterprise is developing considerably in some of these Gaeltacht areas in regard to weaving machine work, and stuff like that.  A complaint has been made to me by people who are absolutely reliable and <i>bona fide</i>, and who have done much for the Gaeltacht by giving employment both in the factory and in the cottages, that in the case of certain given articles, such as, for example, cheap lines of stockings and socks, the Department are putting the best merino wool into socks that are sold for about 1/- a pair, and that these people, having to compete with the private industries throughout the country that manufacture socks for sale cannot put in that quality of stuff into the socks, and that the socks are made from a mixture of cotton and wool, while this Department is producing a sock that is made of the best merino wool and selling it against them.  I wonder does that apply generally? Does it apply to the tweeds and other things that are made in these factories under the management of the Department?  Are they, having State funds behind them, putting in a superior quality into an article and selling it in competition with an inferior article in quality at a much lower price than its economic price?  I am only discussing this from the point of view arising out of the complaint about the stockings.  If it is so, I think it would be very regrettable and that ultimately it would react on the Gaeltacht districts. If we are to do anything in this we must do it absolutely <i>bona fide.</i>  If we are putting a line on the market wholesale, for example, at about 9/-, to be retailed at 1/-, the quality that the Department put into that article should be the quality produced by private enterprise, and not a quality far superior to what private enterprise could put into the article to sell at that price.  There is no doubt about that. <Col N="2468" /> It may be that when they complained to me it was only a particular lot that was presented to them, that somebody got a parcel from somewhere, perhaps some wholesale house.  Somebody probably went in to sell the articles, and they produced this particular lot from Beggars' Bush.  There may be only one lot.  I do not know whether there is a practice made of it, but what I have indicated did take place.  It would be unfair to allow that, because the Minister is aware that private enterprise is doing much for the Gaeltacht areas, and I would not like their financial position to be undermined by competition from the Department with regard to quality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell has gone into the question of the amount of money spent to produce a given amount of goods.  I take it the gist of his complaint is that he regrets the workers are only getting approximately 5/- out of every £1 spent.  I think that is really what he is coming at.  As regards the money spent by this House, the general rule is adopted, even in the Board of Works, that there should be the largest labour content possible. Deputy Dockrell dealt with the money spent by the Department and the amount expended in wages to the workers, and I think he is approximately correct, it is about 5/- in every £1.  It is regrettable that the workers did not get more of the huge amount spent in the Gaeltacht.  I think the Minister should apply himself to the question of the manufacture of tweeds in these factories.  It should be put on a strictly commercial basis and there should be no closing up of these places for the purpose of taking stock. That sort of thing is farcical and it should not be tolerated at all.</P>

      <P>The thing is ridiculous. To a certain extent we are all responsible, in the sense that we are trustees.  Of course, this is where the money is wasted.  The labour content of the money voted in this House is reduced to the very lowest figure. There are two other sore problems in this Vote.  One is really serious and the other is not so serious.  The serious one has reference to kelp.  I made some suggestions to the Minister last year about the utilisation of kelp for the production of artificial manure. Has anything been done in that direction? There is so much in the way of barter going on in the world that I think the Minister should do some bartering in regard to kelp.  We are bartering with Germany and even with England.  It occurs to me that a very considerable amount of drugs comes into this country each year, mainly from England.  Why not barter kelp against drugs?  The medicinal preparation, iodine, is produced in the main out of kelp and there are other by-products.  We get a lot of drugs from Germany, America, England and even France.  Why not barter kelp against them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated the other day that Germany will take more horses from us if we took more of their produce. They even use threats against us, and it is about time this country stiffened its upper lip.  Why are the Germans entitled to claim that?  Is it simply because they are a great nation?  Is it a question of the mailed fist and the big gun?  This bartering should be done on an equitable basis, irrespective of the sizes of the States.  I would be prepared to support the Government in any attitude they may adopt, facing these people on an equitable basis.  If there is trade to be done, it should be done on an equitable basis.  It should not be done on an unequal basis simply because it is a big nation dealing with a small <Col N="2470" /> nation.  Let them know we are prepared to pay £1 for £1 and if they do not want that we will deal elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any hope with regard to kelp?  Has he made any experiments that would lead to some hope?  I could tell him of areas where, were it not for the Unemployment Assistance Act, the people would be absolutely destitute.  There are small tracts in my constituency along the seaboard where for the kelp season they have got from £4,000 to £7,000 in the past, perhaps on a four-mile coast line.  Now these people are not getting a penny for kelp.  Fishing is dead and apparently the collection of carrageen is being subsidised very considerably.</P>
    <P>A general disaster has overcome those people.  The net result of that, from the physical and moral point of view, will be that after a time these people will be in the position that they will do nothing.  If the Minister could give an economic price for kelp, a price that would keep the industry going, he would be doing a wise thing. I admit that there has been strong competition from the South American States in the matter of nitrate. Great Britain, having money invested in those countries, is taking its nitrate requirements from them, There again that reacts on the kelp industry.  It is only in the case of another war, which nobody desires, that Great Britain will again come to buy kelp from us on any large scale. I would like to know from the Minister if he has any intention of opening up any other market for kelp.  I understand that the Department is paying rent for the storage of the unsold kelp.  I suggest that the Minister should unload it, even though an actual loss results.  On the face of it, there is a loss in paying rent for the storage of kelp, and in addition we know that the kelp depreciates in value every year.</P>
    <P>I heard it stated in this House, or perhaps it was outside it, in regard to the question of carrageen, that sufficient carrageen was not being gathered at present around the coast to meet the requirements of the Department, and I was told that the Department <Col N="2471" /> is importing French carrageen.  I was rather astonished at hearing such a statement.  I do not know whether it is true or untrue.  I know that some carrageen lately was got in my house, and I noticed on the packets that it was described as genuine Irish carrageen. I hope for the sake of the industry that it is not true that French carrageen is imported and that it is being sold as genuine Irish carrageen.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister what progress the Department has made in the matter of re-housing in the Gaeltacht.  I know considerable inroads have been made in the solution of the housing problem in the Gaeltacht, but I know it is as yet far from being completed.  I do not want to be so severe on the commercial side in the matter of this Vote as was Deputy Dockrell.  After all the Gaeltacht services are run for the assistance of the congested areas, for areas that would otherwise require relief.  Deputies must keep that fact in view.  Of course I agree that the Minister must apply the application of commercial principles to the management of this Department so as to see (1) that there is no unnecessary waste and (2) that the maximum portion of the money voted will go in wages to the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year when the Minister was introducing this Estimate he had both a halo and wings on him. On that occasion when he came to reply to Deputy Dockrell the halo and the wings dropped off.  He complained of what obtained when he had taken over the Department.  He made an attack on certain departments connected with the Gaeltacht industry. He said he had been greatly tried in his endeavour to restore order so far as these industries were concerned. The Minister wound up his speech by saying that if he had had his way he would draw a red line around the Gaeltacht and migrate the people out of it.  He gave us to understand that his attitude towards the Gaeltacht problem was to throw up his hands, cry havoc, and abandon any attempt to make continual residence in the <Col N="2472" /> Gaeltacht possible.  I should be very glad to hear from the Minister to-night whether he has now modified that view, and whether his experience has not taught him that some of the things that struck him as incongruous when he took over the Department were not incongruous at all, and whether he had come to appreciate that certain things which at first glance appear to be farfetched, showed themselves, when closely examined, to be the only available remedies for the very peculiar ills that afflict the people of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to think that the Minister has by this time learned that his cosmopolitan outlook in regard to the Gaeltacht is not shared by the people for whom he is supposed to be responsible.  Strangely enough, the Minister will find that the people living in the Gaeltacht like the Gaeltacht. They were born there, their homes are there and they have adapted themselves to the circumstances of life there.  If any assistance is vouchsafed to them, they are prepared to make an effort to eke out a livelihood in the Gaeltacht.  Our business here is not to pontificate on the way these people ought to live, how they might live and where they ought to live.  Our business is to make up our minds to realise that they are living in the Gaeltacht and that as many of them as choose to stick to their homesteads should have their existence made as livable as possible.  There are certain people of a revolutionary turn of mind who take the view that they are much better qualified to decide how the people of the Gaeltacht are to live and what they are to do than the Gaeltacht people themselves.  I do not take that view, but I do recognise that a certain duty towards helping the Gaeltacht people devolves on the people as a whole.  We ought to remember that the people living in the poor lands of the Gaeltacht have done yeoman service to this country, because they are the people who have preserved the Irish language when the rest of the people living in more prosperous circumstances and under better conditions let it die out.  It is extremely difficult to discuss the Gaeltacht services. <Col N="2473" /> There was a time when the fisheries of the Gaeltacht were matters for which the Minister for Lands was responsible.  A change has been made in that arrangement, and the fisheries are now incorporated in the Department of Agriculture.  A more inept arrangement it would be difficult to imagine.  Anyone who understands this country recognises that one of the principal means of livelihood for the people along the western coast, and particularly in the Gaeltacht, is the fishery industry. But the fisheries have collapsed and because of that the problem of living for the people in the Gaeltacht becomes intolerable.  I do not wish to trespass on matters ordinarily relevant to the Fisheries Vote, but I want to point out that the principal problem in the Gaeltacht is the providing of employment for the people over and above what they themselves can provide in their own holdings.  One of the most suitable employments for people there is fishing.  The House must bear in mind that in the trade agreement entered into by the Executive Council, of which the Minister was a member, no advertence apparently was taken of our fisheries.  We cannot get away from this, that if the fishing is destroyed throughout the Gaeltacht, then the problem that will confront the Minister for the Gaeltacht is insoluble.  The problem is somewhat different from the problem which confronts Deputy Tom Kelly as chairman of the Dublin Housing Committee. Deputy Tom Kelly comes in here and throws up his hands in despair.  He tells the Minister for Local Government that if he does not like how they in the Corporation of Dublin are doing the work, then let the Minister take it up himself.  The Minister for Lands in this case has no such refuge, because if he cannot solve the problem of the Gaeltacht, no one else can.  The Minister and the Executive Council are the people who have been remiss in their duty in providing work for the people of the Gaeltacht.  In making the trade agreement with Germany, which provided for a three-to-one system of trading, no provision was made for our exports in the form of herrings.  The Minister in his <Col N="2474" /> capacity as a member of the Executive Council should have informed the German Reich that unless they were prepared to accept as part of that agreement our export of matjeherrings from the Donegal coast then we would not make any trade agreement with them.  We could have got a very considerable slice of the German market for our west-coast fisheries.</P>

I have allowed the Deputy to travel a little wide of the Estimate, as I saw there was some difficulty, and perhaps he wanted to make some reference to it.  I think, however, he has gone far enough and we shall have to confine ourselves to what the Minister is responsible for under this Vote.</P>

      <P>There is no use in trying to misconstrue what the Chair says.  The Chair endeavours to be clear&mdash;whether it succeeds or not is another matter.  There was a Vote on which the Deputy could have made these remarks relevantly.  He could have brought in references to the Gaeltacht when dealing with the Fishery Estimate.  This is not the Estimate on which that can be done.  I did allow the Deputy some latitude.  As I said, I saw there was a difficulty and possibly a desire to link up the two. But we have gone far enough on that line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether I agree or not, I have no intention of challenging the ruling of the Chair.  There remains the duty on the Minister for Fisheries to provide employment for the people in that part of the country.  One of the great problems of the Gaeltacht is that we have there a congest condition, but even if there were not a congest condition, the land I refer to, particularly in West Donegal, is really inadequate to provide any more than a subsistence to anybody who lives upon it, except perhaps in so far as the commonage for sheep may provide a better income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose I can make the Minister for the Gaeltacht responsible for the situation which has made that commonage for sheep worthless. Suffice it to say that the Minister and his colleagues have contrived to precipitate a situation which makes that commonage virtually worthless.  They are driven back on what they can produce on their own holdings.  They have the resort providentially, of going to Scotland, and that they are doing in very great numbers.  Nothing that the Minister can do has been left undone to make it more difficult for them to get decent employment in Scotland, but, by the mercy of Providence, they are still able to get some work there.  There are in Donegal at present, and in West Donegal, I think, over 4,000 people on the dole&mdash;not in receipt of unemployment insurance, but in receipt of unemployment assistance, and that is after hundreds and thousands have gone to Scotland to get work as migratory labourers.  That is four years after the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2476" /> administration of the Gaeltacht began.</P>
    <P>We remember the ringing denunciations that used to come from these Benches when Fianna Fáil occupied them, of the incapacity of the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration of Gaeltacht affairs which allowed such difficulties to continue as were operating then.  I heard with amazement the Minister for Lands, when speaking in that capacity, paying the most extravagant compliments to the staff of the Land Commission.  I have no doubt that had I had the privilege of listening to his introductory remarks on the Gaeltacht services I would have heard the same unctuous adulation of the officers of the Gaeltacht Department. That is the same man who made the country ring with the allegation that every responsible officer in the Land Commission, Fisheries, and every other Department, was the hack of Molesworth Street, that Freemason influence dominated every Department, that the Land Commission was in a conspiracy to keep the people in subjection, and that the Gaeltacht services were being run, not in the interests of the people, but in private interests.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Minister coming to realise that the very officials whom he and his colleagues denounced so vigorously were doing, under the Government that went before his, the best that could be done in face of a very difficult problem.  Perhaps, he will realise now, as he ought to realise, that a much more helpful way of approaching problems of this kind is to make suggestions which would assist the Minister to overcome the difficulties that confront him in the areas in which he has to operate.  Last year I made a series of suggestions to the Minister which would be calculated to help in mitigating the difficulties under which the people in that part of the country were living.  So far as I am aware, no attempt was made to consider any of them on their merits, or indeed to put any of them into operation.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it is the intention of the Minister to start an artificial silk factory at Crolly.  I ask him now why it was when there was a scheme in his Department for the purpose of setting up a tie factory in <Col N="2477" /> Anagry and a silk factory for the weaving of poplin or other materials suitable for the manufacture of ties at Crolly, he stamped on it and did not open the factory and closed the factory at Anagry.  He told us last year. I think, that all these schemes bore upon them the seal and stamp of incompetence.  At least, they were an honest endeavour to get something going.  We have yet to have any evidence from the Minister that he is in a position to put anything in their place.  I should like to know what he proposes to substitute for the industries he determined it was necessary to close down.  Last year he deplored the necessity of disemploying a number of instructresses who had been working in the various industrial centres throughout Donegal and the rest of the Gaeltacht.  I would be glad to know from him now whether these instructresses have received anything by way of pension or gratuity on their retirement and, if so, how much.</P>
    <P>Under the Gaeltacht Housing Act, for which the Minister was responsible a new principle was introduced which left a discretion in the Gaeltacht Housing Department, not to give a preference to native Irish speakers as had been the case up to then, but to exclude absolutely anybody from the benefits of the Act who could not prove that Irish was the vernacular of the household.  I believe then, and still believe, that that arrangement was open to grave abuse and has resulted in material hardship.  I would be glad to know from the Minister if he has any information to give the House as to how the amending Act is working. My information is that it has worked considerable hardship and has materially interfered with the success of what was one of the best schemes ever instituted by the Department of Fisheries, as it was then known, namely, the Gaeltacht housing scheme.</P>
    <P>Last year I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that numerous applications for grants, under the Gaeltacht housing scheme, were then in his Department.  The procedure, apparently, is that you apply for a grant or loan; your proposal is examined <i>in situ</i> by an inspector, who <Col N="2478" /> reports back to the Department on the proposal.  Then, there appears to intervene a period when the proposal is suspended like Mohammed's coffin&mdash; it is neither approved nor rejected.  I ask the House to bear that in mind. There is then another class of case where the proposal is substantially approved, but there is no money wherewith to finance it.  If one asks the Minister for the Gaeltacht how many applications there are in his Department which have been approved, but for which there is no money, he will give the figures relating only to the second category, but when he speaks of the position I described as suspended like Mohammed's coffin, he will tell you that there are no figures available to reply to a Parliamentary question.  I ask the Minister now if he is in a position to tell us how many grants have been paid in the last financial year, how many sanctions have been made, how many are in the intermediate stage between examination and final sanction, and how many applications there are in his office awaiting sanction?</P>
    <P>There ought to be no practical delay in dealing with housing applications. It has been made known to the Ministry again and again that money was forthcoming to the limit of the country's resources to provide for Gaeltacht housing.  The Minister himself has repeatedly said that he considers it one of the most important functions of his Department.  I would be glad to know what the details are with that class of case which I described as suspended like Mohammed's coffin.</P>
    <P>The question has come up again and again, before the Public Accounts Committee, in regard to the disposal of purchases by the Central Disposals Board.  We have repeatedly asked that a system of accounting should be set up at Beggars' Bush that would give ordinary business men an opportunity of understanding the profit and loss account in regard to these transactions. Up to date no such system has been established.  We were repeatedly informed that the matter is in the hands of the Department of Finance who have a statutory right under an omnibus law to prescribe <Col N="2479" /> their accounting system.  That may be so.  The Department of Finance may stipulate certain forms of accounts that shall be established, but the Minister for Finance has no authority to prohibit the Minister in charge of the Gaeltacht prescribing for the people at Beggars' Bush an ordinary set of books, on business lines, which would enable them to present to him at the end of each financial year a profit and loss account of their transactions. I submit that that ought to be done.  Until it is done no proper view can be had of how that branch of the Department's activities is carried on.</P>
    <P>Now, we come to the question of kelp.  Kelp bulks as largely in the life of the people living in the Gaeltacht as fisheries.  There is an item, subhead E (3) in the Estimates, dealing with the purchase and disposal of kelp.  I put it to the Minister that the price at present fixed by his Department is between £3 and £4 per ton; so I was informed by a person who has had some dealings in kelp in Galway, but I do not actually know the figure myself.  I put it to the Minister that the least price that will yield a reasonable reward for labour in the kelp industry is £6 per ton.  I put it to him that that figure was put up to the Department by some person whom the Minister or the Department asked to advise on the matter.  I am aware the Chilean intervention has made the production of iodine from kelp uneconomic, but here we have a situation which makes that situation operate with peculiar emphasis.</P>
    <P>The alternative to the gathering of kelp, for hundreds of people on the west coast, is idleness.  There is nothing else for them to do.  We should balance the cost of keeping those people in idleness, on outdoor relief plus unemployment assistance, against any loss which might accrue by paying an uneconomic price for kelp.  In fact, those people, who ordinarily gather and burn kelp, will have to be maintained for part of the time on unemployment assistance and for the rest of the time on relief works. I put it to the Minister that the best work he could do for these <Col N="2480" /> people would be to have a guaranteed price for kelp with this proviso, that the Department would buy that kelp on the condition that it was of fine quality and that the people addressed themselves to turning it out in the best style in which kelp can be produced.</P>
    <P>There was always the danger that kelp would deteriorate as produced by people along the Western seaboard.  It was an obvious danger that people would put kelp of under quality on the market.  It was even known that stones were introduced into the bulk of the kelp dishonestly.  That happened only on rare occasions.  I put it to the Minister it would be money well spent if he would buy kelp even at the uneconomic price of £6 a ton, turn it into iodine, and put it on the market and charge the difference up to such money as he might ask the Executive Council to provide out of Relief Votes ordinarily spent by the Board of Works.  The carrageen situation has become very different under the Minister's administration from what it was.  Perhaps he would give some explanation.  It was pointed out at the Public Accounts Committee last year, or perhaps the statement appeared in the current report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, that the Minister bought carrageen moss in France to supply the demand made upon his Department by the Beggars' Bush board.  I would ask the Minister why he found it necessary to go to an external source to meet the requirements of these people.  Surely the difficulty has been to provide sufficient employment for people gathering kelp and gathering carrageen along the Irish coast.  It may be that some circumstances arose that made this buying necessary, but without some further explanation it looks very odd in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General that the Minister had to go abroad for supplies when he finds it extremely difficult to employ carrageen growers in this country.  I regret to say that, so far as our experience in the West of Ireland goes, the activities of the Gaeltacht Department seem to be dwindling.  The hopes and courage of the people were buoyed up by extravagant promises made on behalf <Col N="2481" /> of other Departments, that the bogs were to be turned into gold mines and that factories were going to spring up in every direction.  For the performance of these promises, the Minister, fortunately for himself, is not responsible. For the making of them his name will vigorously endure throughout the Rosses and Gweedore for a long time to come.  These promises were made, as I have told the House, to the obligato of brass-band music and the flickering light of torches carried throughout the Rosses.  It was easy to make the promises, and they were much appreciated when made.</P>

The electors of West Donegal will want to know from Deputy Brady, Deputy Doherty and Deputy Blaney what has become of the glorious promises that were made by the Minister for the Gaeltacht.  I suggest to their colleagues on the opposite benches that they should take steps to invite Deputy Blaney, Deputy Brady and Deputy Doherty to come in here to-morrow and ask the Minister what has become of those rosy promises.  They will have to go back to West Donegal.  They will have to stand on the hustings on which they stood before and, unless I am greatly mistaken, the Minister for the Gaeltacht will not stand with them.  He has made his last demarche with brass bands and torch lights in West Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that these brass bands have very little to do with the Estimate but the sad thing is that the people of Donegal did not realise that at the time.  They thought that these brass bands and torch lights were to go on for ever.  They thought that wherever Senator Connolly was to be, brass bands were bound to be. They have discovered their error.  I am now emphasising that the brass bands and torch-light processions have given way to this dismal business of the Gaeltacht Estimate.  There are no brass bands or torch-light processions attending Senator Connolly on the Gaeltacht Estimate.  There is only Senator Connolly and the Gaeltacht Estimate.</P>

      <P>All the Minister had to offer us was a doleful dirge.  We have to console ourselves with a single &ldquo;caoiner&rdquo; on this Estimate.  But the people need not abandon hope.  The Minister, when discussing the Land Commission Estimate, was careful to emphasise that preferment in this State was available strictly on the basis of merit.  If the Minister ambitions preferment&mdash;it would be perfectly legitimate for him to have that ambition as a man in the public life of the country&mdash;I suggest that he must look to his merits.  He must realise that unless he can do better for the people entrusted to his charge than he has succeeded in doing up to the present, he cannot hope to climb.  He is, in fact, very likely to fall, and to fall to a place from which he will never return.</P>

      <P>Only three minutes remain before reporting progress and I cannot say very much in three minutes.  I may, however, refer to two points.  To Deputy Dockrell, I can say that the figures for stock, as taken on the 31st March, 1935, were £21,800. <Col N="2484" /> On the 31st March, 1936, the figure was £26,300.  I want to emphasise that, under regulations now in force, these commercial accounts must be prepared for the Department of Finance and laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <P>Before discussion of the Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are not bound to submit the figures to the Department of Finance until some time about September or October. What I am in a position to give the Deputy now is the result of a rough trial balance.  The Deputy will know what I mean by that.  One other observation of the Deputy I want to correct right away.  The Deputy spoke about the development of the market for tweeds.  The actual sales of tweeds in 1935-6, at £17,589, showed an increase on the sales of the previous year of £6,935.  I should like to make clear that that did not include very much of the old stock, most of which had been disposed of in the previous year.  Production wages on weaving in 1935-6 amounted to over £2,400, as compared with about £800 in the year 1934-5.  I do not want to flatter the Department or the workers but I do think that these figures are creditable. I shall deal at greater length with the technical matters mentioned regarding homespuns.  I hope also before finishing to-morrow to deal mildly and gently, and in that unctuous way which I am accused of having, with the various remarks made by Deputy Dillon.</P>
