When replying to Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Gay Mitchell on a number of recent occasions, I have stated that there is a growing tendency across parts of the country, especially in Dublin city, for difficulties to arise at community level regarding this issue.  Tensions may arise for a number of reasons, which is understandable. However, there is no reason for some of the comments and slogans which have appeared.</P>

Given the fact that 800,000 people born in Ireland are living in Britain we should be the last people to raise an issue of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the proposals which were unveiled by the European Commission last July for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in the framework of Agenda 2000.  These outline Commission proposals, present challenges and opportunities and constitute the most important issue facing Irish and European agriculture.</P>
      <P>The proposals are designed to address the implications of enlargement of the Union to include ten Central and East European countries and Cyprus, and analyses and forecasts of world agricultural markets which suggest that surpluses could re-emerge on the Union market, particularly in the light of further possible trade liberalisation resulting from the next round of WTO negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> In June l993 the Heads of State and Governments of the member states decided the ten central and east European countries could in principle join the Union if they fulfilled the economic and political conditions associated with membership. The Commission has examined the structures in these applicant countries and recommends in Agenda 2000 that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus can meet the criteria for entry in the medium term.  The remaining five applicant countries are unlikely to meet the criteria for some time.  The Commission recommends that accession negotiations should begin next year with the six countries which can meet the criteria for entry in the medium term while negotiations with the remaining five countries can commence as soon as they are ready.  The European Council will make a decision on the Commission's recommendations when it meets in Luxembourg next month.</P>
    <P>With enlargement, the number of consumers will rise by 100 million to around 500 million. Consumers in central and eastern European countries have, on average, only one quarter of the purchasing power of the average EU citizen and average expenditure on food still represents for them a far higher proportion of total household expenditure.</P>
    <P>Agriculture plays a much greater role in the economies of these countries.  More than 20 per cent of their workforces, on average, are employed in agriculture, compared to an average of 6 per cent in the EU which in recent years has done a great deal to facilitate their integration. Serious problems remain to be tackled, particularly in relation to the structure of primary agriculture and the food processing and marketing sectors.  That is why the EU is offering technical assistance and advisory services.</P>
    <P>In spite of the structural deficiencies throughout the agriculture and food sectors in these prospective new members of the EU, it is clear they have enormous potential to increase food production. While it is difficult to predict precisely when this will occur, one thing is clear &mdash; it will happen.  The EU must take account of this fact as it looks at policy adjustments into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals have been considered by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in recent months.  At its most recent meeting last week, the Council agreed on conclusions for submission to the European Council which is due to meet in Luxembourg next month.  Spain disagreed with that part of the conclusions dealing with the Agricultural Guideline.</P>
    <P>Among the conclusions were that the model of European agriculture must be versatile, sustainable and competitive.  It must be capable of conserving nature and responding to consumer concerns regarding food quality and safety, environmental protection and the safeguarding of animal welfare.  This model of European agriculture <Col N="1076" /> would serve as a reference point for the thrust of the applicant countries' agricultural policies and provide a powerful force for integration in an enlarged Union.  The long-term outlook for the main agricultural markets given in Agenda 2000 was an acceptable working hypothesis and, without reform, significant surpluses could emerge.  In those circumstances, the reform process which commenced in 1992 should be continued and deepened.  The framing of a rural development policy had an important role to play in preserving and creating permanent jobs on and off farms.  Agricultural regulations and procedures should be streamlined with more subsidiarity for member states &mdash; the arrangements to be established should not distort competition nor lead to renationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is important to have adequate and suitable resources available to complete the reform process and achieve the desired model of European agriculture and to retain the Agricultural Guideline, as a ceiling, in principle and as presently calculated.  The Commission should frame its proposals as quickly as possible on the basis of this agreed approach.  The Commission is expected to table detailed proposals in the first quarter of 1998 in light of the outcome of the European Council.</P>
    <P>Any estimate of the net effect of the Agenda 2000 proposals on Irish agriculture has to be regarded with extreme caution and is crucially dependent on future market prices which are notoriously difficult to forecast.  Even if it is assumed that market prices for the three commodities concerned &mdash; beef, milk and arable crops &mdash; will fall by the precise amount of the proposed reductions in support prices, difficulties will still be encountered in arriving at a reliable estimate.  There is the question of which rate should be used for the conversion of ecu values to Irish pound values; the difference could be as big as 8.5 per cent between the two extreme options available.  There is also the simple fact that the Commission's proposals are incomplete and the crucial details which could affect significantly their impact are unknown.  For example, we do not know what proposals the Commission will make, in the form of measures, to encourage extensification or environmental preservation and enhancement.</P>
    <P>With these qualifications, the net effect of the proposals on prices and premia could be a loss of the order of £125 million a year.  This tentative estimate is based on what is known of the proposals on market supports; it does not take account of the effect of changes in Ireland's receipts under the structural heading where the Commission's proposals are less developed.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, between now and the emergence of the Commission's detailed proposals and in the subsequent negotiations that will follow at the Council of Ministers, to ensure that not alone will losses not accrue for any sector of Irish agriculture but that the final outcome will be positively advantageous for Irish farmers individually <Col N="1077" /> and provide a platform for the further development of the food industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to discuss briefly the main areas of interest to Irish agriculture in Agenda 2000. Before dealing with the main elements I wish to set down a number of principles which will govern my approach in the forthcoming negotiations: first, farmers' incomes and the economies of rural areas will have to be protected &mdash; this will require, among other things, full and permanent compensation for price reductions; second, the system of compensation will have to be fair and equitable &mdash; the economic interests of member states in the product areas concerned will have to be fully respected and one type of production should not be disadvantaged by reference to another; third, the system of compensation should be defended vigorously in the next round of World Trade Organisation negotiations.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the Commission has proposed that the support price of beef should be cut by 30 per cent, that the various beef premiums, including a new beef premium for the dairy herd, should be increased and that intervention should have a reduced role.  These proposals follow the route charted by the MacSharry reform proposals in the beef sector and would result in a balanced EU beef market based on increased domestic consumption and greater penetration of non-EU markets without the aid of export refunds.</P>
    <P>These proposals are of crucial significance to us given the central importance of beef production to the economy.  It accounts for over one third of agricultural output.  We export some 90 per cent of annual output, making us the largest net beef exporter in the northern hemisphere. Given our dependence on export markets we are uniquely sensitive to the nature of EU support arrangements.  This was clearly demonstrated when the latest and worst BSE crisis broke in March 1996.</P>
    <P>While Ireland accepts the need for reform we have a number of serious concerns which have been expressed at the EU Council of Ministers. The litmus test not alone for Ireland but for all member states is whether the Commission's proposals, if implemented, will restore balance to the market and sustain producers' incomes.</P>
    <P>The proposals are designed to increase beef consumption in the EU by reducing prices, while at the same time enabling beef to be exported to third countries, the South East Asian market in particular, without subsidies, thereby avoiding WTO constraints on subsidised exports.  Beef consumption in the EU should increase if the price is substantially reduced but it is difficult to predict by how much.  It is also debatable whether the EU can achieve the level of export market penetration envisaged with the level of price cuts proposed.  Much will depend on the price structures and production potential of the EU's major competitors.  Given the uncertainty, the future EU beef regime must retain an adequate safety net.  Reliance on aids to private storage, as envisaged by the Commission, would not be adequate <Col N="1078" /> in difficult market circumstances and where major market imbalance remains a threat.</P>
    <P>Another key element for consideration, in relation to the future direction of the beef regime, is the maintenance of a reasonable income for European beef producers.  I will be seeking to ensure they are compensated for any cut in price. The final agreed package must ensure that extensive grass-based systems are not disadvantaged as against the more intensive bull producing systems in the EU.  The proposed increases in premiums, as they stand, are biased in favour of intensive beef production.  It would be a mistake to maintain that bias in the final package.  Extensive methods of beef production which are environmentally friendly must be encouraged now more than ever.  I note that the Commission will reflect on how incentives to production can be improved.  I await its detailed proposals with interest.  In addition to seeking enhanced arrangements for extensive production, we shall be seeking appropriate measures to safeguard heifer beef production which would be endangered by a 30 per cent price reduction.</P>
    <P>Under the reform proposals, while premiums will play an increasing role in beef producers' incomes, I am concerned that the level of efficiency at farm level remains relatively low in comparison with other sectors.  Teagasc has shown there is major scope for improving incomes through the efficient utilisation of grass and the use of high quality silage leading to enhanced animal performance and reductions in the cost of beef production.  In a trading environment where prices will continue to remain under pressure it is incumbent on producers to improve their level of efficiency.</P>
    <P>The outline framework for reform of the dairy sector in Agenda 2000 is: an extension of the quota system until the year 2006; an improved flexibility and simplification of the common organisation of the market; a gradual decrease in support prices by an average 10 per cent over the period and the introduction of a yearly direct payment of 145 ecu for dairy cows, adjusted to average yield, in addition to a payment of 70 ecu per cow in respect of the dairy herd's contribution to beef production.</P>
    <P>The Commission claims that its proposals represent a cautious approach and that such an approach is justified because expected market developments do not require extreme measures. However, the Commission clearly indicates that, in its view, the present system, with its intrinsic rigidities, cannot last forever.</P>
    <P>Despite the rigidities associated with strict supply control, the quota regime has largely benefited the dairy sector since 1984.  In general, the operation of the quota has maintained high income levels among dairy farmers.  Of equal importance to Ireland is the role that the milk quota system plays in maintaining viable farming activity in less advantaged rural areas through instruments like restructuring and the temporary leasing scheme as well as ring fencing quota in <Col N="1079" /> these areas.  In general, the quota system has been a successful tool of economic development in rural areas.  For these reasons, I agree with the Commission's analysis that there is no immediate need to make changes to the quota regime.  If change is required, it would be preferable to signal it well in advance to allow the EU dairy sector and individual producers to adapt and assist longer-term planning.  Commission analysis suggests that the world market for certain dairy products is expanding.  I broadly share this view and believe this will continue to be the case in ensuing years.  It is commercially and economically important that the European Union maintains a strong presence in that growing market. Any retreat from this position over time would seriously undermine the long-term viability of the European Union dairy sector.  Any changes to the current system designed to enable the European Union to enhance its presence on world markets should not result in a worsening of the income of dairy farmers.  Therefore, an overriding principle is that any price reductions, or other changes having an adverse effect on price, should be accompanied by an appropriate direct aid system. While this principle is explicitly accepted in the outline proposals, detailed clarification is still required on the actual level of, and mechanisms for, compensation likely to be paid across member states.</P>
    <P>In relation to the arable crops sector, the key element of the Commission proposals is a reduction of 20 per cent in the intervention price with only half of this being compensated for by way of an increase in area aid payments.  The new rate of aid would be 66 ecu per tonne applicable to all crops including oilseeds, linseed and protein crops and also to &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo;.  It is also proposed that these payments would be reduced if market prices remain at a higher level than currently foreseen.  A top-up of 6.5 ecu per tonne is proposed for protein crops.  Aid for silage maize and other silage cereals would no longer be payable. The standard rate for &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; would be set at zero instead of the present 17.5 per cent.  Voluntary &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; would be allowed and the &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; areas would receive the non-crop specific payment rate of 66 ecu per tonne.  Penalty &ldquo;set-aside&rdquo; would be abolished.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals stem from its analysis that intervention stocks are expected to reach some 58 million tonnes by the year 2005-2006 unless some reform of the sector is undertaken.</P>
    <P>While the predicted growth in world demand and price trends would facilitate the disposal of increasing quantities of cereals without export subsidies on the world market, one cannot escape the conclusion that there is indeed a clear risk of a return to substantial levels of intervention stocks with resultant strains on the EU budget and its capacity to fund adequate levels of support for farmers in all sectors.  However, if the Commission's response is to be accepted, price <Col N="1080" /> reductions must be fully compensated so that growers' incomes are not reduced.</P>
    <P>Mainstream agriculture will remain crucial to the economic and social fabric of rural areas for the foreseeable future and, therefore, market policies will remain of the utmost importance. However, other measures are required to enable farmers and rural dwellers to enhance their incomes and thus enable them to remain in rural areas.  Therefore, given past trends in numbers employed in agriculture, the proposals for an increased emphasis on rural development in Agenda 2000 are necessary and welcome.</P>
    <P>I also support the idea of integrating environmental goals into the CAP and the best way forward in this regard is the strengthening and extension of existing measures aimed at maintaining and enhancing the quality of the environment in general.  Budgetary resources will need to be made available for targeted agri-environmental measures and for the maintenance and promotion of low input systems as it is unrealistic to expect farmers to produce quality food in an environmentally friendly manner while ignoring the cost factors and effort involved.</P>
    <P>The CAP has already been subject to extensive reform which is set to continue.  It is in the interests of Ireland and other member states that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  However, it must also be done in a way which ensures that the principles of the CAP &mdash; the cornerstone of the European Union &mdash; are preserved, that the interests of member states are taken into account in a balanced way and, above all, that the incomes of farmers and the viability of rural communities are fully protected.  While the general direction of the reform has been put forward by the Commission in Agenda 2000, I stress that a huge amount of work at all levels of the decision making process will take place before final decisions can be taken.  That is why I am initiating a process of consultation so that Ireland's input to the negotiations can be based on the widest, best expertise available and on the views of those who have a direct stake in the outcome of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>We are in the process of setting up four consultative groups, one each for beef, milk, cereals and rural development, on which we shall invite farmers, processors and others with a direct interest, in addition to academics, to serve.  These groups will remain in existence for the duration of the negotiations.  I expect an expert input from them so that the strongest possible case can be advanced in defence of Irish interests.</P>
    <P>I am glad the House is being given an opportunity to debate these very important proposals.  I look forward to a constructive debate and assure Members that, as I prepare for the next phase of negotiations, I shall be happy to take on board any suggestions they may put forward which would be of assistance in advancing the interests of Irish agriculture and of rural areas generally.</P>

      <P>Without implying anything about what the Minister of State may have said, or will say, I should point out that this debate had been signalled for over a month, that we did not fix the date and considered it important that the Minister for Agriculture and Food be present. However, the Minister of State has explained that is not possible.</P>
      <P>I will deal later with the position in regard to Agenda 2000 but, as stated by our spokesman on Finance, I want to refer to the Estimates for 1998. The climate in which the 1998 Estimates were prepared was one of the most favourable any Government could find itself in.  Due to fancy financial engineering it is difficult to work out some of the figures but, as pointed out by Deputy Noonan yesterday, in real terms current spending will increase in 1998 by £900 million pre-budget. One could argue that figure but that is the approximate position.  How can the Minister for Agriculture and Food justify reducing the Estimate for Agriculture in this climate?  It defies understanding by me and by farming interests.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has been made aware of that by representatives of the IFA, the ICMSA and others who have spoken to us in strident terms in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>To put this matter into perspective, if the 1997 outturn, including last week's Supplementary Estimate, was simply increased by 2 per cent for inflation, the figure would have been £757 million for 1998.  The reality is that the figure is reduced to £735 million which is a decline of £22 million at a time when every other sector is doing relatively well &mdash; some are doing exceptionally well &mdash; and when more money is being pumped into other Departments.</P>
      <P>This Government came into office on a high note for agriculture.  Its leader and the current Minister for Agriculture and Food stomped the country for a year before the general election persuading farmers that the then Government was doing a bad job and that it would do a much better job for agriculture.  The first test of that promise is the provision of money for 1998 but the Minister has miserably failed that test.  This set of Estimates is an indictment of the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is much worse, however, when one examines where the cuts are taking place. There has been a cutback of £34 million in the headage scheme.  On farm investment including <Col N="1082" /> the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes, which are essential for farmers, there has been a cut of £30 million.  Installation aid and other structural improvement schemes have been cut by £5 million.  The farm diversification scheme has been cut by £1 million.  That is a total of £70 million in cuts under those four headings.  It will be impossible to contemplate the position in 1998 if those cuts are not restored. That is the reason I am so disappointed the Minister is not here today because it would be fairer to direct these comments at him rather than at the Minister of State, Deputy Davern.</P>
    <P>Further cuts are being made in the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes at a time when brucellosis is in danger of overwhelming our brucellosis free status in the European Union.  I hope that will not happen but it is a possibility and a cutback in that area seems particularly inappropriate. There is a rather sinister cutback of £7 million under the heading of administration.  We tend to applaud Governments which cut back administration but if one examines this in greater detail, it becomes obvious that the cutback is in the IT area.  I suspect that is a cutback in the computerisation of the beef herd which is so essential for the quality improvement scheme introduced last year.  The provision for that scheme is very small and that too is a retrograde step.</P>
    <P>On the Estimates, I find it extraordinary at this time that the Minister appears to be so ineffective in dealing with the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Santer proposals and the Estimates are distinctly linked because the proposals pose a future threat to farmers.  I ask the Minister of State to relate to his master in the Department that next week will be the last opportunity to put back into agriculture urgently needed money not included in the Estimates.  It must be put back particularly into areas to which his party and his partners in Government committed themselves unequivocally prior to the last election.  I refer specifically to headage payments, the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme and installation aid for young farmers.  Those four items were committed to in writing in replies given by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to IFA questionnaires sent to all parties prior to the last election.  The answers are unequivocal.  The Government has <Col N="1083" /> reneged on those commitments in the Estimates and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to relay this message to his master in the Department and to the Minister for Finance and request that moneys be restored in next week's budget for headage payments as well as the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes.  Only existing applicants for those two schemes are currently being funded, and no further applicants will be accepted from 1998.</P>
      <P>Installation aid for young farmers has been referred to by our party and others.  An unequivocal undertaking was given in writing to Macra na Feirme before the election but that was shamelessly reneged on by the Minister last August.  In examining the budgetary figures for agriculture next week, it is necessary to acknowledge the critical state of the brucellosis scheme to ensure there is no shortage of funds to maintain our status.</P>
      <P>The farming organisations, particularly the IFA and the ICMSA, have made a strong case for a substantial number of issues to be included in the budget.  These include the maintenance of lower tax rates, wider tax bands, improved personal allowances, capital allowances, farm machinery allowances and a possible countryside renewal scheme similar to the seaside resorts and urban renewal schemes which have been so successful and which rural areas have been deprived of for so long.  They also want issues relating to pensions, stock relief, etc. to be included.  Those are a range of reasonable measures, some of which would not cost much.  At a time when the Estimates for Agriculture have been ruthlessly cut back and the Minister for Finance is awash with money in relative terms, farmers in particular are entitled to a reasonable slice of the growing national cake under the headings I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural sector faces other difficulties not related to budgetary matters but linked in the longer term to what is happening in regard to Agenda 2000.  Last week in his Supplementary Estimate the Minister included a figure of £24.5 million under the heading of agri-monetary compensation. That was the figure for which I understood the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Yates, had got Government approval subject to its approval in Brussels.  Under that heading of £24.5 million the Minister includes the words &ldquo;and weather damage measures&rdquo; which presumably relate to grain farmers.  He appears to be robbing Peter to pay Paul.  That figure was put forward by a previous Minister to compensate farmers for EU currency revaluation.  Of the £24.5 million, £17 million was intended for the beef sector and the other £7.5 million was intended to be divided between the milk, grain and beet sectors.  The Minister seems to be saying that part of that money will be used for the special compensation for grain farmers, but I do not understand what that means.  That money was intended for a different purpose to compensate producers for <Col N="1084" /> the consequences of losses arising from EU currency revaluation.  The Minister does not appear to have added anything for compensation to grain farmers who suffered severe harvest losses, particularly in the south and south-east.</P>
    <P>He has rigidly maintained the position that only farmers who failed to harvest their crops in any shape or form will be considered for any form of compensation.  However, a large number of farmers who literally broke their necks trying to harvest practically unharvestable crops will be treated differently from those who could not harvest their crops.  That treatment is inequitable.  I want the Minister to reconsider this matter to ensure equity in regard to compensation for grain farmers, to spell out the amount of that compensation and when it will be paid.  Many grain farmers have difficulties meeting their repayments to their banks.  While the banks are alleged to be sympathetic, in the end they must be paid and the farmers need that compensation.</P>
    <P>What is happening to live cattle exports to the middle east?  The Minister and his leader put down markers in the earlier part of this year that when their party came to power they would be on the plane to Cairo, Libya and the capital cities in the Middle East and beyond.  The Taoiseach has not had any input to that or, if he has, he has done so very quietly and nobody seems to know about it.  The Minister made one abortive trip to Cairo, but nothing is happening.  In response to a direct question by the IFA the Minister and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats stated unequivocally that they were committed to the restoration and maintenance of the live cattle trade and the competitive position in which that would put Irish farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any results from that endeavour or promise.  There are issues relating to payments entitlements in regard to area aid which are inflaming farmers because of delays arising from technical difficulties in the Department of Agriculture and Food and its contractors. In recent weeks Deputy Connaughton and I proposed that, as a means to overcome the cashflow difficulties that presents to farmers, payments should be based on 1996 entitlements which could be adjusted next year when the balance of payments would normally be due, but we have not got a response.  The position is not satisfactory. Many payments have been made, but some remains outstanding and those farmers are suffering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred in the Estimates debate to the cut-backs in administration which relate to the computerised cattle movement monitoring system without which talk of beef quality assurance schemes is balderdash.  We need and should have such a system and I want the Minister of State to indicate when it will be set up.  Strong representations have been made in this House on behalf of mountain sheep farmers who are suffering serious <Col N="1085" /> cutbacks in their incomes as a result of the operation of the ewe premium.  The Government should assist those farmers by tackling the anomaly that exists in that regard.  Small abattoirs are being forced to implement onerous new regulations at a high cost which they cannot afford.  I would like the Minister to consider that area in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>One of the most critical matters facing the Government and the agricultural sector at this time is how we will enter EMU and whether we will enter it at the current rate, some other rate or critically at the central rate which would be very much to the benefit of agriculture and our economy in general.  The Minister should be at the table with his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that priorities which may suggest other rates of entry should not be allowed to overshadow the fact that it is vital for Irish agriculture and our economy in general that we enter EMU at the central EMS rate which would substantially benefit Irish agriculture and increase our competitiveness, not only in agriculture but across other sectors of the economy.  The Government will need to be vigilant about that.</P>
    <P>On Agenda 2000, I recognise we are in the early stages of the development of the Santer proposals, but I am concerned by many of the comments I heard about its consequences, the long-term ones in particular, for Irish agriculture.  I know the Minister and the Government will do their best for the industry, but that might not be enough.  I am not an expert in this matter, not yet anyway, but I have read what was said by some independent sources inside and outside this country. I accept what the Minister said that it is difficult to be precise about figures and that various factors can change matters.  Martin Varley, an economist with ICOS, stated on 24 October that based on conservative figures and after the proposed reductions in prices are made and the compensation is paid there would be a net loss in production in milk of £10.6 million per annum, in beef of £86.4 million and in cereals of £8.83 million. In other words, there would be a total net loss of £106 million after compensation based on the current proposals.  In addition, if Ireland was to lose its objective one status for headage and installation aid &mdash; there is a large question mark over this area &mdash; the figure would increase by perhaps another £38 million to approximately £145 million net loss after compensation to farmers. He is an independent economist and that was his opinion.</P>
    <P>He also said that direct payments are estimated to increase from approximately 40 per cent of net farm income to approximately 60 per cent.  He continued that these developments imply that farm income would be heavily dependent on EU budget sources and it would be extremely exposed to EU and GATT changes, possibly involving renationalisation of the CAP and the removal of the green box status.  As the House is aware, this status means that in the GATT negotiations direct payments to farmers as compensation <Col N="1086" /> are not in violation of the agreement. However, that protection is only available to 2003.  After then, direct compensation to farmers will be under attack in the World Trade Organisation and the negotiating positions of Australia, New Zealand, America, Canada, etc.  The suggestion that the compensation, regardless of whether it equals the loss, is permanent misrepresents the position and misleads farmers.  That is a serious difficulty with this entire matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Martin Varley continued that the proposals would significantly reduce the market reward for the production of quality food.  If the direct payments were to become decoupled from production in the next WTO agreement, it would exacerbate the reduction in the incentive to produce the current volume of output.  This would be a serious disincentive for young people going into agriculture.  That was his view but an even worse view was put forward at the seminar by a senior representative of the British Department of Agriculture and Food, Mr. John Slater. He said that supports should be adjusted progressively so that EU producers could compete in world markets, reliance on intervention should be reduced and set aside and quotas abolished.</P>
    <P>The British position is that complementary measures should be introduced to ease the immediate impact on farmers' incomes but any adjustment aid should be temporary.  Mr. Slater went on to state that there are some indications that the Commission views these measures as an interim step over the longer term.  If that is not a code word for temporary rather than permanent compensation, I do not know what is.  I fear for Irish agriculture if that is the case, as it appears it will be.</P>
    <P>Mr. Slater also stated that it is difficult to envisage permanent payments being acceptable politically in Europe.  After adjustment periods, those remaining in full-time farming should be able to compete more effectively in a freer market. However, there will not be many of them. Although that view is not universally accepted, and will not be accepted by Ireland, it indicates how Britain, which is a large player in the EU, considers the position in the future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Con Lucey, the distinguished IFA economist, prepared a paper last September.  Although he stressed that it was his view rather that of the IFA, he is a significant voice in agriculture.  He said that if he was looking for a slogan to describe the most important influence on EU agricultural policy in 25 years, it would be that the GATT changed everything.  He stated that levels of import protection, export refunds and permissible direct payments are increasingly determined in Geneva, not in Brussels.  He continued that a high level of dependence on direct payments increases the political vulnerability of the CAP.  For example, market supports through import tariffs are generally not viewed as subsidies whereas direct payments are viewed as such.  They will be subject to political pressures for their reduction in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> I recently attended an ICOS conference on this subject.  The most interesting speaker by far was the agricultural attaché from the German Embassy in London, Mr. Richard Peters.  The Germans, who are paying the piper, have a different view of what is happening.  In relation to Agenda 2000 proposals, which he criticised, Mr. Peters said:</P>
    <P>Agenda 2000 advocates drastic cuts at a time when world markets, particularly for cereals and dairy products, are generally viewed to be encouraging.  Secondly, it abandons the principle that price cuts should be matched by full compensation to farmers.</P>
    <P>That is the German view.  He continued:</P>
    <P>German farmers' incomes would be considerably affected and, in a worse case scenario, would fall by 15 to 20 per cent.  Furthermore, farmers and their families would in future rely predominantly on direct income support which could make CAP after the year 2000 very vulnerable to political interference.</P>
    <P>Mr. Peters made some revealing comments at the conclusion of his paper:</P>
    <P>The German Government's underlying concern is the impact the proposals if accepted might have on farmers, especially in terms of morale.  These reforms would trigger the biggest change ever in modern history of income support for farmers who in future would be rewarded for their work predominantly by social welfare and no longer by the marketplace.  As we see it, what is needed is above all a thorough assessment of the impact the envisaged reforms will have on European agriculture.</P>
    <P>Farmers expect answers to the following questions: do we need a substantial and rapid price reduction?  What are the implications for the Internal Market?  Why are farmers not entitled to full compensation?  What can be done to ensure that direct income payments are not eroded in future world trade negotiations?</P>
    <P>What Europe first and foremost needs is to define a negotiating position which meets the requirements of European farmers according to their structure and the environment in which they operate.  In our view this position has to be based on the indispensable elements of community preference, internal price support, supply management accompanied by full compensation of farmers in case of price reductions.</P>
    <P>That is the German view.</P>
    <P>On 19 November the Council of Ministers produced a paper which has been referred to the Heads of Government meeting in December.  If ever I read bureaucratic gobbledygook that was it.  The Spaniards refused to accept it while the other 14 member states, including Ireland, agreed to it.  I read it carefully but it does not mention anywhere that compensation will equal the cutback <Col N="1088" /> in prices, despite the fact the Minister said this morning and the Taoiseach said at the recent ICOS conference that our position was that compensation must equal price cuts.</P>
    <P>I fear for the future of the Agenda 2000 proposals because of the varying views which exist. They represent a serious threat to farmers and I regret to say that the Government has not yet grasped the importance of this nettle.  It is falling into the trap of stating that it accepts the principle and fighting round the edges about compensation. However, the principle is at stake.  The Germans are not happy with it and they are paying the piper.  We should be cautious about accepting the principle.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that advisory groups from within the industry will be set up and I hope that will help him.  However, I fear we are going down this road too quickly and that we are depending on compensation equal to price cuts.  That compensation will be under continual assault in the World Trade Organisation discussions in the future and inevitably it will be eroded for the reasons outlined by the commentators I mentioned. We must be extremely vigilant.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on the proposals unveiled by the European Commission last July for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy within the framework of Agenda 2000.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing this important matter before the House as it is timely and opportune for us to initiate debate on the matter.  However, this is only the beginning and there is a long way to go.</P>
      <P>I will try to be as positive as I can in regard to matters which are important in the national interest and for the continuation of family farms. In 1992 the CAP was reformed by then Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, the purposes of which were to maintain the maximum number of farm families; to have a supply of food at an affordable price for the Community; to deal with surplus production in grain, beef and milk products; to take care of the environment and to ensure a supply of good quality food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CAP reform has failed to deliver in its efforts to maintain the maximum number of farm families as evidenced by the rate at which people are leaving the agriculture industry in Ireland and I will return to that later.  It has also failed to provide food at affordable prices for consumers as evidenced by the continuing decline in beef consumption. At that time the Commission also set out a number of other objectives &mdash; to increase competitiveness internally and externally to ensure that EU producers would take full advantage of positive world market developments; to <Col N="1089" /> aim for food safety and quality which are fundamental obligations to consumers; to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and contributing to the stability of farm incomes; the integration of environmental goals in the CAP; the creation of alternative jobs and income opportunities for farmers and their families and the simplification of EU farm legislation.  Any individual who has examined the latter would say that goal has not been achieved but it is an area in which the Minister of State is interested.</P>
    <P>There has been some success dealing with the surplus in various products but very little overall when it is looked at in a global context, particularly when it is considered that the EU expects 1.5 million tonnes of beef to be in intervention by 2005.  In terms of the environment, progress has been made with the REPS and I am glad the Minister of State is confident of getting a ten year extension.  That is a good day's work and I applaud and compliment him on it.  There are a number of areas that should be refined in it and hopefully he will continue to do so.  The agriculture industry was never more aware of quality and consumers than it is now and that is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I will deal in more depth with the issue of maintaining the maximum number of farm families as there is clear evidence that CAP reform has failed miserably in this regard and stands severely indicted.  Five thousand farmers leave the industry annually in Ireland and not only are they leaving, but young people are less interested in taking up farming as a career as highlighted by the fact that agricultural colleges are not able to fill all available training places this year.  That is a worrying development, which has nothing to do with politics, and one which I am sure has exercised the minds of the Minister and his officials.  I went through the agricultural college system and found the year I spent in it to be of substantial benefit.</P>
    <P>I urge farmers to avail of such training because it will prepare them for a very technical business and one where they must have financial acumen. It is a fundamental requirement because the least one needs is a certificate or diploma in agriculture. It is also important and a prerequisite for qualifying for installation aid &mdash; hopefully it will return &mdash; and for the REPS and completing other application forms referred to so often in the House.</P>
    <P>This area needs to be examined in terms of the simplification of the forms, a quick reactive response to human errors which are made and an improvement in the appeals system which is still too slow.  Recently I raised the issue of an appeal by one of my constituents and it still has not been dealt with.  I have not brought it to the attention of the Minister of State but I will before the end of the week.  The system gets clogged up but I will not pontificate about that because I have been dealing with bureaucratic systems since my youth. Nevertheless, steps must be taken to ensure it does not take eight or nine weeks to clear up a <Col N="1090" /> genuine human error, for example, on a premium for 16 or 17 cattle.  This area needs to be tightened up.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is not seen as a career choice any longer and some farmers in my area say it is a career of last resort for them.  That is disappointing for farmers who have been entrenched in the industry all their lives, fighting to build up their holdings for their sons.  I was an agricultural consultant in the mid 1980s and, while times may have been tougher then, there was difficulty in getting young farmers to take up the reins.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme has played a positive role but the enlargement clause in it must be examined.  I acknowledge the Minister will be bringing it to the attention of the Commission when it is up for review in 1999 but he should make a strong case because it is time to eliminate it.  Likewise the taxation of inter family transfers of leases under the farm retirement scheme is an anomaly which should be challenged.  If I was a barrister I would advise a case to be taken.  I am not threatening the Minister of State, it is an objective, independent view which I hold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unfortunately, I have too much business.  However, it should be challenged. I am reminded of a farmer who retired at the end of a hard struggle building his farm up to 60 acres. He had a son-in-law who was interested in dairying but he was treated completely differently from a taxation viewpoint in regard to leasing income.  I went through the worries that exist in the Department of Finance on this issue with the Minister for Finance and I intend tabling an amendment on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  It is an unjust impediment which should be removed while there is an opportunity to do so.</P>
      <P>There is low morale among farmers, particularly younger ones, who see colleagues from school earning plenty of money looking after the Celtic tiger.  I meet parents regularly in their late 40s or early 50s who have worked extremely hard all their lives.  They are now faced with a situation where no member of their family has any interest in taking over the farm.  Many of the farms have been worked by the same families for several generations. This is more serious in dry stock farming where the average family farm income is £5,000 annually and without direct income support administered by the Department the situation on those farms would be very serious.  We should never forget there are 100,000 dry stock farmers and much of this type of farming takes place in the midlands where I am from.</P>
      <P>I want to knock the notion that people from the midlands have a wealthy background.  When I attended college the saying was that people from Westmeath were beef to the heels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>We were credited with being beef to the heels and producing Joe Dolan and while I have no doubt he is a great singer and a worthy ambassador, farmers in that area are not wealthy. In my area we finish cattle from the west.  The withdrawal of farmers from that would have a dramatic impact on people in the west.</P>
      <P>What will happen to farms if no family member takes them over?  More important, what will happen to the families who have been farming there for generations?  Only one thing can happen and that is that the farm will be bought up by someone else so that we will end up with fewer but larger farms. Family members who originally lived on the farms will move into the already overcrowded big towns and cities to seek employment.  This will have long-term devastating effects on the balance of population in Ireland and on the whole socio-economic structure of rural and urban Ireland. Often those farms are bought up by people from another jurisdiction who engage in what I call remote control farming.  Under EU laws relating to the free movement of goods and cattle, that is permissible, but it is demoralising for local people who want to buy land and who are outbid by outsiders who can pay an inflated price.  Another worrying development is that Coillte can outbid small farmers for tracts of land.  It is the reason I have called for a land agency to replace the old Land Commission.  As things are many people cannot get into farming.  That is the scene in farming today, so let no one try to tell me that CAP reform is working as it was intended to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most damning aspect of this decline in farming is that it is taking place against an annual injection into Irish agriculture of £1.6 billion from the EU.  We are getting £1.6 million which the Minister is administering and yet 5,000 people a year are leaving farming, agricultural colleges cannot fill their places, and two thirds of farmers are on a farming income of £5,000 a year.  That is the background against which we must discuss the Santer proposals in Agenda 2000.  I welcome the Minister's commitment given to me in reply to a question to set up advisory groups from within the industry and even outside to examine the impact of the Santer proposals.  Because of our position as an insular country affected by many factors that do not impact on other nations, and because of the enlargement of the EU which is imminent, we have to take careful stock of those proposals.  They are nothing short of the greatest scandal that has ever taken place in Irish agriculture. If the Santer proposals in Agenda 2000 go through, there will be devastation in farming here within five to ten years, and the knock-on effects will be felt throughout our economy because of the huge increase in the numbers of people who will be looking for off-farm employment. These will include not only the sons and daughters of farmers but also the families of the <Col N="1092" /> thousands of people in the ancillary industries that depend on agriculture for their business.  The Celtic tiger will need to have a very large litter of cubs if jobs are to be found for all of those people.</P>
    <P>Despite the obvious failure of CAP reform to maintain the maximum number of family farms over the past five years, the situation is not yet beyond repair for those families remaining in farming, and we in this House have a duty to do everything we can to rescue the situation.  Some people think farmers are rolling in money and should not be supported.  That is a simplistic view. Farmers have a fixed asset with a poor return on capital that is not readily disposable.  Do these people realise farmers are involved in providing an essential service to the community, the most essential service of all, as important and essential as electricity, health and transport?  This is not generally recognised.  In addition, the product they produce is perishable, which leaves them totally vulnerable.  A farmer cannot withhold produce from the market without facing definite and immediate financial ruin.  For example, if a manufacturer of paper finds the price of his product is depressed because of oversupply, he can withhold supply or stop making the product. Likewise, if workers in an industry are unhappy with something, they have the option of withdrawing their labour as a last resort.  Because they are producers of a perishable product, farmers do not have these options open to them.  When their product is ready for the market it must be sold to the highest bidder, whether or not it is profitable to do so.  There is therefore an onus on society to take account of these issue, that farmers are providing the most essential service to the community and that they are producing a perishable product and do not have the option of withholding their product or going on strike.  Some Deputies might not like to hear me say that farmers should be supported because they think farmers are well off; a small percentage of farmers are well off.  In my profession it is the same.  The top 10 per cent are doing very well, but at the bottom many people are struggling.  The vast majority of farmers who are extremely dedicated to their work and do the best they can are not well off and have anything but a bright future.</P>
    <P>There is still hope, and the hope is that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his officials will reject the Santer proposals in their present form.  However, it worries me that I have seen no evidence to date that that will happen in a forthright fashion.  I agree we have to accept change, and it is how we address that change that is critical, but as far as I can see, the Minister and the Taoiseach appear to accept what the President of the Commission has proposed. Do the Minister and the Taoiseach accept or reject the broad principles of the Santer proposals? Are there any proposals for dealing with the impact they will have?  The House needs to know the answer to this, and farmers need to know the answer.  If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; the <Col N="1093" /> Government will be rightly credited with giving agriculture, farm families and rural Ireland a lethal injection.  I anticipate that will not happen and the Minister, with the support of everyone in the House, will formulate a policy to deal with these matters.</P>
    <P>I referred last night to installation aid, particularly for young farmers.  It is critical to reintroduce that.  About 5,650 young farmers have availed of the scheme but, just when people had a legitimate expectation that it would continue, it was suspended.  The Minister has a case to answer.  There seems to be no funding for it from the EU, so the national Exchequer will have to come to the rescue.  The suspension of that scheme was devastating for young farmers.  I have not received more representations on any point than on this.  It will cost £5 million to £6 million per annum.  That represents 0.75 per cent of the £700 million extra tax revenue we grossed this year.</P>
    <P>There were 18,000 participants on the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  The extra £20 million will allow it to be maintained at the current rate but will not be able to cater for new entrants. That is critical in the context of the rural environmental protection scheme.  We cannot have one without the other, and the Minister should try to secure the necessary funding, and ensure that the budget next Wednesday will bring good news on both fronts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the Santer Agenda 2000 proposals and thank our main spokesperson on Agriculture, Deputy Penrose, for allowing me to say a few words about this area of greatest economic input.  Without viable agriculture there is no future for this country because we are basically an agricultural country.  In recent years there has been a tendency to forget the crucial significance of agriculture to our economy and to rural Ireland.  The agricultural industry has been hit by a series of crises in recent years, for example, the beef tribunal &mdash; there is still a trail of bad meat going back to that period &mdash; the BSE issue, which unfortunately deteriorated again this year, and the inclement weather, particularly in the south east, which destroyed many crops. These crises have distracted the public's attention from the very important discussions on the future of agriculture and rural development, which are part of the Santer proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals emanate from the agricultural strategy paper submitted to the Madrid Council. They seek to continue the process initiated by the then Agricultural Commissioner, Ray MacSharry, during the Uruguay Round.  In summary, that process involves the substitution of price support with income support to tackle over-production within the Union and to increase the demand for products within the Union and internationally. Some people regard the forces which drive change in agriculture as inevitable.  The World <Col N="1094" /> Trade Organisation talks about the Union's capacity to support exports to third countries.</P>
    <P>The requirements of consumers of agricultural products are changing rapidly.  For example, consumers now demand increasing standards of quality and specialised methods of production.  While these changes present Ireland with huge opportunities, they also require change.  The farming organisations are extremely worried about these changes.  They do not know what proposals the Government will put forward at the Council of Ministers and cannot analyse them.  Their experts and analysts have come across figures which have frightened many farmers.</P>
    <P>There is a growing concern about the environment among farmers and the public generally. I am disappointed at the lack of involvement by the Government in the control of farm pollution scheme.  It is essential that inspectors have the necessary facilities to inspect works so that payment can be made to enable farmers implement very important changes which will prevent pollution. These developments have prompted considerable changes in agricultural practices.  At times farmers are blamed incorrectly, even by officials, for causing pollution.  Many people in the Department are quick to criticise farmers who cause pollution but very slow to give them assistance to rectify the problem.</P>
    <P>The number of farmers in this category is considerable. Like County Westmeath, my constituency is regarded as very wealthy.  There are many small hill farmers in my constituency on the side of Sliabh na mBan and the Galtee Mountains from Glencushabine to Cahir on one side and to Brackbawn and Skeheenarinky on the other.  All these people depend on sheep farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a list of clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold clinics and get a few votes there.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a reply given by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to a parliamentary question which dominated the minds of some people in the media this morning.  He said that the highest amount paid to an applicant in respect of instalments of the l996 ewe premium was £49,648.70 and that this involved 2,546 ewes.  That payment included £14,000 paid under the rural world premium scheme.  The difficulty with giving such figures is that people believe all farmers receive payments of this magnitude.  As the Minister stated in his reply, this was an exceptional case and the average amount paid in respect of all instalments of the l996 ewe premium was £1,871.  This is equivalent to approximately £40 per week, £27 a week less than what one would receive on social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When my party whip referred to the figures given by the Minister he was accused of saying that hill sheep farmers received similar payments. He wants to ensure that there is a cap on very large payments so that the money can be spread <Col N="1095" /> more evenly among all farmers.  We all want to sustain smaller farmers in agriculture.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the Commission believes reform of the CAP is inevitable is the pending enlargement of the Union.  The Minister also referred to this point.  In the previous Dáil I was chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and at meetings countries involved in the enlargement process confirmed they would make no demand on the resources of the Union for their agricultural industries because there was such a disparity between them.  It will be many years before all of them qualify for payments under the Common Agricultural Policy.  These countries depend on agriculture and if they immediately qualified for payment it would put an enormous strain on the Common Agricultural Policy.  We must not lose any of the benefits we have won for our farmers at difficult negotiations merely because of enlargement of the EU.  This is a simple case of the more affluent EU countries refusing to support the newcomers.  The payment of CAP supports at current levels would create enormous inequalities in terms of income for Eastern European countries in particular and undermine political stability.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this debate on the Santer proposals, which spell out in some detail the broad ideas on CAP reform, the crucial debates will take place in the Agricultural Commissioner's office, at the Commission, with Commissioner Fischler and at the Council of Ministers.  It will take several months to analyse these detailed proposals. Yesterday in the Seanad the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, said that the Santer proposals represented opportunities and challenges for us.  He may be right but we will depend to a large extent on the Government's ability to lobby its friends in the Commission.  There is little evidence that the Government's negotiators have won any new friends in the Union.  One of the reasons for this was the decision by us to agree to the abolition of installation aid for young farmers. I am surprised the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and others allowed this to happen.  The sooner this aid is reintroduced for young farmers the better.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Penrose, I welcome the decision to establish consultative groups in the areas of beef, milk, cereals and rural development.</P>

Farmers are walking out of meetings because of the inactivity of the Government on payments, the farmers' charter <Col N="1096" /> and so on.  Those are matters for which Fianna Fáil always fought but now that it is in office it has done nothing about them.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this very important debate.  I am glad the Government facilitated this House with the debate because during the course of the last Government the only time we debated agriculture issues was when the Fianna Fáil Party took the initiative and put down motions during Private Members' time.  A much wider debate is needed among the public on Agenda 2000.</P>
      <P>The Santer proposals are not only significant for farmers, they are of the utmost importance to the whole economy.  We are fortunate Deputy Joe Walsh is Minister for Agriculture and Food.  During his previous term in that Department he achieved many successes for the agriculture industry, both in his work at home and as a member of the Council of Agriculture Ministers of the European Union.  The Minister of State, Deputy Davern, has always been a champion of rural development and agriculture.  I am sure both Ministers will be vigorous negotiators on behalf of Irish agriculture at the Council of European Ministers.  Successful negotiation of the Agenda 2000 proposals is needed to ensure agriculture and food remain the cornerstone of the economy in the future.  Farming, agriculture in general and the associated food industry has the potential to contribute to economic growth, which is essential if we are to have a dynamic rural society.  Strong leadership and effective negotiation is needed at ministerial level and I am confident the Ministers will have the determination and capacity to achieve those objectives.  This country must be to the forefront in advocating policy changes that suit the agriculture industry rather than accept policy handed down by policymakers in Brussels. At times such policy has been anathema to the interests of Irish farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1097" /> Agenda 2000 is a far-reaching document which has serious implications for this country.  It is basically a set of proposals mapping out a strategy for the European Union for the period up to the year 2006.  The framework and strategy includes consideration of, among other things, enlargement of the European Union, future financing of the Union and preparation of policies to bring the European Union into the next century.  The review of the Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period after 1999 and the review of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be impacted upon by the impending World Trade Organisation round, are of crucial concern to us.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the common currency, the euro, implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty and enlargement of the Union, with 11 countries from central and Eastern Europe seeking membership, change will be the order of the day.  The Agenda 2000 programme is an ambitious plan which outlines the process to expand membership of the European Union to 21 members early in the new millennium.  Publication of the European Commission proposals, which are general in nature, must be welcomed so that a comprehensive debate can begin on the future direction of European Union Structural Fund programmes, Common Agricultural Policy, the European budget and European enlargement.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the Common Agricultural Policy the European Union must bear in mind that the agriculture and food industry are vitally important sectors of the Irish economy, which are directly responsible for a large proportion of the country's total employment and export earnings. Agriculture remains the key element in underpinning the economic and social fabric of our rural areas and most of our medium to small-sized towns.  The well-being of the agriculture sector is strongly influenced by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy.  The influence of the Common Agricultural Policy is not, however, confined to Ireland's farming or rural community.  The huge transfer of resources to this country under the Common Agricultural Policy, amounting to more than £1,500 million in 1997, continues to be a major factor in generating strong economic growth and increased employment levels, which have been a feature of our economy in recent years.  That funding comprises compensatory payments and funding for the further development of the agriculture and food industry.  It must be remembered that those funds are of crucial importance to rural and urban Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that those interested in the future of agriculture and economic development participate actively in this debate so that the advances made during the 1992 reform process are safeguarded and further changes in the organisation of the CAP are in line with the needs of agriculture and the wider economy.</P>
    <P>The Commission's document contains a series of ideas for the future development of agriculture policy, many of which are controversial and some <Col N="1098" /> of which, if implemented, would have far-reaching consequences for farming.  The Commission's document marks the starting point of a long process of debate, discussion and negotiation which will culminate in a Common Agricultural Policy geared to meet the challenges posed by an enlarged European Union of up to 30 member states.  The emerging Common Agricultural Policy is an issue of vital national interest for Ireland. Debate and discussion must be provoked between all interested parties and I hope clearly defined and broadly similar objectives will be achieved for the future of the Irish and European agricultural sectors.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, in regard to a wide-ranging consultative process.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the European Union will not be possible without reform of the CAP.  While it can be argued that the agricultural sector needs to become more competitive and must change to take account of varying circumstances such as European Union enlargement and world trade conditions, it is vitally important to adequately compensate farmers for price reductions.  Agriculture is of crucial importance to those countries seeking membership of the Union, with more than 20 per cent of their workforce on average employed in agriculture compared with an average of 6 per cent in the European Union at present.</P>
    <P>The final proposals on the beef sector must ensure, in achieving market balance, the income of producers is protected.  I am concerned about the apparent bias in the Commission proposals which favours intensive beef producing systems, which is in marked contrast to our traditional and much superior grassland-based production system. There are indications that the dairy market will expand and the European Union must make every effort to increase its market share.  The Commission proposal on direct payments to farmers must be an essential element of any new overall agreement.  Farmers must have guarantees of direct income support at adequate levels over the medium to long-term if they are to be in a position to plan for the future.  We must put in place a stable long-term support system for our family farms and avoid possible re-nationalisation of the CAP.  To ensure the continued viability and expansion of Irish farming, the milk quota system, which has benefited the dairy sector since 1984, must be retained.  Direct income supports for family farms must be expanded, particularly where producer incomes may decrease.  Attempts to reduce the CAP's share of the European budget must be resolved and the proposals to renationalise the CAP must be defeated.  Since our accession to the EU we have consistently opposed efforts to renationalise the CAP on the basis that such a development would be in the interests of farmers from the larger and more affluent economies only.</P>
    <P>The milk quota system is crucial to less advantaged areas and mechanisms must be strengthened to retain quota in those areas.  The dairy sector <Col N="1099" /> is of particular importance to my constituency and obviously it would be difficult to obtain an increased national milk quota.  Efforts must be made to distribute additional quota to small and medium sized producers to bring those farmers' incomes up to a viable level.  The question of young farmers and new entrants to the milk sector must also be addressed.  Many young farmers take over relatively underdeveloped holdings with limited development options.  Adequate provision must be made in the negotiations to ensure access to quotas and production rights by qualified new entrants.</P>
    <P>Women have played a key role in agriculture which, to a large extent, has not been recognised. This is an opportune time to outline proposals to support women in agriculture.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister to involve women in the consultative process he announced this morning.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister laid down the principles that will govern his negotiation, namely, the protection of farmers' incomes and the economy of rural areas and a fair and equitable compensation system, which should be defended vigorously in the next round of WTO negotiations. Rural renewal and regeneration is essential for the future operation of the Common Agricultural Policy.  In my constituency, particularly in west Cavan, rural development is not assisted by increasing levels of afforestation.  Far too often farmers, particularly young farmers, have been denied the right to expand their holdings by forestry companies buying land that adjoin their holdings.  In many cases purchases by forestry companies &mdash; often international companies &mdash; have denied those farmers the only hope of making their small or medium size holdings viable. An effective land policy is essential if we are not to have blanket afforestation and depopulation in many rural areas.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister urgently consider lifting the suspension on the control of farmyard pollution scheme?  That scheme is of particular importance to my constituency where the drumlin soil is not free draining, agriculture is intensive and farmers want to put in place proper on-farm facilities to prevent pollution.  The farmers I represent have small to medium sized holdings and cannot afford the huge expenditure involved unless they get grant assistance.  The reintroduction of that scheme is crucial.</P>

      <P>Given much of the media coverage in recent days, it is essential that we adopt a sensible approach to these proposals.  It is important that the agricultural sector is not vilified on the airwaves, as the intensity of the argument tends to be misdirected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" /> I represent a constituency where agriculture is very important.  That sector has benefited &mdash; perhaps even more than the fishing industry &mdash; from the European Union.  I appeal to the Minister to look after small farmers, for many of whom headage and compensatory payments are the only lifeline.  While I accept there are some large farmers in the Finn Valley, the majority of farmers I represent are hill and suckler cow farmers, most of whom work part-time because they have no other choice.  It is vital that compensatory and headage payments are paid to them first.</P>
    <P>We in the Border counties will seek Objective I status.  Many people are seeking additional funding and delineation for the type of area in which they farm.  We must copperfasten the status of such areas, particularly in the Border regions.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes must be guaranteed under the Santer proposals.  It is proposed to introduce compensatory payments for the beef industry, with a proposed reduction from 84p to 60p in beef prices.  Many consumers at local and European level would be pleased with such a reduction but, as producers, farmers will want compensation for that loss of income.  I hope future proposals will be to pay full compensation for any decrease in incomes.</P>
    <P>While I am not a great proponent of intervention, it has been an escape valve for many producers and I hope it is not abolished in any future proposals.  If intervention were not available when crises arose in the industry, farmers would have faced serious difficulties.  We know to our detriment that some third country markets have not been as successful as we would like.  We must expand our markets to other third countries, particularly to the Far East which would be a massive market for Europeans.  However, that market may not be sustainable in five or ten years' time or we may not be able to compete with other countries, in particular, New Zealand. We must increase our market share, but there must also be a safety valve, such as intervention, for times of crisis . To abolish intervention would be a detrimental step for beef producers.  I speak in particular for those producers because there are practically no cereal growers and very few milk producers in Donegal.  The small producers should benefit from any proposals made.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's speech that intensive farmers may benefit most from the Santer proposals. I am not particularly enamoured with intensive farming but it will develop in the community. What we have been able to promote, however, is good Irish beef, a grass-based product which should be supported.  Whatever is decided, smaller grass-based producers should be supported over and above whatever is given to intensive farmers.</P>
    <P>We must protect farm incomes and provide full and permanent compensation for any loss.  That compensation must be fair and equitable and if it must be targeted, so be it.  Perhaps we should examine the overall agriculture budget as regards targeting premia to the small producer.  We must <Col N="1101" /> support efforts to increase beef consumption in the EU and worldwide.  I welcome the discussions announced by the Minister and when they take place I hope everyone is involved, including the consumer, the producer and all organisations. Resulting from that the Government should have a full, well-researched proposal for stable farm incomes.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food should be here.  The media should be present also.  One problem facing farming organisations and politicians is that it is difficult to put across anything said about agriculture in this House.  A debate as important as this should be better covered.</P>
      <P>It is not so much that agriculture is at a crossroads but in a <i>cul de sac,</i> where we have few options.  We have one chance of gaining major influence in Europe and we can only hope that Europe can influence the world thereafter.  That is a big story and we may have to return to it on another day.  I am worried about statements emanating from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  What was said on &ldquo;Today with Pat Kenny&rdquo; yesterday was amazing and I have to assume that the views expressed on that programme were those of the Minister.  If they were, many farmers will be extremely disappointed.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election, the IFA &mdash; which is represented in the Visitors' Gallery &mdash; the ICMSA and other bodies asked us for our views on the shipment of live cattle.  It was the express view of all parties, certainly of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, that everything would be done to maintain live exports, not least to maintain competition with the factories.  It is my understanding that at a meeting of a Kildare farm organisation last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

However, he also said that as far as he was concerned we might be better off without the Egyptian trade because the return to the Irish producer was only 17 pence <Col N="1102" /> per pound and it might be better to process the meat in Ireland.  If that is the case it is a serious matter for every farmer.  I will not be shouted down but if I am wrong I will accept it because I was not at the meeting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven or eight points we must watch in the Santer proposals. Farmers not only in Ireland but across Europe should be worried.  Many people who are not farmers and do not even like them but live in their communities should take great interest in these proposals because they will affect their cash registers.  There should be a concerted effort across rural Ireland, involving trade unions, commercial life and farming interests, to help the Government get across to our partners that there is a certain level below which we will not go.</P>
      <P>We live in a global village and farmers in Carlow, Limerick and Cork have little enough influence on matters which affect them, whether here, in Brussels, or in the GATT negotiations on world trade.  We need to exercise the type of influence we are not showing at present to ensure our vital national interest is protected.</P>
      <P>Our 150,000 farmers can be divided into three broad categories.  About 50,000 are small farmers who find it difficult to make a living and would not survive but for off-farm income; this is the group I know best.  Another 50,000 farmers are almost viable and the events of the last two to three years, under various Governments, have created many problems for them.  The final group is the 50,000 commercial farmers and despite my background it is this group I worry most about if the Santer proposals are implemented.  If I can receive 86 pence per pound for my cattle at a factory today and if I have to sell them eventually for 62 pence, I must accept that I will incur a debt, forgetting about the compensation.  I am proud to be a farmer but that has a demoralising impact on me.  Like thousands of other farmers, I want to operate at a profit.  If prices drop for livestock farmers, cereal growers and dairy farmers &mdash; perhaps to a lesser degree for them &mdash; our farming community will be demoralised.  Commercial farmers are our powerhouses who compete with people all over the world.  If their hands are tied, given that farming exports are perhaps ten times more important to us than to other countries, our vital national interests are under threat.  This is why all our guns must be blazing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen many agreements and rows in Brussels and at home.  It is the easiest thing in the world to promise compensation but where will it come from and at what level will it be set?  It may be set at 86 to 90 pence per pound but as farmers <Col N="1103" /> we argue it should be set at £1 per pound.  More importantly, as speakers on both sides asked, will it be the lowest common denominator?  In other words, it could be a very low level of compensation. Do we take it that German taxpayers will continue to foot the bill at a time when seven or eight countries, which are much poorer than us, are entering the system?  That is the big question. We should put down a marker that we need a safety net.</P>
    <P>Has an impact study been conducted of how much extra meat we would sell at home or abroad as a result of the 62p rate?  What difference would it make?  Even if the rate were 62p in the pound, how much would Irish consumers have to pay? From past experience, it will be much more than 62p.</P>

      <P>The Government's position in this important debate does not encourage me.  In fact, it is in the weakest possible position.  In the five months since the Government came into office, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, has welshed on ten commitments in the two parties' programme for Government.  When it comes to breaking faith with the electorate, the Minister for Agriculture and Food is an even bigger offender than the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We seem to have a Government which treats even its own commitments with zero tolerance.</P>
      <P>I will list the broken promises.  They concern the level of headage payments, the young farmer installation scheme, the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the dairy hygiene scheme, prioritising the resumption of live cattle exports, changes in the management of export refunds, extensification premia for sheep, increasing the rural world premium, the establishment of a grower acreage register and amendments to EPA licensing provisions for pig production.  Those are the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;ten sorrowful mysteries of Irish farming and they have left thousands of farm families without a prayer.</P>
      <P>For example, the total allocation for headage payments in 1998 is £31.4 million below the 1997 level, a reduction of over 26 per cent.  That is nothing less than butchery of the incomes of thousands of the lowest income families in the country.  This is the first Government in my memory which has launched such a deliberate and callous attack on rural Ireland and the living standards of rural communities.  It is doing nothing to increase public comprehension of what is involved.</P>
      <P>I was appalled this morning to hear the most ignorant and ill informed discussion on headage payments between Pat Kenny and Deputy Stagg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I do not mind Pat Kenny, but the ignorance in Deputy Stagg's case was culpable.  He occasionally holds himself out as a defender of small farmers. He pretended not to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a former Labour spokesman on agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should be quiet because he was glad enough of him at one stage.</P>
      <P>He pretended not to know that this income is taxable and that the sheep are sold from time to time.  He seemed to think they spend their days like the Ride of the Valkyries, forever wandering around in substantial clouds in the mountains.  It was outrageous for a Member to indulge in such pretence on the public airwaves.</P>
      <P>At a time when structural change in farming is so rapid and when the pressures for further change are building up, the axing of the young farmer installation grant scheme is incomprehensible and indefensible.  I now hear mutterings from Government Deputies that the scheme is being reviewed.  It certainly needs to be reviewed but not in this way.  In my experience, no young farmer who acted outside the terms of the scheme has benefited from it.  However, it is also my experience that many young farmers who qualified for the scheme have been excluded.  In at least one case, a young farmer was excluded from that scheme and a person in an appropriate relationship to him was excluded from the farm retirement scheme, despite their having meticulously consulted the appropriate authorities and followed their advice.  Any honest review of this scheme would rectify these glaring omissions rather than simply axing it, as now appears to be the case.</P>
      <P>The two parties in Government committed themselves to reopening the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the dairy hygiene schemes.  As matters stand, the existing provision for those two schemes is sufficient only to meet the commitments made to applicants who have been accepted.  It allows no room to reopen the schemes.  There has been controversy about these schemes in the past, mainly because the level of uptake was greater than expected.  That level of uptake reflects how seriously the farming community has taken to heart today's justifiable concerns about human health and the health of our environment.</P>
      <P>I cannot imagine the Minister for Agriculture and Food did not have some understanding of that when he entered that commitment.  It is even possible the Progressive Democrats understood it.  However, the two parties solemnly wrote into their programme for Government an undertaking which they clearly had no intention of honouring. Even for Fianna Fáil, that is a rare refinement of cynicism.  For the Progressive Democrats, who hold themselves out as a policy driven party, it is another illustration of the fact that all that drives them these days is a slavish and subservient sycophancy to their manipulative masters in Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> In the meantime, rural Ireland bleeds.  Our Government has now put itself in the worst possible position for the negotiations which will be so crucial to the future of Irish farming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Dukes and Connaughton for allowing me to express some of my concerns.  The Santer proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are not only of interest to those employed directly in agriculture but also to many people employed in rural areas in agri-related industries.  The proposals represent a real crossroads for agriculture.</P>
      <P>Deputy Penrose referred to 5,000 farmers leaving the land every year.  One of the cornerstones of the reform of the CAP must be to ensure that as many people as possible are allowed to earn an income from farming.  Any analysis of those who have left agriculture in recent years will show that most of those who are forced to leave are small dairy producers.  The reform of the CAP offers significant opportunities to improve the lot of small dairy quota holders.</P>
      <P>Prior to the last election, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, made a commitment to increase the production base of Irish agriculture.  Surely that commitment could entail using the Santer proposals to secure additional milk quotas for small scale dairy producers.</P>
      <P>I regard the Santer proposals as an interim step because the quota regime will possibly be dismantled early in the next century.  It is opportune to begin that phased dismantling now by securing additional quotas and distributing them to where they are needed most.  None of the instruments used by the State to date to reallocate milk quota, such as tribunals, clawback, flexi milk or temporary leasing, has put small scale milk producers into a situation where their livelihoods are not threatened by the quota regime.</P>
      <P>Given that quotas will probably be discontinued early in the next century, we must be aware that we have had our hands tied behind our backs.  While our production has been restricted, our competitors on the world markets have unlimited production, particularly countries such as New Zealand and Australia.  The phased dismantling of the quota regime, which is part of the Santer proposals, must be used to secure additional production rights for small scale milk producers.</P>
      <P>I accept there is a downside in that it may lead to price reductions for producers.  However, we must focus our attempts to secure additional quota rights for small scale milk producers.  The Santer proposals are the appropriate opportunity to do that.</P>
      <P>I regret I do not have time to elaborate in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes outlined a number of broken promises by the Government, all of which are significant in terms of the commitments given to agriculture.  However, they will pale into insignificance in the context of the prospects and livelihoods of many thousands who are currently <Col N="1106" /> employed in agriculture if the Minister's efforts on the Santer proposals to secure the livelihoods of those employed in agriculture, especially small scale dairy producers, are not successful.</P>

      <P>Farmer bashing appears to be the main priority in the discussions on national radio over the past couple of mornings.  I was angry to hear a Deputy from the same county as myself display such ignorance about agriculture on &ldquo;The Pat Kenny Show&rdquo;.  Farmers work within a system of rules laid down by the EU.  They are productive by nature but they are restricted to working within quotas which have been in operation for a number of years.  Deputy Penrose should brief Deputy Stagg on how the system works.  The 40 and 50 year old sheep which one sees travelling through Connemara or the Wicklow mountains are the ones to which Deputy Stagg referred this morning.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 proposals presented to the President of the EU Commission on 16 July are only outline proposals.  We must wait until January for the details.  However, even the outline proposals have far reaching implications for Irish agriculture, the rural economy as a whole and national expenditure.</P>
      <P>This issue will affect the lives of us all during the period 2000-6.  It behoves us to be vigilant regarding the progress of negotiations at EU level and to have well thought out strategies which will offset the impact of price cuts on beef, milk and cereals on the rural economy.</P>
      <P>The Santer proposals contain four interrelated measures: first, proposals to the member states on the financing of the EU budget for the period 2000-6, including the financing of enlargement to the east; second, the EU strategy for enlargement, including the opening of negotiations early next year with five countries of central and eastern Europe &mdash; the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus; third, proposals for further reform of the CAP in the period 2000-2, taking account of the enlargement agenda as well as the next world trade board and market constraints; and fourth, proposals on the EU Structural Funds in the period 2000-6, taking account of enlargement and the state of the EU budget.  The proposals recommend that the ceiling on the overall EU budget will continue at its current level, equivalent of 1.27 per cent of EU GDP.  While it will grow in line with economic growth in the Union, there is no specific increase to finance the proposed enlargement of the Union.  This is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That no new resources are proposed for the EU budget to cope with the enlargement of the five eastern European countries and Cyprus is <Col N="1107" /> unrealistic.  The experience of East Germany, where massive budgetary resources were required to support development for a population of just 20 million, proves that an EU enlargement to include an additional 63 million people cannot be achieved on the cheap.  Without extra EU budgetary resources, the cost of enlargement will be borne by the existing net beneficiaries of EU transfers and the impact of the Santer proposals will be more severe on Ireland than on any other member state.</P>
    <P>Enlargement to the east is basically a political and security agenda driven by Germany in particular. It is extremely worrying that the Germans will not countenance any increase in the EU budget to facilitate enlargement and that, along with the Netherlands, they are currently challenging their net contribution to the EU budget.</P>
    <P>The proposals to reform the CAP further &mdash; CAP Reform II &mdash; are made against the background of looming over supply on EU markets. The problem is most acute in the beef sector as a result of a decline in beef consumption resulting from BSE.  Commission forecasts in the absence of further CAP reform indicate a substantial build-up in beef and cereal stocks over the next few years, as well as some market problems in the dairy sector.  As a result, the EU Commission is proposing to cut beef support prices by 30 per cent, cereal support prices by 20 per cent and dairy support prices by 10 per cent during the period of the reform.  Although there are no proposals to cut sheep prices, these will inevitably fall in line with lower beef prices.</P>
    <P>Farmers are to be compensated for these cuts by increases in direct payments, but the losses will not be fully compensated for in the beef and cereal sectors.  The proposed 20 per cent cut in cereal prices has serious implications for grass-based agriculture.  Cheaper cereals would make grain-based livestock and milk production much more competitive than grass-based production, which has always been Ireland's greatest advantage in international markets.</P>
    <P>The proposed price cut in beef and milk as well as cereals implies a rapid reduction in export refunds after June 2001.  Ireland has a very high dependence on export refunds which means that this kind of adjustment process will be more painful and costly for this country.</P>
    <P>Another major worry for Irish farmers is that the Santer proposals in the beef and grain sectors will cut prices to below the cost of production. When prices are lower than production costs, direct payments become more than 100 per cent of the net farm income.  In this situation, it would be more profitable for many farmers not to produce anything.</P>
    <P>The impact of the outline proposals has been variously estimated as representing a cut of between £100 million and £150 million in farm incomes.  The impact could be even greater when we see the small print in the detailed proposals next January.  It is certain that the income of all <Col N="1108" /> the grain growers, both winter and spring cereal producers, will be cut without full compensation and that there will only be 70 to 80 per cent compensation for the proposed cut in the beef sector.</P>
    <P>We must insist that there should be no price cut without full compensation.  The Germans and French have already expressed serious reservations about aspects of the proposals and we should consult these important member states to find areas of common ground.  Realistically, I do not see any major progress being made in advance of the German general elections next October, so time is on our side to get the kinds of changes we need.</P>

      <P>The Presidency of the EU will pass to Germany in the first half of 1999 and Finland in the second half.  The real negotiations on Agenda 2000 will take place in 1999, with a decision likely in December of that year.  This will tie in with the timetabled discussions for the next round of the World Trade Organisation.  It should not be forgotten that the price cuts proposed by Santer are, to a large extent, driven by the next World Trade Organisation round.</P>
      <P>The failure of Chancellor Kohl's coalition Government to return to power after the German elections would have a huge impact on the future of the CAP.  The alternative SDP-Green Government would be likely to reduce support for agriculture, both in Germany and throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>The impact of the Santer proposals on the dairy sector is limited compared to beef and cereals but we must wait for the small print next January.  It appears as if the quota regime will last at least until 2006.  If so, flexibility will be vital to allow young and small dairy farmers to get sufficient amounts of milk quota at lower cost.  While the EU Commission has ruled out a B quota for milk, which is regrettable, it is prepared to make the quota system more flexible.  This may involve leasing land in certain circumstances, which would be a good thing if it was properly thought out and administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Santer proposals involve significant changes to the future funding arrangements for measures covered by Structural Funds.  The proposal to incorporate headage under the guarantee fund could result in reductions in headage if the fund is not enlarged to take the increased costs into account.  On the other hand, the inclusion of headage under the guarantee fund could make headage more secure if sufficient funds are provided to meet the increased cost in all member states.  The proposal to link headage payments to <Col N="1109" /> areas of high amenity will result in cross-compliance in sensitive areas</P>
    <P>Early retirement, forestry, REPS and Leader will continue and there will be closer links between CAP and rural policy.  The linking of CAP and rural development could have a negative effect on the CAP budget, as rural development is likely to be in a position to obtain more funds to encourage farmers to secure off-farm employment and the creation of employment opportunities in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We must strive to ensure additional funding for rural development is not at the expense of the Common Agricultural Policy and structural supported measures.</P>
    <P>While Ireland's status in relation to Structural Funds after 1999 is not clear, my understanding is that a new status, Objective 1 and transition, will apply to the country or to some sub-regions yet to be defined and agreed.  It can be anticipated that Objective land transition status will mean a lower EU funding rate and a lower percentage EU refund rate which in turn would have implications for the operation of key farm and rural development schemes after 1999.</P>
    <P>The Santer document also reveals that the Commission is planning to put a CAP or a ceiling on the amount of direct payments any single farmer can receive.  The Commission proposes to give member states some flexibility in deciding rates of direct payments and ceilings on direct payments without commonly agreed rules.  While Santer states this does not mean rerationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it will involve some threat to the principle of a common policy in a single market.</P>
    <P>The path mapped out by the Commission is moving prices to world market levels and compensation has far reaching consequences for the future of agriculture in Europe.  Questions which must be asked about the future policy are: can the compensatory payments for price cuts in Agenda 2000 be paid on a permanent basis?  Are we in danger of seeing a rerationalisation of the Common Agricultural Policy with an envelope of money being provided for each sector in each member state?</P>
    <P>In the forthcoming negotiations on the proposals, we must be mindful that Ireland will continue to need a corps of strong commercial farmers with the capacity to compete under WTO free trade rules at world prices.  We need this to keep as many farm families as possible on the land and to allow the food industry to be in a position to continue to export successfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous Members I offer my support to the farming community.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe, for allowing us to put forward our points of view to the Minister and the Minister for Finance in the run-up to the budget next week.  I have no doubt he will listen carefully to us.  It is important that <Col N="1110" /> agriculture is not only seen to be doing well but is doing well.  That cannot be said and farmers will testify to that.</P>
      <P>In discussing the Santer proposals we must see what they are and how they will affect us.  As the previous Deputy said these are outline proposals which map out a strategy for the EU for the period up to 2006.  We understand the Commission wants a broad acceptance of the overall strategy and the principles involved.  The strategy has three main strands: enlargement of the EU, future financing of the Union and preparing EU policies for the next century.  The Commission say this approach is necessary because of the need to implement the political decision already taken by the European Council to enlarge the EU: to renew the EU's financing arrangements for the period after 1999; to review Structural and Cohesion Funds for the period after 1999 and to further reform the CAP, not least because of the impending WTO round.  Given the obvious links between these needs the Commission took the view that it should put them all in one package. In comparison with the Delors I and Delors II packages we have a considerably more complex set of measures to grapple with.  If we include the link issues of implementing the Amsterdam Treaty, the advent of the Euro and the need to complete the reform of the EU institutions, it is clear we are moving into a period of tremendous change, which the Commission considers will make for a wider and stronger Europe.  One part of that change will come through enlargement, to which Deputy Power referred.</P>
      <P>The Commission takes the view that the next financial agreement should cover a seven year period from the year 2000 to 2006, inclusive.  As regards the Structural and Cohesion Funds, Agenda 2000 proposes some important principles. Much detail has still to be spelt out, such as a definition of the different objectives and the base year or years for assessing GDP and GNP levels.  There will be an overall increase of 75 billion ecus for structural policies from 200 billion ecus to 275 billion ecus.  Of this 230 billion ecus will go to the existing 15 states with 45 billion ecus going to pre-accession aid and aid for the new member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, the strategy is to build on the MacSharry reforms in key market sectors, to strengthen rural development policy and to take more account of the environmental dimension.  Even if enlargement were not on the agenda, there would still be a need for the further stage of reform.  Analyses of world agricultural markets has led the Commission to conclude it must avoid creating surpluses which it would be unable to get rid of, to become more competitive on the world market and while doing so to guarantee farmers an adequate income.  I emphasise this is important. In this way CAP reform will help to achieve a long-term viable and competitive agricultural sector. The key aims for CAP are: greater competitiveness on the internal market and abroad, a fundamental <Col N="1111" /> commitment to food safety and quality, safeguarding an adequate standard of living for people working in agriculture, incorporating environmental goals into the CAP, creating alternative sources of income and employment in rural areas and simplifying EU agricultural law.</P>
    <P>The actual substance of the key proposals, in the main sectors of interest to Ireland, is well known: cuts of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, in the milk, cereals and beef sectors; the milk quota system will be retained; the impact of cuts on farm incomes will be compensated for by means of additional or new premiums.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry approach has meant balanced markets and considerably lower intervention stocks in most of the sectors concerned.  EU spending on agriculture as a whole has stabilised and is within the agricultural guidelines.</P>

      <P>At a time when farm incomes are being reduced, even though almost every other sector is experiencing income growth, it is incomprehensible that spending on agriculture in 1998 is to be reduced by £35 million, a drop of 9 per cent.  This is a dismal effort and will do nothing to restore the confidence of the agricultural community. Allowing for the inevitable variations under individual subheads and the transfer of the forestry division to the Department of the Marine, there is no sustainable argument for reducing spending on agriculture at a time of falling incomes and uncertainty.  Despite unprecedented buoyancy, the Minister has failed dismally to convince his Cabinet colleagues that many farmers face uniquely difficult conditions.  Far from reducing expenditure on agriculture the Government should do the opposite at this critical juncture.</P>
      <P>The Minister has failed hopelessly to deliver on his pre-election pledge to farmers and seems to lack clout at the Cabinet table and the European Commission.  He should take off the kid gloves and inform his counterparts that agriculture is our primary industry.  We are not responsible for the wine lake or the citrus fruit mountain in Europe. We produce clean agricultural products, of which we should be proud.  We are the only remaining island nation in the EU since Great Britain was connected to the Continent by the channel tunnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Minister and his team of experts have not secured preferential treatment for farmers.  He must drive home the message that they are labouring under a disadvantage. Headage payments must not be reduced as they are farmers' only source of salvation.  No live cattle have been exported to the Middle East since 10 November 1996 when the last shipment left Greenore.  The Minister has failed hopelessly <Col N="1112" /> in his efforts to have this market reopened.  He does not seem to have the will to fight his case in Europe.</P>
    <P>Farmers are receiving 86p per pound for beef. Under the Santer proposals, if implemented, they will receive 62p per pound.  They are pawns in a game played by bureaucrats throughout the world.  The time has come to engender sanity.  The Minister should act before it is too late.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Sheehan for sharing his time with me and three of my colleagues. That is an indication of the level of interest on this side of the House in the Santer proposals. More time should have been provided for what is an important debate.  The consequences of these proposals for agriculture are frightening if implemented in their present form.  If we are to succeed in mounting a challenge and changing the thinking behind them we will have to be wholehearted in our efforts.</P>
      <P>I am more than concerned at the propaganda emanating from the Department.  I regret this as I have a high regard for the Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe, who have both been successful in farming.  Yesterday on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; the Department's PR person instead of defending the system distorted the facts in relation to the headage payments made to farmers.  I do not know his name or if he is one of the officials present in the House but he seemed to suggest that as farmers were in receipt of a bonanza of millions of pounds they should say nothing.  Why should they remain silent?  The payments are not illegal.  They are entitled to receive them and they form part of their income. Farmers would much prefer to receive a fair price for the goods they produce and forget about compensation but this is no longer possible under the MacSharry reform package.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the price paid to the farmer should be reduced to the world level.  This is nonsense as one cannot sell below cost.  If one is required to do so one must be compensated. There should be no hidden agenda.  The propaganda emanating from the Department to the urban dweller is that farmers are ripping off the system.  If this continues we will not be able to mount a proper campaign against the Santer proposals and to defend the right of farmers to earn a livelihood from their holdings.</P>
      <P>Companies such as Sisks do not represent the interests of those involved in the building industry. Dunnes Stores and Quinnsworth do not represent the interests of small retailers.  Likewise in farming the four to six large players which are in receipt of substantial funding do not represent the interests of the small farmer who receives on average less than £1,500 per year from the EU.</P>

      <P>Agriculture, which is our most important industry, is being downgraded by the Government, mainly through the inactivity of the Minister.  His promises made last June and when in Opposition led farmers to anticipate boom, expansion and increased prosperity but the opposite is the case.  The Houdini of agriculture is no more, the prophet of boom is silent and the whiz kid of activity has been strangled.  He is the wrong man to be in command in this battle.  He has demonstrated in the Estimates that he is running ahead of the Santer proposals by cutting supports for farmers ahead of time.  Under the Santer proposals farmers stand to lose £150 million.  This year under the Minister's proposals farmers in County Galway will lose £3 million.  Cuts hurt. The Minister should go back to Cabinet and demand support for the maintenance of family farms.  One cannot over-state the impact Agenda 2000 and the next phase of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will have on our farmers if the Minister does not take immediate action.</P>
      <P>The rural environment protection scheme, intended to assist small farmers to improve various aspects of their farming activities such as the management of the countryside, the control of pollution and so on, has proven to be a huge disappointment in implementation.  Departmental officials encouraged their participation and it had a reasonable uptake until red tape and the inability to deliver on its provisions led to the Department being brought to court regularly when applicants challenged its officials' interpretation of various aspects of it.  The most recent case was the shared commonage problem, settled out of court, in the case of approximately 60 farmers, mainly in the west, after a long battle and failure on the part of those same Departmental officials to accept that they could be wrong on occasion.  This excellent scheme has been badly served by them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is well aware of one case, that of a Cork farmer who opted for the early retirement scheme, with leased commonage in Bonaboy in north Mayo, a split holding.  Will he inform the House of the reasons this case has gone through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the last general election the Minister undertook to provide funds for private abattoirs here.  There were 900 of them but that has now been reduced to 400.  A sum of £20 million is required urgently for their upgrading to acceptable European Union hygiene standards to avoid <Col N="1114" /> their being forced out of existence, as have so many others before them.</P>

      <P>It is important that we be afforded more time to debate agriculture generally in coming weeks and months, a topic on which all of us could speak at considerable length.</P>
      <P>I will concentrate my remarks mainly on the debate at European level since Europe will decide the future of our agriculture industry and rural areas.  My concern is that the political compilation of this Government means it does not have real political influence at European level. For example, we know that, within the European Parliament and Commission, the solid political power blocs, namely the Christian Democratic movement and the Socialist movement make most of the important decisions, they being the main political players.  Although the Minister of State served as an MEP for some time until the electorate of Munster decided otherwise, he will readily appreciate that, unfortunately, since this Government is comprised of parties irrelevant politically at European level it does not matter. My fear is that, because of that political alliance, we do not have sufficient clout at European level. There was a time when our Taoisigh, whether Dr. Garrett FitzGerald or Deputy John Bruton, on touring European capitals, had that political clout, whereas the same does not obtain today.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to impress on his senior colleague &mdash; who appears to have become ever more removed from the practicalities of life as far as agriculture is concerned &mdash; that he should examine the Book of Estimates and the forthcoming budget in addition to the broader aspects of the Santer proposals which I predict will decimate our rural economy and rural areas generally, adding greater numbers to the dole queues.</P>
      <P>I hope the forthcoming budget will contain some good news for agriculture since the Book of Estimates presents a very dismal picture.  My final plea to the Minister is to endeavour to correct matters as speedily as possible and restore some hope to those engaged in agriculture.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said his senior Minister is extremely busy engaging in negotiations on behalf of our farmers, which is why he cannot be present.  Since the Minister of State has been a Member of the House for a long period, he will readily appreciate that it is a gross <Col N="1115" /> insult to the House, the electorate and the agricultural industry in general that the Minister is not present for this debate.  It is a grave reflection on him, since it is most important that he listen to elected representatives' views.</P>
      <P>Our farming industry is going through a very difficult period, facing obstacles on a number of fronts including declining cattle prices, harvesting difficulties occasioned by bad weather, the changes now proposed by Monsieur Jacques Santer, in addition to which the Government, in its approach, is actually attacking the agricultural industry.  I put it to the House that because of this, approximately 100 young people, many under the age of 35, leave agriculture weekly.</P>
      <P>The abolition of the installation aid scheme for young farmers constituted a scandalous attack on them.</P>

      <P>While I know the Minister will say the Government will honour applications already received, the installation aid scheme was indeed a welcome innovation which attracted young farmers into agriculture.  Its abolition is regrettable. I call on him to ensure its restoration in the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Before the last general election the Minister and his party leader promised to reinstate the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  It should be done without further delay.  The enormous cut of £35 million in the Agriculture Vote in the Book of Estimates is extremely serious.  I emphasise that our farmers are going through a very difficult period in respect of which the Minister is adopting a lethargic approach.  It is time he began taking some positive action on behalf of the farming community generally.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see the Minister of State here since he is responsible for western development, the part of the country I represent. As he will be well aware, the backbone of our western seaboard is agriculture.  If these Santer proposals are accepted and implemented by this Government some ten years hence the vast majority of farmers in my constituency will no longer be engaged in farming.  I hope the Minister will allocate funds to the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, when in Opposition, said he would reinstate the control of farmyard pollution scheme once Fianna Fáil returned to Government.  I perceive that as being impossible since some £35 million has been deducted from the Vote for Agriculture this year. I do not know where he will find such moneys. Since he is not here today, I hope he is en route to Egypt in an effort to have our live export trade, so vital to our agricultural industry generally, reopened there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> I should also like the Minister to confirm to farmers in disadvantaged areas that cuts will not be effected in headage grants after l999.  Were such cuts to be effected, farmers would quickly leave the land.</P>
    <P>This being a difficult time for the agricultural industry generally, it is in need of strong leadership. I am extremely doubtful about it at present. When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition they gave many promises on which I doubt they will now deliver.  Yet that party has an opportunity to show our agricultural community that its views are at the forefront of Government policy.  Nonetheless, a massive reduction of 9 per cent in the Vote for Agriculture for l998 does not augur well for demonstrating to the agricultural community that they have a Minister sufficiently strong, not only to represent them in Europe but able to adequately present his departmental requirements at the Cabinet table.  The future of agriculture will be in serious jeopardy unless we include proposals that will save small farmers from extinction.</P>

      <P>In all honesty, how much lower can those subsidies go?  They appear to have struck rock bottom.  They will have to be increased to maintain these people in the hills and mountains of south Kerry and other severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind that these severely disadvantaged areas were not so described simply for a laugh.  They were thoroughly examined and it is now well known that if we do not come to the assistance of the people living in these areas, their numbers will dwindle and there will be nothing left but foxes, badgers and other wild animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> Ireland receives a high level of agricultural premia, and we must attempt to direct more of that money to the people living in severely disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In 1997, factory prices for lighter lamb were on average 10p to 12p per pound below lowland lamb prices.  We are now at a point where people living in severely disadvantaged areas face a crisis.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to come to the assistance of the family butcher by providing the suitable abattoirs required to adhere to EU standards.  It does not make much sense for a man to travel from Kenmare to Mallow or Tipperary for a few carcases when he has facilities of his own which merely require to be updated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to follow in the footsteps of Deputy Healy-Rae, particularly as this is my first time to speak in the House.  I welcome this debate and compliment the Minister and the Minister of State for their interest in agriculture. People in agriculture have experienced many difficulties in the past number of years, particularly in regard to the BSE crisis.</P>
      <P>I come from a beef producing county where 60 per cent of the farmers own less than 60 acres of land.  We are all well aware of the plight of small farmers over the past few years.  It is tragic to see so many young people leaving the land because their small acreages cannot provide them with a livelihood.  That is the reason it is important that the Santer proposals should be rejected out of hand, and I know our competent Ministers will address that through the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Beef farmers have suffered enormously over the past two years.  I realise our Ministers are doing their utmost to get the ships sailing again but that is difficult when the factory owners, who are operating a cartel, pay farmers whatever price they like for their product.</P>
      <P>Many backbenchers like myself are anxious that the farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene grants be restored.  These grants are vitally important because many people cannot participate in the REP scheme if they are unable to get farmyard pollution under control.  The installation aid for young farmers is vitally important because every encouragement should be given to them to stay on the land and continue to run their farms when their parents have retired from farming.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is setting up four consultative groups in beef, cereals, dairying and rural development.  He will invite farmers, processors and others with a direct interest in these areas, in addition to other people, to serve on them.  The groups will remain in existence for the duration of the negotiations and the Minister expects an excellent input from the representatives so that the strongest possible case can be put in defence of Irish interests.  The existence of these groups will not displace the normal process of consultation with farming organisations, processors and other interest groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> With regard to the stance of the European Union in future world trade negotiations, we should learn from our experience of the last GATT round.  We should decide our reforms in advance of the next WTO round and then vigorously defend the European vision of agriculture on which the reforms are based.  It is essential that we take the initiative as that is the best way to achieve the objective.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an issue of crucial importance. The funding of reforms and the participation of new member states in the market regime must be secured.  The Commission is projecting that both the reforms and enlargement can be accommodated within the agricultural guidelines, but there can be no certainty about this.  We must ensure that adequate funding is available before we commit ourselves to proceeding further with these proposals.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome this debate on the Santer proposals.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Walsh and the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, on their activities to date in this particular area.</P>
      <P>I come from a county where agriculture is of major importance to the local economy and large and small farmers are very concerned about the proposals on the table.  While we have been told these are only proposals and there will be a good deal of negotiation between now and their becoming a reality, farmers are suspicious about what the future might hold for them as a consequence of their implementation.  They have wide implications not only for farmers but for rural Ireland.  They will affect thousands of workers involved in the food sector which is closely related to the agricultural sector.  They will affect our major national asset, our agricultural industry.  That industry is vital to our economic growth and we are very dependent on it.</P>
      <P>It is questionable if bureaucrats and policymakers in the EU have any sense of the importance of agriculture to our people.  Many of the proposals related to agriculture put forward by bureaucrats in Brussels on a daily basis are drafted by people who live in an ivory tower and do not understand the importance of the agricultural industry to our people.  Many of the proposals and regulations, particularly those related to the food sector, we have had to implement in recent years have suffocated the industry and, in many ways, have caused it to stand still.  I urge the Minister to ensure that before any long-term decisions are made on Agenda 2000 proposals a message is sent loud and clear to the bureaucrats in Brussels that our agricultural industry is our most important one.  It is important not only to farmers but to other workers in this nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a two tier farming industry made up of large farmers who have become more well off and small farmers who have been driven out of <Col N="1119" /> business.  I note in an article in today's <i>The Examiner</i> that neither of the policies of the two contenders in the forthcoming IFA challenge mentioned the plight of the small farmer.  Our farming organisations operate to a very small extent in the interest of small farmers.  That also applies to the co-operatives.  The board of the Avonmore Waterford Group has sabotaged 700 to 800 jobs as we near Christmas and they have shown little concern for the workers involved and their families. For many years I predicted that PLCs will take over from our farmers and the farming community. The leader of ICOS said last week that there were too many farmers on the boards of PLCs and that some of them should be removed. If farmers were to allow that to happen they would not have much of a future.  They must fight and become actively involved to protect their livelihoods and those of others involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>There was much shouting from members of the Opposition this morning about installation aid and farm pollution grants, but those schemes were abolished by the previous Minister, Deputy Yates.  Money was not provided in the 1997 or 1998 Estimates for installation aid.  I ask the Minister to provide for the restoration of that scheme and the farm pollution scheme in next week's budget, and I am confident he will do that.  I specifically ask him to ensure that farm pollution grants are made available to small farmers who cannot afford to implement the necessary pollution controls laid down by local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Unless small farmers are eligible for farm pollution grants they will not be in a position to continue farming and that will result in more small farmers seeking social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the beef industry which was hard hit by BSE in recent years and the abolition of the live cattle trade, another negative measure taken by the former Minister, Deputy Yates.  However, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, reopened that trade.  Deputies opposite should not shout too loudly about what the former Minister did when he was in Government. He did very little.  He worked to a PR agenda in relation to farmers from day one and did very little to back that up.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the beef industry and the dairy sector will be protected under these proposals.  The dairy sector is important to our economy, particularly to small farmers.  I hope that when extra milk quotas are allocated the ministerial regime in the Department will ensure it is specifically allocated to small farmers. During the previous Minister's term of office a significant number of farmers with milk quotas of 60,000 plus gallons were able to receive an extra milk quota yearly, but that should not be the case. Like many backbenchers I receive representations from small farmers with milk quotas of 15,000, 20,000 or 25,000 gallons who find it difficult to increase their milk quota and as a result <Col N="1120" /> they have been told by Teagasc and others, including their bank managers, that their operations are not viable.  I ask the Minister to ensure in any negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals or other proposals that he will seek to ensure adequate milk quotas for small dairy farmers.  It is important that small family farms are protected for the future and that we will not continue to generate a two tier farming industry where the well off farmers get most of the area aid payments and other EU payments while small farmers are not in a position to avail of them because they do not have the necessary funds to increase their stocks or milk quotas.  As an island nation it is important we should tell the bureaucrats that it is difficult and costly to sell our products on European markets and therefore we must be treated differently.  The bureaucrats in Brussels appear to want to move a major part of agricultural industry to areas beside major cities like London, Paris, Madrid and the large cities in Germany, which would result in this island nation being left behind.  We cannot compete on those grounds.  Therefore, it is essential we are treated differently from other countries which may want to change the agricultural proposals.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition have some cheek to criticise the former Minister, Mr. Ray MacSharry.  If it were not for his proposals and his negotiating skills in putting forward the case of Irish farmers, our farmers would be worse off.  Under the leadership and stewardship of our Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and O'Keeffe, our farmers can rest assured that when these proposals are being concluded the livelihoods of family farmers will be protected.</P>

Due to the concerns about the potential risk to human health and the environment, the EU has passed legislation covering the continued use of genetically modified microorganisms and the deliberate release of GMOs.</P>
      <P>Almost all analysis has predicted that biotechnology will be the basis of major economic growth.  According to the National Science and Technology Council of the USA, biotechnology may play a pivotal role in social and industrial advancement in the next ten to 20 years, as physics and chemistry did in the post-World War II period.  The EU growth, competitiveness and employment report makes a similar prediction. These views suggest that biotechnology must play a major part in our economic future.  Biotechnology will be a specific agent of technological change in the healthcare industry and the food and agri-business industries where recombinant crops are already widely available and successful in economic blocs other than Europe.  Such crops can satisfy public demand for tastier and more nutritious foods and for the reduction of potentially polluting inputs to crop production.  It can also satisfy industrial requirements for higher yields and quality plant extracts.</P>
      <P>In the environmental sector, an increasing range of effective bio-based technologies are becoming available for the treatment of waste emissions.  Among other benefits, these present the real possibility of regenerating current permanently polluted parts of the planet.  I do not suggest we should blindly accept genetic engineering with open arms, but it presents major economic and environmental benefits.  Therefore, a balanced approach must be taken to ensure that we can compete with the best in the world.  Previous Governments did not have a proper economic or general policy on genetic engineering or biotechnology. This also applies to the current Administration and we are losing out as a result.</P>
      <P>Europe has created a significant number of new biotech companies and jobs, although the number is considerably lower than in the USA. In crop agriculture, the EU lags dramatically behind the USA in the application of biotechnology. Of the 35 million acres of recombinant crops planted worldwide in 1997, virtually none was in the EU.  Similarly, only a few genetically modified foods have received EU wide approval despite their widespread availability in the USA and other markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> A further area of concern relates to recombinant vaccines.  A significant proportion of vaccine research is now directed at recombinant products. Their availability in the EU will have consequences for human health but also significant economic benefits for animal agriculture.  The low availability of genetically modified organism products in the EU is due mainly to the regulatory problems, which in turn are largely due to negative public attitudes.  We need high quality, high value, safe products.  This is the only way agriculture can compete in future.</P>
    <P>The south of the country benefits from high quality products in the cheddar cheese industry. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, is a dairy scientist and aware of the difficulties regarding phage and phage resistance. Many companies spend and lose millions of pounds every day because of problems with phage.  This work can be done much more quickly using genetic engineering.  However, it cannot be used in Ireland because of the regulations.  This means long winded processes must be used to come up with exactly the same product but it takes six months longer.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this area and initiate a full debate.  Everybody in biotechnology research or industry fully subscribes to the need for the regulation of biotechnology, including GMOs.  Indeed, in the early 1970s when such technology was developing, genetic engineering researchers voluntarily agreed their own controls. However, there is significant experience of GMOs and a clear picture of their potential for economic, environmental and health benefits.  It is time Ireland and the rest of Europe moved from a position of imagining the disadvantages and dangers of GMOs to realising the opportunities and benefits they can provide.  However, I am sure Deputy Sargent will disagree with me on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's call for a debate on that area and I thank him for sharing his time.  However, I disagree with his glowing welcome for some aspects of genetic engineering on the basis that they are available in the USA.  I hope we will not slavishly follow the actions of the USA because it is not America but the major commercial corporations based there which are the prime motivators behind the growing use of genetically engineered products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Naughten's first point, there is a need to introduce serious controls on labelling of genetically engineered products.  We must stress that the cause of farmers is shared by everybody. It should not be viewed as a sectional interest seeking special treatment.  People depend on food which is generated by farming on small or large scales, but they are entitled to the respect of knowing what they are consuming.  Genetic engineering must get its house in order regarding the marketing of produce.  The debate on genetically engineered products has not yet begun in terms of the ramifications of releasing organisms <Col N="1123" /> into the environment which have been tested under controlled conditions.  One cannot predict how they will react in the general environment. A debate on this aspect is much needed and long overdue.  I welcome the call for such a discussion.</P>
    <P>The background to the Santer proposals is the continuing trend, which has not been redressed by any Government, of the exodus from the land. Small farmers are being forced out of agriculture and they are the victims of the trend of the worship of free trade.  The view is that free trade is good in itself.  In the same way as people think healthy food is good, free trade is considered necessary for good health.  In farming free trade could be viewed as the cause of a great deal of problems.  Farmers, in addition to the community which depends on the food, must put the alternative view that unfettered free trade will continue to denude Ireland of its farming community and infrastructure.</P>
    <P>There are many good aspects in the Santer proposals and we must try to analyse them.  We should not throw out the baby with the bath water.  There are many environmental and conservation objectives which are required for the long-term good of farming.  It must be recognised that a balanced environment will support farming because an environment which is overexploited and ultimately unsustainable would be a dreadful legacy for future generations of farming families.</P>
    <P>There will be a reduction in farming unless environmental and conservation objectives are taken into account.  However, the free trade element of the Santer proposals will allow greater control by the United States and New Zealand, as a result of which consumers will have less control over the quality of their food.</P>
    <P>I have referred previously to the labelling aspect of genetically engineered products.  In many ways it is a continuation of CAP reform and has caused a great deal of disruption to Irish farming.  The Santer proposals will further widen the link between the primary producer, the farmer, and the consumer and it is time consumers were much more involved in this debate. The move toward more direct payments could depress the product price so far below cost that it could lead to a situation where it will be better for farmers to stay idle full time, which they do not want to do even with the set-aside provision.</P>
    <P>It is likely Ireland will lose its Objective status and the Government must put contingency plans in place on a regional basis, but this will be a difficult task based on the experience of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  We must be careful about suggestions to lump all payments and funds under one umbrella.  As always when EU bureaucrats tamper with agriculture there are anomalies.  For example, if the price of beef is projected to fall then competition will force other meat prices down and new premiums will have to increase. Will this be budgeted for on 3 December?  We have listened to promises of price reductions for consumers for many years, yet we are aware of <Col N="1124" /> their emptiness.  Another example is premium headage payments where the majority of dry stock farmers have only 20 suckler cows.</P>
    <P>Subsidies need to be examined.  I represent Dublin North, as the Minister of State will know from visiting Teagasc in Kinsealy.  There is a healthy mix of opinion extending from the north city area to the farming areas of the Naul, Garristown and Balbriggan.  The cry from urban dwellers unconnected with farming to end subsidies needs to be challenged and it is important that farmers are rational about the justification for subsidies in the long-term, not just the short-term. It is much more complex than it seems at first. If subsidies were removed from agriculture then control of food production would pass even more from farmers to the corporate sector.</P>
    <P>This is the case in the US where, under the guise of so-called free trade, support for farmers has been slashed and a far more invidious subsidisation of corporate industrial agri-companies has taken its place.  The US is attempting to force this system on the rest of the world through GATT and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. Europe is currently being subjected to covert bullying tactics to lift the ban on hormone injected beef and genetically engineered soya beans.  This dispute may soon emerge into the open through a legal case under the GATT rules and I hope that will provide a debate where Deputy Naughten and I can lock horns and investigate both sides of the argument.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons put forward by the European Commission and the Government for the proposed slaughter of two million calves at ten days old and two million weanlings at ten months old is that the GATT rules dictate that Europe must accept many tonnes of beef imports, for example, 28,000 tonnes from Argentina, while being closed out of many global export markets.  Successive Governments and the Commission have signed Ireland up for this.  How can they justify such a sell out?  Once again, the contradictions of European agricultural policy become apparent.</P>
    <P>The socialist centralist aim of producing cheap food regardless of quality and damage to the environment blends cosily with the right wing aim of handing over control of production to the corporate sector.  Where does the consumer fit in this and where is the long-term interest of agriculture when it seems that the pressure from big business interests on Governments is so great that they present this as being in support of farming?  If the agenda is being set by big business interests, generally non-Irish, it does not support long-term farming.</P>
    <P>EU schemes, as currently operated, are a series of stopgap measures designed for damage limitation. Almost all payments are based on the more a farmer has, the more he or she gets.  Only large farmers can afford to get involved in supplementary activities while small ones are deprived of the primary function of producing clean, healthy food because under these rules it becomes impossible to sustain a viable income.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> The REPS, which has most potential to help genuine environmentally friendly farmers, has also introduced the concept of ghettoization of nature by facilitating the taking of some land out of intensive production while allowing the remainder to be intensified further.  Extensification, fewer animals per acre, has been used in some cases by larger farmers to buy more land per animal and, as with new schemes, the person with large amounts of ready cash can buy into the latest one which is why the sudden closure of all on-farm investment grant schemes is a blow to small farmers in their struggle to compete in terms of quality.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Department of Agriculture and Food takes into account the increasing demand for organic produce in Ireland.  All supermarket chains say they cannot get supplies of organic produce in Ireland and must import from other countries which, ironically, are far less able and prepared as a result of environmental degradation to grow such products but which have managed to jump on the bandwagon and successfully develop an export market which we should be well capable of developing.</P>
    <P>During the recent debate on An Bord Glas, we were left without any hope of development in the organic sector.  Different types of produce were discussed but not the method of farming.  This area has potential and is badly in need of development.  Will it be possible to discuss the matter further?  The Department of Agriculture and Food is being looked to for guidance. Organic organisations depend on the voluntary input of many of their members who believe in the cause.  However, the cause is very commercial and I cannot understand why the Department has not taken advantage of and built on it.  Hopefully, the Minister of State will address this.</P>
    <P>Set-aside is a morally bankrupt system and we should argue &mdash; farmers will join with us &mdash; that it is not the way forward if we are to produce a healthy farming industry and proper community development throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements of the debate which I particularly welcome.  The first is that it is being held in Government time &mdash; over a long period most debates on agriculture were held during Private Members' time and it was difficult to deal properly with issues.  The second is that this debate is not a response to an immediate crisis which, unfortunately, has been the case in virtually all debates on agriculture over the past three years or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to set a debate on agriculture in context and, in this instance, it is in the context of the Santer proposals.  It is important to bear in mind the background of the European Union, its commencement as the Common Market after the Second World War, the food shortages in Europe, the political and economic background, the progression to the Common Agricultural Policy and GATT, and the various elements which come into play and which, in many instances, are <Col N="1126" /> substantially outside our control as a nation but which impact greatly on policy.</P>
    <P>The second context in which a debate on agriculture needs to be set is that of the individual farmer planning for the future.  That applies in particular to young people deciding whether they might be prepared to make a career in agriculture. They have to believe they can make that decision, that the decision to participate in farming in the long-term is one which is open to them. That has effects on the population and social structure of rural areas, on the economy and the social climate generally.  It would be foolish and short-sighted to debate agriculture independently of the huge industrial sector which is dependent on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>In those contexts there is a need for clear planning, which would be difficult unless done along the lines of the European Union's Agenda 2000 proposals which are commonly known as the Santer proposals.  In that context young farmers particularly face difficulties because they do not know exactly what supports will be in place for them.  Most speakers have urged the Minister to ensure, for example, that the installation aid scheme is restored.  I add my voice to that.  Also, more and more people are gradually realising that farming is an industry which must be undertaken in the context of the environment and the control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes and others that had to be suspended through lack of cash.  They should be restored, not just for the sake of the future of the development element of agriculture but for the environmental protection element, which is also very important.  In this respect the rural environmental protection scheme is extremely effective.  I suspect that it may be the direction in which supports for Irish farming may go in future.  Concerns have been expressed by many people about the long-term implications for headage payments. The truth is that the payments were substantially front-loaded, the European Union money which was provided has mostly been used up and it is now a decision for Government whether to provide State money to ensure that those payments can continue.  I strongly favour that, and I urge the Minister to take that line.</P>
    <P>One of the most likely effects of the Santer proposals will be the enormous potential to increase food production which the prospective new members have.  EU technical assistance and advisory services are already being made available to these people.  It is important that the advice and support they get does not rush them into huge levels of overproduction and factory farming which, unfortunately, would be the likely outcome if we were to go down the road of providing headage type supports which have the effect of inflating the number of animals and the amount of food coming into the marketplace and which work against the interests of the Community generally, the agricultural policy and the environment.  Also, overproduction of food would <Col N="1127" /> create trouble, not just for new entrants but for all members of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assessment of the net effect of Agenda 2000.  It is frank, objective and honest, it pinpoints the potential problems and does not seem to downplay them in any way.  It is a good starting point to consider the effects of the Santer proposals.  However, it is important that the new framework be sufficiently versatile to respond quickly and effectively to inevitable crises.  Some of these may be predictable and it should be possible at the forward planning stage to make provision for them.  Inevitably, there will be crises which nobody could foresee, and it will be vital to be able to respond quickly to these and ensure that individual farmers do not go to the wall because of a slow and cumbersome process of putting support systems in place when such crises arise.</P>
    <P>In that regard I welcome the Minister's proposal to set up four consultative groups.  It is an excellent move.  One will be dealing with the beef sector which has had more than its fair share of problems in recent times.  The assessment in relation to milk is that the quota system has been largely successful and effective and there is an apparent commitment to that for the next ten years or so.  That will be generally welcomed in our economy.  Cereal production, which is not hugely important in my area, serves as an example of the kind of difficulties that can arise, unplanned and unpredictable, as happened this year and which were responded to quickly here in terms of paying compensation to the people involved.  One of the groups will be dealing with rural development, an area in which the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, is very much involved. The very close connection between the viability of the individual family farm and the continuing existence of the rural community has to be faced up to and prepared for.</P>
    <P>There does not seem to be much mention of sheep farming.  In the overall context it may not be a big issue.  On the ground it most certainly is, and needs to be considered in the context of the Santer proposals.</P>
    <P>Another thing which is difficult to predict, but which will undoubtedly have an enormous short-term effect &mdash; which, in terms of these proposals, means in the first year or two &mdash; is the position the British Government might take on economic and monetary union.  They are joined on the fence by Sweden and Denmark, Denmark being one of our competitors in the British market. That is something we need to be aware of.  Also, it is seen that the new British Government is preparing the way for participation in a way that perhaps its predecessors may not have been doing.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for allowing me some time and I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Santer proposals.  We have not had enough such debates, although we had a number in Private Members' time when my party was in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I want to take up what Deputy Killeen said about hill sheep farmers.  Last week we had a meeting with the IFA during which we had frank discussions on that subject.  One thing that emerged at that meeting &mdash; and it was referred to this morning on Pat Kenny's radio show by Mr. Musgrave from Connemara &mdash; is that hill sheep farmers are not included for extensification payments. The maximum amount which can be paid in sheep headage is £2,000.  Deputy Stagg referred to a payment of £49,000 in sheep headage and ewe premium to one farmer but most farmers do not receive such payments.  When Mr. Musgrave was asked about this he said he could not get more than £2,000 and that extensification for sheep farmers was an avenue that could be explored.</P>

      <P>The National Theatre Society Limited is funded on an annual basis by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council.  Prior to 1993 responsibility for policy in arts and culture rested with the Taoiseach, and his Department did not exercise any role in the annual funding allocation to the society as determined by the council.  However, on the establishment of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in 1993, a new arrangement was put in place by my predecessor in respect of the role of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Minister in relation to the funding of the National Theatre Society Limited, the National Concert Hall and the Irish Museum of Modern Art whereby, under section 3.2 of the Arts Act, 1951, the advice of the council would be sought on the annual funding submissions of the National Concert Hall and IMMA.  The new arrangement also involved the simultaneous transfer of the Abbey Theatre into the same category as the National Concert Hall and IMMA as a national cultural institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My predecessor indicated in an explanatory press release on 17 December 1993 that, as a result of these new arrangements he was putting in place, the only diminution in the role of An <Col N="1129" /> Chomhairle Ealaíon in the funding of the National Theatre Society Limited would be to remove from An Chomhairle the discretion to cut the level of funding to the Abbey below a sustainable level.  These arrangements also represented a departure from the complete and exclusive discretion the Minister had hitherto in the funding of the National Concert Hall and IMMA.</P>
    <P>I understand it was the intention to formalise the new funding arrangement for the Abbey, the National Concert Hall and IMMA &mdash; representing the three national cultural institutions for the contemporary arts &mdash; by establishing a separate subhead for their funding under the annual Vote for An Chomhairle Ealaíon. However, specific legislative authority was required to give effect to this arrangement and the matter was not addressed before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>The new funding arrangement announced by my predecessor involved a new role for my Department in the annual funding allocation for the National Theatre Society Limited.  This new role was manifested most clearly in 1996 when my Department chaired tripartite discussions with An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the society to review and make recommendations on the funding formula used by An Chomhairle in determining the annual grant to the society in 1994, 1995 and 1996.  Although these tripartite discussions have yet to be completed, a consensus position was reached by the three parties on a new funding formula for the society which was implemented in full by the council in determining its allocation for 1997, resulting in an overall funding increase of 11 per cent this year over 1996.</P>
    <P>I am unclear as to the efficacy or relevance of the new funding arrangements for the National Theatre Society Limited, the National Concert Hall and IMMA which were introduced by my predecessor but am aware the National Concert Hall and IMMA have never been entirely happy with them.  In all the circumstances, I propose to re-establish the tripartite discussions between my Department, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the National Theatre Society Limited to review the funding arrangements introduced by my predecessor, based on experience to date, and to establish the best way to proceed in the future.  I also propose, separately, to seek the views of the National Concert Hall and IMMA about their experience of the funding relationship with An Chomhairle which was introduced in 1993.</P>
    <P>I confirm my view that the National Theatre Society Limited should be regarded as a national cultural institution.  The rather complex shareholding structure of the company is totally at variance with the other national cultural institutions of the State and the relationship that exists between them and me as Minister.  In the context of proposals emerging for the capital development of the theatres as outlined in the position paper &ldquo;A Theatre for the Millennium&rdquo;, I favour <Col N="1130" /> the retention of the Abbey Theatre on its historic site on Lower Abbey Street.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to a newspaper report on An Chomhairle Ealaíon's plans to locate the Abbey Theatre and other theatres in the docklands.  I said I agreed in principle with the establishment of a performing arts centre, but, as I said on a number of occasions, I would prefer this centre to be located on the Earlsfort Terrace site.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the proposals in the FORTÉ report cover a very wide range of issues, many of which involve areas of responsibility relating to Government Departments and State agencies other than my own. One of the main recommendation of the FORTÉ report is that a specialist body or music board should be established to advance the interests of the music industry.  I have begun dialogue with the industry to see how such a board might be best established, bearing in mind that the report, which after all was drawn up by representatives of the State sector and the industry, proposed that such a body would be a partnership to be jointly funded between the Government and the industry.  This model was also proposed in the report of the Music Industry Group of IBEC on the industry, Striking the Right Note.  I regard the implementation of this funding commitment by the industry as a necessary prerequisite for progress on this issue and I am concerned at recent utterances that seem to suggest the industry has moved away from this commitment.  I hope to meet representatives of the IBEC Music Industry Group early in the new year to discuss the possibilities in this regard.</P>
      <P>Other recommendations of the FORTÉ report cover areas not directly within my remit, for example issues of taxation and education.  On taxation, one of the issues covered by FORTÉ was the extension of the business expansion scheme to the music industry, a measure which was introduced on 6 April 1996.  The FORTÉ report recommended various modifications to this scheme to make it more amenable to the special needs of the music industry.  I am not convinced the scheme has been established long enough, or that there has been sufficient take up of the scheme to justify any of the recommended modifications. The Deputy can be assured, however, that I will keep the operation of the scheme under review.</P>
      <P>On education, officials of my Department have met officials of the Department of Education and Science to discuss the feasibility of establishing an Irish academy for the performing arts.  The Deputy will appreciate that this proposal is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science as well as for the Department I represent.  I am committed to the development of this important industry.  The analysis and recommendations of the FORTÉ report will continue to inform my consideration of future initiatives.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply.  I am confused about her intentions regarding the music board.  I established PIANO to consider classical music and the orchestras and the PIANO report made recommendations on the changes necessary in education.  FORTÉ is widely representative of the music industry and, therefore, I do not understand the need to go back to the people on the working group.  There were many discussions on FORTÉ and a conference was held at which everybody agreed the music industry needed a lift off, as it were.  We all agreed with the recommendations and proposals. Why is it necessary to go back to IBEC to hear it has removed its support for the proposal?  I heard a radio report that IBEC is less enthusiastic about this matter than was the case previously.  Is it the Minister's intention to set up the music board in any event and, if so, when will it be established?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I recognise the work the Minister did regarding the PIANO report.  He welcomed that report, as I did in Opposition.  The need for music education at primary, secondary and third level cannot be over-emphasised.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that although we have a moral obligation to push for music education within the curricula, our primary concern must come from a different angle.  The music board was one of the more important recommendations of the FORTÉ report.  I heard the radio interview to which the Deputy referred and I was concerned at the suggestion that the industry had moved away from a commitment to a joint venture between the State and the music industry in setting up the board.  I look forward to meeting IBEC to discuss this matter and I will announce my intentions early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>I heard the assistant secretary of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands ask what recommendation in the report can be implemented to assist young people who wish to take up a career in music.  The State has an obligation to establish a music board regardless of whether it is supported by IBEC.  Its support would be useful and it could form part of the partnership, but the case for the setting up of a music board has not been weakened by IBEC's lack of support.</P>
      <P>What recommendation has the Minister made to her Cabinet colleagues in this regard?  As well as referring to a music board, the FORTÉ report also refers to matters which are the responsibility of the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Finance.  What proposals has the Minister made to the Minister for Finance on, for example, artists' relief or changes in the BES in advance of the Finance Bill?  When that Bill is drafted the opportunity to implement that part of it will have gone.  What discussions has the Minister had with FÁS, which is crucially important in facilitating young musicians?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is as concerned as I am that the PIANO and FORTÉ reports identify a <Col N="1133" /> huge area of the country, west of a line almost from Derry to Limerick, where there is no music education.  The Minister will have my support in approaching the Department of Education and Science.  The behaviour of that Department down the years has been scandalous.  Will the Minister agree there is an overwhelming case for the establishment of a music board?  What are the proposals for changes in the incentive scheme, directed not so much at the percentage merchants but at young musicians who are anxious to take up music?  Will the Minister adopt a more vigorous approach towards the Department of Education and Science to ensure it fulfils its obligations to music education?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the approach of the Department of Education and Science to music education, one of the first things I did on my appointment was set up a co-ordinating unit between my Department and the Department of Education and Science to discuss the promotion of music and arts generally within the curriculum. I assure the Deputy of my continuing concern about this matter.  I said in Opposition, as I did earlier today, that we have a moral obligation as people who wish to promote the arts to ensure further emphasis on the arts, including music, within our education system, from primary through to third level.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's reference to the BES, I am not convinced the scheme has been established long enough or that there has been sufficient take up of the scheme to justify changes in this regard. I will continue to review its operations.  I would like to see further take up of the scheme in the future.</P>
      <P>A music board will be extremely useful and, as outlined in the FORTÉ report, it could play three roles.  It could constitute a forum for the industry to devise and actively promote strategic policies, it could be of vigorous assistance to the Government and State agencies in their efforts to develop the industry and a supportive and innovative board with funds available to fund targeted initiatives and proposals.  If such a board were set up it could be used to complement the work of State agencies and the private sector in providing joint ventures that would assist individuals and musical organisations.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that the music industry has been very successful, particularly for young people.  For that reason in my talks with IBEC I will propose a joint approach to the industry.  The FORTÉ report emphasised that a joint venture is the way forward.</P>

      <P>Thug mé cuairt ar Inis Bigil ar an 29 Deireadh Fómhair 1997.  Labhair mé leis na hoileánaigh agus le hionadaithe an oileáin agus phléigh muid na deacrachtaí agus na riachtanaisí atá ag muintir Inis Bhigil.  Is an t-éileamh is mó a chuir na hoileánaigh faoi mo bhráid bealach sábháilte a bheith curtha ar fáil go dtí an mór thír agus ar ais.  Cruthaíonn an fhadhb seo deacrachtaí móra do pháistí scoile ach go háirithe.  Áiríonn siad gá freisin le hionad phobail a fhreastalóidh ar riachtanais shóisialta ar an oileán agus teastaíonn uatha caoi a chur ar chuid de bhóithrí an oileáin. Tá sé soiléir gurb í an fhadhb is mó atá ag Inis Bigil ná cóir taistil sábháilte go dtí an mór thír agus ar ais.  Tá cúpla socrú éagsúil luaite don fhadhb seo ach, cibé leigheas a bhéas ann ag an deireadh, beidh costas mór i gceist.  Mar sin caithfear a bheith cinnte go ndéanfar an cinneadh ceart.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands</askee>
      <Quest>her views on whether the most recent postponement by Clare County Council of a planning decision in relation to her application for visitor facilities at Mullaghmore, County Clare signals the end of this project; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The current position in the development of the Burren National Park is that the Clare county manager decided to treat the planning application for the proposed visitor facilities at Mullaghmore as a &ldquo;material contravention&rdquo; of the county development plan.  The application was brought before Clare County Council on 10 November 1997, and it passed a resolution that a decision on the material contravention would be deferred for a period of six months, subject to the consent of the applicant.  I have consented to this deferral and the matter will fall to be considered again by the council on 20 May 1998.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium I am involved in a process of consultation with all interested parties with a view to studying the situation thoroughly.  I and my officials recently met a number of groups and listened to their views. This process, which is ongoing, will inform an overall management strategy for the Burren area and the development of the national park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unhappy with what has developed.  At the recent meeting Clare County Council &mdash; which has a substantial majority from the Minister's party &mdash; prevaricated unnecessarily and put the project in question.  It is not only Mullaghmore which is suffering, Kilfenora and other areas of north Clare have been badly let down. <Col N="1139" /> All these examinations were completed by the previous Minister and people before him.  Why did the current Minister agree to the delay?  This puts the problems of Corofin, Kilfenora and the other areas on a long finger never to be resolved, which will be a disaster for North Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is only too well aware I am not a member of Clare County Council, which took the decision for its own reasons. The proposal was put forward by the last Minister, Deputy Higgins, and it is under the planning process.  It is for the county council to decide how to run with that process and I am sure Deputy Carey will encourage Fine Gael members of the council to support that plan, given that the proposal was agreed by the last Government and no doubt he feels he can continue to support it.</P>
      <P>I do not accept, under any circumstances, that the centres in Corofin and Kilfenora will be left dangling in this regard.  As I said in my initial reply, I have spoken more than once to all the interested groups, including the representatives of Corofin and Kilfenora.  The groups which I met several times in those areas outlined a number of proposals which they wish to see developed.  We hope to further those proposals.  As I said, it is a matter for the planning process and it would be most injudicious and wrong to try to interfere in any way in that process which must take its due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be very wrong to interfere in the planning process. However, the Minister's Department is the applicant in that planning process.  Is she aware that the present application to Clare County Council was made after a working group was established which, after a consultative process, made a proposal to the county council?  It has had a number of difficulties in relation to requests for further information.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that the deferral to which the Minister referred will require a return to the court?  The Minister is the applicant to Clare County Council but is also the person before the court.  Given that an undertaking was given to the court of what would be put to the county council, a return to the court is inevitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the person making the application to Clare County Council, would it not be judicious for the Minister, without interfering in the planning process, to consider withdrawing the application? When I was the Minister I withdrew the first application and replaced it with the present proposal, which came from the working group and a consultative process.  Would it not be judicious to consider withdrawing the present proposal and decoupling the development of Kilfenora, Corofin and Ballyvaughan from the contentious matter? I understood there was consensus that those <Col N="1140" /> three villages should be developed.  Would that not be better than having a long, indefinite and protracted process?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  We know about the consultative process and the Brady, Shipman &amp; Martin reports. However, this question came before Clare County Council and the councillors took a democratic decision to look for further time.  The planning process should be allowed take place in the normal way.  It would be very wrong for me or any other Minister to interfere in that process.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of withdrawing the present proposal.  As the Deputy said, I, as Minister, am the applicant.  That is part of the planning process at present.  I do not accept the views expressed by Deputy Higgins and Carey that the situation in Corofin and Kilfenora should not be addressed.  I hope we can move all these situations forward.  I have been speaking to both those who are very much in favour of the development in Mullaghmore and those who do not share that view.  As I said earlier, I have also been speaking to the people in Corofin and Kilfenora who would like to see matters progressing there.  I hope all these matters can progress together.  I have spoken about the plans for possible land acquisition to the people concerned in Corofin and Kilfenora and that is currently being addressed by my Department.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the court is that the applicant, the Minister of the day, was required by the other litigants to give an indication of what the Minister would put before Clare County Council.  While Clare County Council is perfectly entitled to defer the matter for six months, what is the Minister's position in relation to the court?</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer but I have not been advised that any legal action needs to be taken at this point.  My advice is that Clare County Council, on foot of its decision at its last meeting, will decide on this matter on 20 May 1998.  I await its judgment on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's indecisiveness in this project will bring about greater divisions than existed heretofore in north Clare.  The Department issued a statement on behalf of the Minister saying there was no contravention of the county plan.  The county manager said there was a contravention of the plan which meant he needed to change the development plan.  He required the support of two thirds of the councillors to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that two Fianna Fáil councillors refused to take a decision and, consequently, the council postponed the decision.  That is not good for development.  What action will the Minister take to reverse that?  If <Col N="1141" /> she has no further information to give Clare County Council nothing can change, unless she is submitting a new application which she has already told Deputy Higgins she has no intention of doing.  What will change?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is being some-what vexatious in regard to this straightforward matter.  Clare County Council took a decision in which I obviously had no part.  I hope we can take from the Deputy's remarks that he can guarantee there will be a full complement of Fine Gael councillors in attendance on 20 May who will vote for this contravention and support the proposal.</P>
      <P>I have already said quite clearly that I have spoken to the groups from Corofin and Kilfenora. They put forward very definite plans on which I am working, with very definite views in mind which I have expressed to the representatives of both organisations.  They are well aware, not only of my intentions but of my actions in this regard.</P>

      <P>Tá iarratas déanta ag Comhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall le mo Roinnse maidir le hoibreacha ar bhóithre agus ar chéibheanna ar Oileán Ghabhla.  Tá an t-iarratas seo á mheas ag mo Roinn faoi láthair tar éis é a bheith pléite leis an gcomhairle chontae.  Tuigim go maith na deacrachtaí atá ag muintir an oileáin.  Bhuail mé le toscaireacht ón oileán tamall ó shin agus is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte de go ndéanfaidh mé gach iarracht chun cuidiú leis na tograí atá i gceist thar tréimhse.</P>

      <P>Tá lúcháir orm a chluinstin ón Aire go bhfuil iarratas an chomhairle chontae faighte aige agus go bhfuil sé á mheas go báúil. Táimid iontach sásta leis an méid atá á dhéanamh i Roinn an Aire agus leis an méid a rinne an Teachta Carey nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Stáit do na hoileáin eile sa chontae.</P>
      <P>Bhí díomá ar mhuintir Ghabhla nár cuireadh deontas ar fáil dóibh as measc na ndeontas deiridh a tugadh amach tá cúpla seachtain ó shin.  Cáilíonn Gabhla go huile agus go hiomlán: tugann Údarás na Gaeltachta aitheantas dóibh, tá roinnt deontas tithíochta curtha ar fáil ann; thug Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta aitheantas dóibh agus chuir siad deontais ar fáil do thionscnamh éigin ar an oileán.</P>

Tá mé ag trácht ar chéibheanna agus ar bhóithre.  An mbeidh sé ábalta é a dhéanamh roimh dheireadh na bliana seo nó an gcaithfimid fanacht go dtí an bhliain seo chughainn?</P>

      <P>Rinne muid liosta den obair ba phráinní agus ba éasca a dhéanamh go sciobtha ar na hoileáin. Ceadaíodh airgead le gairid i leith na hoibre sin. Tá an t-iarratas seo á mheas agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar cinneadh go luath ach ní shamhlóinn ar aon chaoi go ndéanfaí tada roimh an bhliain nua, fiú dá gceadófaí airgead, Is féidir leis an Teachta a bheith cinnte nach mbeidh aon ró-mhoill ar cheadú airgid más rud gurb é sin an cinneadh a dhéanfar.  Níor mhaith liom dul roimh aon chinneadh nó roimh aon chomhairle a chuirfear orm. Tá an rud á mheas ach níl i gceist agam dul chun leadráine le meastóireacht; déanfar cinneadh chomh luath agus is féidir ag brath ar chomhairle agus ar an staidéar a dhéanfar air.

Sílim go bhfuil sé ar fáil ag na hoileáin ar chósta thiar na hÉireann, ar Oileán Thoraí, ar Oileán Árainnmhór agus is dóigh ar Oileán Inis Bó Finne.  An bhféadfaí an stádas sin a thabhairt d'Oileán Ghamhla mar dá dtabharfaí, tá mé cinnte go mba spreagadh é do mhuintir an oileáin fhéin infheistíocht a dhéanamh ann agus áiseanna a chur ar fáil do thurasóirí agus na tithe agus mar sin de a fheabhsú.

      <P>Táimid ag imeacht beagán ó ábhar na ceiste ach freagróidh mé an cheist seo le cead an Cheann Comhairle.  Tá stádas áirithe cánach tugtha do chuid de na hoileáin.  De réir mar a thuigim, ní raibh mórán éilimh ar an scéim mar bhí an faoiseamh cánach le tabhairt ar thithe go mbeadh buanchónaí iontu, ach go leor de na hoileánaigh, níl dóthain ioncaim acu le faoiseamh cánach a fháil ar thada.  Mar sin, caithfear an cheist sin a aithbhreithniú ina iomlán.  Mar is eol don Teachta, sa bpolasaí a réitigh mé roimh an toghcháin bhí ceist cúrsaí cánach i gcoitinne luaite sa gcáipéis agus beidh an cheist sin á scrúdú.  Cuirfear chuile oileán go bhfuil cónaí buan air san áireamh sa scrúdú a dhéanfar.</P>

      <P>I was scheduled to meet with the Players' Council of the Abbey Theatre on 20 November last but, due to my attendance in the <Col N="1146" /> Dáil where Second Stage of a Bill relating to my powers and functions as Minister was being taken, I was obliged to cancel the meeting with the agreement of the Players' Council.  The meeting will take place on 11 December.  With regard to the issue of a voluntary severance package for the permanent acting company of the National Theatre Society, as I advised the House in my replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 208 of 7 October 1997, and 17 and 30 of 23 October 1997, the proposals for such a package have been submitted to An Chomhairle Ealaíon and copied to me as a courtesy.  I am awaiting the recommendations of An Chomhairle Ealaíon in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it was a pity she was unable to meet the Players' Council on the day designated?  Will she agree this matter has to be resolved, given that the Players' Council has lived for a long time in a state of limbo?  Will she indicate how she anticipates this matter coming to a happy conclusion?  People with great talent are in a state of limbo because decisions have not been made to the satisfaction of both parties. The Minister is responsible in an overall sense. How does she see her role in this matter and what is the timeframe in relation to reaching a satisfactory conclusion given that people's livelihoods have been seriously affected, in terms of their creativity? How does she envisage this need will be met in a fair way and in what timeframe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy I consider this to be a serious matter and that is the reason I immediately agreed to meet the Players' Council. As explained, I could not do that on 20 November because I was taking Second Stage of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Bill, 1997.  Given my particular interest in the matter, I immediately made another appointment and a meeting will take place on 11 December.  On that occasion I shall listen to the issues directly from the Players' Council.  The proposals have been submitted to An Chomhairle Ealaíon and I await its recommendations. On receipt of those recommendations I will not delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is not a matter of meeting the Players' Council to hear what they have to say?  We all know, including the Minister, what they have to say.  Will she ensure she has the information she is waiting on before meeting the Players' Council?  Surely, she is in a position to demand that information before meeting the Players' Council.  Will she agree we are well beyond the point of simply having a meeting to listen to views expressed by the Players' Council?  Does she perceive this meeting as one where progress can be made?  The only way that progress can be made is if she has the information at hand before meeting the Players' Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Players' Council who asked if I would meet with them.  Obviously they want to speak with me, they wish to put forward certain views that I should be aware of.  As Minister <Col N="1147" /> I very much wish to hear those views.  When someone asks to meet me I do my best to facilitate them.  I hope to receive the recommendations from An Chomhairle Ealaíon shortly.  I look forward to meeting the Players' Council to see how this matter can be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>This smacks of indecisiveness by the Minister.  I support the thrust of the question by Deputy McManus.  The Players' Council asked to see me and I met them.  Their case is very real. The nine people involved have given service ranging from 21 years to 39 years in a national institution and have portrayed Ireland very well. The top wage is £21,000.  There is no secret in bringing about a voluntary severance package.  As Minister for Tourism and Trade I did this with Bord Fáilte and the Trade Board.  The Minister should be in a position to deal with nine people, given that next week the Minister for Finance is to lash out £500 million.  The meeting has been arranged conveniently for 11 December, after the budget.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that that sum, small by comparative standards, will be included in the Finance Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused that when one tries to consult, one is told one is indecisive. Deputies who put forward that view would be the first to say it would not be right for a Minister to pre-empt decisions and that one should listen to the people directly involved.  I look forward to meeting the Players' Council on 11 December.  It would not be appropriate to pre-empt our discussions before taking part in them.  In regard to Deputy Kenny's reference to the budget and the scheduling of the meeting, I assure him there is absolutely no connection between the two.  The date of 11 December was the nearest that accommodated both the Players' Council and myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the Minister's intention to meet the Players' Council. While it will be a useful meeting, what Deputy McManus has said is also true, that the agenda is known.  The Players' Council had more than nine people a few years ago.  When the Minister gets advice from the Arts Council it will be impossible for her to solve the problem if the Abbey Theatre is instructed to find the money out of its annual grant allocation.  The core of this problem has always been whether the Department of Finance would facilitate a once off payment of funds to enable the redundancy package to be implemented.  This was an overhang that continued as the Abbey Theatre was responsible to different Ministers, including the Department of the Taoiseach.  If, having met the Players' Council on 11 December, it becomes clear an approach to the Department of Finance is necessary, will it be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Higgins has pointed out that this is not a new problem that has suddenly materialised, it has continued under another Administration.  Although Deputy <Col N="1148" /> Kenny said he was able to do all sorts of good things when Minister for Tourism and Trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá scéim labhairt na Gaeilge nua i bhfeidhm ón scoilbhliain 1993-4.  Is mar thoradh ar athbhreithniú ar an seanscéim a bhí ann ó 1934 i leith a tháinig an scéim nua ar an saol. Tá an scéim nua, a bhfuil éileamh mór uirthi, dírithe ar theaghlaigh seachas ar pháistí aonaracha mar a bhí roimhe seo.</P>
      <P>Is é cuspóir na scéime nua muintir na Gaeltachta a spreagadh chun labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn sa teaghlach agus sa phobal i gcoitinne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoin scéim is féidir leis an Roinn deontas £200 in aghaidh na scoilbhliana a íoc le teaghlaigh le 3 nó níos mó dalta scoile agus deontas £100 in <Col N="1149" /> aghaidh na scoilbhliana a íoc le teaghlaigh le 2 nó níos lú dalta scoile má shásaíonn na teaghlaigh coinníollacha na scéime &mdash; go háirthe na coinníollacha gurb í an Ghaeilge a ngnáth-theanga labhartha agus go bhfuil an líofacht nádúrtha dá réir acu, agus go bhfuil cónaí orthu sna Limistéir Ghaeltachta.  Mura bhfuil an t-ardchaighdeán atá riachtanach don scéim ag teaghlach is féidir leis an Roinn deontas laghdaithe 50% a íoc leis an teaghlach sin ach í a bheith sásta go bhfuil ar a chumas an t-ardchaighdeán cuí a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Níl sé i gceist agam an deontas atá ar fáil faoi scéim labhairt na Gaeilge a mhéadú san scoilbhliain reatha.  Tá coinníollacha na scéime á scrúdú agam faoi láthair, áfach, agus má bhíonn aon athrú le déanamh amach anseo fógróidh mé é sin ag am cuí.</P>

      <P>Mar a bhí á rá agam, sular cuireadh isteach orm, tuigim an fhadhb maidir le teagmháil leis an mhuintir atá luaite ag an Teachta.  Is fadhb mhór é go bhfuil mórán daoine ag teacht abhaile chuig na Gaeltachtaí agus de bharr gur chaith siad mórán ama thar lear níl aon Ghaeilge acu.  Tá sé ar intinn againn scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an gceist seo.  Tuigim go bhfuil gá le gníomhaíocht agus baineann an ghníomhaíocht sin leis an Roinn Oideachais chomh maith le mo Roinn.  Tá súil agam dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Oideachais ar an gceist.  Tá fhios ag an Teachta gur cheist an-chasta í seo agus ní mór scrúdú fíorchruinn a dhéanamh ar an gceist sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis Scéim Labhairt an Gaeilge, tá a fhios ag an Teachta go bhfuil sé dirithe don chuid is mó ar theaghlaigh ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar ghnáththeanga.  Chuir an Teachta ceist faoi é a chur i bhfeidhm taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  I láthair na huaire níl aon phleanna é sin a dhéanamh. Tógadh an cheist seo go minic thar na mblianta, agus caithfimid scrúdú géar a dhéanamh ar na himpleachtaí a bheadh leis.  Níl m'intinn dúnta agam ar an gceist agus déanfaidh mé scrúdú air i rith mo thréimhse mar Aire Stáit.  Ceann de na buntáistí a bhaineann leis an scéim seo, taobh amuigh de chuidiú airgid do na teaghlaigh atá i gceist, ná go dtugann sé áireamh dúinn ar na teaghlaigh ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge mar gnáththeanga iontu.</P>

An cheist atá ann ná nach féidir le daoine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht cur isteach ar an scéim faoi láthair ach i gcás corr-eisceacht ar chúrsaí stairiúla.  Tá an Teachta ag cur na ceiste an bhféadfainn an scéim a athrú ionas go bhféadfadh teaghlaigh lánGhaelacha i mBaile Átha Cliath, mar shampla, cur isteach ar an scéim.  Má theastaíonn ó dhaoine aighneacht a chur chugham i dtaobh na ceiste sin, faoi an bhfuil sé inmholta nó nach bhfuil, cinnte, bhreathnóinn orthu.

      <P>In speaking on the powers and functions introduced by the Minister last week, my party leader, Deputy John Bruton, recommended the implementation of a pilot scheme, using technology in terms of making educational facilities available, certainly to primary and early second-level, school-going students.

Will the Minister consider such a pilot scheme in providing the education services he mentioned, to which islanders would have access?</P>

      <P>What I would like to do, whether by technology or transport, is to lay down the basic principle, in co-operation with parents, and students' their choices being paramount, that schooling, wherever practicable, will be provided, on the islands.  Wherever it cannot be provided on the islands, due to population or other factors, as much access and facilities will be afforded students to return home as frequently as possible. The House can take it as an absolute basic principle that we shall endeavour to maintain the bond between island children, their parents and their island in so far as possible.  However, in so doing, we must ensure that all children have equal opportunity to full access to full education whether on the mainland or on an island.  That principle will underline everything I shall do in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking about the circumstances <Col N="1154" /> of hill sheep farmers, and mentioned our meeting with the Irish Farmers Association last week.  One of the very positive proposals then advanced was for an extensification premium for flock owners who qualified on the basis of the stocking rate requirement of less than 1.4 per hectare. I hope this will be addressed in the course of future negotiations and proposals at European level.  It proposed an increase in the rural world premium to £10 per ewe, an increased headage payment targeted specifically at hill sheep flock owners, and also proposed the abolition of the 7 per cent stabiliser mechanism worth £44.70 per ewe in additional ewe premium.  It had a very good case which it articulated very well to us and I hope it will be acted on by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State set out very clearly the Santer proposals, detailing clearly the net effect of the Agenda 2000 proposals on Irish agriculture. He said:</P>
      <P>. I believe that the net effect of the proposals on prices and on premia could be a loss of the order of £125 million a year.</P>
      <P>and went on to say:</P>
      <P>. it does not include any estimate of the effect of changes in Ireland's receipts under the structural heading where the Commission's proposals, at this stage, are even less developed than their market proposals.</P>
      <P>Since Structural Funds have been very important and of enormous benefit to us, I am most concerned about this.  Recent departmental replies given to all queries on Structural Funds are to the effect that much of those moneys has already been used up on tourism projects and on other projects concerned with arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I want individual Ministers to follow up the matter of Structural funding, ascertaining how farmers in rural areas can be compensated so that, consequent on these proposed changes, no loss will accrue to them.</P>
      <P>The incomes of farmers in rural areas will have to be protected and I hope the Minister spells out the way permanent compensation could be made for any price reductions.  Any system of compensation will have to be fair and equitable.  As a major beef exporter, Ireland depends to a large degree on income from that sector and we are sensitive, therefore, to any changes in EU arrangements.</P>
      <P>I hope young farmers, particularly those in the dairy sector, will have an opportunity to avail of quotas.  I had a number of meetings with members of Macra na Feirme who stressed the need for access to quotas across the board but particularly in the dairy sector.  The current negotiations on access to the market by other countries are a cause of concern to young farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Raymond Keane of the European Commission Representation in Ireland, stated in a presentation that the conclusion the Commission came to with regard to new entries to the European Union was that five eastern European countries were the best prepared, even though they <Col N="1155" /> had some way to go in economic terms.  Those countries were Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia.  The Commission proposes to open negotiations with these five countries, in addition to Cyprus which was always favoured for access to the EU.  I hope that when these negotiations take place, we will have a vibrant European Union.</P>
    <P>On the question of funding, the Commission has taken the view that the next financial agreement should cover a seven year period from 2000 to 2006.  In that context it is important that the whole question of Structural Funds and Objective One status is examined.  If Objective One status is being considered for western and Border regions, it would present a major opportunity to obtain additional funding for severely disadvantaged areas.  It is important that the Commission is considering Objective One status, maintaining the overall funding and putting in place a transition arrangement for western and Border regions.  The strategy should be to build on the MacSharry reforms in key market areas, particularly in regard to rural structural development policy, and to take account of the environmental dimension.</P>
    <P>On the question of rural development policy, many of the difficulties we face as a result of rural depopulation and transport problems could be overcome by examining some of the schemes already in existence.  I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, for the small but important changes he made in the Leader programmes. He informed us that community groups, for example, will have to provide only 30 per cent funding rather than the 50 per cent they had to provide in the past.  That is a welcome announcement.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism projects, more projects have applied for funding than there is money available.  I note that the grant aid will be increased from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.  Recognition of own labour as private matching funds will now be included in private projects.  These are important issues which will assist the developments currently being made in the Leader programme and I commend the Minister and the Minister of State for negotiating these proposals.</P>
    <P>I am glad that matters have improved following the problems experienced in relation to delays in payments of headage and other grants.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has more staff at his disposal to deal with this issue which I hope will ensure that these grants will be paid in the coming weeks.  I hope also that concerns about future headage payments will be allayed by the Minister giving an assurance that this direct payment will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on the Santer proposals and other related matters but it is unfortunate that those of us in the Fine Gael Party do not have sufficient time to make our points.</P>
      <P>The Treaty of Rome came into effect in l972 and we all have a clear recollection of the promised benefits it would bring to Irish agriculture. We were told it would bring a free market of 350 million people as far as agricultural produce was concerned, and that we would never again face the difficulty of being unable to obtain a market for our produce at a reasonable price.  We were also told that this market would expand into Third World countries which would be beneficial and would compensate to some degree for the closure of industries such as Ford and Dunlop in Cork and numerous other industries as a result of decisions made by multinationals.  The closure of these industries resulted in enormous job losses in the respective areas.</P>
      <P>If one examines what actually happened, however, even over the past ten years, the general performance as far as Europe is concerned was disappointing.  I refer in particular to the GATT arrangements and the CAP agreement.</P>
      <P>The general threat to the future of Ireland's farm families is not the Santer proposals contained in Agenda 2000 but the anti-farmer attitude of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the way in which the Taoiseach has virtually surrendered Ireland's negotiating position.  The Government is pitiful in its inability or unwillingness to recognise that the consistent core of our economy is the earnings of farmers which derive from the production of their farms.  It will be a long time before the Celtic tiger can match an Irish cow in its ability to protect the long-term interests of the Irish nation.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger exists because of the output of farms and the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds this attracts.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance seem intent on diminishing the role of farmers in the agricultural sector as a whole and inculcating in the minds of people the false image of a tiger economy built on computer chips.</P>
      <P>I make these remarks in view of the fact that the latest information available is a cut of £35 million from the Book of Estimates.  The announcement last August that installation aid would be discontinued to young farmers is regrettable. What message does that send to farmers who cannot get people to take over their farms? This is happening not only in Wexford but in the constituency of the Minister of State.  I spent the day in that constituency yesterday and I met numerous farmers who told me the difficulties they face as a result of this decision.</P>
      <P>We have been told by the Minister and other Ministers that this aid will be reinstated in the budget.  I hope that is the case but the fact that he contemplated removing it for a short period is an indication that there is a serious problem in regard to confidence in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> I wish to deal with the manner in which the Department of Agriculture and Food disallows cases and stops premium payments for a period of one year, or in some case two years.  This matter involves the issue of apportionality.  The penalty imposed is illegal because it breaks the requirements of apportionality.  It is indisputable that a farmer who makes an innocent mistake or a technical error with no fraudulent intent is not guilty of dishonest conduct.  The imposition on such a farmer of one of the more severe penalties of stopping the payment of premiums for a two year period is out of proportion to the mistake.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited this position, but it prevailed before his party left office on the previous occasion.  I accuse his officials of disallowing the payment of premiums where every &ldquo;i&rdquo; is not dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed on an application. Numerous cases have been brought to court, but I understand the Department has not won any of them.  I represent those involved in the agricultural industry and I ask the Minister to take this matter in hand.  I do not know how he will do that, but people cannot afford the expense of going to court and awaiting the outcome of their cases.  I have taken this matter up with the Minister's officials.  I am sure that most Deputies and Senators know of two or three constituents who are affected by the decision to refuse premium payments.  I brought three such cases to the Ombudsman, but he turned them down.  He is a civil servant and if everything does not comply with the regulations he will reject a case.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister's notice to a case brought by the NFU in England against the British Government and the EU.  The NFU won its case and the NFU president, Sir David Nash, said that the judgment was a victory for common sense and the 120 farm businesses affected were harshly and unfairly victimised for genuine errors in making claims under a system that is notoriously complicated and at times confusing.  The Minister will agree that farmers would need a computer to complete their applications.  Simple mistakes are made in applications by people who are well equipped, but most farmers are not equipped with computers.  They must keep records of the age of cattle, the amount of area aid must be mapped out on a yearly basis and if they make the smallest mistake the Minister's officials are very quick to disallow the claim.  I will ask our spokesperson, Deputy Coveney, to appeal to the Minister to ensure this matter is immediately addressed.  Dozens of farmers from my county have made representations to me on this matter.</P>
    <P>I tabled a question on this matter to the Minister on 12 November to which he replied:</P>
    <P>The information requested for the years in question in respect of the headage and premia schemes is not readily available.  However, I am arranging to have the details sent to the Deputy within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>I have not received that information and I need it to compile data to enable our spokesperson to do something about this matter.  This position is unacceptable.  Small errors may be made in the <Col N="1158" /> completion of applications by 3,000, 4,000 or 5,000 people.</P>
    <P>I know of a case of a father and two sons whose payments involving £17,000 were suspended for two years.  I raised that case with the Department before the Minister came to office and I have raised it with him since he became Minister, but I have not got a satisfactory reply.  He must deal with this case.  This matter was raised with him three years ago and his response was reasonable to an extent, but he will have to be more forthcoming in his response to this and other cases.  I would like the Minister to answer the question I tabled concerning the number of cases involved. The case taken by the NFU resolved a similar problem in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is an understatement to say that rural Ireland is under threat and has been for some time.  Regrettably, the contribution from the State to an industry that has been the lifeblood of the nation has been reduced substantially. There is no doubt that the Celtic tiger is an urban beast and does not in any way relate to rural Ireland.  A survey reveals the frightening speed with which people are moving from rural areas of west Limerick to cities.</P>
      <P>The removal of the installation aid scheme, following the commitment made by Deputy Walsh prior to his party's going into Government, is shameful.  The Minister indicated to young farmers that their future does not lie in farming and they are responding to his comments by not taking up farming courses.  Deputies who represent rural areas know there is a good deal of unrest among young farmers.  We have had constant contact from members of Macra na Feirme, young farmers who are considering taking up farming and farmers who undertook certificate courses on the understanding that they would be eligible for the installation aid scheme, but that scheme has been withdrawn.  The Minister should re-examine that decision.</P>
      <P>The proposed £34 million reduction in headage payments in next week's budget is unacceptable. Deputy Walsh's pre-election commitment that there would be no tampering with the headage mechanism up to the end of the current round of Structural Funds was written in sand.  Headage and other EU payments are an inherent part of farmers' incomes.  The reduction in and capping of headage payments will have a serious effect on farmers' incomes.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister intends to reduce administration costs by £7 million.  I would like him to examine the position in the Limerick office at St. Munchin's House where the small number of people involved in administration is causing extreme difficulty for the staff and farmers in that area.  There is a six months' delay in dealing with an installation aid or farm retirement application. Farmers do not understand why when money is available they have to wait so long for what should be a reasonable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that there is a serious problem of brucellosis in County Limerick. I do not understand why when farmers are <Col N="1159" /> facing a crisis, especially in my area which there has been an outbreak of brucellosis, the Minister intends to cut the contribution to the eradication of TB and brucellosis.  The Minister comes from Cork and he must be aware of the outbreak of brucellosis in Limerick, north Cork and parts of Tipperary.  His senior officials are extremely concerned about that outbreak.  I am disappointed and concerned that the Minister is not prepared to respond to that problem.</P>
    <P>I understand it is the Minister's view that live exports to Egypt are not the way forward, that they will have an adverse effect on the country's ability to achieve a 35 per cent steer kill out of season and that it is no longer a viable export market.  I understand the Minister made that statement to members of Macra na Feirme in Kildare.  Is that the Minister's view or was he just masquerading before the public when he said he would reopen live trade with the Egyptian market?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Members could talk on this topic for half and hour without difficulty.  I am glad the Minister is present because he was not here for the beginning of this debate.  His place was taken by the Charles Mitchell of Fianna Fáil, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who read the Minister's speech beautifully. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to two points in that speech.  The Minister of State said that agriculture should be developed in a way that fully protects the incomes of farmers and the viability of rural communities.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that other measures are required to enable farmers and rural dwellers enhance their incomes and enable them to remain in rural areas.  How does abolishing installation aid fall into the category of preserving rural Ireland?  Young people need encouragement to stay on farms because, despite all the rubbish written by people who know nothing about farming, it is a tough life.  When education facilities are available and they can qualify for other jobs, young people are happy to leave the land.  How can the Minister justify making the statements to which I referred when he abolished installation aid after he promised he would not do so?</P>
      <P>Goldsmith wrote a poem round the time this House was built in which he worried about rural Ireland.  Many people will know the following lines:</P>
      <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey Where wealth accumulates, and men decay;</P>
      <P>He was worried 250 years ago about the decline of rural Ireland and the rich getting richer with large farmers turning into ranchers and small farmers disappearing.  We need rural life and the Minister must restore installation aid in the budget.  However, I hope it is not restored in a way which will suit only a small number of people who submitted applications.  This aid should be continued because young people need to be encouraged.  It is insulting to them to abolish it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pollution control grants must be restored. Everybody is against farmers.  As soon as there is <Col N="1160" /> an accident on a farm, the experts arrive to tell the farmer what he should have done.  The pollution of rivers cannot be defended but a high standard is expected and pollution control measures are expensive.  At a time when the economy appears to be booming, we should help those who want to protect the environment.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to mountain sheep.  It has been suggested that if sheep count when it comes to extensification of the low lands, mountain sheep should also be included.  Many farmers want such a move.</P>
    <P>The delay in headage payments is unbelievable. I am not aware of any other group which would put up with the irregularity of payments that farmers endure.  A strike was threatened last weekend over a wage agreement.  It is unbelievable that farmers can make arrangements with banks but are left high and dry because the Department cannot digitise the maps.  Deputies are told every effort is being made to deal with the matter and that payments will be issued soon. However, that is of little value to farmers who are under pressure in terms of living costs and meeting arrangements made with banks which, despite their profits, are often extremely tough on them. It is unbelievable in this age of computerisation that the Department cannot live up to the charter introduced by the Minister's excellent predecessor, Deputy Yates, that payments would be made regularly.</P>
    <P>The Minister must improve because people are beginning to think he made statements when he was in Opposition that he did not think out properly. He must do something during his term of office.  For example, he should guarantee farmers that they will receive payments by certain dates. Members would not wait more than a few days for their salary.  I am sure that also applies in the world of journalism.  People would not wait week after week for payments which never arrive.  This delay insults farmers and it is time the issue was tackled.  In this age of modern computer equipment it should be possible to arrange payments regularly.  I agree with Deputy D'Arcy's point about petty mistakes being treated as criminal acts.  That type of behaviour is outrageous.  I will share the remainder of my time with Deputy Timmins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>In my recent dealings with farmers and farming groups one main theme, while not overtly mentioned, has become obvious.  This is the fear of the unknown and for their way of life.  They worry that their children may not be able to seek a livelihood from the land which they hold so dear.  Hidden behind the demands for increased ewe premia, prompt headage payments, the restoration of installation aid and tillage weather losses is the great concern that Deputies and the public do not understand their plight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This way of life, which was once extolled as an authentic base on which the country securely rested, is no longer considered viable in this new age.  As society becomes more prosperous we tend to forget some basic fundamentals of which the role of agriculture is one.  The two basic needs in society are food and clothing and both of these <Col N="1161" /> come from agriculture.  Too many people, including some Members, have uttered what they consider populist sound bites without examining the basis for their statements and the effect they can have on sections of society.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is a simple process involving the production of food.  Three important structures have emerged to support this food supply system. The first is intervention by the State to develop a modern production system, supporting farm prices to reward increased farm output and guaranteeing a market for this produce, thereby reducing the risks inherent in farm investment. Second, with the increasing capital needs of modern agriculture, including the rising cost of purchasing farm land, the State and banking institutions must have in place a financial and tax system tailored to the needs of farmers.  Third, farmers now produce for a global market and, accordingly, international trade must be facilitated. How has the Minister performed in these areas?</P>
    <P>In his pre-election position paper in May 1997, the Minister stated in relation to cereals that provision would be made for exceptional hardship cases.  He said we had had our worst harvest for many years and the IFA estimated the loss at £38 million.  The Minister said he would provide £1.2 million.  However, I understand the Minister announced yesterday that to qualify for aid farmers must not have more than £16,000 off farm income, a milk quota of 25 gallons, 50 hectares of forage area, a 1000 tonnes sugar beet quota or a pig unit of more than 100 breeding sows.  On the surface it appears it would be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a farmer to receive compensation for lost cereals under this package.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said in his pre-election paper that to ensure the future of young farmers, the installation aid scheme for them, which was then under threat, would be maintained and improved. However, the Minister suspended the scheme in August.  If he is to maintain any credibility, it must be restored in the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Santer proposals and Agenda 2000 do not deal directly with sheep, it is disappointing that the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, did not refer to sheep in his speech earlier.  Action is needed immediately to address the problems of hill sheep farms where because of lower lamb output, weaker light lamb prices have dropped from a high of 130p a pound on the Mediterranean market in mid summer to 92p a pound this week.  There has also been a sharp cutback in ewe premia.  Sheep farmers have suffered a substantial reduction in their incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that cattle export markets would be reopened.  However, it now appears that he is wondering whether we should export to Egypt.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to try to lay the blame for the delay in headage payments at the feet of an administrative company. The Minister's goal should be twofold in the negotiations in the months ahead.  The first is to provide equitable remuneration for those employed in agriculture and second to contribute to the social stability of rural areas by <Col N="1162" /> implementing policies which will reduce the instability of farm incomes and maintain rural population densities.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil prides itself on being the guardian of the small farmer.  On St. Patrick's Day 1943, Eamon de Valera said: &ldquo;A land whose countryside will be bright with cosy homesteads, whose fields and villages would be joyous with sounds of industry.&rdquo; The Minister and his party appear to have long since abandoned this ideal.  While I am loath to criticise anybody, part of the reason the Minister is in office today is the position paper he produced before the election.  Many of the matters mentioned in it have not been implemented and many of its commitments cannot be met.  Several months ago the Minister was prepared to swim to Egypt.  Every time I turned on a television before the election the Shandon bells were behind him.  Those bells are beginning to ring in the farming community because it realises it has been sold a pup.  Perhaps the bells are starting to toll for the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh) Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all those who contributed to this important debate on the Agenda 2000 Santer proposals. They are extremely important and the outcome of the negotiations will affect farming incomes for the next decade and put Irish agriculture industry on a footing that will ensure it can participate in growing European and world food markets.</P>
      <P>The Santer proposals were discussed at recent Council of Agriculture Ministers' meetings in Brussels and we were informed that detailed proposals would be publicised early in the new year. It is expected the debate will continue throughout next year.  I recently established consultancy groups representing all sectors of the industry to make sure that during the negotiations the best advice is available to me to ensure the best possible outcome to allow agriculture to develop. Good deals were negotiated in the past on the Common Agricultural Policy and its reform programmes and a similar deal will be made in these negotiations.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies highlighted various problems, the primary one being the question of payments from the EU.  I do not know if it is in the interest of the industry to put the record straight again on payments because, on the one hand, farmers are accused of whingeing by some spokespeople every time payments are mentioned and, on the other, auditors from the EU express the view that certain overpayments have been made.  The agriculture industry has been in receipt of substantial and significant payments since Ireland joined the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year £680 million issued in direct payments to farmers under headage and premia schemes and before the end of the year close to £1,000 million will be paid in support of farmers generally.  That is their entitlement as a result of the deal negotiated for them.  I was the negotiator <Col N="1163" /> for the last reform of the CAP and support such payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, over the past six weeks £280 million issued in direct payments to farmers.  Hardly any week goes by without between £10 and £15 million being paid out. Eighty per cent of sheep headage payments have been made, 83 per cent of special beef premiums, 76 per cent of suckler cow premiums and 99 per cent of arable aid payments.  Political points have been scored and we have reached back to Goldsmith and the late Éamon de Valera to support our case.  If one must score a political point, the current situation is better than this time last year under my predecessor.  Only 79 per cent of sheep headage payments had been made.</P>
      <P>In regard to arable aid, a number of grain farmers had a tough year and some lost their incomes. I said I would seek to be as helpful as possible within various constraints by making arable aid payments as quickly as possible.  The earliest possible date was 16 October and within one week 94 per cent had been paid out and that figure now stands at 99 per cent.  Virtually all of the money was paid out in a matter of hours which was not the case last year.  The Department's information officer was on a radio programme yesterday and he correctly pointed out the current position.  There are two sides to every story.</P>
      <P>The amounts of money available under various schemes was raised by a number of Deputies.  I refer to headage payments.  When I came into office there was a shortfall of £9 million for them and I negotiated their inclusion in the Supplementary Estimate which was presented to the House last week.  It totalled £64 million which covered other schemes for which there was also a shortfall.  It meant bringing forward some of the £9 million from next year's figures and consequently they now look more difficult with a shortfall of £30 million.  Whereas if the money had not been brought forward the shortfall would have been about £11 million.  I am in constant negotiation with the Department of Finance on next week's budget.  I cannot pre-empt what it will contain but I hope this matter will be addressed. The situation resulted from front loading where for a six year programme too much was paid out in the earlier years which left a shortfall in the later years.  We await the outcome of the budget on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The installation aid scheme for younger farmers was raised.  In October 1996 my predecessor signalled there was an inadequate amount of money to cover this which was still the case when I assumed office.  It was not possible to make an announcement before the election and there was no option but to suspend the scheme when not enough money was available.  There are a number of applications in the pipeline which would cost <Col N="1164" /> approximately £6 million.  We are also negotiating with the Department of Finance on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coveney queried the position regarding brucellosis in next year's Estimates.  The provision for 1997 was increased in the recent Supplementary Estimate.  I am concerned about the deteriorating situation and will announce additional tightening up of that scheme because Ireland's status in terms of animal disease is extremely important since we export between 85 and 90 per cent of our produce.  It is important to have the highest possible disease free status and I am pleased this month four cases of BSE in herds were reported compared with 18 this time last year.  That is welcome news and I hope that decline continues because it is important for us to ensure we eliminate the problem.</P>
    <P>Live exports were raised by a number of Members.  They are important and there was a great deal of talk about them prior to my appointment as Minister but within weeks of my appointment I secured Government funding to have a ferry provided between Cork and the continent which carries a substantial number of live cattle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the first load of live cattle, almost 2,000, went to the Lebanon last week.  I hope that will continue.  I and officials of the Department of Agriculture visited Egypt on quite a number of occasions and I have sent detailed proposals to my counterpart in Cairo in relation to a trial shipment of live cattle to Egypt. The Egyptians had raised certain questions about Irish cattle, in particular about our incidence of BSE.  I assured the Egyptian Minister that the incidence of BSE in Ireland was negligible and that we could give an assurance that beef from Ireland would come from BSE free herds.  It was pointed out to me that 30,000 tonnes of beef was imported by Egypt last year.  This year it will reach 60,000 tonnes, a doubling of the 1996 amount, equivalent to about 200,000 head of cattle.  We made the case that we wished to have live exports resumed.  An arrangement was made whereby we would have specified risk material removed from live animals in an Egyptian plant. That plant has now been identified.  Irish engineers and veterinary officials have visited it and all the conditions have been met, but it is a matter for the Egyptians to give the nod and say that they will accept our cattle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other issues were raised.  Deputy D'Arcy raised the question of innocent errors. The principle of penalties fitting the crime should prevail.  My predecessor set up an appeals unit.  I do not know how well it is working but, in the context of the matter being raised here, I will have an urgent look at it to see if it can be operated more effectively.  Obviously if applicants <Col N="1165" /> under any of the programmes make an innocent error they should not be penalised.</P>
    <P>The permanency of direct payments was referred to by a number of Deputies.  I assure everybody it is my intention to ensure that the continuity and permanency of direct aid will be accepted at EU level.  That it will be a central objective of my negotiating position.</P>
    <P>The question of organic farming was raised.  I will outline the schemes relating to organic farming. In regard to ewe premia, when the price of sheep is high the ewe premium goes down and when prices are low the premium goes up.  That is the system that has been in existence for some considerable time.  In relation to harvest damage, I attended a function in the Red Cow Inn where a statement was made, known as the Red Cow declaration, to the effect that a sum of money would be paid to Irish farmers in relation to agri-monetary compensation.  That was in the spring. Despite the summer election, the £24.5 million was not paid, although electorally it would have been important to pay out this money.  However, there was no authority to make this announcement because EU approval is needed before this money can be paid out.  I eventually obtained EU approval for compensation for the losses involved.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the time and effort and the cogent arguments for a better deal for Irish agriculture. I will continue to work for a better deal.  I found most helpful the genuine contributions made in this debate on the current activities of the Department and the negotiations under Agenda 2000 and I will take them into account.</P>

    <P>This privatisation proposal of TEAM Aer Lingus is utter treachery against a premier publicly-owned company of strategic importance, against a dedicated workforce whose skills and commitment have made this company a top quality aircraft maintenance firm.  Proof is that its order books are full for this year and for next year.  In 1997 TEAM Aer Lingus will show a profit <Col N="1166" /> two years before the target date of 1999 which was set in 1994, despite the saddling of TEAM Aer Lingus with bad debts of £8.6 million, with £28 million in severance payments which should have been an Aer Lingus debt, interest charges caused by reservicing inherited debt and with minimum State aid, in contrast to the £34 million given since 1993 to Shannon Aerospace, a private concern with half the workforce.</P>
    <P>The management of TEAM Aer Lingus who have pushed the privatisation agenda relentlessly for years are guilty of outright betrayal.  They have offered an average of £15,600 per worker to agree this privatisation.  It is 15,600 pieces of silver to sell their rights as workers and their right to a job.  Let us make no mistake, if they get away with it, whichever multinational giant comes in will have loyalty to one thing only, maximisation of their profit.  If that means moving the business out of Dublin to the United States or somewhere else, that is what will be done, without thought for Irish jobs, Irish workers or north Dublin. When the Asian 'flu now convulsing the sick tigers in the East spreads to the West, which it inevitably will even if it takes years, maximisation of profits and new strategies will mean that these foreign multinational corporations will abandon this country and Dublin workers.</P>
    <P>I call on the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus, on the trade unions and on the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to fight this proposed sell-out with all the power at their command.  They must mobilise and lobby public support and have public demonstrations of opposition to impress on this management and on the Government that this must be cancelled.</P>
    <P>I want a full explanation from the Minister.  I call on the communities in north Dublin not to let this happen because they will suffer badly if multinationals are allowed to swallow up this fine industry.  Swords, Balbriggan, Rush, Lusk, and The Naul are quaint Irish placenames when it comes to the offices of big multinationals in the United States and elsewhere, but no pity for Irish communities will determine their decisions.  The people of these areas can utilise their voices in the Dublin North by-election if the Government does not indicate today that it will cancel this proposal. The Socialist Party, whose candidate will be Claire Daly, will make this an issue of major importance in the by-election.</P>
    <P>The privatisation of TEAM is only the beginning and Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta will be next on the list.  The aviation Bill takes on a very different complexion in this context in that the Minister will be able to privatise these companies without reference to the Dáil.  We will not allow the Government to wash its hands of its responsibilities in this area.  We must retain this fine company in publicly held ownership for the employees and communities who depend on it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Higgins for sharing his time with me.  I was shocked to hear the announcement of the 100 per cent sell off of <Col N="1167" /> TEAM given the legal agreement with Aer Lingus to retain a 51 per cent ownership in it, thereby ensuring State ownership.  This agreement is designed to protect employment and our excellent track record in air safety.  The proposed aggressive buyers have referred to £25 million in compensation, which amounts to approximately £15,000 for each employee.  This is pitiful thanks to employees who have given so much of their time and effort to the company.  This proposal is incredible given that 60 craft workers will be taken on next week.  The company has been restored to full health, has been paying tax to the Government for many years and is two years ahead of schedule in terms of its recovery plan.</P>
      <P>The management and Government must realise that aircraft safety cannot be enhanced by private ownership.  The employees will be very badly damaged when the private owners source jobs currently carried out by TEAM outside the company.  This is a national flagship company and it is incumbent on the Government to ensure it is retained in State ownership and that employees' pensions, which are a cause of considerable worry, will not also be sold off.  The Government must also assure the employees that it is fully behind TEAM as a State owned company which is improving its performance every day and giving a very good service.</P>

Following their meeting with the Minister, the chief executive and board met the workforce.</P>
      <P>The rights of the workers must be fully protected. Regardless of whatever agreement is reached, the Government will fully protect the rights of the workforce.  More importantly, the company must be able to compete in the international market.  If it is not competitive it will not be able to do this.  I am sure the board will give priority to the protection of the 1,600 jobs in the company in whatever decision it brings to Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While TEAM Aer Lingus has been engaged in an exploratory process of identifying possible strategic partners, no proposals have yet been made to me in this regard.  Any such proposal is, <Col N="1168" /> in the first instance, a matter for the board of the Aer Lingus Group and any recommendation made to me by the board will be considered on its merits, having regard to the interests of all relevant parties.  Furthermore, I understand that no proposal has yet been considered by the board in relation to the future of TEAM within the group.</P>
    <P>I am informed by Aer Lingus management that although TEAM is trading moderately well at present, the company's finances are delicately balanced and it continues to remain dependent on the Aer Lingus Group for financial support. The need to position TEAM to attract a strategic partner was clearly set out in the company's five year business plan, which covers the period 1995-99. While the plan envisages TEAM returning to profitability by 1999, provided there is industrial harmony and an improvement in market rates, an appropriate external partner is seen by management as necessary to secure the long-term viability of the company, having regard to the global competitive nature of the industry and recent trends towards consolidation.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate the concerns of the workforce about the future of TEAM which were made clear to me at the meeting I initiated on 14 November with union representatives.  Following the meeting, I told the Chairman of Aer Lingus of my wish for a process of dialogue in which the staff would be consulted and kept informed of developments, while respecting the need for confidentiality in relation to certain commercially sensitive details.  At the meeting the need for confidentiality on some matters was expressed by all sides.</P>

I strongly believe that constructive discussions between both sides on all the relevant matters, with proper regard for employee rights as well as commercial issues, is the way to ensure the best results for the company and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the concern of Deputies about the necessity to safeguard employment in the aviation industry.  This can only be achieved by ensuring that the industry, in all its aspects, is viable in the long term.  The desire to ensure a long-term viable future for TEAM is the prime motivation <Col N="1169" /> for management's efforts to attract a partner. This will also be my prime concern in examining any proposal from the board regarding TEAM's future.  I am concerned to ensure that the prospects for maintaining and strengthening employment opportunities at TEAM are maximised in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I have always taken my responsibilities to the House seriously.  If this matter develops further I will be prepared at any stage to put all the facts before the House.  This issue is of major importance and I will insist on open and consultative dialogue.  The protection of employees and maximisation of employment in the company are the major issues of concern for me, my Department, the Cabinet and Government.</P>

      <P>The problem of roaming horses came to public notice in recent weeks with the serious traffic accident at the Chapelizod bypass in my constituency.  Luckily there were no fatalities on that occasion, but the incident highlighted the serious problem of horses in urban and suburban Dublin.  I acknowledge the legislation put in place by the previous Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  When that legislation was introduced there was great expectation that it would solve the problem.  I informed my constituents that it would mean an end to the difficulties experienced in housing estates in the Ballyfermot area, but that did not happen.  There were delays in agreeing a tagging system and in implementing by-laws by local authorities. Despite the provision of £2 million to implement the legislation, there were little signs of its implementation. The problems of tagging and by-law implementation were, however, resolved prior to the accident on the Chapelizod bypass.</P>
      <P>I extend my best wishes and those of the House to the worker &mdash; I am not aware if he is a corporation worker or a subcontractor &mdash; who was assaulted and badly beaten up by youths in the Finglas area when trying to do the job which I am requesting should be done.  That highlights the need to implement the legislation in a sensitive way.  The Minister recognises the need for a two-pronged approach to this problem.  In my constituency he has supported the Cherry Orchard equine project by allocating £1.5 million.  The community put forward a comprehensive package of proposals for a proper equine centre which would provide training and stables &mdash; it was not intended as a corral for horses.  I thank the Minister on behalf of the community for recognising the merits of the proposals and agreeing to fund them.  The community group is hopeful that work on the project will soon begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If all sections of the Act are implemented further problems will arise for this community. Since the equine centre may not be open before the legislation is implemented &mdash; the local community is genuinely interested in horses and wishes to avail of this service &mdash; perhaps the community <Col N="1170" /> will be allowed to register their horses and house them in a corral on the 11 acres provided by Dublin Corporation for the project.  In that way the horses would not be confiscated before the project is put in place.  I hope an interim solution will be found to the problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should monitor the position.  I am concerned that whenever an incident occurs such as the accident on the Chapelizod bypass there will be a knee-jerk reaction.  In regard to the problem experienced in Finglas, it is not the first time a local authority member has been assaulted when carrying out such work.  The Minister should communicate with local authorities on the difficulties experienced in implementing the Act. If the position is not monitored there may be a piecemeal response to the matter.  Last week horses were again seen roaming on the Lucan bypass and it appears there has been no great improvement in the position.  The Minister should ensure local authorities receive additional finance in the first year of implementation of the Act if that is necessary.  The efficiency of local authorities in implementing the Act must be monitored. Perhaps they have been dilatory and that is why there are still many horses roaming around Dublin city and county.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGennis for raising this important matter.  This problem must be dealt with in two ways, by control and discipline and encouraging young people who have horses to learn the skills of horsemanship.  I was very pleased on coming to office to assist the Cherry Orchard project.  I pay tribute to the voluntary body involved and the local community on their work in this regard.  Dublin Corporation was also very helpful with the project.</P>
      <P>In many speeches in this House on education matters, I spoke about the importance of training people in skills for which they have an aptitude, and those young people have an aptitude for riding horses, sometimes with two or three people on the same horse.  We have a tremendous skill nationally in horsemanship.  For example, Kieran Fallon is a champion jockey in England and previously Pat Eddery, another Irishman, was champion jockey.  Aidan McCoy, Adrian Maguire, Norman Williams and Charlie Swan are prominent in national hunt.  Last Sunday in the US two young Dublin people came first in the world in golf while in Japan Michael Kinnane, an Irish jockey, won the Japan Cup, the richest race in the world.  Young people who own horses can become international horsemen and do a tremendous job for themselves, their families and the country.  I will do everything possible to ensure they are encouraged to improve their skills in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Control of Horses Act, 1996, which was brought into operation on 18 March 1997 provides for the designation, by local authority by-laws, of control areas in which horses cannot be kept without licences &mdash; Dublin Corporation and <Col N="1171" /> South Dublin County Council have introduced by-laws under this Act.  The Act also contains provisions on the licensing procedure and the identification of horses, a ban on the sale of horses to minors, the seizure and detention of stray horses, the confiscation of horses which stray repeatedly, the disposal of horses seized by local authorities, the maintenance of registers of horses licensed and seized, and criminal liability for permitting or causing a horse to pose a danger to persons or property.</P>
    <P>The Control of Horses Regulations, 1997, were introduced on 24 April 1997 for the necessary purpose of prescribing the licence fee of £25, the format of the licence and of a fine/on-the-spot notice and horse identification.  It is a matter for local authorities to administer such aspects.  The making of these regulations completed the legislative framework necessary to enable local authorities to implement the Act.  Electronic microchips have since been prescribed as the means to be used to identify horses coming within the scope of the Act.  It was necessary that the Minister approve suppliers of such devices.  Two such suppliers were approved in September 1997 and local authorities were informed on 24 September 1997. In so far as my Department is concerned, there should be no confusion on the question of the electronic identification of horses.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Department's Estimates for 1997 to pay grants to local authorities to assist in implementing the Act.  Further provision has been made in the 1998 Estimates. The Department advised local authorities of the specific criteria which would be applied in its consideration of grant allocations and formal applications for assistance totalling almost £1 million have been received from local authorities.  The Department is in the process of examining these applications.  An amount was recently paid to one local authority and arrangements are being made to make payments to others.</P>
    <P>My Department carried out a survey of the wandering horses problem in January 1997 and ascertained that there were some 4,000 wandering horses in the country.  Of the 4,000, some 3,000 are in the Dublin area and are a serious problem.  As the survey indicated, the two Dublin local authorities experiencing the most acute problems with wandering horses are Dublin Corporation and South Dublin County Council.  At my request, officials of the Department met the four Dublin authorities on 18 November and held discussions on the full implementation of the Act.  My Department will continue to seek to have the regulations implemented as quickly, efficiently and as comprehensively as possible.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the legislation and effective tackling of the problem of wandering horses is a matter for local authorities.  I have made it clear that I want the problem tackled as soon as possible and I will continue to encourage the young people concerned to make a career of what is now a problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are almost 5,000 craft workers working in such important areas as voluntary hospitals and health boards and maintaining sewerage services and water supplies and local authority houses and buildings.  The threatened strike by these workers could have a devastating effect on some of the most vulnerable in our society.</P>
      <P>Approximately half of the 5,000 workers work in the hospital system and if the threatened strike goes ahead from mid-night tomorrow night, without being too alarmist, a renal dialysis machine might have to be switched off because there would be no one to maintain it or even change a bulb.  Basic heating services and boilers in hospitals would cease to be maintained, thereby creating a serious problem for the major acute hospitals, such as the Mater, St. Vincent's and Beaumont, and other hospitals around the country.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that at 4.00 p.m. this afternoon the craft unions were due to meet the Labour Court.  That meeting may result in the withdrawal of the strike threat and talks between the Labour Court, the unions and management could take place some time next week.  I sincerely hope this is the case and that even as I speak that could be the case.  I hope a solution can be found to remove the threat of a strike.</P>
      <P>The genesis of this problem seems to relate to the analogue agreement which has existed for craft workers since 1979.  The system evolved whereby a comparison was made between the pay of craft workers and the average pay in 18 semiState and private companies, for example, the ESB, Telecom Éireann and Irish Ropes. Increases were generally paid to the craft workers by regular reviews.  The last review was held in 1994 and I understand there have been approximately seven reviews in the past 18 years leading each time to a small increase in pay.</P>
      <P>A review is currently being undertaken.  During this review the craft unions have sought an increase of £27 per week to maintain parity with the 18 analogue companies and the employer side has offered approximately £13.  The negotiations for the review were chaired by an independent chair, Mr. Aidan Bunyon, formerly of the Labour Court.  It would appear the craft unions were unhappy with the offer made by the employers and decided to ballot their members for strike action.  That ballot took place in October and the strike was called for 28 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the unions seem to have by-passed some of the procedures in place by not going to the Labour Court.  To maintain the industrial and employment security we have had in recent years, it is important that all workers follow the procedures and that a strike is a last resort.  I am pleased the craft unions are meeting the Labour Court.  I am also pleased the craft unions clarified yesterday that they would provide cover for people at risk if the strike goes ahead.  However, it is a matter of great concern that 30,000 SIPTU workers indicated they would back the craft workers in strike action.  The repercussions <Col N="1173" /> from such a pull-out from the workplace would be enormous.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for the craft workers in that they are receiving lower pay rates than many of the workers in the new jobs in the field of technology. The average pay per craft worker is approximately £300 with some small allowances for travel and unsocial hours.  However, they provide a valuable service to our health care facilities and local government services.  We would all suffer greatly if their services are withdrawn.  I sincerely hope a suitable agreement can be reached in the Labour Court and I urge the employers and the craft unions to do all in their power to avoid the chaos that a strike would bring.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance warned yesterday of the crucial need to curtail public sector pay, while at the same time every Fianna Fáil TD and Minister is travelling around the country announcing all sorts of grants and payments.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  I urge the Government in this instance to be as accommodating as possible to the craft workers who have fallen behind the general level of pay.  In return, I would urge the craft workers' unions to accept the need to follow the procedures set down for the protection of workers.</P>

      <P>Trade unions representing 4,000 craft workers in health and local authority services have served official strike notice to take effect from Friday, 28 November 1997.  This threat of industrial action is in clear breach of the industrial peace clause of Partnership 2000.  When direct discussions with the craft unions failed to reach agreement the unions decided to ballot their members on strike action without having recourse to the normal agreed industrial procedures.  In addition, the unions have indicated that emergency cover will not be provided and have refused to discuss this further with the Local Government Management Services Board and the Health Services Employers' Agency.</P>
      <P>I must express particular concern at this stance. The refusal to provide emergency cover is unprecedented in the conduct of industrial disputes in the health services.  By proceeding down this road, the unions will jeopardise the safety and even the lives of patients.  I cannot see any justification for the unions taking this position.  The Health Services Employers' Agency, acting on behalf of the health boards and public voluntary hospitals, with the Local Government Management Services Board, have brought the matter to the attention of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and asked for their assistance to progress the issue peacefully, with particular reference to the provision of emergency cover in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State has put in place appropriate mechanisms to deal with issues of contention when agreement cannot be reached through direct discussions between management and workers.  I welcome the news of the unions' agreement to meet the Labour Court at 4.00 p.m. this afternoon. I am not aware of the outcome of those discussions, but I appeal again to the unions to <Col N="1174" /> suspend their industrial action to allow for the orderly and peaceful resolution of the dispute. This would avoid disruption of the health services and the consequential danger to patients' lives and well-being and the likely distress and hardship to the public.  If it goes ahead, this dispute will undoubtedly affect the various services which health boards and voluntary hospitals provide. The provision of services is a matter for each health board and voluntary hospital but I have asked each agency to keep my Department informed of the impact the dispute may have on service provision and the contingency plans they have to deal with the implications.</P>
    <P>The health and safety of patients and the employees of the health services are my main priority and my Department will monitor the situation constantly.  I am concerned to maintain safe treatment of emergency cases.  Health boards and hospitals are reviewing their services.  Where there is expected to be a disruption of services, individual agencies will contact their patients directly to inform them of the position as it relates to their hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Cowen, arranged for a notice in the national newspapers today, informing the public of the dispute and asking prospective patients to contact hospitals for detailed information.</P>
    <P>From the information to hand, I expect the strike, if it goes ahead, will have varying effects on the services provided by hospitals.  Some will not be affected as they do not employ craftsmen directly; in these cases maintenance, etc., is provided by outside contractors.  However, in some of the larger hospitals I anticipate that elective admissions will need to be deferred.  Accident and Emergency services by their very nature will remain open and I intend to monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic the intervention of the Labour Court this afternoon will prove successful and a suspension of the dispute will avert the threat to patient health and welfare.  I will continue to monitor the effect on services and to ensure the public are kept informed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In raising this matter I do not want to criticize whoever made this mistake; I wish to highlight the fact that some unemployed people are being prevented from availing of an excellent course.  The course was advertised under the logo of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, it is entitled &ldquo;College/Industry Technician Initiative Course&rdquo; and the advertisement asked: &ldquo;Do you want a career in technology?&rdquo; Applicants had to be aged 21 and over and in receipt of unemployment benefit.  This course is a major success story and applicants are guaranteed an interview at its end.  Those who complete the training are almost guaranteed a job.  For some reason the scheme is run through regional colleges and administered by the CAO.  The closing date for the scheme was Friday, 14 November but the course was advertised in a paper dated 14 November, although <Col N="1175" /> admittedly it would be available in towns on 12 November.  However, even if everyone interested had bought the paper on 12 November, the notice was hopeless.</P>
      <P>One parent came to me about the course; he had received a reply from the CAO stating that it may only process those applicants for the course which had arrived in a fully completed state, including payment of the application fee by 5.15 p.m. on the closing date.  The letter was nicely-written and sympathetic but the person's application was not accepted; faxes were no good because the fee was not enclosed.  Those who applied on time are being called for interview tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I do not want to know who made the mistake of placing the advertisement so late.  The course is not regulated by statute so I want the Minister to ask the CAO to accept the late applications and allow those people to be called for interview. If we want to encourage unemployed people to improve their position we should not discourage them when they are prepared to do the work.  All I want to do is get justice for these late applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The joint college-industry initiative is a scheme which offers people opportunities to get technical qualifications through a combination of attendance at college and placement within industry.  It is being run under the auspices of the Department of Education and Science and the EU at nine regional colleges and involves a number of well known companies in the computer and other industries as partners.</P>
      <P>From my point of view as Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, the scheme offered a major new opportunity which might be availed of by unemployed people and lone parents wishing to get back to work, in that it provides high quality training in a sector with very good employment opportunities.  I saw it as important, therefore, that information about the scheme would be made available as widely as possible to unemployed people so that they might be in a position to apply for inclusion in the scheme.  It is the type of scheme constantly being examined by my Department, by which we could entice people back into the workforce and give them the proper education and skills required for them to compete in the jobs market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following discussions with the Department of Education and Science it was agreed the scheme would be included within the scope of my Department's third level allowance scheme under which unemployed people effectively retain their unemployment payment when they take up certain education courses.  The scheme was advertised in the national press on Sunday, 2 November with a <Col N="1176" /> closing date for applications of Friday, 14 November.</P>
    <P>At a meeting on 5 November my Department's jobs facilitators, who are responsible, among other things, for ensuring that unemployed people are made aware of the employment and educational opportunities available, were requested to make every effort to publicise the initiative and a poster for display at the Department's offices was produced to help them to do this.  The advertisements to which Deputy Browne refers appeared in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> and the <i>Carlow Nationalist</i> on 12 November and were inserted at the initiative of the local jobs facilitator.  They gave details of the initiative with a closing date of 14 November.  Although the paper is dated 14 November, it actually appeared on 12 November, as the Deputy acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The motive of the jobs facilitator in placing the advertisements was to ensure that as many people as possible in her catchment area got to hear about the initiative and were made aware that financial assistance was available through the third level allowance for those who wanted to attend. She saw the scheme as an important opportunity for young unemployed people and lone parents and thought it should be publicised as widely as possible.  She was aware of the closing date of 14 November but still felt that placing the advertisement was the best way of ensuring that people locally were informed.  She was also aware that the paper would be published on 12 November. At the same time she made arrangements with the local office of my Department for applications to be processed on the spot where people were in a position to attend.  I compliment the jobs facilitator for her initiative.</P>
    <P>As a direct result of the advertisement 33 applications from people in Carlow and Kilkenny have been submitted to the Central Admissions Office. Eighteen late applications were received.  I am advised it is not possible at this stage for the CAO to extend the closing date for the initiative as this would involve a breach of contract with applicants who have applied on time.</P>
    <P>What happened in advertising in Carlow-Kilkenny was a well-intentioned effort by the local jobs facilitator to ensure the initiative was widely publicised at a local level.  It followed up on an earlier advertisement in the national press and it is to be regretted if it has unintentionally resulted in disappointment for some people.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, has already announced there is potential for a further intake on new courses of this sort next autumn and those who have been disappointed this time around will have the opportunity to apply again then.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 2 December 1997.</P>

      <P>It is planned that a competition will be organised through the Civil Service Commission with a view to the appointment of full-time director of the National Library in the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>With regard to the opening hours of the library I am pleased to say that the opening hours were recently extended as on and from the 10 November of this year.  For some years now the library was closed to the public on Tuesdays and Wednesdays until 2 p.m. As a result of the changes the Library is now open from 10 a.m. from Monday to Saturday.</P>
      <P>The annual library stock-taking process which involved closure of the library for a period of between two to four weeks in each year has now also been changed to a stock-taking process that will not involve any closure of the library.  These changes represent a major improvement in service for National Library users and I compliment all the staff of the library on their efforts in facilitating this development.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of a book and periodical binding service, the National Library uses a variety of methods to help preserve the materials in its collections and choose the most appropriate and cost effective method for each category of material.  There has never been an inhouse book binding service in the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> To meet the binding needs for the future a technical services building for the library has recently been completed and is planned to be operational early in 1998.  This building will house a bindery utilising the most modern equipment and system of binding and will enable the library to be up to date with current binding requirements within the short to medium term.</P>

      <P>In order for the National Museum to properly manage its collections, it is necessary that all its artefact be documented and that an easily accessible record of these collections be in place.  In the past such documentation systems have been largely paperbased and were not always maintained in a consistent manner.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the needs in this area, a programme was initiated on a pilot basis in 1995 to prepare a computerised inventory of the museum's collections.  The immediate focus was to catalogue, document and photograph all the objects in the museum's art and industrial collections destined for transfer to its new facility in Collins Barracks.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that approximately 25,000 objects have now been documented to this standard, and that with the records now created it will be possible to generate a wide range of indexes for internal and external use which will serve to make such information available to a wider public. This work represents the beginning of a longterm process of properly documenting all of the records relating to the museum's extensive collections. Specific staffing resources were engaged on a contract basis to deal with this pilot programme.</P>
      <P>In addition, in response to the identified needs in this area, a newly created post in the museum of registrar and information technology officer was filled this year.  The brief of this officer includes a review of the work achieved to date, as well as establishing the documentation needs and the programmes required for the future in relation to the museum's other collections.  I am confident that with the preparation of a dedicated strategy in the information technology and registration areas that considerable progress will be made towards resolving these long-standing issues.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that Ireland ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1996.  Among the aims of the convention are the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and a key means of achieving these is through the development of biodiversity plans by the parties to the convention.  A national biodiversity plan is currently being prepared by my Department which will address the areas relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As I was anxious to have the widest possible participation in the development of the biodiversity plan, I arranged for a public consultation process in July of this year by announcing that such a plan was being prepared and seeking written submissions from interested bodies and individuals. Approximately fifty submissions were received and these are being considered in the context of the drafting of the national biodiversity plan.</P>
      <P>The plan will review the state of biological diversity in Ireland and outline the measures which are currently in place for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in Ireland.  However, the main focus of the plan will be on setting out strategies and actions to be undertaken for the conservation and sustainable use of such biological diversity in the future.  The plan will examine biodiversity at ecosystem, species and the genetic level and it will cover all ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) and all taxonomic groups.  The plan will pay special attention to the need for the integration of the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity into all relevant sectors and will consider the main sectors which impact on biodiversity, including agriculture, forestry and the marine.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to have the plan published during 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Chester Beatty Library is an independent charitable trust and while substantially funded by the Exchequer, as Minister, it is not within my remit to have any operational input or direct plans for this institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as has been announced previously, the library is being relocated from its present premises in Shrewsbury Road to new facilities at <Col N="1180" /> the Clock Tower in Dublin Castle.  The refurbishment programme has been carried out with the high quality of imagination and professionalism which we have come to expect from the Office of Public Works in working on all our public buildings.  The capital cost of this work was £5.5 million of which £2.25 million was provided in EU grant aid funds available to my Department through the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 with the remainder sourced from the Vote of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The refurbishment has been overseen by a working party representing my Department, the Office of Public Works and the Chester Beatty Library.  The Office of Public Works is providing architectural services and a design firm has been appointed to prepare the exhibitions which are estimated to cost some £3.4 million.  Detailed planning and consultation is taking place so as to fully utilise these new facilities in realising the immense educational and cultural value of the collections in the Chester Beatty Library which have been underexposed in their present site.  It is envisaged that the new facility will be open to the public in the first half of 1999.</P>
    <P>The High Court has recently given permission for changes to be made to the terms of the Chester Beatty Library Trust.  These changes will facilitate the sale of the Shewsbury Road premises with the proceeds being applied to offset some of the cost of completing the redevelopment at the library's new location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Canals Act, 1986, makes provision for the development of the canals as public amenities, the recent Grand Canal and Royal Canal corridor studies, which were published in 1994 and 1995, set out frameworks for undertaking improvements to the physical, economic and social environment within the canal corridors in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Steady improvements have been made in developing the canal infrastructure in the Dublin area over the past number of years.  This work included hard landscaping in Ringsend Dock, three planting along the waterways, automation of a sea lock at Ringsend, replacement of lock gates on the system, new jetties at Mespil Road and Portobello, new mooring posts throughout the system and dredging works.  Further improvements will be carried out on both canals over the next few years as funding permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> EU funding under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 has been used to provide canal infrastructure and, inter alia, to provide a fish stocking programme on the canals and to install fishing stands at specific locations on the system.  It is my objective to develop the canals as premier coarse fishing centres and I have been greatly encouraged by the development of new angling clubs along the canals in the Dublin area. The excellent water quality in our canals has been a major factor contributing to the development of fishing along the system and it is the intention, with the assistance of the Central Fisheries Board, to maintain these high standards.</P>
    <P>The canals are also increasingly used for water sport activities, particularly on the large water body at Ringsend Dock.  Water-based sporting activities include wind surfing, dinghy sailing, swimming, canoeing and model boat racing. Canoe polo is also becoming popular and international canoe polo competitions have taken place on the Royal Canal at Kilcock.</P>
    <P>The Waterways Visitor Centre at Grand Canal Quay provides a unique educational facility for developing an understanding of the waterways system throughout the country.  The Centre has become a popular attraction for school trips and I would hope that more schools and colleges will avail of this wonderful facility in the future.</P>

      <P>Is é Údarás na Gaeltachta an príomhghléas atá ag an Stát chun cuidiú le tionscail agus scéimeanna táirgiúla fostaíochta a bhunú, a fhorbairt agus a chothabháil sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá réimse leathan de ghríosaithe thionsclaíocha agus de ghníomhaíochtaí á n-úsáid ag an Údarás chun fostaíocht a chruthú agus chun deiseanna oiliúna agus forbartha pearsanta a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Cuimsíonn straitéis chruthú fostaíochta an Údaráis céimeanna a luíonn leis na cúinsí ar leith atá i réim sa Ghaeltacht ar nós na teanga.</P>
      <P>Is comhlacht Stáit reachtúil é an tÚdarás atá ag plé le forbairt na Gaeltachta ó 1980 ar aghaidh agus a bhfuil torthaí maithe á mbaint amach aige. Ón am sin tá go leor acmhainní Stáit curtha ar fáil don eagraíocht chun forbairt thionsclaíoch agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus bíonn tacaíocht iomlán mo Roinne le fáil chun cabhrú leo san obair sin.</P>
      <P>Is cúis átháis dom go mbeidh soláthar £24.25 milliúin ar fáil don Údarás i 1998, méadú ar sholáthar 1997.  Is léiriú an tsuim shuntasach sin ar thacaíocht an Rialtais don obair thábhachtach a bhíonn ar siúl ag an Údarás ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.</P>

RPS Cairns was then given an opportunity to respond to those submissions and it submitted its response last month.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that responsibility for the Irish Genealogical Project (IGP) has recently been transferred from the Department of the Taoiseach to my Department.</P>
      <P>The report on a value for money examination of the IGP which the Deputy refers to was laid before the Oireachtas in April last by the then Taoiseach.  The report highlights several difficulties, including the need to fix the establishment of clear targets for the completion by local centres of the database, the periodic assessment of progress relative to those targets, the need to progress the establishment of a central signposting index and the need to develop a marketing plan for the project.  Following the transfer of responsibility my Department will be examining how these dificiencies can best be addressed by Irish Genealogy Ltd.</P>

      <P>National Monuments in State care are not all accessible to people with disabilities and, having regard to the broad nature of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; comprehended by the Deputy's question, monuments accessible to one category of disability would not be so to another. However, where specialist visitor facilities are provided, every effort is made to provide access for such people consistent with the overriding need not to interfere with the integrity of the monument.  Where there are restrictions, these are generally adverted to in the free booklet, entitled &ldquo;Heritage Sites &mdash; Opening Hours and Admission Charges&rdquo; which is published each year for the information of intending visitors by the education and visitor service of my Department.</P>
      <P>The national monuments and historic properties service of my Department is acutely conscious of the need to facilitate people with disabilities to view their heritage and, where improvements can be made without damaging the integrity of the monument and at reasonable cost, these will be implemented as resources permit.</P>

    <P>These revisions have the effect of reducing all unexpended European Regional Development Fund funding from projects at the Blasket Island piers, Mayo National Park, Clara Nature Reserve and the National Library.  It will also result in amendments which still have to be finalised in the list of projects which will be eligible for further European Regional Development Fund assistance under the OP in the waterways service and in the cultural development incentives scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the mid-term review an additional 1.5 million ECU has been allocated under a new measure in subprogramme 3 (marketing) of the operational programme for overseas marketing of cultural and heritage attractions.  My Department will be working closely with the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Bord Fáilte in determining the list of marketing initiatives to be adopted with the aid of this additional funding.</P>
    <P>It has also been agreed as a result of the mid-term review that an appraisal of progress on projects approved under subprogramme 1 be completed by spring 1998 to enable the monitoring committee for the tourism OP to review the necessity, if any, for further reallocation of resources at that time.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht announced the establishment of a screen commission for Ireland on 4 June last.  The preferred method of funding was to be from recoupments on loans advanced by the Irish Film Board since 1994.  However, the reality was that these funds were not immediately at his disposal and that the screen commission could not &mdash; despite his announcement &mdash; be established, funded on this basis.</P>
      <P>Because the loans being provided by the film board are co-funded by the European Union under the operational programme for industrial development, any decision to use recoupments for the purpose of funding the screen commission required the express approval of the European Commission.  On 6 November last, at a meeting of the monitoring committee for the operational programme, at which the necessary technical decisions to allow the funding of the screen commission from this source were taken, my Department received oral approval from the Commission. I await the formal written confirmation of the Commission approval which, I understand, will not be operative until 1 January next.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am taking the opportunity to meet with industry interests, RTÉ and the Irish Film Board itself to hear, <i>inter alia,</i> their views on their priorities for the screen commission and I will make my decision in the matter after giving careful consideration to all the issues raised.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Dempsey, Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and I, are currently finalising, and will shortly be bringing forward to Government for consideation, a package of legislative, administrative and financial proposals for the protection of the architectural heritage (which will include important elements of vernacular architecture and the industrial heritage), based on the recommendations in the report of the inter-departmental working group on strengthening the protection of the architectural heritage.</P>

      <P>I intend to address this matter in the context of the transposition into Irish law of Article 3(A) of Directive 97/36/EC adopted in June 1997, which amended the Television without Frontiers Directive (89/552/EEC). The new article provides that member states may designate national and non-national events as events which are of major importance to society and that broadcasters who acquire broadcasting <Col N="1196" /> rights to such events cannot exercise these rights in such a way as to deprive a substantial proportion of the population of access to coverage of such events on &ldquo;free-to-air&rdquo; television.</P>
      <P>I am considering urgently how best the provisions of the amended directive can be transposed into Irish law and the matter has been referred to the Attorney General for advice.  I will be consulting with my colleague the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, and others such as RTE and the Independent Radio and Television Commission when the mechanics of the transposition measures are decided upon.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem that exists with overgrazing, which applies particularly to areas of commonage in upland areas.</P>
      <P>The country's most important wildlife areas are required to be designated either as special protection areas (SPAs) under the 1979 EU Birds Directive, or as special areas of conservation (SACs) under the 1992 EU Habitats Directive. Over 100 SPAs have already been designated in Ireland and the process of designating SACs is well under way, in that the main part of what will be Ireland's SAC network (over 200 sites amounting to some 550,000 ha) has already been publicly proposed for designation and is accordingly protected.</P>
      <P>Land in SACs and SPAs will henceforth be required to be farmed in accordance with an approved agri-environmental plan, which will specify, <i>inter alia</i>, the stocking restrictions, if any, required to conserve the land in question.  Those participating in the rural environment protection scheme (REPS), administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, will have a farm plan prepared as part of that scheme.  Those who do not wish to join REPS may operate in accordance with a plan prepared by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  Each individual farm plan impinging on commonage land will have to be compatible with an overall plan for the commonage prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This plan will specify the maximum overall stocking density that the area can carry on a sustainable basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>The listing of areas of natural importance is already being addressed.</P>
      <P>The EU Habitats Directive, which was transposed into Irish law on 26 February 1997, by the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 94 of 1997), requires member states to protect their most important natural areas by listing and designating them as special areas of conservation (SACs) and by protecting their ecological status thereafter.</P>
      <P>The main part of Ireland's SAC proposals were notified to landowners thought to be affected and advertised in provincial newspapers and on local radio earlier this year.  A number of sites are the subject of appeals and I will not formally notify the EU Commission of those sites until appeals have been resolved.  I hope that this can be achieved by next April.  The possibility as to whether sites on which there have been no appeals could be notified at an earlier date is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>In addition, over 100 special protection areas (SPAs) have already been designated under the terms of the 1979 EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC).  These are areas of particular importance for wild birds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, areas proposed as natural heritage areas (NHAs) are areas which reflect our national priorities for nature conservation.  Generally speaking, they include all the areas proposed for SAC status together with some additional areas.  The areas proposed for designation were published in 1995 but formal designations will not take place until the Wildlife Act, <Col N="1199" /> 1976, has been amended.  I hope to bring the amending Bill before the Oireachtas early in 1998.</P>

      <P>Officials of the national parks and wildlife service (NPWS) of my Department have been actively involved in monitoring and dealing with the consequences of the unfortunate oil spill in Cork Harbour and wildlife management staff have been drafted in from adjacent areas to assist in the operation.  The NPWS has also been in regular contact with the oil refinery, the Environmental Protection Agency, the local authority with responsibility for the clean up operation and local voluntary bodies in relation to the impact of the oil spill.  In excess of 1,400 birds, mostly guillemots, together with two seals and three otters, are known to have died directly as a result of the spillage and I am advised that it is likely that there were further casualties in the more remote areas which have not as yet come to attention.  On the information available to date, the impact of the spillage on fish stocks will be minimal.</P>

      <P>The statement of strategy for my Department was published in May last and a number of initiatives has since been undertaken.  The main areas of action are as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Co-ordination and Monitoring:</i>
      </P>
      <P>An SMI co-ordination group has been established to advise on and assist with the planning and implementation of the SMI in my Department. The group acts as the promoter of the process within my Department and, being chaired on a rotating basis by an assistant secretary, is a demonstration of the high level management commitment to the SMI process which is required by <i>Delivering Better Government.</i></P>
      <P>
        <i>Quality Customer Service</i>
      </P>
      <P>My Department has drawn up an action plan on quality customer service which I hope to launch formally in the coming weeks.  The plan sets out a two year plan to ensure the delivery of a quality service to the customer and identifies initiatives &mdash; some of which are already in hand &mdash; to ensure that this objective will be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" />
      <i>Organisation Review</i>
    </P>
    <P>A review of the management structure, operations, organisation processes and staffing of the heritage functions of my Department is currently under way with a view to identifying the measures necessary to provide a high quality co-ordinated and effective service and to draw up a practical action plan to implement these measures.  The review, which is due for completion in the first quarter of 1998, will take into account the existing structures and resources in all other areas of my Department.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Training Needs Analysis</i>
    </P>
    <P>A training needs analysis project, which seeks to address the training needs of my Department in the broadest sense, including on-the-job training and staff development needs, is currently under way.  The study, which has as a central theme the linking of training with job responsibilities, both now and in the future, will be completed in early 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Information Technology (IT) Review</i>
    </P>
    <P>Preliminary steps have been taken in establishing parameters for a review of my Department's IT function.  It is expected that the study itself will commence before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Apart from the main areas of action referred to above, work is continuing in my Department in regard to a number of other SMI issues, including the preparation for a review of my Department's statement of strategy, which is due to be carried out by March 1998.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my replies to Questions Nos. 205 and 211 of 14 October 1997 and to Question No. 34 of 23 October 1997.  The position is that Cablelink which provides cable television services in Dublin, Galway and Waterford has sought an amendment to its cable television licence which would authorise the relay of the proposed &ldquo;cable only&rdquo; music television service referred to by the Deputy.  I have no function in the regulation of cable television systems.  However, I have been asked for views from a broadcasting policy perspective on the proposal.  I have met the person who has proposed the establishment of the music television service and I am considering his and other relevant views on the matter.  I hope to convey my views to the Director of Telecommunications <Col N="1202" /> Regulation, who has responsibility for the regulation of cable television systems, in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>European regional funding within my Department is expended under various programmes and the greater part of it is devoted to national/regional cultural activities, national monuments and historic properties, waterways and national parks and wildlife facilities.  The rationale for, and the nature of, this funding is outlined in subprogramme 1 of the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 for Natural/Cultural Tourism.  Within this subprogramme the cultural development incentives scheme has, <i>inter alia</i>, made it possible to target social groups living in areas where up to now facilities for cultural activities were inadequate or non-existent.  However, I should emphasise that the primary purpose of the subprogramme is to generate economic benefit to the economy by making our rich store of cultural and heritage attractions more accessible and attractive to overseas tourists.  This is the basis on which European Regional Development Funding assistance was obtained.  It is not therefore a specific mechanisn for targeting disadvantaged social groups.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the European Commission approved a project under the Cohesion Fund aimed at conserving and restoring a number of Irish raised bogs.  The total cost of this is 2.5 million ECU, of which 85 per cent is met by the EU.  The project is due to be completed in 1998.</P>

      <P>In the case of some groups of wildlife species, reviews of their conservation status have been carried out and it is known that, while for many species their conservation status is satisfactory, there are a number of species which are in decline, some of them seriously.  In the case of some further species, there are indications or grounds to suspect that they may be in decline, but the knowledge base available to assess the true situation is less than adequate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a range of measures already in place, including a small number targeted at specific threatened species, which should help to halt or reverse the decline of wildlife species.  However, I believe that the situation is less than satisfactory, both with regard to the state of knowledge available and to the taking of specific actions aimed at improving the conservation status of species, particularly those species which are in serious decline.  The national biodiversity plan, which is being prepared by my Department, will aim to address these issues and, in the elaboration of a strategy for species conservation in that plan, serious consideration is being given to the necessity for drawing up specific action plans for threatened species.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>All dredging of gravel from State owned foreshore requires the prior consent of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources under the foreshore Acts.  A foreshore licence was granted to Bilberry Shipping and Stevedores Ltd. , on 4 November to carry out a pilot survey of up to 200 tonnes of seabed material from an area south of Waterford Harbour.  Put in context, 200 tonnes would be the equivalent of ten truck loads of material.  The survey, which lasted less than half a day, took place on 10 November last. Officials from the Department and the Marine Institute were on board the dredger to monitor the survey.  They were empowered to halt the survey in the event of damage or injury to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>The application for the licence was subject to thorough examination in the Department, which also consulted the Marine Institute.  The application was published in local and national newspapers in July 1993.  No objection to the proposed survey of aggregate was received from East Waterford Lobster Co-Op Society Ltd.</P>
      <P>The co-op society wrote to the Department on 18 November 1996 expressing its concerns about the survey.  The Department replied in detail on 6 December 1996, and no response was received from the co-op until 13 November last, some three days after the pilot survey was completed. The site surveyed is not a recognised area for harvesting lobsters, and an initial post survey report indicates that the survey itself did not generate any deleterious effects which could be damaging to any other fish breeding grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To summarise, the dredging in question was allowed for a small scale pilot survey under stringent conditions.  Expert advice indicated that the survey would not pose a threat to the marine environment.  The rationale behind the survey was to examine the quality of the seabed material with a view to potential future development of this marine resource.  Any future application for extraction of material will be subjected to rigorous examination including full consultation with <Col N="1212" /> the public and the submission of an environmental impact statement.</P>

      <P>The comments about the railway system in the communication to which the Deputy refers were made in the context of the contribution which it could make to the protection of the environment.  The reference to extensions of the rail network is an indication that a substantial expansion of the mainline railway system is not a realistic option in this regard, given such factors as the extent of the existing rail network, the capital costs of new rail construction, and the diseconomies of rail operations in Ireland.  It was never intended to rule out the possibility that cases might be made from time to time for local rail extension projects in particular circumstances. The reference in the communication to the current EU-assisted investment programme in the existing mainline rail network involving expenditure of more than £275 million in the period from 1994-99 underlines the Government's commitment to the railway system.</P>

      <P>The negotiations at the Third Conference of the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are expected to strengthen the convention commitments by, <i>inter alia,</i> adoption of legally binding limitation and reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions.  The European Union will also be seeking commitments in the negotiations on the development at international level of common and co-ordinated policies and measures, including in relation to the transport sector, for the achievement of these targets.  In this context, the promotion of cycling will be primarily a matter for national action.  The Dublin Transport Initiative final report acknowledges that cycling is an environmental and energy efficient means of transport and gives particular attention to the promotion of cycling.  I have asked the Dublin Transportation Office (DTO) to prepare a national cycle guidelines manual which will set out all aspects of the design of cycle facilities for use by local authorities and I understand that work on this is at an advanced stage.  I also understand that the DTO is in the final stages of the preparation of a co-ordinated cycle route network for the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>An EU framework directive on ambient air quality was adopted in September 1996.  It will be followed by subsidiary directives specifying <Col N="1221" /> air quality standards for a number of pollutants. The first such directive will deal with lead, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particular matter.  Ireland is supporting the development of these new air quality standards and, in parallel with this process, the EPA is preparing a national air quality monitoring programme.</P>
      <P>As regards emissions from motor vehicles the thrust of policies within the EU since 1970 has been, and continues to be, based on vehicle type approval and emissions standards.</P>
      <P>Successively more stringent standards for passenger and goods vehicles have been laid down and Ireland continues to comply with all EU vehicle emission control directives.  Ireland also continues to support the developing EU auto oil programme as an appropriate means of addressing many of the environmental issues arising from vehicle emissions.  The programme will introduce further measures to reduce emissions from vehicles as well as more stringent fuel standards to apply from the year 2000 and later from 2005.</P>
      <P>In addition, local measures such as the Dublin Transportation Initiative and traffic management measures elsewhere, the improvement of public transport and the promotion of other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas, and the extension of compulsory vehicle testing will assist in the response to urban traffic increases and associated vehicle emissions.  The Government is also committed to extending the ban on bituminous coal to major urban areas.  I will be bringing forward proposals for appropriate measures to be implemented in the 1998-99 heating season.</P>

      <P>Government policy in relation to abatement of CO 2 and other greenhouses gas emissions is most recently set out in Ireland's Second National Communication under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, published in July 1997. The communication details a range of policies and measures to limit the growth in Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> As far as the transport sector is concerned, the communication refers to measures being taken to improve the efficiency of the road and rail networks, to promote public transport and other alternatives to the private car in major urban areas (including Dublin), and to reduce the age profile and increase the fuel efficiency of private cars.  The communication describes the DTI Strategy for Dublin which, when fully implemented, will secure a significant shift towards the use of public transport in the area.  Certain road infrastructural works, including completion of the C-Ring, are also necessary for the achievement of this objective.  Implementation of the roadsrelated measures referred to in the communication does not call for the issuing of a specific directive to the NRA.</P>
    <P>Future policy development in relation to climate change will take into account, <i>inter alia,</i> the outcome of the conference of the parties to the convention to be held in Kyoto shortly, developments at EU level and the conclusions of the consultancy study, commissioned by my Department, in relation to limitation and reduction of CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

      <Quest>if persons (details supplied) in Dublin 7 who are currently in receipt of £155 per week on unemployment assistance will only receive £154.80 should one partner take up employment on the community enterprise scheme, earning £90 per week; if this anomaly will be rectified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The couple concerned are currently in receipt of unemployment assistance of £147.10 per week, comprising the personal rate of £67.50, a qualified adult allowance of £40, and three child dependant allowances at the rate of £13.20. In addition, they are in receipt of a free fuel allowance of £8, bringing their total weekly payment to £155.10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that with effect from today, I have brought into effect legislation which provides for the introduction of a tapered withdrawal <Col N="1225" /> of the qualified adult allowance.  Briefly, this measure provides that where the spouse or partner of a recipient of certain social welfare payments earns between £60 and £90, the qualified adult allowance will continue to be payable but at a reduced rate.  Under the previous arrangements, entitlement to the qualified adult allowance would be automatically lost when the income of the spouse or partner exceeded £60 per week.  This represented a major disincentive for such people to take up employment opportunities. The measure being brought into effect today represents the first step towards alleviating this poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The measure will have a positive effect on the position of people such as the couple referred to by the Deputy.  In their case, if one of the couple takes up employment with a net income of £90 per week, the social welfare claimant will continue to receive a qualified adult allowance of £4 per week and now also retain entitlement to the fuel allowance.  The net effect, based on the information available, is that the aggregrate household income would rise to £161.30 per week (comprising income of £90, UA of £63.30 and fuel allowance of £8).  The introduction of the tapered qualified adult allowance will cost £9.7 million in a full year.  Any further enhancement of the arrangements governing the withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in that light and in the light of other priorities.</P>

This is a means-tested payment and the rate payable, if any, depends on the person's means from other sources.  She is currently receiving a pension at the rate of £58.50 per week, based on means of £20 per week derived mainly from her British retirement pension.  This assessment was made in April 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent review of her claim has indicated that her British pension had increased by £4.27 per week since the previous review.  As a result, the appropriate rate of pension in her case is £54.50 per week, a reduction of £4 per week on her current rate.  In addition, she receives a fuel allowance of £5 per week between mid-October and <Col N="1226" /> mid-April and she is entitled to free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>The person concerned has been advised of the position.  Her son is receiving a disability allowance at the maximum rate of £67.50.</P>
    <P>On this basis the household is receiving its full entitements under the schemes administered by my Department.</P>

      <P>Decisions in relation to the holding of recruitment competitions are a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners.  However, having made inquiries into this matter, I understand <Col N="1228" /> that the position is that it has been the practice of the commissioners to hold a fresh competition every two years.  The last competition for the filling of prison officer positions was advertised in April 1995 and the panel set up following this competition has been extended by one year to 1998 because Government restrictions on recruitment meant that no one from that competition had been appointed until recently.  It is intended to make appointments from this competition up until July, 1988.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons for the holding of a competition every two years:</P>
      <P>1.  In the case of any recruitment exercise a number of potential candidates will become eligible in the period between competitions.  Over a two year period this number can be considerable. The commissioners consider this among other issues in determining when a hold a fresh competition. Under normal circumstances they would consider two years to be an appropriate interval in the case of the position of prison officer.</P>
      <P>2.  The longer the time lapse between initial application and the concluding element of the selection process, the greater the number of candidates who will have found alternative employment, or may for other reasons opt out of the competition.  This leads to an increasing waste of resources because of diminishing returns in terms of interested candidates, e.g. of approximately 1,200 people called to sit the second stage of the process during the summer, only half attended. Of these, attendance rate at interview has been between 80 per cent and 90 per cent.  A further fall off manifests itself when some of those ultimately offered appointment decline it.</P>

      <P>The Bail Act, 1997, was passed into law by the Oireachtas in May of this year.  Section 13 of the Act provides that the Act is to come into operation by order to be made by the Minister.  The provisions of the Act have not been brought into force because existing prison accommodation would not be able to deal with the additional demand.  Obviously I want to avoid a situation where convicted persons would have to be released to make space for additional remand prisoners.  I will bring the provisions of the Act into force as quickly as possible.  I am keeping the matter under review in the context of the major prison building programme which I have under way at present which includes a new remand prison at Wheatfield.  The prisons accommodation <Col N="1229" /> situation is the only matter which has prevented the Act being brought into operation and no further legislation is required in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the allocation of Garda personnel to different areas.  They have informed me that the introduction of Operation Dóchas within the Ballyfermot area in October 1996 had implications <Col N="1230" /> for the duties of community gardaí at the time, and in fact altered the policing arrangements of Ballyfermot Garda station in relation to community policing and Operation Dóchas.</P>
      <P>In November 1996 I am informed that there were six gardaí and one sergeant attached to Ballyfermot Garda station involved in community policing.  In addition to their duties as community gardaí they also carried out duties under Operation Dóchas and to augment these new arrangements an extra sergeant had been appointed in October 1997.</P>
      <P>The current position, the Garda authorities inform me, is that there are a total of seven gardaí involved in community policing and operation Dóchas &mdash; three gardaí full-time in community policing with one vacancy for a community sergeant, and four gardaí and one sergeant full-time in Operation Dóchas.  Selection procedures are under way to fill the post of community sergeant. The net effect of these new arrangements is that a comparison with the same period last shows that there are now seven gardaí employed on flexi duties of community policing and Operation Dóchas, along with an extra sergeant on Operation Dóchas.  I am assured by the Garda authorities that the policing arrangements in Ballyfermot are under continual review and changes are made as necessary.</P>

      <P>Stage two of architectural planning (outline sketch scheme) for the second phase of Castleknock community college is currently being prepared by the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee's design team.  When this has been received in my Department, the project will be progressed further without delay.  It is not possible at this stage of planning to indicate when the project is likely to be ready for construction and completion.  However, every effort will be made to expedite architectural planning so that construction can begin as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>My Department's building unit has prepared sketch scheme drawings for the proposed new junior school at Cherry Orchard, Dublin 10. These drawings have been referred to the patron's local representative who has indicated that he is consulting widely in respect of the plans.  The patron's representative has recently confirmed that he will shortly furnish a submission to my Department suggesting a number of possible alterations to the plans.  As soon as my Department receives such a proposal the matter will be considered and the scheme may be altered as appropriate.  The patron's representative has also undertaken to consult openly with all interested parties in the locality in due course.</P>

      <P>There are substantial cost implications in relocating the proposed new vocational education committee school for Dungarvan from the present site at Ringasillogue.  In addition, the provision of the new school would be greatly delayed because of the necessity to accommodate the architectural plans to the new site.  My Department is at present awaiting notification from the planning authorities of a decision in relation to planning permission.  When this is available, the matter will be considered further.</P>
