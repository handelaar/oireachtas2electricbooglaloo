      <P>It is proposed to take: No. 1, Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1996 [Seanad], Second Stage (Resumed); No. 2, Children Bill, 1996, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; Private Members' Business shall be No. 10, Prisons Bill, 1997, Second Stage (Resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government decision to legislate against the possession of child pornography, but will the Taoiseach consider the wisdom of his proposals?  The Children Bill has more than 200 sections and will involve a long debate.  The Fianna Fáil Bill on child pornography, put forward by Deputies Eoin Ryan and John O'Donoghue, which the Government accepted at Second Stage, is now before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  This issue is urgent and we have already had a debate, but could the Fianna Fáil Bill be taken as a stand alone Bill and amended by the Government rather than awaiting the long debate on the Children Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Children Bill deals with all forms of exploitation of children, including &mdash; as a result of the amendments we will introduce &mdash; the sexual exploitation of children.  There is a very great degree of interdependence in terms of the enforcement arrangements that would apply in respect of sexual and other forms of abuse of children, and to have separate legislation dealing with one form of abuse that did not derive from and work in complete harmony with the enforcement arrangements for other forms of abuse would not be the most effective way to apply legislation.  The way the Government is proceeding is the best way.  I would ask for the co-operation of the Opposition in ensuring that the Children Bill, including the amendments which we will introduce to it, will pass through the various Stages in the House with speed.</P>

      <P>The issue of food legislation generally, and having complete procedure and enforcement arrangements, not just an auditing procedure, in respect of food safety to ensure that food is safe at every level of production and distribution and that those who buy Irish food in whatever form and in whatever part of the world can be offered an assurance of quality, is a very high priority for the Government.  Obviously, the food safety legislation the Government is preparing is a very important element, but it is just one element of that approach.  The Government is giving the highest priority to that matter at present.</P>

      <P>The Children Bill which is currently before the Dáil deals, for the most part, with offences committed by children as opposed to offences committed against children.  As the Taoiseach refused our party leader's request that he accept Fianna Fáil's Bill as a stand alone Bill, will he give the House an assurance that, true to form, the Fianna Fáil legislation will be plagiarised and copied, line by line, even down to the punctuation?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening before we adjourned I made the point that in places like Carlingford other aspects of the aquaculture industry have seen tremendous development in recent years.  Oyster cultivation and mussel farming are two areas in which significant progress has been made.  There has been significant investment in the oyster sector, in particular.  While there was an element of trial and error as far as many of the entrepreneurs who became involved in the sector were concerned, they eventually got the formula right and the sector is doing well at present.  It is our wish that that growth rate continue.</P>
      <P>As we could glean from the Minister of State's speech yesterday, fish have become an integral part of the consumer's diet and there is clearly a growing market which needs to be supplied from home.  Lobster development has also taken place along the Louth coast.  The sector is progressing with the development of new production techniques. We are talking about areas where the room for development was significant and where people saw opportunities and are proceeding to develop the various projects.</P>
      <P>Mussel cultivation is the longest established aquacultural activity in Carlingford where there is a significant number of jobs both in the primary sector and onshore.  Many of the producers who have been there for generations have small farms on the side of the Cooley Mountains where they run simultaneously small sheep herds but the mussel cultivation provided the principal portion of the family income.  In recent times the position of many of those producers has changed dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A licence covering some of the most productive areas in the lough was issued to an applicant from outside the area.  It is an understatement to say there is considerable tension locally as a result.  I ask the Minister to outline the implications of this legislation.  We are talking about people who effectively have been displaced from an area of activity where a family tradition is involved. While I realise the new licensing structure will bring a more ordered approach, inevitably the transition period will pose difficulties and problems. People who have been dependent &mdash; in some cases totally dependent &mdash; on mussel production in Carlingford Lough are effectively <Col N="1282" /> excluded from the industry.  I am not sure any licensing arrangement envisaged that happening. Given that the Minister has taken a keen interest in the development of the aquacultural industry he could bring a sense of fair play and justice to bear in the examination of such situations.  He might even consider the possibility of visiting Carlingford to meet the displaced producers at first hand with a view to producing a formula to overcome their problems.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the various points I wished to make in relation to this legislation as it affects my constituency.  I join with the other speakers in the House in welcoming the legislation.  Clearly the provisions of the Bill reflect the developments taking place around the coast.  I do not pretend that putting a new licence arrangement in place and dealing with people who have established production rights through the traditional method will be easy but there is a certain inevitability about it.  Again I ask the Minister to examine the position and the particular difficulties as they appertain in Carlingford Lough with the view to resolving the problem there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address a particular aspect of this Bill but before doing so I welcome the Bill.  There is a need for order in the development of our aquaculture which generally has brought great benefits but there are downsides and problems in relation to the siting of mussel farms.  These problems are accentuated where there is not local support for the venture.  From that point of view the approach adopted by the Minister is the right one and the result will be balanced development and the interests of the local community will be taken into account and judged alongside the interest of the developer.  It is even better if there is a coincidence of interest between the local community and the developer. Ideally the local community should be involved in these areas as part of the undertaking so that they have an ownership of the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to highlight a particular application since a major community voice has been raised in relation to it.  I am concerned that the application which was lodged prior to the Act should be covered by the Act.  I refer to an application to place long lines within an area of the foreshore at Dunnycove Bay by people who had and have no connection with that locality.  It is purely a commercial operation without any support whatever from the local community.  It is clear from my discussions with them that that application has no merit whatever from the point of view of being an addition to the local community.  On the contrary it has huge drawbacks.  There is a problem from the point of view of road access and safety since there is no proper road network to carry trucks or lorries dealing with mussels.  There would be major interference with the amenities of the area, the existing fishing activity, the sea and bird life.  Without going into detail on the Dunnycove application, it is entirely unsuitable. <Col N="1283" /> It has united the local community totally and unanimously against it.</P>
    <P>What will happen applications of that kind when the Act comes into force?  I am concerned that the protections under the Act should be available to deal with applications of that kind which so far have not been decided, that is where an application has been made and there are serious objections.  Will applications, such as those at Dunnycove and near Ardfield, Clonakilty, be dealt with under the protections of the new Bill or will some effort be made by the applicants to force the application through under the old procedure?  As I understand it, the old procedure involved an aquacultural licence vetting committee within the Department who obviously tried to do the best they could but did not have the same open transparent procedures as will be provided under the Bill.  I am concerned that the protections now being provided should be available to those who wish to object to existing applications. I am concerned to have reassurances on that issue and if it is not covered I would be keen to have amendments made to the Bill to deal with those points.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters that I will raise on Committee Stage.  I am concerned that there should be openness and transparency about operations under the Act.  It is important for interested parties to have an opportunity to make their case in regard to applications.  There must also be proper appeal procedures and, as in the case of the planning process, all reports must be available to the public. There must be as much openness and transparency as possible under the Bill, and I will follow the Committee Stage debate very closely to ensure this is achieved.</P>
    <P>My main concern relates to existing applications which have not been granted, as highlighted by the Dunnycove Bay case.  The voices of local communities must not be stifled and legitimate objections must not be overruled without first giving people an opportunity to express them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Whips for facilitating the speedy introduction of the Bill.  The only representations I received were from the aquaculture industry which referred to the need to have it passed as quickly as possible.  During the past decade the development of the industry in my constituency has been contentious.  We are very fortunate in County Mayo in having a large number of internationally known inland fisheries which have the potential to create great wealth for isolated rural communities provided they are further developed.  I will refer to this in greater detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of these competing but complementary industries in County Mayo has led to much stress and strain and I would like to think they could work together, coexist, be viable, prosper and contribute to the economies of isolated <Col N="1284" /> rural communities.  In order to achieve this they require a clean environment and must be in a position to promote themselves without the fear of damaging advertising or unfounded malicious allegations that one industry is damaging the other.  For far too long the Department of the Marine has been the poor cousin in terms of funding.  I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to secure the necessary resources to assist scientists in developing wildlife fisheries and aquaculture so that they can further contribute to the creation of badly needed jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack suggested indirectly yesterday that the legislation could lead to a dispute similar to the rod licence dispute.  I do not agree with him as there will be continuous monitoring of both industries.  Those involved in inland fisheries will probably continue to believe that the mariculture industry damages inland waters because of sea lice and wild trout.  However, I would like to think the Minister can play an active role in this area by furthering scientific information which will help develop the industry and ensure good practice is followed.  The conditions attached to licences must be rigidly enforced and a clear warning given that a breach of them will lead to the immediate revocation of the licence.</P>
    <P>Coastal communities endeavour to create jobs through the development of natural resources and the tourism industry.  The Minister may not be aware of an advertisement on the Internet which is used by millions of people throughout the world.  This advertisement by a group called Icarus which is supposed to come from County Mayo lambastes the environment of the county and states it does not believe the quality of water in a group scheme is satisfactory.  The advertisement adopts such a broad brush approach that potential tourists will think it refers to all aspects of the environment in County Mayo.  One can only imagine the impression it gives of the county.</P>
    <P>I hope angling and mariculture interests work together in further developing their industries and promoting the country in a positive way.  We have an international reputation for having excellent fishing waters and some of the campaigns pursued in recent years have led to a reduction in the number of tourists coming here.  As a result of self-generated bad publicity and campaigns pursued by competing interests the number of anglers visiting County Mayo has declined in recent years.  I am not sure these campaigns were valid.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the future of the industry.  The Government was very successful last year in attracting overseas companies to set up here.  However, we knew those jobs would be created following the measures taken by previous Governments to stabilise the economy.  It is important to point out that only 0.86 per cent of these jobs were located in Connacht and counties Donegal and Clare, which account for 20 per cent of the population.  This had led to a feeling of discrimination among the people in these areas. I <Col N="1285" /> am pleased that during the first week of January the Government and the IDA woke up and recognised the necessity of spreading jobs equitably throughout the country, particularly rural areas, if they were to prevent Dublin bursting at the seams and ensure young people had the option of staying in their local areas.  People in rural areas who have not been successful in securing new industries cherish their jobs and want to see them preserved, supported and expanded.</P>
    <P>I am horrified at the Minister's unilateral decision to implement one of the recommendations of the salmon task force report without listening to the views of Opposition Deputies.  We are public representatives, the legitimate democratic voice of the people who return us to this House, yet the Minister did not ask our opinions on any changes to the draft and drift net regime which has benefited approximately 800 coastal families.  Those part-time fishermen, invariably small farmers, who live a traditional way of life collecting seaweed in winter and salmon fishing during the salmon season, use that regime to supplement their incomes.</P>
    <P>The changes the Minister made may suit the absentee landlords and other vested interests resident here but he has totally ignored the legitimate concerns of many small fishermen who are not sophisticated lobbyists or members of any representative group.  However, when they organise themselves, the Minister will have to take notice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has substantially curtailed the potential of these fishermen to live a traditional way of life.  If the Minister believes the changes he has made may be beneficial to the overall industry, why has he not offered compensation to these fishermen?  He has not put anything on the table and it appears to be the thin end of the wedge to follow what has happened in other countries, namely, the abolition of a traditional way of life without anything in exchange from government.</P>
    <P>On the question of the curtailment of the 12 mile limit to six miles &mdash; I appreciate the Minister will refer to base lines &mdash; I am reliably informed that in the Achill area in particular this may affect the safety of fishermen who will now be required to operate in curtailed hours.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a letter I received from the West Mayo Fishermen's Development Co-Operative Society which has welcomed the salmon task force report and many of its recommendations, particularly in regard to the overall management of the salmon stock.  However, the society strongly disagrees with two of the recommendations, one of which is the proposed reduction of the 12 mile limit to six miles.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>Since drift net fishing became established in the early seventies, the sea area between 7 and 12 miles offshore produces over 70% of our catch in the Bangor District of North Western Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> The reasons the Task Force gives for closing this area are capture of foreign salmon and capture of fish going to rivers further South in this country.</P>
    <P>Since the early eighties the West Mayo Fishermen's Development Co-operative Society has taken part in decoding salmon tags under the control of the Department of the Marine during the salmon seasons.  Thousands of salmon are examined each season.  Returns from these reports show that as high as 90% of fish captured are from rivers in our own district mainly Burrishoole, Bunowen and Bundorragha with very little catch from the Moy or Corrib.  The catch of tagged fish from foreign rivers has varied from 1-9 fish for a season. Tagged fish account for between 5% &mdash; 11% of overall catch.</P>
    <P>The reasons the Task Force give for closure do not hold up.  To deny us access to the 12 mile limit would be the same as telling anglers they could not fish on the Moy river and the consequences for tourism.</P>
    <P>Inside the six mile limit the currents are much stronger and the sea much rougher, this combined with the onshore prevalent South West wind and closer proximity to shore will make gear more difficult to fish and fishing more dangerous.</P>
    <P>The area between Achill Head and the Stages of Broadhaven would be a no go area for drift netting owing to the number of crab pots and static gear set there.</P>
    <P>The people advising the Minister do not accept the figures I put forward.  I accept that the people in the West Mayo Fishermen's Development Co-Operative Society and many others produce accurate records.  People who suggest that records of the number of tags examined are being suppressed and that a false picture is being given are trying to ensure that the voices of those involved in drift net fishing will not be heard.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the curtailment of the 12 mile limit to six miles in my area. Local fishermen say their lives are being put in danger and I will not tolerate that.  I will hold the Minister personally responsible if any boats get into difficulty in the forthcoming season.  As I said, these fishermen are not an organised group such as the aquaculture group which has joined the IFA and which the Minister meets on a weekly basis.  I wish they were more co-ordinated in their approach to fighting recommendations which may affect their industry.</P>
    <P>In the further development of the aquaculture industry the Minister has received many requests both from native fishermen and people involved in the industry to curtail the number of seals along our coastline.  I appreciate there is a growing consciousness of our environment and I am to the forefront regarding environmental concerns in my constituency.  As a member of Fianna Fáil I do not believe others such as the Green movement have a monopoly on protecting the <Col N="1287" /> environment.  One must always take a balanced approach in matters concerning the environment.</P>
    <P>A balanced approach must be taken to ensure a selective seal cull.  Seals are causing substantial economic damage to salmon fishermen, whose incomes are uncertain, and others involved in the aquaculture industry who have a high risk element in their work.  I appreciate many young people regard seals as small, cuddly mammals which should be allowed to flourish as part of nature, but some seals can weigh up to 20 stone and are capable of doing untold damage to salmon cages in one night.</P>
    <P>The people calling for a selective seal cull are responsible and reasonable.  They are not advocating the widespread destruction of seals but want a sustainable population consistent with fishing and aquaculture interests.  The Minister has put off making a decision on a cull because he does not want to be accused of lacking compassion, but he should not fear a reasonable approach.  A decision should be made on this matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to regulate the aquaculture industry.  This important industry has potential but, for various reasons, it has stagnated over recent years.  The aquaculture industry plays a major role in Mayo and Galway.  Its potential has not been tapped.  Additional jobs can be created onshore as well as offshore.  The manufacturing of meal sustains a number of jobs in Westport. Trou Ireland buys the raw material in Killybegs, manufactures it into pellets and distributes it to many fish farms around the country.  The industry is expanding and will create more jobs and wealth in remote communities in the west. While the suggested 3,600 jobs in the industry by the year 2000 may be somewhat optimistic, it should be supported.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries have suffered greatly from sea trout fishing in recent years, a matter to which few speakers referred.  I have received a large amount of literature from both competing groups advocating the wisdom of their scientific research. As I am not in a position to distinguish between fact and fiction, I am guided by the Minister and his officials who advised him on the best form of legislation to introduce to assist the long-term prospects of the aquaculture industry while not causing damage to a native resource such as inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed many of the concerns in this legislation, but I urge him to continue to heed the concerns being expressed so that they can be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Minister that large press advertisements are over the top, I hope he addresses the valid concerns of the aquaculture industry.  Hysteria should not be allowed play a part in such concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> Members of the Green Party on the west coast have a particular interest in the Bill.  Section 15 of the 1959 Act has not been changed.  The Minister spoke about his responsible role in granting aquaculture licences.  This conflicts with the judgment in the Mulcahy <i>v</i>.  Minister for the Marine case in November 1994 which held that the Minister should not be given such power and that the manner in which licences are granted should be carefully reviewed.  Licences are open to abuse.  I have been informed that Fanad Fisheries should be closely monitored in this regard.  As it is only natural that licences will be used to the maximum extent possible, strict controls should apply when granting them so that aquaculture activities do not adversely affect the wider environment.</P>
    <P>The proposals for an appeals procedure is a definite improvement.  However, attention should also focus on the granting of licences in this area because, as Deputy Molloy stated yesterday, it seems to favour the interests of the aquaculture industry.  In supporting that industry, it is crucial that tourism, angling and wider environmental concerns are also taken into account.</P>
    <P>Sea trout anglers believe their concerns are not being met.  As the Minister appeared to support the conclusions of the report of the Sea Trout Working Group, they believed their concerns would be addressed.  I hope consultation will take place following this debate and that the necessary changes are made on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The use of chemicals, particularly nuvan, in the aquaculture industry has been a matter of concern for people in the Green movement for some time.  I am pleased the Bill provides for a reduction in the use of that and other highly toxic chemicals in aquaculture.  However, while we want to reduce the use of chemicals in the industry, the growth of the industry will probably result in their increased use.  The use of chemicals in aquaculture has been declared a matter for the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The Environmental Protection Agency should be given a more official statutory role in this area because of the impact of such chemicals on the environment. As chemicals dilute in water there will be a temptation to use them.  They should be strictly controlled because they pollute the natural environment.  I do not want to say much more. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta Ó Cuív ag fanacht chun teacht isteach.  Ag an am gcéanna, is gá éisteacht leis na daoine atá ag plé le cursaí iascaireachta i gcoitinne.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister will be concerned about the reports from Sellafield on the east coast. Whereas that is something we hope is a minimal problem it clarifies for us that, when we talk about Sellafield, we are not simply talking about dangers to the human health and well-being of this population but the economic fabric of the country which is closely tied to our success in fighting the nuclear industry in Britain.  One hopes there will not be an accident or serious incident. I hope that the evidence which exists to date and the real risk in the future will ensure the <Col N="1289" /> Government puts the issue of Sellafield at the level of political activity which knows no higher level.  To that extent, I hope that the Anglo-Irish conference and other international opportunities, legal or diplomatic, are used to the fullest extent. This Bill brings home to us that we have a heritage which can all too easily be lost and, with it, the potential for keeping people in rural areas and maintaining the fabric of rural communities.</P>

Mar sin, an chéad rud a d'iarrfainn ar an Aire ná a bheith foighdeach, éisteacht go cúramach agus, má tá gá le leasuithe ar an mBille seo, go mba cheart dó a bheith oscailte do leasuithe.  Déarfainn freisin leis an dream atá ag plé le feirmeoracht éisc, go mbfearr go mbéadh córas an-oscailte ann mar, ag deireadh an lae nuair a cheadófar ceadúnais, ba dheas an rud é a cheapadh go nglacfaidh chuile dhuine leis an gcinneadh agus go mórmhór go nglacfaidh na pobail sna háiteanna ina bhfuil na feirmeacha éisc suite le cinneadh cibé córas a bheidh ann.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in principle.  The system of licensing of aquaculture projects has been most unsatisfactory in the past.  It has been characterised by unspecified periods of delay, sudden decisions, a total lack of transparency and a feeling by people that objections might or might not be considered seriously.  I accept that objections lodged were fully and totally considered but there was no system in place to reassure the public that this was so and we know how destructive suspicion and mistrust can be in situations like this.</P>
      <P>I live in Connemara, in which there are two clear schools of thought about fin fish farming.  I accept that this Bill covers all aquaculture development.  There are two schools of thought, especially relating to fin fish farming, and, furthermore, within Connemara, there are two distinct areas.  One strongly favours fin fish farming and stretches mainly from Bertraghboy Bay along to Leitir Mór, Leitir Mealláin and Ceathrú Rua. The other area in north-west Connemara has huge community resistance to fin fish farming.  It is extraordinary that, within a short space of coastline, two totally opposing views would be held by communities.  It is important to recognise the rights of the communities to hold views and that must be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was involved in significant industrial development in the timber industry within the area in <Col N="1290" /> which I live.  One point I have always made is that it would not have been possible in the long term to sustain what has since become a huge development without the goodwill of the local community. Therefore, local community views must be taken into account when decisions are being made on aquaculture licences.  I know there are provisions here for the Minister to give general directives and make regulations but, before this Bill is passed, the type of directions which will be involved must be clarified.  A Bill which does not provide for general community acceptance in some form or another will be totally flawed.  We will return to the same point which has existed all the time, that there is a fear that big corporations can get licences against the wishes of the locals who will have no say in the development.  This would not suit fish farmers who are serious about their business and local commitment and it would be another way of telling local people that their views do not count.  In passing this Bill, this aspect must be tackled in a much more specific way.  A Bill which does not recognise this reality would be totally flawed.</P>
    <P>The second major point is that it must be clarified if there are general areas which are off-limits. I would like the Minister to clarify whether he accepts that, for example, Lough Mask, Lough Corrib and their water system are off-limits for the development of aquaculture.  That is a major issue in the area in which I live.  The people there would argue succinctly and with great validity that the greatest potential of the lakes and all rivers feeding into them lies in ensuring that there would be no aquaculture development of a commercial nature on the lakes or their systems. Maybe this is covered in regulations here and there, but we must be reassured that there can be no question about certain fundamental things.  I understand that one of my colleagues will make specific proposals about it, but this reassurance is needed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I was slightly disappointed as a TD representing Galway West to find that huge advertisements were taken out in the newspapers last Thursday and that no one had bothered to contact me regarding whatever worries and fears there are about this.  The only written communication I received from local lobby groups against aquaculture was a letter in the post which arrived in my Dáil office on which there was no telephone number and only a PO box number to which to reply.  This is a pity because, although I was not an elected representative at the time of the rod licence dispute, I live in the lake area in Connemara and know the trauma, suffering and difficulties caused by that dispute.  Whatever the merits of the arguments made, the one thing needed at this stage is dialogue.  I am slightly disappointed at the method adopted by the lobby groups because it is not conducive to real dialogue. I would like to see the people who have difficulties and who are seriously concerned sitting down, studying the Bill, formulating their <Col N="1291" /> own detailed proposals, discussing them and making suggestions.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the method adopted in this instance as it is not conducive to real dialogue. Deputies receive representations on all legislation that comes before the House.  People who are seriously concerned about a proposal will study it and approach their public representatives with detailed proposals and suggestions.  I hope the groups which published these advertisements will contact us and furnish us with their names, addresses and telephone numbers to enable us to contact them.  They should be willing to meet the Minister of State and his officials and the local representatives of the areas affected to discuss their worries so we can represent them and their views.  We will discuss with them how this Bill might allay their fears.</P>
    <P>Their worries cannot be dismissed even if their method of publicising them might not be the most conducive means to proper dialogue.  One fishing club approached me in the past week to bring its concerns to my notice.  I will read its submission carefully and voice those concerns on Committee Stage.  I have tried to make contact with the groups which published the advertisement and I hope we will be able to discuss the issues they have raised.  Their points are valid.</P>
    <P>The press release of the Minister of State is reassuring but he should consider a number of points.  There is a non-aquaculture and non-technical but equally relevant community support issue, without which no local industry can survive. It is peculiar that this Bill provides that a decision of the Minister can be overturned by an appeals board.  I would prefer if an independent board would conduct the first analysis, after which the Minister, if there was overriding local opposition to a proposal, could take such opposition on board.  It is a political decision and the Minister could decide, if he is satisfied that there is overriding local opposition, not to grant an aquaculture licence.  There is a genuine fear that local views which are not expressed in technical language cannot be taken into consideration.  That could lead to conflict and difficulty and do more damage to the fin fish farming industry than anything else.  This issue should be debated and examined in an open manner.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is involved.  There is a very good system in local authorities at present whereby a member of the public has the statutory right to see a planning file.  After a decision is made a person can look not only at the decision but also at the internal notes that were made with regard to the decision.  One can follow the thought processes of the officials who handled the file and see the basis on which a decision was made.  Up to now that was not the case in the aquaculture sector.  Even if a decision was valid and correct there was no means by which people could follow the system of thought prior to the decision being made and decide, regardless of <Col N="1292" /> whether they agree with the decision, that it was made through a valid and systematic process.</P>
    <P>In the aquaculture licensing and appeals system it will be most important that the documentation on which the decision was made and the reasons for the decision will be made available to those who have an interest in it.  That would generate great confidence in the system.  We all are afraid of situations where every side is listened to, but where minds are made up before their cases are heard.  That is a great fear in the community and it is something we must tackle.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that trial licences should be granted without a system of appeal.  A huge change has been made with the imposition of time limits on making decisions about the granting of aquaculture licences.  I welcome that change as it suited neither the applicant nor the objector that this process could continue <i>ad nauseam</i>. However, an appeal cannot be made against a trial licence because of the extra time involved, but the extra time involved would be more than justified in view of the public confidence it would create in the transparency and openness of the system.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to provide for granting licences <i>in perpetuo</i>.  There is also reference to a time period of not longer than 20 years.  Nothing should be granted <i>in perpetuo</i>.  I cannot see why provision cannot be included for seeking renewal of licences, particularly in the case of fin fish farming where technology could change dramatically.  There should be a renewal provision and, if necessary, a stipulation included that the licence will be regranted unless the grounds on which the original decision was made in terms of technology and so forth changed or new information came to hand about the dangers of the technology or the operation.  There must be regular review periods for fin fish farming.</P>
    <P>Other types of aquaculture are growing in importance in the west.  There is a thriving shellfish farming industry in my constituency and I hope it will grow rapidly in future.  Shellfish farming has the great advantage of not being dependent on chemicals or feedstuffs and the dangers they create.  I hope there will be greater emphasis on the potential of that industry.  Killary Harbour is a massive resource in my constituency but, because of licensing difficulties, the restrictions that have been imposed and difficulties in arriving at a proper development plan with the local co-operative, the mussel farming industry has not developed to its full potential.  The possibility of developing that industry and investing resources in it should be examined further.  I hope we will see a new phase of development throughout the range of activities in aquaculture.</P>
    <P>This Bill was published last November so any charge that it is being rushed through the Oireachtas is untrue.  However, I was concerned last week when people claimed it was hidden from view.  Long before the Bill was published, the Minister of State outlined its main provisions in a press release and I give him full credit for his <Col N="1293" /> action.  I and most people were aware that aquaculture legislation had been considered for some time.  Nevertheless, it appears that some people did not become aware of the legislation until recently and they fear, rightly or wrongly, that it will be rushed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Time is on our side.  We have waited a long time for this Bill and, while I do not believe in unnecessary delay, those who have voiced reservations about the legislation, including those involved in the aquaculture sector, should be contacted and asked to make submissions.  They should be shown an open door policy and it should be made clear that anything they wish to say that is reasonable and sustainable will be considered seriously.  In this way, we will have a Bill that provides for balance between competing interests in aquaculture.  I hope that when the Bill is passed it will receive broad support from all people interested in fishing and from the communities in which the industry is based.  If, as a result of further consultation, it takes an extra three or four weeks to get the Bill through, it will be time well spent.  It would be better to spend an extra few weeks working on it now than to have a Bill that causes controversy, doubt, concern and acrimony and that does not solve the problems which this Bill sets out to solve.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this most important Bill.  Much of Ireland is heavily reliant on three industries, agriculture, tourism and fisheries.  The agriculture sector is experiencing severe hardship as a result of the crisis in that industry, but today we are talking primarily about the fishing industry which also has an impact on tourism.  In the fishing industry there is a great variety of skilled labour, production and so on.  Such a primary resource, however, be it sea or fresh water fish, cannot exist to its optimum potential without regulation and legislation.  That is borne out in areas such as the Foyle where people are striving to maintain flat oyster stocks without the support of legislation. In those circumstances the sustainable nature of the product is not guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Everybody in the industry favours conservation, protection mechanisms and pollution awareness, which are essential to the future of our fisheries.  With the enactment of legislation that embraces the basic principles, we look forward to a successful future.  Proper regulation of licensing and environmental protection mechanisms are necessary not only to maintain the resource but the hundreds of thousands of jobs created directly and indirectly in the industry.</P>
      <P>In my constituency there is a variety of fishing, with fish farms in Fanad and anglers working primarily from rivers such as the Crana.  In his response last night the Minister said that one of his primary concerns in the drafting of the Bill was to strike the necessary balance between essential developmental needs of the aquaculture industry and acknowledgement of the concerns of other parties.  It is essential to get that balance right to ensure the development of aquaculture is planned and regulated in a sustainable way.  I welcome the Minister's comments in that regard.</P>
      <P>A substantial part of my constituency is not covered by the Bill.  The Foyle area awaits similar legislation, but that is an issue for another time. Many jobs have been created &mdash; 3,000 in 1995 &mdash; through investment in the industry.  There have been difficulties with escapement and the use of chemicals, matters which primarily affect people involved in wild salmon fishing, and the restrictions on licensing will result in improvements in that regard as well as in the whole area of fishery management.  Investment in research is necessary to ensure an environmentally friendly approach is adopted in the interests of our eco-system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a strong angling club in my area and its commitment to the development of rivers and protection of stock is second to none.  Recent <Col N="1295" /> developments of onshore facilities have improved recreational and working conditions.</P>
    <P>It is important that wild salmon and other species are protected under the Bill, as anglers have striven to do up to now despite the lack of legislative support.  All aspects of fishing are of tremendous importance to rural coastal areas such as mine.  Each has potential for job creation, recreational enjoyment, attracting visitors and producing a product that can be sold worldwide. Conservation and protection of all species is important and legislation must treat all forms of fishing with an equal degree of rigour in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>Much concern has been voiced about the Bill by anglers.  Like many other Deputies, I have been approached by anglers concerned about the issue of a trial licence without recourse to appeal. Such a practice poses a huge threat to traditional recreational and amenity areas as well as to rivers. There are difficulties with the 20 year licence and area designation is being replaced by a system where anything goes.  At a time when local planning is becoming more centred on the designation of areas as high or low amenity areas, one wonders whether these classifications would be of assistance to the applicant and enforcer alike.</P>
    <P>While the Minister dealt with some of these matters in his opening speech, I trust he will consider the issues of concern I raised and give further clarification on them at the close of the debate.  Does the Minister envisage legislation on the recreational use of rivers and seas, specifically in regard to safety, and would such legislation duplicate any of the provisions in this Bill?  There is much more use made of our rivers and recreational activities on rivers have increased substantially.  With more people, more demand and different equipment on the rivers, we need an awareness of safety.  We should encourage such activities within our remit. We also must look to safe access for all.  Can the aspect of safety on rivers be considered in this legislation?  Perhaps the Minister can inform me of the feasibility of incorporating some reference to the safety aspect on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  It is important for the true development of our resources.  The Bill should be sensitive to all aspects of fishing, to other river users and to our environment. Research should continue to maximise the eco-friendly aspect of development on rivers.  Those creating jobs should get sufficient support to help them in this research and their further development. All those with concerns should have them addressed.  Through doing this, the Minister will move towards a unity which is the best way to make a Bill truly effective.</P>
    <P>If the issues of concern are dealt with, before the Bill is finalised, we will have a Bill which will work.  This will not happen if we ignore the concerns of the people or do not fully explain that the Bill is not what they think it is, as the Minister stated last night.  The Minister said the aquaculture <Col N="1296" /> industry has been poorly served by out of date legislation and a licensing programme which has failed to deliver decisions in a reasonable timeframe.  I welcome the Bill but ask that the concerns raised are addressed and that the Minister thinks about safety on rivers.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss this legislation because we all agree it is difficult to develop an industry properly and have proper regulations without a statutory instrument and legislation.  One of the biggest problems with fisheries is that there are so many sectoral interests which do not seem to listen to each other or want to agree or compromise.  We all know that our waters belong to the nation and are for the good of the nation.  We should always be aware of that.</P>
      <P>I have experience of many types of fishery development; angling, drift and draft-net fishing and fish farming.  There are four fish farms in my village of Inver.  Compromise, working together and a proper local management structure has meant that people have been able to live amicably in recent years.</P>
      <P>Local management structures are most important for the development of aquaculture.  In my village there would not be as many people in full-time employment if we did not have fish farms in Inver and Killybegs.  It is unfortunate that the more traditional types of fisheries are no longer viable.  As a consequence, I was glad to see that many local people who were formerly part-time fishermen and farmers were able to get fulltime employment with fish farms in my village. We have spent an astronomical amount of money on the promotion of angling and angling tourism. The North Western Fisheries Board has spent a considerable sum on the promotion of the Eany, the provision of new stock and proper facilities for fishermen.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is acutely aware, there were hiccups in the development of spats and some of the larger fisheries.  There is conflict between the promotion of angling tourism, the traditional drift and draft net fisheries and aquaculture.  It is important, therefore, that there is a proper structure to allow the development of a sea or estuary fishery to be looked at by everyone.  I hope such a structure can be provided for in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the licensing appeals board as it will allow for greater transparency in granting licences.  I am glad that those with a grievance will be able to avail of an appeals <Col N="1297" /> procedure similar to that provided for in the planning Acts.</P>
    <P>On membership of the board, the Minister proposes to appoint a chairperson and others with a specific interest in various sectors of the industry. It may be more prudent, however, to allow various organisations to elect nominees who could then be appointed to the board.  As a consequence, they would have greater standing in processing appeals.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides the board in hearing appeals with the power to extend the time limits.  As the Minister is aware, during the years there have been many complaints about the length of time it takes An Bord Pleanála to make decisions.  It would be prudent to emphasise the need to make decisions as quickly as possible, recognising that oral hearings result in delays.  On Committee Stage the Minister should lay down stringent guidelines as investors cannot afford to wait six months to a year for a decision while those who object to the provision of an aquaculture licence need to know that their views will be taken into consideration and that a decision will be made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>My eminent colleague from the west, Deputy Molloy, does not agree but there has been much misinformation about the legislation.  The Minister should clearly outline its objectives.  The only representations I received in my constituency were from those involved in the aquaculture sector who are anxious to ensure that the Bill is enacted.  If angling associations are concerned about a particular matter, they always go to their local Deputy.  Having said that, I received representations today from one or two national organisations.  All organisations should have an opportunity to obtain answers and to have their concerns allayed.</P>
    <P>Polarisation is not the way forward.  There is a need to create employment in isolated areas.  My colleagues from the west mentioned that males in particular find it difficult to secure full-time employment in the north west, they are dependent on the fishing, farming and tourism sectors for part-time employment.  There is, therefore, a need for compromise.  We have to marry economic development with environmental concerns. I am concerned that this polarisation does not hinder development of the industry.</P>
    <P>The fin fish sector has been mentioned.  Insufficient research has been carried out into new species, fish diseases and alternative methods of fish farming, while insufficient attention has been paid to aquaculture, in particular shellfish, which has proved very popular.</P>
    <P>On fish promotion, there has been a decrease in the price of salmon in particular.  While this is good for the consumer, I hope the Minister will address the issue of dumping large quantities of fish on the market by non-EU member states, particularly the Norwegians, which causes huge problems for those involved in the industry here. There is a need for regulation.  Local management <Col N="1298" /> structures are the best way forward in the development of the industry.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and on answering the queries of those concerned about it in Athlone this week. Advertisements were placed in local newspapers last weekend spelling out the reasons it should not pass through the Dáil.  The Minister is prepared to make any changes necessary on Committee Stage to allay the concerns of the sectional interests involved.</P>
      <P>There is room for the angling organisations and those involved in the aquaculture sector to work together.  Trou Ireland, based in my home town of Westport, has a large staff.  In addition, there are many fish farms in the Achill-Clare Island area which provide full-time employment in a region of high unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have not come into the Chamber.  They, as well as Members on the Government side, have an obligation to ensure there is a quorum.  It should not be necessary to call a quorum every few minutes.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on bringing this Bill before the Dáil.  It is important that the two groups work together.  The Minister of State is trying to achieve that by ensuring all sectors are represented.  In the past he has met representatives of interested organisations to ascertain the problems they encounter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government and EU funds allocated to fisheries boards in the west.  The work carried out on our lakes and rivers is excellent. For many years I attended public meetings throughout County Mayo at which the main complaint was that the Government was not serious about the angling or other sectors and did not provide funding.  Such groups do not say that any more.  Funding has poured into the Western Fisheries Board for many years now and I compliment the Minister of State on the fact that we have beautiful lakes where people can fish such as those in Kilmeena, Aghagower and other places in the west.</P>
      <P>There is much concern about fish farms.  I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  The Minister of State is prepared to reconsider it on Committee Stage in light of concerns that may be expressed by the angling sector.  Those sectors are creating employment in a disadvantaged area in the west where previous Governments failed to provide employment.  Those working in fish farms are committed to them and to protecting the environment.  They do not want to destroy the angling industry but to co-operate with it.  That is what the Minister is trying to achieve and I welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased this Bill is before the Dáil and it can be considered in detail on Committee Stage. <Col N="1299" /> The draft and drift net fishermen are somewhat annoyed that their fishing season has been reduced.  Will the Minister reconsider that decision on Committee Stage and extend their fishing season, which is very short, by a week? The Minister of State has met representatives of many of the organisations concerned.  Some small farmers in the west engage in fishing to supplement their income.  The Minister of State wants to protect the fish stocks.  I ask him to meet the representatives of the organisations concerned again and to reach agreement on extending the fishing season by a week.  There is some conflict between the draft and drift net fishermen about the times they fish and the Minister of State had consultations with them.  He will have further consultations with them and I hope agreement will be reached.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting 17 years for this Bill.  I will consider its provisions in detail on Committee Stage.  I will meet representatives of some of the organisations concerned over the weekend who wish to put forward suggestions.  There is no need for conflict.  The Minister of State is trying to get agreement from the interested parties.  The fish farming and angling industries have a contribution to make to the economy in terms of employment.  They are valuable industries and should be able to work together.  There is no reason the industries cannot be regulated to ensure their needs are catered for.  We support the two industries.  There is no need for scare-mongering. This is a democratic State.  Representatives of the two industries are prepared to meet, discuss and iron out any problems.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on the amount of money given to the west in past two and a half a years.  The angling and aquaculture industries appreciate it.  I wish the Minister of State well with this Bill.  I will monitor its progress and I know he will introduce the necessary amendments on Committee Stage.  I will meet certain organisations over the weekend and take their criticisms on board.  It is important that everyone works together as this industry is important for tourism and employment.</P>
    <P>Trou Ireland is a major company in Westport which depends on fish farming and employs many people.  It provides good, steady full-time jobs.  In terms of angling, it attracts many people to the county who spend a great deal of money.  The Minister of State has created the right balance in this Bill and any major difficulties can be examined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been criticism of the Opposition for calling quorums.  As Deputy Ring said, this is important legislation, yet only two Government spokespeople have contributed to the debate.  It is the duty of the Government to debate this Bill.  I have been calling for this legislation for some months and I give credit to the Minister of State for introducing it.  We have to tease this Bill out and, unfortunately, the Minister <Col N="1300" /> of State encountered a problem in the past few days.  The publicity given to this Bill recently has been unfair, particularly untruths which have been published.  In his speech, the Minister of State gave guarantees that freshwater areas will be protected and that it will require the authority of the Minister and the Department to do that. The Government has been lacking because, come the general election, this legislation may turn out to be very important in certain areas of the country. Many Government Deputies have paid little or no attention to it.</P>
      <P>If we want to be regarded as a maritime country we should pay more attention to the Department of the Marine.  It has been shabbily treated down through the years by successive Governments with regard to its budget allocation.  At a time when there are problems in agriculture and other industries in rural Ireland we should turn more to the marine industry as it is a natural resource.  It receives possibly the lowest budget allocation.  A huge untapped potential exists in this industry.  Future Governments will have to pay more attention to it if we are to be regarded as a maritime nation.</P>
      <P>This potential is extremely important for rural areas, particularly in Donegal where unemployment is such a problem.  Fanad Fisheries, now known as Hydro Seafoods, started off in the Fanad peninsula and provides massive employment in an area which would be devastated otherwise. People stay in the peninsula as a result of the aquaculture industry.  I support aquaculture.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State consider setting up a Lough Swilly port authority to monitor activity there?  It is a huge lake which has been totally neglected environmentally, as other Deputies said.  Large, foreign vessels are able to travel up Lough Swilly as far as Inch Island and Rathmullan where they discharge offal etc.  Fianna Fáil may put down an amendment on this on Committee Stage to see whether it is possible to incorporate it in this Bill.  The issue has been pressed at meetings of Donegal County Council by my colleague, Hugh Conaghan.  Donegal County Council, through its engineers, has been in touch with the Department of the Marine.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on this.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill, especially the section on the reduction of smoults.  Also, the implementation of the sea trout task force is vitally important.  It is complicated legislation but not as complicated as indicated by the publicity it has received over the past few days.  It is vital for the industry that this legislation is passed quickly because it has seasonal connotations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Members who contributed to this debate and, in particular, for their suggestions as <Col N="1301" /> to how the Bill can be improved.  I have made it clear to all interested parties that I welcome observations on the Bill and that I introduced it in a spirit of openness and readiness to listen to worthwhile suggestions for its improvement.  The most appropriate place to examine the detailed provisions of the Bill is on Committee Stage and I look forward to doing so.  The acquaculture industry and those communities that are home to the industry deserve the best possible Bill that the combined wisdom of this House and the Seanad can deliver.  I am glad there is a broad welcome from all sides of the House for the development of acquaculture which, as has been proved, has the capacity to deliver jobs in our coastal communities. The Bill is ultimately designed to underpin these jobs and provide a platform for the further environmentally sustainable development of the industry.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised by Deputies to which I wish to reply.  Deputy Smith, in a very thoughtful speech, raised the question of the delay in publishing the Bill.  Although the Bill has been in gestation for some time, the critical importance of consultation in getting it right was a primary concern.  Neither is the Bill exclusively modelled on planning law.  For example, Part II is specific to acquaculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith asked about licence applications outstanding, and the figure of 800 that he quoted is substantially correct.  However, experience has shown that many applications are not ultimately pursued by applicants.  Great care is taken by the Department to ensure that licence applications are dealt with as expeditiously as possible, having regard to third party rights which, as many Deputies highlighted, are of vital importance. The Bill provides a statutory target of four months for determination of licence applications in an effort to bring more certainty to the licensing process.  The outstanding applications include both fin fish and shelfish, the preponderance of applications being for shellfish.</P>
    <P>I also assure Deputy Smith that Bord Iascaigh Mara and the Marine Institute are very much involved in research and development for the acquaculture industry.  Other statutory bodies, such as the regional fishery boards and local authorities, are consulted on every single licence application before decisions are made, and this will remain the case following the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith also raised the important question of added value.  The fish processing industry, in tandem with acquaculture, is supported by the operational programme on fisheries.  About 30 per cent of fish processed in our fish processing plants comes from acquaculture production, so we are mindful of the interdependency between fish farmers and processors.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, particularly Deputies Molloy and McCormack, raised the ghost of the rod licence dispute.  This Bill has nothing to do with rod licences, the ownership of lakes or anything of that sort.  I am aware of the concerns <Col N="1302" /> expressed by angling groups in recent newspaper advertisements which, as Deputy Sargent acknowledged, go somewhat over the top.  I took the opportunity of addressing these issues at the annual general meeting of the Trout Anglers' Federation of Ireland in Athlone on Sunday last. I also addressed these concerns in my introductory speech on the Bill to the House yesterday.</P>
    <P>This Bill greatly enhances the rights of existing users of our water resources to have a say and to have their views taken into account before licensing decisions are made.  The licensing Authority is specifically required by section 61 of the Bill to have regard to these matters.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling what this Bill specifically provides for.  It provides, first, that one cannot engage in aquaculture without a licence.  Second, if one does engage in aquaculture without a licence one will be prohibited from applying for a licence.  Third, it provides, for the first time, for an appeals mechanism against licensing decisions. It is worth recalling that in addition to the aquaculture licence that is provided for in this legislation, it will also be necessary to obtain a foreshore licence in the case of aquaculture at sea and to obtain planning permission for any land based aquaculture activity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the sea trout issue, a matter which is of very considerable concern to me, as I have specific responsibility for inland fisheries as well as for aquaculture.  The combined efforts of State agencies and private groups, particularly through the Whitaker Task Force on Sea Trout, the Scientific Working Group on Sea Trout and the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group, have led to the significant recovery of stocks of sea trout in many of our rivers and lakes.  Fisheries such as Waterville in County Kerry and Casla and Ballinahinch in County Galway, now have good returns of these sporting fish. I accept that there is no room for complacency and that considerably more work must be done to ensure that our sea stocks are fully rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised several other issues of details with which I wish to deal generally and which I will be happy to address more specifically on Committee Stage.  The trial licence provisions in this Bill tighten up the existing temporary permit regime which is already provided under the Fisheries Act.  This is not, therefore, a new proposal, but it circumscribes the use of trial permissions while recognising the role of trials for fallowing and for testing new sites.  There is some misunderstanding about the purpose of the trial licence provision.  There is already provision in existing fisheries legislation for granting licences for trials but, unfortunately, in some cases, the permit for the trial tends to extend for much longer than anybody intended.  This Bill circumscribes the trial permit, puts a time limit on it, makes it clear that it is not renewable, and that if somebody carries out a trial on a particular site, it is found suitable for aquaculture purposes and they want to engage in aquaculture on that site, <Col N="1303" /> they will have to apply for a licence in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Attention has been drawn to aquaculture licences of 20 years' duration.  The industry has been drawing to our attention the need to have security of tenure in regard to licences.  I have listened to the concerns expressed about the perpetuity provision in the Bill.  Again, it is worth recalling that the existing legislation provides for licences to be issued in perpetuity.  This is an issue that I am quite happy to consider and examine on Committee Stage, and I will certainly bear in mind the observations of Deputies McCormack and Molloy in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also spoke about the appointment of the appeals board.  The proposed composition of the appeals board is even-handed and fair and is neither prejudicial against nor baised in favour of any interest.  However, this is an issue, among others, that I am prepared to examine on Committee Stage and I will consider suggestions from Members about how it might be improved.</P>
    <P>The question of existing licences has been raised.  There is a need to ensure that existing licences are brought fully within the regulatory framework of this Bill.  If existing licences were not addressed in this way, Deputies might well have good grounds for complaint that a two-tier system was being introduced with lower standards required of existing licensees.  That would clearly be undesirable.  Existing licences are, therefore, being brought within the terms of this Bill so that the enhanced controls which this Bill provides for can apply to existing licences as well as to new licences.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy rightly referred to the deficiencies of the 1959 and 1980 Fisheries Acts under which aquaculture has been licensed to date.  The Acts predated the major development of aquaculture and, with hindsight, it is clear that the more detailed provisions to govern licensing, regulation and appeals are needed if aquaculture is to be both developed and controlled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy also raised the question of identifying suitable areas for aquaculture.  BIM is heavily involved in assisting potential fish farmers with this task and with considerable success.  The Deputy also asked about how the foreshore is allocated.  The initiative rests with the applicant. Applications for use of the foreshore are dealt with under the Foreshore Act and will continue to be following the enactment of this legislation</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Browne and Deputy Coughlan, referred to the important question of cheap Norwegian salmon products.  The Department and the industry have been active in addressing this issue.  I travelled to Norway last year to meet the Norwegian Minister on this matter.  I emphasised the need for control of production by the Norwegian salmon industry. I also raised the matter at EU level and the Commission is at present examining whether anti-dumping measures are required.  The Irish industry <Col N="1304" /> has been engaged in trilateral discussions with the Norwegian and Scottish industries under the auspices of the three Governments.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say prices for farmed salmon stabilised and, indeed, increased on the EU markets in 1996.  Irish farmed salmon, in particular, has enjoyed a premium price &mdash; a clear indication of its superior quality.  Credit is due to BIM for recently introducing a quality code of practice for farmed salmon and to Irish salmon farmers whose good husbandry has produced dividends in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Deputies McCormack, Molloy and Ó Cuív were particularly concerned about the great western lakes.  I share their appreciation of the magnificent part of our heritage which the great lakes of Lough Corrib, Mask, Carra and Conn represent. Let me say unequivocally that these lakes will continue to be maintained and developed as premier world wild sport fisheries lakes.  Indeed, considerable investment under the tourism angling measure has been approved for the development of the wild brown trout stocks in the lakes.  There will be no commercial fish farming on those lakes.</P>
    <P>As regards fresh water aquaculture in general, planning permission is required from the local authority and a fish culture licence from the Department of the Marine.  Decisions on planning permission are appealable and, when this Bill is enacted, decisions on fish culture licences will also be appealable.  In practice, most new fresh water aquaculture takes place on land based units and an effluent discharge licence from the local authority is required.  Deputy McCormack can be reassured, therefore, that the Bill does not diminish the local authorities' role as regards planning permission and effluent discharge permits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk referred to Carlingford Lough where there are two operations, one involving a local co-operative and the other a private operator. As he will know, a case is being taken in relation to the licence which prohibits me from speaking in detail about it other than to say that, following the enactment of this legislation, it will be open to a third party which has a concern or a complaint about a licensing decision to pursue it through the aquaculture licence appeals boards rather than the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised the question of applications lodged before the Act comes into effect.  Applications made prior to the Act, if not determined before the commencement date, will be determined in accordance with the Act under section 74.  The particular application to which he referred is at an early stage.  Deputy Hughes raised the issue of the revocation of licences.  As I stated yesterday, a number of penalties are provided for in the legislation, including penalties of up to £1,000 per day for breaches of conditions of licences.  In addition, there is a provision whereby the Minister may revoke a licence which is not being complied with by the operator.  I agree with the Deputy that aquaculture and inland fisheries need to be fostered.  Under section 61, the licensing <Col N="1305" /> authority is required to take into account wild fishery interests before making a decision on a licence application.  He also raised the issue of the salmon task force report.  I referred the report to the appropriate committee last October and I am available to consider the matter with it, when invited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent made a reasoned contribution. I agree that the approach we must take to the development of the aquaculture industry should ensure it is developed in a way that is sustainable and in keeping with the environment.  That is the approach and thinking behind this Bill.  I am willing to consider strengthening or tidying up aspects of the Bill on Committee Stage to achieve that object.  Deputy Keaveney referred to research into environmentally friendly techniques for salmon farming.  I agree research is important and the establishment of the Marine Institute facilitated the research and development needed to underpin the aquaculture industry as a sustainable one.  She referred to the need to strike a balance between the development of aquaculture and the protection of the environment and wild fisheries.  Deputy Coughlan referred to the appointment of the appeals board which, as I mentioned earlier, I am happy to examine on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It would be regrettable if polarised positions were taken on this legislation and it is not my intention to do so.  I was disappointed that persons and organisations who have had considerable access to me and my Department should adopt a particular approach to voicing concerns about the Bill which has been published for three months.  As I said, I responded in general to those concerns.  I accept, however, that there are genuine concerns and fears and I hope that, as the Bill progresses through the House, I will be able to allay many of them as they are groundless. If a case is made for strengthening or improving the Bill, I will be open to considering it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I have received some submissions from interested bodies on certain aspects of the Bill which I am considering.  I undertook to consider some observations made in the Seanad before the Bill was fully considered in the Dáil.  I am happy to address the concerns raised by Members during the course of the Second Stage debate.  The most appropriate way of doing that is when we examine the Bill section by section on Committee Stage.  One or two Deputies feared the Bill is being rushed.  It is not being rushed, it was published in November.  I have no intention of rushing it.  I believe in the full use of the parliamentary process to examine legislation.  I am happy to have the Bill thoroughly examined by the committee and to address amendments tabled by Members and specific concerns raised in the course of that debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Children Bill, 1996, deals with three important areas of policy concerning children.  It provides a statutory framework within which can be created and developed a new juvenile justice system responsive to the challenges posed by a sophisticated and largely urbanised society at the end of the 20th century.  It amends and extends the Child Care Act, 1991, by providing an additional range of powers to health boards to <Col N="1307" /> ensure that non-offending children who are out of control receive special care, education and treatment.  It re-enacts in an updated format the protection provisions in the Children Act, 1908. The Bill conforms to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and is in line with the first report of the Dáil Select Committee on Crime entitled &ldquo;Juvenile Crime &mdash; Its Causes and its Remedies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will refer to juvenile justice, past and present. It is by examining the past that we can understand the present and plan for the future.  The first real landmark in juvenile justice came in 1858 with the enactment of legislation providing for the certification of institutions for the detention of young offenders.  These were the reformatory schools which, in legal terms if not in operational or practical terms, are with us to this day. Within a few years up to ten reformatories were in operation.  The 1858 Act has long since been repealed and other similar Acts have come and gone, but if Deputies look at the Second Schedule they will notice we are repealing section 25 of The Irish Reformatory Schools Act, 1868.  The remainder of that Act was repealed in 1908 and it is interesting that its last remaining provision, now being repealed, was concerned with the financial contributions of parents towards their child's maintenance in a reformatory.  The contribution could be up to five shillings a week, a not inconsiderable sum in those days.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the 19th century saw further advances in the way young offenders were dealt with as well as in the protection of children generally. The reforming zeal of that time culminated in the second great landmark in the history of juvenile justice in Ireland, the enactment of the Children Act, 1908.  This Act was rightly known as the Children's Charter.  That enlightened and forward looking legislation forms a bridge to the present juvenile justice system.  The 1908 Act covered a wide range of policy areas relevant to children such as protection, care and juvenile justice.  The care provisions, including life protection, were repealed in 1991 by the Child Care Act of that year and we are now repealing all the remaining provisions.  It is truly the end of an era.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third landmark in the history of juvenile justice here, the legislation we are debating today.  It would be difficult to overstate the importance of this legislation, but it is worth being cautious about its potential effect.  We are not today discussing a new juvenile justice system but rather a legislative framework within which we can create a new juvenile justice system in the coming years.  The success of the system will depend on where we target the resources to operate it to its full potential, within the parameters and priorities established and implied in the Bill, and on the dedication and expertise of those who will operate it.  We are now presenting a new beginning and it is crucial that full advantage be taken of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> This is not the first attempt in recent years to reform juvenile justice legislation.  In the 1980s the Department of Health prepared proposals, which included juvenile justice provisions, aimed at replacing the 1908 Act.  More recently the Department of Justice took over this work.  All the time the principal factor holding back progress was the difficulty in agreeing the respective responsibilities of the main Government Departments concerned, Justice, Health and Education, under any new legislation.  One of the reasons I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for children's affairs at the three Departments was to bring forward this legislation.  On my appointment I immediately established under my chairmanship a co-ordinating committee of officials from each of the Departments.  One of the first tasks of the committee was to break the impasse on responsibility that was holding up progress on the Bill.  The agreement we reached was, to put it briefly, that the Department of Justice would be responsible for the detention of 16 and 17 year old young offenders, the Department of Education would be responsible for young offenders under 16 years of age and the Department of Health would be responsible for disturbed non-offending children.</P>
    <P>In general, this legislation is concerned with children, while the juvenile justice aspect is concerned with child or juvenile offenders.  The question we have to ask ourselves is: who are juvenile offenders and why do they, at a relatively young age, become involved in crime?  Juvenile offenders are children between ten and 18 years of age and most are boys, while a small but increasing number are girls.  The crimes they commit run the whole gamut from the trivial to the most serious.  It is not easy to say why young persons become involved in crime but a proper understanding of this question is necessary to allow for an appropriate targeting of resources.</P>
    <P>We are not unique in thinking we have a problem with juvenile crime.  All developed countries have a problem with juvenile delinquency and crime to a greater or lesser extent and most have a more serious problem than us.  Neither is juvenile crime, nor the perception of it as a perennial problem, new.  After feudalism broke down in Europe, probably every succeeding generation of adults has considered itself to be in the middle of a juvenile crime wave, with children effectively out of control, and has considered that things were much better in the days of their youth.  The reaction of the law makers in responding to public opinion has usually been to introduce harsh measures to deal with juvenile delinquency at times of particular concern.  Inevitably, opinion swings full circle when the harsh measures are seen not to work and a softer approach is then introduced.  When in time the situation still does not improve there is a return to harsher methods and so on.  What I am describing is the cycle of juvenile justice, an oscillation between the two traditional approaches to dealing with juvenile delinquency, the justice model and the welfare <Col N="1309" /> model.  In the light of our knowledge of the experience of other countries and in accordance with our constitutional requirements and social conditions, we have rejected legislating for a pure form of either model.  Instead, the most appropriate system for this country is a modified form of the justice model which incorporates suitable elements of the welfare model, as provided for in the Bill.  This is the best way to break out of the cycle I have described.  It allows each child offender to be dealt with in a way that offers the best and most appropriate hope for his or her rehabilitation without compromising the good of society generally and the feelings of the victim. Child offenders will not be dealt with in accordance with some outmoded or discredited approach to juvenile justice, especially one driven by an idealistic or theoretical approach.</P>
    <P>A high proportion of crime is committed by young males living in socially deprived areas. Undoubtedly, drugs are a contributory factor but it is also the case that only a small number of children in deprived areas become involved in crime.  If we knew the reasons some do and some do not, the problem would be easier to tackle. However, an accurate profile of the average juvenile delinquent can be built.  He, and it is usually a &ldquo;he&rdquo;, will be from a deprived background; he will come from a dysfunctional family with a strong possibility that one or both parents and other siblings will be involved in criminal and other anti-social activities; he will have below average intelligence and low self-esteem.  He will also be subject to intensive peer pressure and be open to malign influences from many sources.  He may, for example, suffer from video or television violence intoxication.  He will be a youth who has little hope for himself in the future and has nothing to lose through his anti-social activities. Pride, guilt and shame are emotions that may become alien to him.  People who deal with persistent young offenders say they have a short attention span and difficulty relating to other children and adults.  They crave affection and seek attention through misbehaviour.</P>
    <P>Most crime committed by children is petty. Larceny is by far the most common and the most popular time is during the afternoon.  That is a time of maximum opportunity; many houses are unoccupied during the day, cars are parked outside shops and in the city streets and the shops are open.  A significant percentage of the offences are committed by boys in the 14 to 15 years age group.  Deputies will see that in planning and preparing the legislation we possessed a considerable amount of information, from sources such as the statistics produced by the Garda National Juvenile Office, about what could be described as our target group and this information will be invaluable when it comes to implementing the legislation.</P>
    <P>This is a long and, in places, a complex Bill even though we have tried to draft it in as logical and sequential a way as possible.  Detailed consideration of its provisions can wait until it is <Col N="1310" /> debated in committee.  I will explain in as much detail as time allows, the meaning and intent of each Part of the Bill as well as the general approach to matters such as the role of parents. The role of parents is of crucial importance when dealing with young criminals, and this is recognised throughout the Bill.  On virtually every page are the words &ldquo;parents or guardian&rdquo;.  It begins in Part II where the parents would normally be expected to be present for the administration of a caution to their child; the juvenile liaison officer would have been in contact with the parents before that stage is reached.  The parents have an even more important role through their involvement in the family conference.  In this case they will be an intrinsic part of the proceedings aimed at getting their child to face up to his or her behaviour and formulating an informal family or community orientated plan to keep the child away from further anti-social activities.  The involvement continues through Parts VI and VII and I will refer to it in more detail when I discuss those Parts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will also see references to victims and victim impact reports.  Examples of where they occur include section 13 &mdash; admission to the diversion programme; section 24 &mdash; persons obliged or entitled to attend family conferences; and section 76 &mdash; power of the court to request reports.  That the children we are primarily concerned about have committed offences should not be lost sight of; where there are offences there are usually victims.  It matters little to the hurt, fear, loss and feelings of insecurity of a victim that the perpetrator was a child.  The Bill seeks to uphold the interests of all parties when a child commits an offence, and I suggest it succeeds in that difficult task.</P>
    <P>Part II is both unique and inventive.  It is unique in that no other country of which we are aware has given such statutory prominence to their diversion programmes or their equivalents. It is both unique and inventive in the incorporation into it of a family conference.  This allows the child's problems to be aired and a programme of corrective measures to be suggested in the presence of the child, his or her parents, perhaps wider family members and others interested in the child's welfare and, in some cases, the victim. It is essential that this type of intervention takes place soon after a child commits an offence because if a child become a persistent offender, successful intervention is more problematic.  By placing the family conference within the diversion programme we are ensuring the earliest possible intervention.  Other countries have non-statutory family conferences of varying types.  New Zealand has a statutory family group conference but it is different both in its operation and its functions to the one we propose.  Although the conference will have statutory functions in that it will be able to consider whether the child's period or level of supervision should be varied, the most important aspect of it is that it takes place and the child's problems and future can be discussed and <Col N="1311" /> planned in a calm and controlled atmosphere. Overall, Part II will enhance an already successfully administered diversion programme and will ensure more resources will be applied to keeping many young offenders out of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>Part III raises the age of criminal responsibility from seven to ten years, thus bringing us into line with other common law countries where the meaning of the term &ldquo;the age of criminal responsibility&rdquo; is the same as in this country.  The age of criminal responsibility means the age below which there is no capacity to commity an offence.  In other words, there is an irrebuttable presumption that a child under the age of criminal responsibility is incapable of crime.  This means there can be no compulsory intervention in respect of the anti-social activities of such a child which, if committed by an older person, would be an offence.  Therefore, there has to be a credible alternative way to deal with problem children.  The framework provided for in the Bill is that the health boards will have responsibility for these children.  When the necessary resources are in place the health boards will be in a position to provide a range of supports for this under 12 years age group.  There will be reviews of the age of criminal responsibility every three years thereafter until it is possible to raise the age further, probably in two stages to 12 years.  The experience gained by the health boards with the under tens will be valuable when the reviews take place.</P>
    <P>The rule that a child under the age of criminal responsibility is incapable of crime is called the <i>doli incapax</i> rule.  A child between the age, for the time being, of criminal responsibility and 14 years is also <i>doli incapax</i> but in this case the presumption that the child is incapable of crime is rebuttable.  It is now proposed to place this ancient rule on a statutory basis, thus ensuring it will remain a part of our law.</P>
    <P>Part IV places, with some changes and additions, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987, as they apply to children, on a full statutory basis within the comprehensive set of provisions in this Bill. It is underpinned by a statement of principle that children who are being investigated for the commission of an offence are entitled to special treatment in accordance with the provisions of this Part.  It thus recognises the vulnerability of children due to their age and level of maturity.</P>
    <P>The parents or guardian of a child will be notified by the Garda Síochána of their child's arrest and of the nature of the offence for which the child has been arrested.  They will be requested to attend the Garda station as soon as possible, but failure to attend will not be subject to any sanction. It would be unreasonable to expect parents to be always in a position to react quickly to notification of their child's arrest and it would be unfair to expect the Garda to wait indefinitely for the parents' arrival.  The child might be away from home or a parent may be looking after other children or be sick.  Where a parent or guardian does not or cannot attend at the station, the child <Col N="1312" /> will be entitled to request the attendance of an adult relative or other adult, reasonably named, who will then be informed by the Garda.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on the Office of the Attorney General, published on 21 February 1995, listed 25 recommendations for early implementation and identified another 10 issues requiring further consideration.</P>
      <P>Since then two progress reports from the Attorney General have been published outlining action taken on the recommendations.  A copy of the second report on the implementation of the report was made available to each Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas in May 1996.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a summary of the latest position which outlines further progress in so far as the Office of the Attorney General is concerned.</P>
      <P>Overall, substantial progress has been made in implementing the report of the review group.  The office of the Attorney General has undergone a period of sustained change and that change is continuing.  Systems and procedures are being refined to meet the changing demands being placed on the office.</P>
      <P>A strategy statement for the office will be published within the next few weeks, the office has moved into the final stages of its information technology plan and the Government will publish an annual report of the Attorney General for 1996 in June of this year.  This arrangement will provide the Government with an opportunity to keep the operations of the office under continuous review.</P>

      <P>A total of 29 recommendations are either already implemented or are in the course of being implemented.  It is not possible to summarise them.  The only way I could give the Deputy an adequate answer would be to read each of them into the record.  They are being circulated. The Deputy should table questions on individual recommendations if she requires further information.  If she insists I will go through the recommendations one by one, but that would not be the best use of parliamentary time.</P>

      <P>The reports issued by the Attorney General's office have been helpful to the House.  However, they do not address the procedures whereby other officials in the office deal with numerous cases with which the Attorney General cannot deal because of previous involvement. How do the Chinese walls work in so many cases in the Office of the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who has had an active practice at the Bar before becoming Attorney General will encounter cases in which he or she may have had a previous involvement.  There is nothing unusual or unprecedented about that. There is no evidence that any previous Attorney General acted improperly in this regard, even though almost every Attorney General came from private practice.  The current Attorney General has instituted a formalised procedure for dealing with the matter.  That it is a new procedure is not an inference about previous Attorneys General.</P>
      <P>If a matter does not require counsel's advice the head of the office, a senior legal assistant, deals with it and reports to me or to the Government without the intermediation of the Attorney General.  If the head of the office cannot deal with a matter with the aid of in-house services, external counsel is obtained by the head of the office without reference to the Attorney General.  If the Government requires senior counsel's advice on a matter in which the current Attorney General is conflicted, arrangements exist to deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not know the Deputy wished to raise this supplementary, but I have given him the best outline possible of the arrangements in place.  I do <Col N="1318" /> not have information written down on the subject. I believe what I have said is accurate, but if there is a slight alteration I will inform the Deputy.</P>

      <P>A committee of the House sat recently to examine the compellability of witnesses Bill.  Members of the committee were told by the relevant Minister that the committee could sit until midnight on the Thursday in question to complete Committee Stage with a view to taking Report Stage in the Dáil the following Wednesday.  The Minister promised to table at least 50 amendments on Report Stage for the following Wednesday.  Members of the committee received telephone calls last Friday to say that would not happen.  We later learned this is because the Attorney General's office is unwilling to put together all the amendments in such a short space of time.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if that is the position?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am furnishing to the House full information on the implementation of all the recommendations in the report.  That will provide satisfactory information for the Deputy on all relevant matters.  If he has further questions to put arising from that information, he is free to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the legal profession, it is important we recognise that there are two competing <Col N="1319" /> branches in this profession.  If a certain category of post previously confined to one branch is to be opened to the other, there will be pressure to open all posts to both branches.  The traffic cannot be in one direction only.  As long as we maintain the division between the two professions, there will be pressure from both sides for positions to be opened.  A number of posts which were previously reserved for barristers have now been opened to solicitors.  I am not aware if an equivalent number of posts which were previously reserved for solicitors have been opened to barristers.</P>
    <P>As regards the drafting of amendments to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, this is complex legislation which deals with something not dealt with by successive Governments since 1970.  It involves striking the appropriate balance between the rights of individual citizens and those of the democratic assembly, committees of the Dáil and bodies established by it to get information.  It involves the Houses of the Oireachtas potentially entering into areas which they did not previously enter, for example, where the courts might consider they had a primary responsibility.  It involves many difficult judgments arising from that and the wording of any legislation is one with which we must deal with considerable care.  It is true there were difficulties in producing all the required amendments in the time frame originally envisaged.  I am glad more time is now being taken to consider the legislation and the further amendments to it which are under consideration.  I do not expect this delay to be long but I am happy that more time has been afforded for drafting amendments. The contributions made by all parties in the committee have been helpful and have been taken into account as far as possible in the drafting amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree there was considerable unease at the subcommittee set up for Committee Stage of the compellability legislation, that the Attorney General was judge in his own cause?  There was a feeling among Members that we could do with an independent view of what is and is not necessary to conserve the independence and integrity of the office of the Attorney General in relation to that office's compellability before committees of this House.  Is the Taoiseach aware the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Doyle, informed that committee that, if we were ever to have another Wallace committee, it would require a special Act of Parliament to establish it because the Bill prohibited any officer of the Attorney General being called before such a committee in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate matter, is the Taoiseach happy with the overall management of the State's litigation? Is he happy that claims against the State &mdash; in prisons, in the Army relating to deafness or <Col N="1320" /> relating to ordinary employer negligence cases &mdash; are being handled efficiently and well?  Is there scope for appointing someone to a position such as the Solicitor General in England which would be a position dealing with day to day management of litigation with political responsibility as well <i>via</i> the Attorney General to this House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having quite an extension of this question and we also seem to be delving into the affairs of a committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have information to hand which answers Deputy Dermot Ahern's questions about solicitors.  Solicitors have been made eligible for appointment to draftsmen's posts which is an improvement in the position of solicitors.  It is the view that legal advisory posts should continue to be filled by barristers.</P>
      <P>As far as management of the State's litigation is concerned, I have been aware and concerned about this for some time, but not in the sense of imputing any lack of diligence or skill on the part of the people concerned.  However, from an organisational point of view, where categories of claims are consistent with one another, there could be more economical ways of dealing with them collectively rather than individually.  I know the high level group chaired by the Attorney General examining the interaction of the various State law offices will examine this matter.  It is of particular concern to them to ensure that the State law offices &mdash; the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General, the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána &mdash; interact and operate with one another in the most effective fashion possible to ensure the most efficient management of the State's legal business.</P>
      <P>As far as the affairs of the subcommittee are concerned, I would have no problem entering into an argument with the Deputy on the subject of the compellability legislation but it is inappropriate to Question Time.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Government authorised the publication on 5 February 1997 of the report by the Department of Finance on the Review of the Office of Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>In my statement announcing the publication of the report, which, together with a copy of the report, was placed in the Oireachtas Library and circulated to all Members, I said the Government had noted that good progress had been made in the following areas: putting in place of procedures to ensure that a comprehensive annual report is published in respect of the activities of the office &mdash; the first report in respect of the year 1996 will be published in June of this year; the expansion and upgrading of computer facilities within the office and the preparation of a Statement of Strategy for the office covering the period 1997 to 2000 which is expected to be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government also noted that the interaction between the office and the other agencies involved in the prosecution of offences is one of the issues being considered by the High Level Review Group on the Law Offices of the State chaired by the Attorney General.  That group is representative of the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's the office of the DPP, the Department of the Taoiseach, the office of the Tánaiste, the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice and includes an international legal consultant.  This group is to report back to Government within four months.</P>
      <P>The matters discussed in the Department of Finance report impact across a number of agencies and Departments.  I assure the House they are receiving careful attention within the office and the other bodies involved.  The report concluded there was no evidence of unnecessary or extensive unexplained delay in dealing with files in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned about the number of cases that cannot be processed because of administrative errors in drafting prosecution papers which was highlighted recently by the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  There appears to be a problem with the nature of the files coming from the Garda Síochána.  A special group to deal with this problem was established.  It met this morning and it hopes to report within three months on the action to be taken to ensure that all those involved in supplying papers or evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions will provide them in a form that is usable, so no delay can occur in his office as a result of deficiencies in materials supplied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into the arguments put forward by the Director of Public Prosecutions on this matter as they are on public record.  The Taoiseach spoke about an investigation <Col N="1322" /> of the complaints to produce a user friendly format.  Is there a training programme for gardaí which deals with these matters and shows the types of error that occur?  The Director of Public Prosecutions appears to view them as basic errors yet those who produce the papers appear to believe they are producing them to the best of their ability.  An in-service training programme could resolve many of these problems.  A three month investigation of the errors might not correct them.  It might be easier to bring those involved in preparing such papers to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions where he can show them how he wants the job done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The preparation of papers for prosecutions is one of the fundamental responsibilities of a member of the Garda Síochána.  It is basic to the operation of the force and is one of the factors that informs the work of its members. It is also central to the training which gardaí receive in Templemore to ensure they assemble evidence and present it in such a way as to enable a prosecution to be carried forward, if that is the appropriate course of action.</P>
      <P>Among the problems identified were cases where people put the wrong dates on papers. That is indicative of an absence of adequate care being taken and not an indication of a training deficiency.  It is important that people are reminded to take care in what they write on something that will be used as evidence in court or as the foundation for a prosecution.  There are areas, however, where further or refresher training would be appropriate for members of the Garda Síochána.  Efforts, if necessary, will be made to deal with that.  Furthermore, the Garda Síochána is currently the subject of a major examination in the context of the strategic management initiative.  This issue is one of the matters dealt with in that review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in its programme for renewal promised it would bring holders of high office before committees of the House.  When the Government published the compellability of witnesses legislation it did not envisage the Director of Public Prosecutions coming before the House.  Members of the committee accept that the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent, but independence does not mean non-accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a change of heart on the part of the Government since the Bill was originally drafted, and it put forward amendments to include the Director of Public Prosecutions as one of the people who could be called before at least one committee of the House.  That amendment was put forward because the Director of Public Prosecutions was interviewed on the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; radio programme in the meantime.  Will the Taoiseach extend the ability of the Director of Public Prosecutions to come before other committees of the House, apart from the Committee of Public <Col N="1323" /> Accounts which deals only with financial matters and Estimates?</P>
    <P>There was discussion recently about whether the findings of the hepatitis C tribunal should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Will the Taoiseach give his views on whether, when the House establishes tribunals of inquiry, there should be reference to the fact that the findings should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up the Deputy's invitation to become involved in comment on a matter which was the subject of discussion within a tribunal established by the House.  That matter can be dealt with when the tribunal report is received.  Everybody will be free to speak about it at that stage.  I will not do so in advance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Director of Public Prosecutions accounting for his work, that role has been greatly enhanced since I was given responsibility for that office by the House.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is now obliged to produce an annual report every June. That was never done under any previous Administration. Furthermore, in the near future the Director of Public Prosecutions will publish a statement of strategy for his office for the coming four or five years.  This, too, was never done before.  It will take a forward look at the work of the Director of Public Prosecutions while the annual report will offer an immediate retrospective on his work.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to compellable appearances by the Director of Public Prosecutions. There would be serious difficulties in maintaining the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions if we were to compel him to appear before the House to report on particular matters. However, that does not preclude voluntary appearances by him.  The Attorney General, for example, recently appeared voluntarily before a committee of the House and dealt with questions from Members.  There is no preclusion of voluntary appearances.  If such appearances occur, it would be important to acknowledge that we are now looking at these matters on the basis of more information being in the public domain than previously through the annual report and the statement of strategy.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is more accountable than he was in previous years as a result of initiatives I have taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is appropriate that we do not allow a situation to develop where the Director of Public Prosecutions is forced to discuss decisions about individual cases before a committee of the House.  That would be an infringement of the proper independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That independence was one of the achievements of the first Government of the State in which I had the honour to serve as a junior member in the 1970s.  The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions is one of the <Col N="1324" /> great strengths of Irish democracy and its legal system.  I do not wish to see it infringed in any way because it represents the best guarantee of the liberty of our citizens.  It protects all citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to conclude these questions.  I will call Deputy Dermot Ahern, Deputy Michael McDowell and Deputy O'Donoghue for final questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that the compellability of witnesses legislation proposes that the Director of Public Prosecutions would only come before a committee of the House to discuss statistical matters and general administration?  The Director of Public Prosecutions has an important role in society.  He issues important directions from time to time. Recently he issued a direction to the Garda Síochána regarding the detention of people in custody.  The direction had severe ramifications for the criminal justice system.  The Oireachtas wishes to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to explain the rationale for such a decision.  We do not wish to ask about individual cases and why he made decisions regarding individual prosecutions. Will the Taoiseach accept that there is a role for Deputies in questioning an officer such as the Director of Public Prosecutions about general policy matters rather than simply statistical matters to do with his office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my hope that matters referred to by the Deputy, such as the reasons for general decisions and the considerations when making decisions on particular categories of cases, will be voluntarily put forth by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the annual report.

      <P>The Deputy might think about what I am about to say.  Look at what happens during the Order of Business in the House.  Deputies know the rules by which we and the Ceann Comhairle must abide. We also know that virtually every day those rules are transgressed by Deputies who are frequently mentioned on news programmes the following day, as was the case in today's lunchtime news, for something that was technically not in order.  However, they achieve what they want to achieve.  It might be possible for us to make a rule that if the DPP were to be compelled to appear he could not be asked about an individual case, but in practice what might happen is that he would be asked the question but the Chair would intervene to say it could not be asked.  The Deputy who asked the question would get publicity but the DPP would not be able to reply.  That would be the worst of all possible <Col N="1325" /> situations, a chamber of accusation without a chamber of reply.</P>

      <P>That would not be good for the independence of the prosecution service.  This is a fundamental issue concerning the liberty of the citizen.  A prosecutorial decision should not be driven by considerations of transient popularity or unpopularity of particular categories of individual or alleged offender.  Issues of that nature should be looked at objectively and dispassionately by a truly independent person just as they are subsequently looked at independently by the courts.  I do not want to see political intrusion into decision-making of the kind that could arise inadvertently and unintentionally from well motivated suggestions of the kind made by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Whereas one would be tempted to say that virtually everybody in the House fully agrees with the proposition that the DPP should never be asked to explain or justify an individual decision, there was unanimity, particularly from the Fine Gael participants on the committee, that there is a whale of a difference between that and granting the DPP the kind of immunity proposed.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the report he mentioned, which suggested there was no evidence of significant or unjustified delays, is unduly complacent?  Will he recall correspondence I sent him two years ago asking why nothing had been done about reference of the Goodman report to the DPP's office, a matter in which two years later I have had no satisfaction from that office?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO has started preparations for the production of quarterly estimates of the main components of the national accounts, including GNP.  Some new quarterly inquiries into stock-building and investment have been initiated.  However, a substantial lead-in time is needed to develop the methodology and to collate new data.  It is envisaged that the first results will be published during 1999 both in current and constant prices.  These will include some retrospective data.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Quarterly GNP statistics are required for the purpose of operating the stability pact, which the Irish Presidency negotiated last year.  Recession is internationally defined as two quarters of negative growth in succession.  Will the Minister explain how the stability pact will be operated in 1998 if we do not have the statistics?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in the reply, there is a lead-in time.  We are in the process of meeting two of the requirements laid down, that relating to the revised system for national accounts and the exact data needed to establish our qualification for economic and monetary union.  As part of the lead-in we have taken on board a number of requirements &mdash; for example, we are undertaking quarterly inquiries into stock-building and investment.  We are confident that 1999 will be the terminal date and that we will be able to bring the required data on-stream on a <Col N="1328" /> quarterly basis before that date.  We are not the only country in Europe that does not hold quarterly surveys.  Other member states such as Belgium, Greece and Luxembourg are in the same position, but in their own way they are addressing the issue and will bring quarterly data on stream to meet the 1999 requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister request the CSO to go through the stability pact and see the other areas with which we need to comply? Obviously, when the documents were prepared the CSO was not consulted because there are a number of areas where it is out of line with what we can produce, even though we negotiated it during our EU Presidency.  The CSO should look carefully at what is being agreed to and ensure we comply with the statistical data, otherwise we will be in grave difficulty and out of line with other countries who say they will have this data ready by 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident we will have the data in advance of 1999.  I have already said that we are already making the adjustments in relation to capital investments and stocktaking.</P>
      <P>We are moving towards quarterly surveys across a range of areas.  I have already indicated that from this year we will have the quarterly labour force survey.  These are not the only surveys being carried out.  Other interim tracking measurements are being used to gauge our performance in other areas.  All of those help to give a composite picture.  The fact that it will be 1999 at the outside by the time the data comes onstream does not mean the targets will not be reached in the interim.  We already have a fair body of statistical data as regards meeting the various requirements.  A huge volume of data is assessed on a regular and quarterly basis.  I will bring the Deputy's comments to the attention of the CSO.</P>

      <P>Has the CSO taken account of the other economic indicators alluded to by the Minister of State in the light of the limitations of GNP in measuring both good and bad factors in society's welfare?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware there is a debate at present on the relevance of certain figures, whether it is GNP, GDP, GNDI or whatever will be the accurate indicator of performance. As a Government, the most relevant one is GNP, because the various items of income and expenditure are factored out or in to provide the most accurate database.  The GNP is the most accurate because profits which are repatriated outside the country are taken out and income that accrues to the country by way of investment outside of the country by Irish nationals is brought in.  That is the most accurate indicator of the performance of the economy and the amount of <Col N="1329" /> money that is available for spending within the economy.</P>

The station will be acquired by way of open competition.  This will be the first competition of its kind in Ireland for a major power station and I want to make sure it is successful.  I have engaged independent consultants to run the competition.</P>
      <P>The project has been included in the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme with EU grant aid of £21 million.  The allocation of funding for the project was agreed in a memorandum of understanding agreed with Regional Affairs Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies.  The schedule for drawing down funds under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme requires expenditure commitments to be made by the end of 1999 with actual expenditure completed by the end of 2000.  On the basis of the preliminary work done by the independent consultants, there should be no difficulty in complying with the first of these deadlines.  The main constraint in complying with the second deadline is the time necessary to secure environmental and planning permissions for the project.  The Commission can extend these deadlines and I intend to seek such an extension to cater for this uncertainty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Press reports last week referred to the midterm review of the Structural Funds.  Consultants have been engaged to evaluate all projects under the various operational programmes.  The new peat station is just one of the projects under <Col N="1331" /> review and it has not, in any way, been singled out for special treatment.  This process is part of the normal routine of the Structural Funds and contrary to reports in the press last week, my Department has not received instructions from the Commission about references to the grant in tender documents.  Firms which are interested in bidding for the project have known for some time that the Government has EU approval for the grant.</P>
    <P>I stress that Government support for the peat station project is not dependent on the availability of Structural Funds, as reports in the press seem to indicate.  Successive Governments have taken the view that Ireland must use its own fuels to protect our security of supply as far as is possible. The Government is fully committed to the peat station and we look forward to a competition which will see a new modern peat fired power station being built in the east midlands.</P>
    <P>I accept that it has taken some time to get this competition under way.  This is the first time that such a competition has been undertaken here. Any extra time taken reflects the care which the Government is exercising over the establishment of this competition and its desire to see that it is conducted properly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of engaging consultants for the project, the House will be aware that it was originally intended that the ESB power procurer would run the competition for the new station.  On that basis, a firm of consultants, Combustion Systems Incorporated, was engaged to advise my Department with regard to the technical specification which the ESB proposed for the competition.  The cost incurred, £26,957, was cofinanced from the Technical Assistance Programme amounting to £20,217.</P>
    <P>However, as I indicated in a written answer to Deputy Molloy yesterday, following legal advice from the Attorney General it was decided that the competition should be conducted by independent consultants rather than by the ESB.  This assignment is complex and onerous and requires a broad range of skills.  Following a selection process in accordance with EU procurement rules, a consortium of consulting firms was selected for the task.  The consortium comprises five firms who have been given the task of designing the framework for the competition and running the competition itself.  They have been working on the project for the last few months and have almost completed their consideration of the competition framework.  There is some further work to be done to complete the project documentation and I expect the competition will be formally announced by the end of March.  No EIOP expenditure has been incurred so far on this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the project which all parties in the House support was initiated during my time in the Department.  He will accept that the delay, for which I was previously given a different reason, gives cause for concern.  The reason I was given was that because some of those who had expressed an interest objected to the condition that required joint and several liability for the execution of the contract, the contract had to be readvertised.  We have now been informed the reason for the delay is that the ESB wishes to act as a procurer.  Has the fact that the Government has decided that the ESB can participate in the tendering process for the construction of the plant and that it would be selling electricity to itself caused a problem in the Minister's discussions with European officials on advancing the project?</P>
      <P>The Minister informed me before Christmas that the report of the consultants would be available before the end of December and he would enter into a contract early in 1997.  I understand the consultants' report has not yet arrived.  It is difficult to understand why there should be such a long delay.  We have had statements from the Minister and his predecessors about the complexity of the matter but that is a cover-up for mistakes or whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no conflict or inconsistency between the two matters raised by the Deputy.  It caused a delay at the beginning when the decision was taken that the ESB would run the project.  That subsequently proved, for reasons that could not be foreseen at the beginning, not to be a practical way of going about it. A change in the procedure had to be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We told the Minister's predecessor that would happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a difficulty in the appointment of consultants.  When the job was advertised it included a number of conditions, including joint and several liability.  One firm of consultants refused to tender on that basis, others did so and then said they did not like the conditions. That part of the project had to be readvertised. The delay added about eight weeks to the timescale for completion of the project.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Molloy and other Members are aware, we have the beginnings of a serious problem in the approach to major projects of this kind as they necessarily involve extensive procedures laid down by the European Union as to how one should go about giving contracts for the design of a project, as well as extensive procedures here in relation to planning and environmental legislation and the invitation of tenders.  It will be difficult for many Governments from here on to ensure that a project will be carried from conception to birth in the normal lifetime of a Government of four to five years.</P>
      <P>The involvement of the ESB in the project to which Deputy Molloy referred adds several layers of complexity.  It wants to be a bidder, which is a perfectly legitimate position for it to take.  It will also purchase the power generated at the plant. To ensure all of the bidders believe they will be treated fairly we have to ensure the way in which the ESB is treated cannot be represented as a way that favours the ESB over any other bidder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It presents a difficulty but it would be wrong to approach the project on the basis that the ESB should not be entitled to bid for the contract.  The Government has taken the view that there will be open competitions for any new power stations on a build, own and operate basis. It would not be reasonable to exclude the ESB from such competitions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

Given that he has now informed the House for the first time that the plant will not open for another five years, is he telling the House there is a doubt that this grant will be forthcoming?  I fully support the <Col N="1334" /> idea that the ESB should be permitted to tender for the contract for the project as long as it is kept at arm's length.</P>

      <P>The reply I gave to a written question on 19 December sets out the definitive position on ownership of the 20 per cent of Esat Digifone which appears to be contentious.  It could not be any clearer.  That reply states:</P>
      <P>The Secretary of my Department announced on 19 April that the application by Esat Digifone for the GSM licence disclosed an intention to place 20 per cent of the equity with financial investors in the period leading up to the award of the licence.  The application was supported by letters of intent from a number of highly reputable financial institutions.  At the time of award of the licence some two months later, it was certified to my Department that the 20 per cent had been placed with IIU Nominees Ltd. which was wholly owned by Mr. Dermot Desmond.</P>
      <P>The reference to the statement by the Secretary contained in the details supplied with today's question is not accurate.  IIU Nominees is now, and was at the time of the award of the licence, the sole investor in the 20 per cent of the equity available to financial investors.  The question of a list did not arise.

      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, indicated he did not know, nor did the Department know, anything about the financing. He indicated he knew nothing about the source of the financing or who organised it.  The Secretary indicated that a list of potential investors was handed to the Department.  Can the Minister resolve that apparent conflict?  Will he review the files in light of the revelation in the <i>Sunday World</i> article of a connection that appears to exist between the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, and a firm of financial accountants involved in the fund raising for Esat Digifone?  Given that the licence is almost a year old, what does the Minister intend to do about getting it up and running?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confused in several respects.  At the press conference on 19 April 1996 the Secretary of the Department made it clear that five of the six applicants had declared <Col N="1338" /> an intention to place minority stakes with outside investors mainly by way of share flotation or placement.  That is what happened and what produced IIU Nominees, which is wholly owned by Mr. Dermot Desmond.  I do not have any responsibility to explain to the Deputy or to interpret for him how he should read a particular shabby little article in the <i>Sunday World</i>.  I would not presume to advise him on how he should try to interpret that.  When he refers to financing, I gather he is referring to a completely different financing operation in which Esat Digifone was involved recently.  It raised quite a substantial amount of finance on markets in a way totally unconnected with this licence.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question about an alleged connection is shabby and unworthy of him.  I am not prepared to comment on the progress by Esat Digifone.  There are certain conditions in the licence.  I will answer a question on it shortly and if the Deputy waits until then, I will say everything that needs to be said about it at that stage.</P>

      <P>I asked questions of the Minister responsible for this area and he does not appear to want to answer them.  It is quite clear the Minister is not prepared to &ldquo;unpick&rdquo; any of the decisions of the former Minister, Deputy Lowry.  That is entirely unsatisfactory.  The Minister says that IIU owns 20 per cent of Esat.  No questions are asked by his Department as to who is the beneficial owner.  The company is still off the air after a year with no proposals from the Department to get it on the air.</P>
      <P>A Sunday newspaper indicated the financial advisers who helped to put the funds together for this scheme had a connection, albeit tenuous, with the former Minister.  Does the Minister intend to review the files in light of this suggestion or does he regard as shabby every point with which he does not agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talks about who owns 20 per cent of IIU and has been running with this for months.  The fact is that 20 per cent of Esat Digifone is owned by IIU.  The sole beneficial owner of IIU, as far as I can determine after extensive investigations, is Mr. Dermot Desmond.  There is, therefore, no basis for allegations which were touted around, and which the Deputy has run with at various times in the past, that there was some connection between people involved in providing the capital for this project <Col N="1339" /> and the former Minister.  The Deputy better get his mind clear on that because there is no future for him in trying still to suggest there was any improper connection.  That matter has been dealt with comprehensively from beginning to end.  The Deputy is literally punch drunk on this.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>the tax planning elements which were contained in the strategic alliance deal with KPN/Telia and Telecom Éireann and which were referred to by the chief executive of Telia (details supplied) on 30 January 1997; and his views on whether Telecom Éireann should be privatised within three years.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no special Irish tax arrangements in the alliance agreement reached between the State and the partners, KPN and Telia.  It is my understanding that comments about tax planning issues made by a representative of the strategic partners related to arrangements between KPN and Telia.  As these are matters for the two partners, I have no further comment to make.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should at this stage be well aware of the Government's views on the future development of Telecom Éireann.  Government policy on this issue is clearly set out in the programme for Government.  In summary the State's assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its stakeholders.  The Government is committed to retaining majority State ownership in these companies.  Opportunities for expansion to utilise the bank of skills in these companies will be encouraged.  In addition, commercial State bodies will be given a clear commercial mandate and clarity in the financial targets which measure their performance.</P>
      <P>The Telecom Éireann strategic alliance clearly fits the criteria set down in the programme for Government as being in the long-term interest of the company and its stakeholders.  Furthermore, the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996 provides that the aggregate State shareholding in Telecom Éireann must not be reduced to less than a majority of the issued share capital.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware the head of the new partners has been quoted in national newspapers as saying one of the reasons for the deal was some tax planning requirements.  The Minister said there were no tax implications in Ireland, but has he any information about the kind of tax planning arrangements entered into by the new partners in Telecom Éireann?  Do the three parties in Government consider these tax arrangements to be acceptable?</P>

      <P>I want to put two points to the Minister.  Twenty per cent of Telecom Éireann is now foreign owned.  It was sold for a scandalously low price but that is a debate for another day. Since they took over, the owners first said the figure of £500 million was negotiated by the company, and which the Minister's predecessor and the Minister of State told the House was £500 <Col N="1341" /> million from time to time but they are now quoted as saying that figure was largely a political figure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>What else would they say?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Minister it was a political figure before he did the deal.  Does the Minister now accept this?</P>
      <P>The Minister has laid out Government policy in regard to privatisation but the chief executive of Telia says that he intends to see it brought about in three years.  I take it that the Minister has communicated with the minority shareholder and brought to its attention Government policy in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The minority shareholders are well aware of Government policy and since I expect this Government will continue in office after the next general election, by the time we get to the end of that three year period, this Government will hold its view.</P>

The increase in value above a threshold based on an agreed rate of turn on the purchaser's initial investment on the 20 per cent stake and the option price on the 15 per cent is shared 60/40 between the State and KPN/Telia.

      <P>In November 1996 I announced that the Government had decided, on security of supply grounds, that the mandatory purchase of petroleum products from the Whitegate Refinery would continue in modified form.</P>
      <P>The effect of the modifications are: to reduce the purchase obligation from 35 per cent to 20 per cent, and to limit the additional income to the refinery arising from the mandatory regime to £3 million in 1997.</P>
      <P>As a result of these modifications the impact of the mandatory regime on the consumer price of petrol is estimated to have reduced from 0.70p per litre in December 1996 to 0.15p since January 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer the first part of the Deputy's question, 100 per cent of the produce of the refinery is now sold either at home or abroad, but the mandatory section of the off-take is reduced from 35 per cent to 20 per cent of what the companies sell within this country.  The decision taken in the context of the Government's response to the Culliton and Moriarty reports that the mandatory regime should terminate at the end of 1996 was taken on the basis that the continuation of refining could be assured in open market conditions and that, therefore, the interests of security of oil supply could be maintained. However, international refining margins in Europe fell significantly in 1995 and continued to fall in 1996 making the immediate prospects for the refinery's continuation in operation extremely difficult.  As a result, some corrective action was necessary to retain Whitegate's essential role in maintaining security of oil supplies.  In other words, if we had removed the mandatory regime entirely at the end of 1996, the refinery would have closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answers to Questions Nos. 580 and 583 of 22 January 1997.  I am not aware of radioactive waste being discharged into the Irish Sea in an experimental fashion. However, routine discharges by BNFL are authorised by the United Kingdom's Environment Agency and are permitted under its relevant national legislation.</P>
      <P>Revised discharge authorisations for the Sellafield site, agreed in 1993 by the UK's Inspector of Pollution and the Ministry for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries, came into effect in 1994 and provided for the operation of the new THORP reprocessing plant and the enhanced actinide removal plant known as EARP.  As a result of the coming on stream of these plants steep increases in the level of radioactive technetium 99 in the Irish Sea have been detected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from this, I wrote to the relevant UK Ministers expressing my concerns and requested that they use powers available to them to order the immediate and complete cessation of the discharge of technetium 99 from Sellafield into the <Col N="1347" /> Irish Sea.  In addition, I have also written to the European Commissioner responsible for nuclear safety, Ritt Bjerregaard.</P>
    <P>The necessary preparations have been made to have the question of radioactive discharges from Sellafield raised again at a meeting later this year of the Commission for the Protection of the Environment of the North East Atlantic established under the Paris and Oslo Conventions dealing with the prevention of marine pollution.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also requested the Oslo-Paris Commission and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to undertake a thorough technical review and assessment of both the reprocessing and non-reprocessing options for spent fuel management as well as their impact on radioactive discharges into the marine environment.  To this end, Ireland has made a voluntary financial contribution to the NEA to fund such a study.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the British Ambassador in my office last Friday, I expressly requested that the concerns of the Government and public in general on radioactive discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea be conveyed directly to the British Government.  I assure the House that I will persist in vigorously pressing the Government's case against Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for acceding to my exhortations in the House last week when I asked him to put the fears of the public on this side of the Irish Sea to the British Ambassador.  As regards technetium 99, does he accept the figures show a 14 times higher level of this radiation than the limit set by the EU after the Chernobyl incident?  This was the limit set by the EU for an accident.  Does he accept that the commissioning of EARP has led to the increase in this regard and that there is no provision to take technetium 99 or, indeed, krypton 85 out of THORP?  This is a matter of considerable concern to those living on the east coast and those involved in the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Did the Government have an input to the request by Sellafield for authorisation for increased discharges into the Irish Sea?  Will the Minister of State outline the action he proposes to take in relation to technetium 99?  Some nuclear apologists say it is not a dangerous radiation, although expert advice is available which suggests it is detrimental to public health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I should expand on the information the Deputy gave to the House.  Levels of technetium 99 detected in lobsters and some other shellfish produced near the Cumbrian coast have been found to contain 16 times more radioactivity than the European Union limit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of 1,250 becquerels per kilogramme for radioactivity in food.  I apologise to <Col N="1348" /> the Deputy for giving him wrong information as I believe I said 14 times on a previous occasion but it was not my intention to mislead him.  This intervention level is designed to apply in the case of the aftermath of a nuclear accident.  I assume that would be a higher level than would normally be expected.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware of a report published in October 1996 by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland entitled <i>Radioactivity Monitoring of the Irish Marine Environment, 1993-1995</i>.  The report indicates that the dose from artificial radioactivity to a heavy consumer of fish and shellfish at our north eastern ports was small &mdash; two microsievert in 1995.  To put the above dose in perspective, it may be compared with the does to the Irish population of 3,000 microsievert derived from natural and artificial sources.</P>
      <P>The report also states that the levels of radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea do not justify misgivings on health grounds about eating fish from the Irish Sea, swimming or engaging in any other activity in or near the sea along the east coast.  Such findings, however, do not affect the Government's continued opposition to any radioactive contamination of the Irish Sea caused by Sellafield, nor is it saying that fish landed or caught off the Cumbrian coast would be safe to eat.  The fish measured by the RPII were landed by Irish fishermen in Irish ports.  It is not talking about the fish to which the Deputy referred with levels 16 times higher than that recommended for human consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the huge increase in the level of technetium found in lobsters on the British side of the Irish Sea, does the Minister of State accept there has been a significant increase on the Irish side?  This was made clear by the RPII in its investigations.  Does he accept that the further commissioning of THORP will increase discharges not only into the sea, but into the air around these two islands and that this will potentially damage our health?  That is why he and the Government should renew their efforts as regards THORP and support the case taken by the four County Louth litigants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I confirm the Deputy's point that the RPII has found alarming increases in the level of technetium 99 along the Irish coast in the Irish Sea.  The levels are still below those which would give rise to health concerns, but they would give rise to concern from the point of view that they are constantly increasing.  The Deputy asked me the position concerning the latest application by BNFL.  As he is no doubt aware, BNFL recently applied to the UK Environment Agency for a <Col N="1349" /> variation of the existing aerial and liquid discharge authorisations from Sellafield.  The UK Environment Agency which regulates the granting of discharge authorisations is expected to take some time to examine the BNFL application. When it has formed a view on the application, it will be obliged to engage in a formal consultation process with designated parties.  However, the Government would be entitled to, and will, make its views known.  The consultation process is likely to commence this month and all parties would have eight weeks to present their views.  It has been suggested that it could be May or June before a final decision is made by the environment agency.  My Department has already written to it outlining Ireland's concerns in relation to BNFL's application and reserving the right of the Irish Government to submit further comments when the environment agency issues the draft authorisation for public consultation.  I am determining the most effective course of action to articulate Ireland's concerns in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of Council Directive 91/440 railway undertakings are entitled to limited access and transit rights across the frontiers of member states.  The directive provides for rights of access and transit for international services operated by international groupings of railway undertakings and for railway undertakings operating international combined transport goods services.</P>
      <P>The access provisions of the directive were transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument 204 of 1996.  Two further directives have been adopted supplementing Directive 91/440.  These relate to the licensing of railway undertakings, the allocation of rail infrastructure capacity and the charging of fees for infrastructure use.  Both of these directives are due to come into force on 28 June 1997.  The method of transposing these directives into Irish law is being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any approach by outside operators to provide services on Irish railway systems to date.  However, whether other rail operators avail of access to the Irish rail network the fact is that Iarnród Éireann is certain to face intensified competition from alternative modes including the private car and private road freight and bus operators.  It is essential, therefore, that Iarnród Éireann takes the necessary steps now to ensure it can meet this intensified competition.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister spell out in clear terms whether it is possible under EU law for a third party rail operator to come here and enter into an arrangement to provide rail services on the Irish rail track in competition with Iarnród Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two answers to that question. The practical answer is that it would be very difficult for them to do so except from Northern Ireland because the gauge of our track is different from tracks in the rest of Europe.  The legislative answer is that access and transit rights have to be given to international services operated by international groupings of railway undertakings and to railway undertakings operating international combined transport goods services.  The Deputy will agree it is unlikely that anybody will be seeking transit rights across Ireland; that is not a matter that would concern us.  A right of access for international services operated by international groupings of railway undertakings would be the most likely one but I cannot see many of those coming on the scene because of the difference in gauge between our track and that in the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>In practical terms the degree of access we have to offer under the directives in force is very limited on our rail infrastructure.  The commissioners made it clear in the White Paper on the revitalisation of community railways that the degree of opening up access to other operators will increase over time.  I expect, as the years go by, there will be further directives that will expand the range. Most of the practical effects of this are designed to meet the situation in continental member states where transit and cross-border operations are far more important than they ever will be here.</P>

      <P>I am seeking to elicit from the Minister the real implications for Ireland of this new EU directive.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain circumstances in which that could happen.  As Directive 91/440 stands, we would have to grant limited access and transit rights to a railway undertaking operating international combined transport goods services. If a railway operator in Northern Ireland was operating an international combined transport service, that is, if it was taking charge of the movement of goods by railway from a point in Northern Ireland to a point in our jurisdiction and it was also operating another mode of transport to bring the same goods further, we would have to grant limited access.</P>

Under this Part where the member in charge of the Garda station to which an arrested child has been brought believes the child may be in need of care or protection he or she will be obliged to inform the local health board.  A representative of the board will then go to the station as soon as practicable.  This provision could be important where, for example, the child is homeless or involved in prostitution.</P>
      <P>Part V establishes a new children court which will replace the existing juvenile court.

Under this Part the President of the District Court will have power to designate children court judges in any district to which more than one judge is attached.  For other districts a panel of judges will be established by the president from which he or she may designate children court judges.  It is for the president to decide on what basis he or she will make these designations. The separate issue of the training of judges has been dealt with in a more appropriate broader context in the Courts and Courts Officers Act, 1995.</P>

    <P>Part VI is concerned with proceedings in the new children court.  It is underpinned by a general <Col N="1353" /> statement of principle establishing the rights of children before the children court.  There are several important crossovers in the Bill from the justice to the care and protection procedures for dealing with children.  One of these is provided for in section 64 which allows the court to adjourn proceedings against the child where it appears the child's problem is a need for care or protection. The health board will then investigate the child's circumstances and, having done so, will inform the court of its assessment of his or her health care needs, if any.  The board may apply to the court for a supervision order, a care order or a special care order in respect of the child and where it does so the court may dismiss the charges against the child.  Special care orders are introduced in Part X and I will deal with them in more detail under that Part.</P>
    <P>Another provision in Part VI which I wish to highlight is the requirement on both parents or the guardian to attend all proceedings in the court with their child, and when I say &ldquo;both&rdquo; I mean both parents.  The least that can be expected of parents is that they are there to offer whatever support they can to their child and, if necessary, to be questioned about their child's behaviour.  It is also important that they are there to hear the decision if their child is found guilty as the court may offer advice to them on how to help and support their child cope with and carry out any penalty imposed, in particular a community sanction. The court can also make clear to the parents what it regards as their responsibilities to their child. Of course, it may not always be possible for one or both parents to attend court.  We have to be realistic on that point.  The court will have the power, in the interests of justice, to excuse one or both parents from attendance at all or part of the proceedings.  Where a parent or guardian is not present in court, an adult relative or other adult may attend with the child.</P>
    <P>I turn now to one of the longest and most important Parts of the Bill.  A child can be detained where it is the only suitable penalty.  In those circumstances it behoves us to provide the courts with a wide range of community sanctions which, if used imaginatively, should ensure an appropriate sanction for each child on whom such a sanction is imposed.  Part VII provides those community sanctions.  Like several other Parts, this Part is underpinned by a set of principles, in this case those relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction.  It also sets out clearly and concisely the powers of a court on a finding of guilt of a child, and most of these are dealt with in detail in this Part.  On a finding of guilt, before a court decides how it will deal with a child it can request a report on the child.  It is entitled to do this in any case but is obliged to do so whenever it forms the opinion that the appropriate penalty may be a community sanction or detention.  The report is prepared by a probation and welfare officer but the courts also have power to request any other report it considers may assist it in arriving at a decision.  For the guidance of the courts, examples <Col N="1354" /> of other reports are given in section 76 &mdash; these are medical, psychiatric, psychological and victim impact reports.  It is important to emphasise that the persons preparing the reports are professionals and experts in child matters and are uniquely placed and qualified to assist the courts in determining the appropriate way of dealing with child offenders.</P>
    <P>A court can deal with a child by such means as a reprimand or conditional discharge but, if it goes beyond that, the penalties it can impose can be broadly classified under three headings &mdash; financial, community sanction or, as a last resort, detention.  These are as wide-ranging and flexible as possible so that there will be an appropriate penalty available for imposition on each child, regardless of the child's circumstances.</P>
    <P>I will describe the financial penalties.  The courts will be empowered to order a child to pay a fine, the maximum of which will be one half of that which could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same offence.  With children defined as persons up to 18 years of age, many children who appear before a court will be working or will be potential earners.  For those whom the court deems could afford to pay, provision for the payment of a fine is a proper and valid penalty for the courts to have at their disposal.</P>
    <P>Child offenders could also be obliged to pay compensation, as could their parents.  Where the courts order a parent to pay compensation they must be satisfied that there is good reason for so doing.  It is for the courts to decide what is a good reason in any particular case.  For parents who could afford to pay compensation, this is an appropriate penalty which will encourage them to face up to their responsibilities to control their children.  Another way of making parents face up to their responsibilities in this regard is to oblige them to enter into a recognisance to exercise proper and adequate control over their children.  It can only be forfeited when the child is found guilty of another offence and the court is satisfied that the failure of the parent to exercise proper and adequate control over the child contributed to the child committing the offence.</P>
    <P>None of the financial provisions I have mentioned is new.  They are simply being rationalised, updated and placed on a proper statutory basis in a comprehensive manner.  What is new is that before imposing one of these penalties the court must take into account the person's present and future ability to pay.  This may apply to the child or the parent and for that purpose the court may require evidence to be given as to means and financial commitments.  This will obviate any possibility of inappropriate financial penalties being imposed.</P>
    <P>The second category of penalties is the community sanction.  These are listed in section 94 and, very broadly, can be divided into three main groups.  First, is the day centre order and other orders in which the probation service plays a central role.  The day centre order is crucial to the success of the Bill.  It could almost be described as <Col N="1355" /> a junior version of the community service order, although it will be available for the courts to impose on all child offenders, regardless of age. Instead of work, it will involve programmes of occupation, activities and, in the broadest sense of the word, instruction, both indoor and outdoor. Participation will be for up to 90 days, not necessarily consecutive.  The probation service will be responsible for the construction or provision of a network of day centres and can also use other facilities for that purpose with the consent of the owners of those facilities.  Three variations of a probation order are also provided which isolate and highlight a particular aspect of the order for implementation.  Thus, if the court considers that one of these orders is appropriate in a particular case it can, depending on circumstances, especially those of the child offender, impose a training or activities programme order, an intensive supervision order or a residential supervision order.</P>
    <P>The second group of community sanctions is the suitable person order.  While the child offender will still be under the supervision of a probation and welfare officer, the emphasis will have changed.  These orders will be relevant where the child's family is part of the problem, whether it is a dysfunctional family or a family who just cannot cope despite good intentions.  In the former case the child could live for a predetermined time with an especially chosen person or family.  This would parallel fostering in care situations.  In the latter case the child and his or her family would receive the help and support of another especially chosen person or family to prevent the child becoming involved in further crime.</P>
    <P>The third group of community sanctions is the restriction on movement order which, combined with a probation or day centre order, is called a dual order.  The child's movements can be restricted in two ways.  First, he or she can be restricted to a particular residence for any time between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following morning.  It will be for the court to decide, when making this order, between what particular hours the order will apply.  Matters such as the age of the child, his or her legitimate pursuits and the offence for which he or she has been found guilty would be relevant. This order would not be appropriate for many children, such as those whose problems emanate from an inadequate family background. Parents will not be asked to enforce the order although their full co-operation would certainly be useful.  The residence need not necessarily be that of the parents; it could be that of a relative such as a grandparent.  Enforcement will be through the local gardaí who will be given a copy of the order by the court and will be empowered to call to the named residence to check for compliance.</P>
    <P>The other type of restriction is that which prohibits a child being at or in any named premises, place or locality during specified days or times. <Col N="1356" /> The days or times are not restricted in the Bill. The purpose of this form of the order is primarily to prevent a child being at some place where he or she may become involved in crime or be open to the temptation or persuasion to be so involved.</P>
    <P>The third type of penalty open to the court is detention.  This can only be imposed where the court is satisfied that it is the only suitable way of dealing with the child.  In Part VII some general detention matters are dealt with.  Part VIII outlines in more detail the type of detention being proposed.  The Minister for Education will be responsible for the detention of all child offenders under 16 years of age on whom a child detention order has been imposed.  The children detention schools provided for that purpose will be obliged to accept all referrals to them from the courts regardless of what the child has done, his or her problems or any specialised treatment the child may need.  Such detention will be for a period of up to three years.  Detention of 16 and 17 year olds will be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice who will be obliged to designate places for that age group separate from older detainees and prisoners.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill sees the end of the reformatory and industrial schools and their replacement with children detention schools.  The way these schools will operate in practice is of the utmost importance, and this is reflected in section 137 which sets out their principal object.  Another positive effect on the operation of the schools is that most should become the responsibility of a single board of management which will appoint a chief executive to be responsible for the running of the schools and the management of the detention of each child.  It is essential that each child's detention is managed in a way that will maximise his or her chances and opportunities for remaining free from involvement in further crime. Achieving that will be a major challenge because by the time child offenders end up in detention they may be persistent or serious offenders and some may be quite disturbed.</P>
    <P>Part VIII is too long to discuss in detail today but I will mention briefly some of its features.  An inspector will be appointed by the Minister for Education who will be responsible for the inspection of each school at least once every six months. Children Court judges will be entitled to visit the schools at any time.  The director of each school will be obliged to accept every referral from the courts and every transfer from another school as directed by the chief executive.  Schools will have to provide treatment facilities for children with particular problems.  A sophisticated policy of leave and supervision will ensure that children successfully reintegrate back into society, and voluntary aftercare will be available on completion of the detention.  The board will be in a position to enter into arrangements with others to provide detention facilities for child offenders.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill re-enacts provisions in the 1908 Act concerned with the protection of children. Of all man's inhumanity to man, one of the <Col N="1357" /> worst is cruelty to children.  The law on cruelty and neglect is being updated and the penalties substantially increased in accordance with a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its report on non-fatal offences against the person. Changes to the law on sending out children to beg are also in line with a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in its report on vagrancy and related offences.  The evidential burden will now be on the person who sent the child out to beg, making successful prosecutions easier.  The law on encouraging or causing a sexual offence upon a child under 17 years of age is being updated in many important respects, including an increase in the penalties.</P>
    <P>Part X of the Bill is the responsibility of the Department of Health and provides for an amendment of the Child Care Act, 1991.  Under that Act, health boards have statutory responsibility for promoting the welfare of children not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>My apologies but this is the most substantial legislation ever to emanate from the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>A small number of children whom the boards have been endeavouring to assist are so unruly that they cannot appropriately be cared for in the existing range of residential care centres.</P>
      <P>Judicial review proceedings were brought against a number of health boards on behalf of some of the children concerned alleging that the boards were failing in their statutory responsibilities towards the children.  The High Court held that (a) the Child Care Act does not empower a health board to detain a child and (b) the State is under a constitutional duty to provide suitable secure accommodation for children who need to be detained for their own safety and welfare.  The result is that Part X now provides that health boards will have responsibility for the provision and operation of appropriate services and facilities for children who, while not in trouble with the law, need to be detained in their own best interests.  It does this by making provision for a special care order on the application of a health board where the court is satisfied that the behaviour of the child is such that it poses a real and substantial risk to his or her health, safety, development or welfare, and the child requires care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless the court makes the appropriate order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special care order would commit a child to the care of a health board and authorise a board to arrange for appropriate care, education and treatment for the child and for this purpose to detain the child in a special care unit.  A health board will have authority to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to prevent children from <Col N="1358" /> injuring themselves or other persons in such a unit or from absconding.  Provision is also made to allow a health board to place a child in a children's residential centre, with foster parents or give the child temporary release as part of a programme of treatment.</P>
    <P>Part XI of the Bill provides for some miscellaneous provisions, most of which require little comment.  One important provision is section 219. What child has not done something silly or been involved in some sort of vandalism or petty crime?  If caught, charged and found guilty, that child will have a stain on his or her record for life. Once found guilty, only a court can undo that guilt and that would be on appeal.  What we are providing in section 219 is a limited &ldquo;clean slate&rdquo; in respect of most offences committed by children; the only limitation being that one cannot say an offence never took place.  The section limits instead the effects of a finding of guilt by treating a person who was found guilty of committing an offence as a child, for all purposes in law, as a person who has not committed, been charged with, prosecuted for, found guilty of or dealt with for an offence.  The conditions applying are that the offence was committed while the person was a child, three years has elapsed since the finding of guilt and the person has maintained a clean record in those three years.  It will exclude offences such as rape or murder that are triable by the Central Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Although I have spoken today at some length I have barely scratched the surface of the Bill.  I hope I have said enough about each Part to give a flavour of the Bill and its importance.  I have also placed the Bill in a historical setting as to do so allows us to avoid the mistakes of the past.  I will conclude by placing the Bill in a more contemporary setting.  In itself the Bill is important for the procedures it provides for dealing with children who have committed offences as well as those non-offending children with behavioural problems.  It should also have positive implications in relation to the number of offences committed by children.  Its real significance, however, is how it fits into overall policy, both legislative and non-statutory, on children.  The recent full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, and the forthcoming school attendance Bill will, with this Bill, complete a trio of statutory measures which, in a complementary fashion, will help to prevent juvenile crime and provide a comprehensive framework for responding to the needs of vulnerable and troubled children.</P>
    <P>Non-statutory measures are of equal if not greater importance.  For example, the Department of Justice currently funds youth diversion projects in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford. These projects have a particular focus and are directed at young people either involved in or at risk of becoming involved in crime.  The community gardaí maintain contact with young persons in a number of ways, for example, through structured and formal visits to schools, through the schools programme and by informal contact <Col N="1359" /> through sports organisations and youth organisations. Over 1000 gardaí have been trained in the programme which now operates in over 2,800 schools.  Its aim is to help children, with the support of their teachers, to develop behaviour that will keep them safe from accidents and crime. These type of dealings by gardaí with young persons are vital to divert children from a possible life of crime.</P>
    <P>Initiatives have also been taken in the Department of Education which will have important preventative implications.  These include the commissioning of a report from the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre on the problem of educational disadvantage.  In response to the report a new targeted initiative has been launched which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.  The Minister for Education also introduced the early start pre-school initiative which aims to expose young children to an educational programme that will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.  The home-school community liaison scheme has, among its aims, an important role to play in establishing contact with parents and encouraging them to become involved in their children's education. Twenty-seven teacher-counsellor posts have been allocated by the Department of Education to offer special targeted support to selected disadvantaged schools for the purposes of supporting these schools in their efforts to manage the behaviour of pupils who may be disruptive or disturbed.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health makes substantial resources available to the health boards to develop their child care and family support services. These services are far too many to refer to, but those of particular significance in the context of this debate include home help services to families and children under stress, residential accommodation and support services for at-risk adolescents and young homeless, parenting courses, family resource centres and counselling and social education programmes.</P>
    <P>In debating the Children Bill, it is important to refer to the schemes I have briefly mentioned and to the many others aimed at disadvantaged areas, children in danger or need and parents under stress or lacking parenting skills.  While the purposes and aims of the schemes, statutory and non-statutory, may vary, one effect they all have in common is to prevent youngsters becoming involved in crime.  The Children Bill will complete the picture by dealing with the situation that arises when a child becomes involved in crime.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate on the recent Private Members' child pornography Bill I undertook to include appropriate child pornography provisions in this Bill.  I intend to honour that undertaking by way of Committee Stage amendments.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a constructive debate on the <Col N="1360" /> Bill in which the respective interests of children in trouble with the law, their victims and the community generally and the other aspects of the Bill are considered in a fair and balanced manner.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The stated purpose of the Bill is to replace the remaining provisions of the Children Act, 1908, and associated legislation with a modern, comprehensive statute.  Its predominant aim is to provide a basis for a new system of juvenile justice.  It should take cognisance of the developments here and elsewhere in the area of juvenile justice which have occurred over the past 90 years.  It should set out a vision for the future and a blueprint for the implementation of that vision.  Unfortunately, the Bill must be read with a growing sense of disappointment.  It merely tinkers with solutions and systems which have already been seen to be inadequate.  It lacks innovation and vision and merely offers more of the same.</P>
      <P>If the parts of the Bill which merely restate existing law in a mildly altered form were to be removed, what would remain would amount to little more than window dressing.  Existing schemes and rules are placed on a statutory basis but substantive reform has not been achieved. The common law has been written down, shuffled and rewritten in statutory form.  Existing schemes have been transcribed, renamed and given statutory form.  The Bill seeks to create the illusion of reform while maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  It is a tired Bill which has emanated from a tired Minister in a tired Department.</P>
      <P>The Bill represents a policy of acceptance and resignation rather than a vision for the future.  It makes a clear statement that &ldquo;this is the best we can do&rdquo;.  It is inadequate and its publication has been rushed to create a semblance of activity in an election year.  It may even deprive the Minister for Education of the parliamentary record she attained during the passage of the Universities Bill because this Bill will require at least as many amendments.  A Government that is serious about juvenile justice would withdraw the Bill and acknowledge it for what it is, a shallow attempt at parliamentary scrabble to create the illusion of activity.</P>
      <P>Part II, which includes sections 7 to 39, lacks innovation and vision.  Its primary purpose is to place the Garda diversion programme, formerly known as the juvenile liaison officers' scheme, on a statutory basis.  The explanatory memorandum is commendably honest when it declares: &ldquo;The statutory scheme will operate similarly in many respects to the administrative scheme&rdquo;.  In the 32 sections of the Bill the Minister hopes to achieve a change in the basis of the bureaucracy which oversees the implementation of an existing policy. With the lamentably isolated exception of a family conference, nothing new will result from the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III deals with criminal responsibility and is as bereft of innovation as Part II.  Substantive reform is not attempted or achieved.  Part II simply <Col N="1361" /> seeks to put an existing administrative scheme into statutory form and Part III simply seeks to restate the existing common law in a slightly altered manner in statutory form.  It is indicative of the rushed manner in which the Bill has been approached that it does not even achieve this limited task without confusion.</P>
    <P>The new age of criminal responsibility is to be ten, 11 or 12, depending on which group of Ministers can reach a consensus at a given time.  If the Minister for Finance were to apply the same parliamentary logic to the Finance Bill, the standard rate of income tax would be 27 per cent, 25 per cent or 23 per cent, depending on which Cabinet faction is in the ascendancy at a given time.</P>
    <P>I have known children to learn to paint by numbers but the concept of legislation by numbers is novel and indicative of muddled thinking and a rush to overcome an absence of consensus by legislating for alternatives.  It may be novel but it is also nonsense.  How can the concept of constitutional fairness guaranteed in the criminal process be reconciled with shifting the age of criminal responsibility envisaged by the legislation?  In hindsight would it not have been better for the Government to have made a decision rather than institutionalise its indecision?  The common law concept of criminal guilt as understood by our courts is heavily based on the notion of <i>mens rea</i>. This in turn arises from the influence of the Ecclesiastical courts on the common law system of justice in the 12th century and is most forcibly set out in the legally oft-quoted Latin maxim, <i>actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea</i>, a person is not legally culpable unless the mind is morally blameworthy.  Simply put, this means criminal responsibility does not arise from the performance of a prohibited act alone; a further ingredient, that of intention, is also necessary before the prohibited act becomes criminal.  Thus, the minimum age of potential criminal responsibility was fixed by the common law courts at seven years of age as that was the age at which the Ecclesiastical courts believed a child obtained the use of reason. For that reason a common law presumption arose that a child under seven years of age was incapable of committing criminal wrong.  In the parlance of the time, such a child was presumed to be <i>doli incapax</i>.  The presumption in respect of children under seven years of age was irrebuttable. In respect of children between seven and 14 years of age the presumption of <i>doli incapax</i> also applied, but was rebuttable.</P>
    <P>It became clear that the test of <i>doli incapax</i> gave rise to considerable difficulty which was spelled out with admirable clarity by the English jurist, Glanville Williams in a document entitled The Criminal Responsibility of Children, published in the 1954 edition of <i>The Criminal Law Review</i>, when he stated that the <i>doli incapax</i> test meant that the more warped the child's moral standards, the safer he was from the correctional treatment of the criminal law.  The difficulty was again addressed in the specific context of Irish <Col N="1362" /> jurisprudence by Professor Niall Osborough in an article entitled &ldquo;Rebutting the presumption of <i>doli incapax</i>&rdquo; in the 1968 volume of the <i>Irish Jurist.</i> In the article, Professor Osborough reviewed existing case law with a view to extrapolating those factors which were relevant to rebutting the presumption.  It was again found that a home background which suggested a firm awareness of right from wrong was a factor relevant to deciding whether the presumption of <i>doli incapax</i> was rebutted.  This finding of Professor Osborough confirmed the earlier view expressed by Glanville Williams that the more warped the child's moral values were the more immune he or she became from criminal prosecution.</P>
    <P>This is a difficulty which has been known to have existed for more than 40 years.  It is a difficulty which manifests itself with unfortunate regularity in criminal courts.  It is unfortunate the Government has chosen to pretend it does not exist.  It is clear the ostrich approach to legislative enactment pioneered by the Minister for Justice has now percolated through the Department of Justice.  Difficulties do not go away if they are side-stepped.  The Minister has chosen to pretend the most serious difficulty which has affected the concept of <i>doli incapax</i> does not exist.</P>
    <P>In Section 40 which could have addressed the problem, the Minister has chosen to simply move the age of criminal responsibility as if engaged in a game of legislative bingo.  Section 40(2) provides that the Minister and her friends may play further games of legislative bingo with the age of criminal responsibility at specified times in the future.  I am forced to ask whether the Minister for Justice ever tunes in to the real world.  Does she know what happens in courts?  Does she listen to what judges say?</P>

      <P>It is ironic that within one week of the honourable Judge Cyril Kelly &mdash; the judge who presides over the criminal list in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court &mdash; criticising the common law <i>doli incapax</i> rule as being unfair and giving rise to potential instances of injustice, this Government has seen fit to move the Second Stage of a Bill which gives statutory authority to the very same rule in an effectively unmodified form.  While this development is ironic, it is not surprising.  It typifies the attitude of the Department of Justice over the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of any necessary reform to the concept of <i>doli incapax</i> is a serious flaw which could have been avoided by the application of understanding and imagination.  Section 40, which ought to have taken cognisance of advances in the field of cognitive development and child psychology, is silent on such development.  If an age of criminal responsibility is to have any meaning in the late 20th century, it must be seen to refer to mental and not physical age.  This Bill wholly ignores this issue.  As far as the Government is <Col N="1363" /> concerned, the issue does not exist.  Section 40 does little more than restate the existing laws with mildly altered figures.  An opportunity for reform has been squandered; yet another issue has been side-stepped.  This section will be seen not as a milestone in the development of the jurisprudence of young offenders but as a rushed and ill-considered hotchpotch prematurely published in advance of a general election to give a semblance of legislative activity to a Department which has been bereft of leadership and inspiration for the past two years.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the treatment of child suspects in Garda stations.  It is a collection of sections which owe more in their origin to the photo-copier than to the intellect.  This is frankly admitted by the explanatory memorandum which acknowledges the scissors and paste approach of the Minister by stating: &ldquo;This Part re-enacts, with additions and modifications, the relevant regulations of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Stations) Regulations, 1987, as they relate to children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sections 42 to 56 are nakedly plagiarised from the 1987 regulations.  The same result could have been achieved by a one line amendment which raised the age at which a person is to be regarded as a child from 17 to 18.  Is there a reason the Minister did not take the obvious and easy course?  The answer is yes.  The reason is that she wishes to create the illusion of legislative activity in circumstances where there is none.  Sections 42 to 56 restate existing law and represents the enactment of Government policy on child offenders which is, more of the same.</P>
    <P>The provision relating to the Children Court is equally lacking in innovation.  The opening section of Part V declares: &ldquo;The District Court when hearing charges against children....  shall be known as the Children Court ....&rdquo;.  The section represents no more than the triumph of form over substance.  If something does not work effectively, the Minister's solution is to change its name.  The concept of substantive changes is clearly beyond the Minister's comprehension and capacity.  The existing Children's Court is to be abolished and, in its place, the Minister proposes to establish a Children Court.  This semblance of change takes the place of much needed reform.  Why, instead of contenting herself with changing the nameplate on the door, did the Minister not address the real problems created on a daily basis by the rules of evidence which hinder and prevent children from giving evidence?  The answer is that the Minister is not looking for solutions.  She is not looking for reform.  She is looking for publicity.</P>
    <P>The mentality which gave us endless photographs of the Minister poised over caches of seized cocaine, like the human companion of Jake the sniffer dog, while the unopened post spilled onto the floor of her private office, is responsible for this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> The provisions relating to proceedings in the Children Court, which occupy sections 63 to 71 must be read in conjunction with section 2 which deals with commencement dates.  It is clear the preparation made by this Government for the introduction of this part of the Bill is far from complete.  Could the Minister indicate the time frame envisaged for the coming into operation of this phase of the Bill?  How many junior remand centres are planned?  Where will they be located? What provision was made for them in the recent budget?  Is it envisaged that existing detention schools will merely be renamed in a continuation of the Orwellian charade which permeates every section of this Bill?  Why does the Minister not declare that offences committed by children shall be deemed not to be offences for statistical purposes thus giving rise to a fall in crime?  Does the Minister believe that changing a name provides a solution?  Why is this Bill so bereft of vision?  Why do we have pages of plagiarism, restatement and re-enactment?  It is no substitute for a policy and this Government is clearly bereft of a policy on young offenders.</P>

      <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are equally bereft of innovation.  The sooner the Minister vacates her office the better. The Department of Justice is in need of a renaissance. It has spent two long years in the Dark Ages, plagued and paralysed by indecision, a fact now recognised by the electorate as amply demonstrated recently by <i>The Irish Times/</i> MRBI poll.</P>

      <P>True to form, this Bill does not tackle juvenile crime in any meaningful way. For example, juvenile males contribute to crime figures at a highly excessive rate relative to their numbers in the population, but this problem is not addressed at all.  While I accept there is no single answer to why young boys turn to crime, there are many theories well known to the Government which might have evoked a legislative response.  The paucity of the Government's response in this respect is due to the priority it attaches to form over substance.  Since the problem of juvenile crime goes to the very root of and is the spawning ground for crime, one might have expected a Green or White Paper on the problem from the Government.  That this did not happen does not obviate the need for an in-depth look at the causes of juvenile crime in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an established fact that young boys need a role model.  If this figure is absent or inadequate, the young boy looks next to his peer group and, if that group is comprised of similar rootless young people, the first step to petty crime is all too easy to take.  These young people quickly learn to ape others whom they see flouting the law with impunity, getting a buzz from their activities and <Col N="1365" /> ending up materially better off.  They can also see that the justice system, because of its enormous flaws, simply does not work.  They become unafraid of the Garda and of judges because they understand the reality of the situation.  These young people are easy prey for the experienced hard man in the community who can steadily and insidiously embroil them in serious crimes and very often drug related offences.</P>
    <P>The reasons for youthful crime are environmental, educational and social.  Approximately 90 per cent of prisoners left school before 16 years of age.  That statistic not only indicates the lack of formal education but also the underlying environment and social background.  Recent research seem to suggest that many young offenders simply cannot comprehend or relate to the results of their crimes and that there is some inherent psychological breakdown, whether through nature or nurture, which prevents them from understanding or caring about the injuries and sufferings which they inflict on others.  Leaving aside the jargon, young people must be made responsible.</P>
    <P>The obvious and primary forum for young people to learn social responsibility is in the family. In a recent article in &ldquo;The Spectator&rdquo;, Paul Johnson referred to the current resurgence in popularity &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In his view, part of the reason for that popularity is the fact that Jane Austen makes the family appear important and central to the tragic comedy of life, but also comforting and secure.  He referred to the stability and power of the family and, to underline his point about the Labour Party in the UK stealing the thunder of the Conservatives in their promotion of family values, he said a country should be seen as an aggregation of families and not a collection of social classes.  It appears the Labour Party here is far more interested in digging up stories, whether true or untrue, about politicians and spreading them around like a muckspreader on Irish society.  Such politicians have no place in this House.</P>

      <P>The traditional family in western society comprised a mother, father and the children they produced together.  In today's society the family might comprise many types of units.  It might be composed of a single parent and children or a man and a woman, either or both of whom were previously married to a third party, together with children who might be products of each of the previous relationships together with children of the current relationship.</P>
      <P>The composition of the family unit is not largely relevant.  What is important is the responsibility of the parent, parents or those <i>in loco parentis</i>.  They must be forced to accept responsibility for the care, nurture and well-being of the children in their care.  It is true that dysfunctional family units, particularly those where there is a history of alcohol abuse, drug abuse, criminal records and physical and sexual abuse, produce more juvenile offenders than others.  All families, whether they can be described as dysfunctional or otherwise, must be targeted.  Simply removing the young person and trying to find a place for him in one of our few and utterly overstretched places of detention for a short time is not an answer in the long-term.  The parent of each child in the State must be forced to realise that his or her role in relation to the child does not end at its birth, but continues until the child reaches adulthood.</P>
      <P>Rights and responsibilities are two sides of the same coin.  No parent should be allowed to easily abdicate responsibility for his or her children. Juvenile crime must be tackled radically, at its roots.  No baby, regardless of the surroundings into which he is born, should be born to an inevitable life of crime and violence.  Educational and social programmes, no matter how intensive or comprehensive, can only have an effect if a child's background is secure and supportive.</P>
      <P>In certain strata of society at present detention is seen by young people as the social alternative to high points in the leaving certificate.  The offender has acquired a certain social cachet.  In real terms, because of the appalling lack of detention places and overcrowding, the offender is likely to be released within a ridiculously short time.  If the offender is a drug addict, prison is seen as a place where there is a steady supply of drugs in a controlled environment.  In either event, the present prison system is not effective as a deterrent and is greatly diminished as a means of retribution.  The necessity for more secure and drug free places of detention is overwhelming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternative forms of sentencing must also be explored.  Community service should be expanded but must have increased funding to ensure each sentence is closely monitored and that there are sufficient meaningful projects and programmes.  We strongly recommended the concept of curfew from the outset, not just for juvenile <Col N="1367" /> offenders but also for adult offenders on bail. A combination of increased community service and the curfew provided for in the legislation would have several benefits.  It would keep the young offender out of prison, thus reducing overcrowding. The work might sow the seeds of community and civic spirit in the young person.  The community would benefit from the practical work done, while the family's responsibility would be emphasised, particularly if the parents or guardians are to be penalised together with the young person for a breach of curfew.</P>
    <P>Community service must be appropriate in terms of location, duration and worth to the community. There is a fine distinction between the correctly punitive and perhaps humiliating aspect of such service and the objective of instilling in the offender a sense of rehabilitation.  Liaison with community centres should be encouraged. Community workers complain constantly and bitterly about the lack of Government funding for community centres where young people are encouraged to keep active and occupied, and thus avoid becoming involved in criminal activities. Their efforts to have some of the national lottery moneys allocated to them have so far failed.</P>
    <P>Drug related crime committed by juveniles must be considered separately.  There are three main types of drug related crime &mdash; possession, crimes committed to feed a habit and crimes committed while under the influence of narcotic substances. Increased powers must be given to courts of summary jurisdiction to deal with such charges as expeditiously as possible.  There must be increased funding for drug treatment programmes for juveniles as a matter of urgency. Young offenders might be given a choice of detention for the full statutory period or a reduced sentence with attendance at detoxification and treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>Education has always been the key to liberation, whether it be liberation from poverty, ignorance, political servitude or social restraint. In modern Ireland, the emphasis is more and more on the individual, and there are enormous changes of influence in education.  Young people are, quite properly, educated to have high expectations. In financially comfortable families young people are given the means to achieve their expectations, either through financial support or through formal education.  In not so well off families, if the interest and motivation of the parents or guardians are present and positive, youngsters are given the means by encouragement towards formal education or a trade or training.  In either case, the children are provided with the means of achieving their goals.</P>
    <P>In dysfunctional or disadvantaged families, the young person is often educated, not just or not even by parents or guardians but by the media, cinema, videos and peers, to expect and want material gain.  However, he is not given the direction and mindset to achieve his aims by legitimate methods.  Society, in the guise of social welfare, <Col N="1368" /> charities, social workers and caring and well meaning community groups, may, by simply giving material assistance alone, be serving to reinforce the child's expectations, without providing and instilling in the young person the belief that he can and must do something himself to improve his life.</P>
    <P>Young people should be taught that most people in a healthy society do not get, and do not expect to get, something for nothing.  One does the young person no favour if one does not instil in him a sense of his own worth, his ability to contribute and his ability to learn from his contribution to society.  If a young person is educated to expect to receive all the time as a fundamental right, is it any wonder that when he wants more of anything he looks to the nearest soft target?  If there is the slightest resistance he uses unreasonable force because he has been conditioned to think it is right to take what he wants.  At the slightest sign of denial he reacts violently.</P>
    <P>In the musical &ldquo;West Side Story&rdquo; there is an amusing song and dance routine in which the youngsters make great play of being juvenile delinquents from severely dysfunctional backgrounds; <i>ergo,</i> how can they be expected to be anything other than criminal?  Society today might still be educating young people along those lines.  Give a young person a tag, whether it be &ldquo;deprived background&rdquo; or &ldquo;history of drug abuse&rdquo; or &ldquo;alcohol abuse in the family&rdquo;, draw a line under the definition and educate him henceforth as not being expected to give but only to take, and his education is most assuredly not a stepping stone to a crime free life.</P>
    <P>Dr. Art O'Connor, the forensic psychiatrist in the Central Mental Hospital, who appears to speak considerable sense in measured tones, talks about the cult of the individual.  This is exemplified in the area of juvenile crime.  If a young person has no idea of his role in society, he will think only of himself.  If he is thwarted in any way, he lashes out at his victim showing how he is utterly insensitive to the effect of his actions on others.  He does not appreciate that his actions impact on others.</P>
    <P>In its instinct for survival a small infant is at first entirely solipsistic.  He gradually begins to become aware that other people's actions affect him.  In other words, his comfort and well-being depend on the actions of other people.  The next stage in a healthy development is when the child begins to learn that his actions can affect others. For some reason, this normal development pattern does not appear to progress in the juvenile criminal.  The changes in the scale of crime are evidence enough for this argument.  One rarely hears of burglars who, when disturbed, make good their escape as quickly as possible.  Burglars now all too frequently involve the householders immediately and subject them to extremes of violence, simply, it appears, for kicks.  Why do they find such brutality enjoyable?  Why should the criminal not bear responsibility for his crime? <Col N="1369" /> Why should we always look for excuses for the criminal?</P>
    <P>One of the first duties of society should be to educate the criminal to face up to the consequences of crime.  There should be very little in the way of excuses.  The criminal must be told, &ldquo;this is your doing, you may come from a deprived background, you may have suffered brutality, but they are not excuses for the suffering of your victim&rdquo;.  In other jurisdictions such as New Zealand confrontation between the criminal and the victim, particularly the young criminal and his victim, has proved effective both by giving the victim the reassurance that he has some involvement in the treatment of his attacker and by encouraging the criminal to appreciate the consequences and seriousness of his crime.  That is why we have constantly argued for family conferences and the need for the juvenile offender to meet his victim face to face.  We welcome the inclusion of that provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, commissioned a five year policy plan by the Department of Justice on the management of young offenders.  Among the many excellent objectives of the prison education service, we need to establish the appetite and capacity for further education after release and to develop a prison education service based on the principles of the Council of Europe Report 1990, in particular by adopting an adult education approach and by encouraging interaction between offenders and the community.</P>
    <P>If one excludes Mountjoy Prison, more than 60 per cent of all offenders are involved in prison education, but in many of the prisons, because of limited accommodation, the number of classes is very restricted.  In theory the prison education curriculum in this State is very wide, based on the holistic concept that the greater the range of opportunities on offer the greater the chance of a prisoner finding some form of education suited to his needs.  Sadly, because of our extremely over-stretched prison accommodation, the actuality does not reflect the theory.  Mountjoy prison has very limited educational accommodation. Unfortunately the majority of prisoners in Mountjoy receive their education from their peers, as is all too well documented.  It is not outside the bounds of possibility that a drug free offender who enters Mountjoy to serve a sentence may leave the prison a drug addict.  The potential for litigation in that area is alarming.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice is serious in her efforts to improve the prison service, priority should be given to the provision of more space for educational purposes.  The formal education system can be benefit only if young people are given the opportunity to avail of it and this opportunity need not depend solely on the financial means of parents or guardians.  Motivation in many cases equals means.  Many teachers experience the frustration of seeing their educational endeavour consistently undermined by a child's alternative educational forum, that is, the home, <Col N="1370" /> the child's peers, the bombardment by all forms of media and society at large.</P>
    <P>The relevance and importance of education is breathtakingly apparent, from the formal exam structured curriculum to extra curricular activities to the involvement of specialists in areas such as drug dependency and alcoholism.  The message of educational programmes, however, no matter how excellent, is diluted if the child's family is not supportive and is constantly eroding the effects of the educational programme by giving out negative and contradictory signals.  The home-school liaison programme established by the deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy O'Rourke, is very important and should be encouraged and expanded.  The appropriate involvement of the entire family is vital.  A hunger for knowledge is innate.  If encouraged and fed it can be a life long and positive influence, if stunted and warped it can become a negative and destructive force.</P>
    <P>Clearly the efficacy of any legislation is dependent upon adequate funding being made available. The fact that the Bill is sadly lacking in vision and innovation does not mean it can operate without adequate resources.  For example, adequately trained and supported probation and welfare officers will require funding.  Children court judges should be specially trained and there should be special collaboration with the prospective Judicial Studies Board.  The proposed unified children court will deal with child care matters and children who have committed crimes, but different legal principles are at the root of children and civil law and children and criminal law. In the former case, an inquisitorial, best interests approach must be taken, but in the latter case the Constitution requires the protection of adversarial proof.  The ramifications of this essential difference have not been dealt with in the Bill and that should be made explicit.  There must be specific funds for independent research into what steps are efficient and effective and how the children court orders operate, with the detention facilities and the diversion programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said that I should address my comments to him, that he is responsible for this Bill.  I acknowledge his considerable interest in and work on children legislation. Nonetheless, even though the Minister of State presented the Bill, which has deficiencies, the Minister for Justice is responsible for it.  She decided that Fianna Fáil's Pornography Bill, 1996, should be plagiarised by the Government and she made the running in the media in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Government to plagiarise Fianna Fáil child pornography legislation will come as no surprise to those who have been following the criminal justice record of the Government over the past two years.  Bereft of any philosophy, ideology or definite direction of its own, the Government has consistently copied Fianna Fáil legislation and tried to present it as its own. For example, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice are tripping over each other <Col N="1371" /> in a bid to claim credit for the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, Fianna Fáil legislation which they actually accepted.  The Government also had little choice but to accept the Fianna Fáil Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction).  Bill, 1996, which provides that a person can be tried in this jurisdiction for a paedophile offence committed abroad.  The essential provisions of our Sexual Offences (No. 2) Bill, 1995, were lifted by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad, to provide that the details of evidence in incest cases could again be reported. The Drug Trafficking Act, 1996, is a poorly watered down version of Part 1 of Fianna Fáil's Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1996.  The bail referendum was largely copied from Fianna Fáil's Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>Media reports and documentation published with the referendum wording clearly indicate that the new bail legislation, following the referendum, will be lifted lock, stock and barrel from our Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995.  The Government is playing the same game with our Child Pornography Bill as it played with our Misuse of Drugs Bill.  It is important that the public should know just how devious this Administration is when it comes to covering the dearth of its intellectual capacity.  It accepted Fianna Fáil's Child Pornography Bill in the Dáil on Second Stage and then sent it to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security where it, and any worthwhile amendments, were supposed to be debated. Before the matter could be considered by the committee, the Government did exactly what it did with the Misuse of Drugs Bill, it plagiarised it and made a few amendments and, by encompassing it in this legislation, is now presenting it to the media as its own.  This kind of legislative hijacking undermines parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The members of the Government involved in this surreptitious game would do well to remember that, while can plagiarise our work, steal our ideas, and engage in barefaced lies, nobody is fooled by the shallow depth of their innovation and vision.  Everybody knows that they are legislative parasites.</P>
    <P>The Minister has plagiarised some of our solutions &mdash; I have suggested others in this debate which she is welcome to take on board because it is clear she does not have a solution.  The efforts of the Minister for Justice to engage in a class of legislative ticker tape prior to the election by introducing unfinished and ill-considered Bills do her no credit.  I have spoken in the past of the inadequacy of measures introduced by the Minister. Fine Gael is a party which once espoused a commitment to law and order and introducing legislation necessary for law and order, but the Minister has ended that tradition.  She commenced her tenure at the Department of Justice by presiding over the greatest legislative drought ever witnessed in this country.  When Government unease with her inaction grew she responded by introducing threadbare and inadequate <Col N="1372" /> Bills and this is such a Bill.  It firmly establishes the tenure of the Minister as the era of the photocopier in the Department of Justice.  There is much work to be done and we need a Government prepared to do it.</P>

I wish, however, it could have been presented to a new Dáil because it is the type of Bill on which we could spend much time in committee deliberating its practicalities and minutiae.  It is an enormous Bill, the contents of which represent not only the work of the Minister of State &mdash; which I acknowledge &mdash; but of a previous Government, of which I was not a member, which did much of the preparatory work.  On reading the report on juvenile crime produced by a previous select committee in 1992, it is obvious that people who are no longer Members of this House put an enormous amount of hard work into studying juvenile crime, its causes and cures.  Deputy Quill, a member of my party, chaired that committee.  I give credit to some of those who are no longer Members of this House for the work they did because much of the preparatory work was done during that Dáil.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the Minister said, is more a legislative framework rather than a new system of criminal justice for juveniles.  The Child Care Act, 1991, took a long time to implement. The proof of this legislation will be in its enforcement over the years.  It will be implemented on a phased basis and will probably be the responsibility of the next Government, whether that will be the present Administration in a new form.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we have a considered debate on this Bill, devoid of party politics.  It is one which will bring us into the next century and hopefully will put a coherent long-term strategy in place to deal with our juvenile justice problems. The profile of our criminals is pathetically predictable &mdash; it is mainly disadvantaged young males.  Comprehensive legislation to reflect that reality is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the measures in this Bill although there is much work to be done on Committee Stage.  I welcome raising the age of criminal responsibility although I do not see the reason it could not have been raised to 12 years.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, numerical age is a crude instrument by which to judge the capacity for criminal behaviour.  Those of us who are parents realise the difference between boys and girls in the different stages of maturity.  Boys are much slower to develop emotionally than girls.  Any analysis of the psychological make-up of juvenile criminals clearly shows they have low IQ and low emotional maturity.  It is crude to draw a line at ten or 12 years.  The concept of <i>doli incapax</i> is the <Col N="1373" /> key to this legislation and its enforcement.  That can be discussed further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill is inclusive in so many ways, it skirts around the issue of drugs and their impact on crime.  It is a big area and perhaps we will have an opportunity to discuss it on Committee Stage. The Henchy Committee did not deal with the issue of drugs when it looked at the possible reform of the law of insanity and the area of diminished responsibility.  In this Bill, we need to look strategically at the strong influence of drug addiction on young people and their responsibility for criminal acts.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Bill is good in that it seeks to make critical interventions to steer people away from the mainstream criminal justice system.  One of the criticisms levelled at those of us who are tough on crime is that we do not take the long view and do not look at the root causes of crime. Effective law and order does not need to be postponed while we examine the root causes of crime. The two endeavours are not mutually exclusive. It is appropriate that in Private Members' time we are discussing reform of the prison and penal system and making it effective to deal with hardened criminals.  At the same time we are taking the long view and looking at the causes of criminality and ways in which we can critically intervene with young people and their parents to steer them away from crime.</P>
    <P>An effective juvenile justice system ideally embraces crime prevention strategies, early intervention with young offenders and diversion away from crime.  The Minister said non-statutory measures are just as important as the legislative measures we are debating.  The importance of sport has been hugely undervalued and understi-mated as a way of keeping children out of trouble.  Communities which have sporting facilities and community leaders are fortunate because children are motivated, occupied and acquire self-esteem from being involved in team sports.  Communities which lack those social skills and leadership need State intervention.  Non-statutory measures and the role of sport are important and should be helped, as far as possible, by the State.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has included, as he promised, measures to reinforce the existing law which provides that it is an offence to allow or procure a child to beg.  It is a scandal to see children begging on our streets on a daily basis.  It might appear to be a small thing but it is an aspect of our law which has been avoided and not enforced.  People cannot understand how it is allowed to continue without State intervention. No one has an ethnic right to allow a child to beg. It is a terrible form of child abuse and is against the law.  For many years that law has not been enforced.  I am glad to see the Minister has restated the law.  It is against the law to allow a child to beg with the parent's knowledge or to cause or procure a child to beg.  The burden of proof has shifted and it now rests with the parents to prove that they did not know the child was begging.  Hopefully, this law will be enforced.  It <Col N="1374" /> is demeaning, when walking around Dublin, to see children begging on the streets.</P>
    <P>There is much in this Bill about parents and I am glad that they are included.  Parenting is becoming more difficult.  It is a pathetic fact that most deviant adolescents come from dysfunctional family backgrounds.  The Bill dovetails well with the Child Care Act, 1991, and that is why it is so long and complex.  It comprehensively restates current law and puts existing procedures on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the juvenile diversion programme has been put on a statutory basis.  I had some concerns about the programme, which is widely used.  It has to be remembered that the law is generally loathe to put juveniles into detention or send them to jail.  That is as it should be.  I understand from replies to parliamentary questions that in the three year period 1992-4, 22,963 cautions were issued under the programme to juveniles who had committed crimes such as larceny, joyriding, burglary, offences against the person as well as sexual offences.  They were given a second chance.  This is an appropriate intervention which helps to steer young people away from the mainstream criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I had concerns about the programme under which the State waives a criminal prosecution, and considered that it needed to be tightened. For the programme to operate the juvenile offender must confess to the offence and be under 18 years of age.  In such circumstances there is a need to reassure victims that there is proper supervision.  I had cause for concern that this was not happening in certain cases, particularly in cases involving sexual offences.  A constituent of mine was concerned that a young man who had confessed to a serious sexual offence was walking around as if nothing had happened.  Her parents wanted to know if he was being supervised and if he could obtain work in a youth club. They had made a tremendous sacrifice in agreeing to waive a criminal prosecution to allow him participate in the programme.  It is important that our desire to show compassion and support for the programme should not be taken as a licence for continued misbehaviour.  There is a need for guarantees on this point.</P>
    <P>In 1985 the Whitaker report noted that it was rare for an adult who had not committed an offence before his seventeenth birthday to engage in crime.  The vast majority of crimes are committed by male juveniles.  It is especially important, therefore, that we attempt to rehabilitate young offenders.  It is clear that the law is antiquated and needs to be updated.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in raising the age of criminal responsibility to 12 is that it may encourage adult criminals to use children below that age to commit crimes.  There is evidence that children below the current age of responsibility are used by adult criminals to carry drugs.  It is likely this practice will continue but that is not sufficient reason to prevent the age of criminal responsibility from being raised.  We should, perhaps, <Col N="1375" /> create a new offence relating to the use of children below the age of criminal responsibility to commit crimes.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Federation suggests that emphasis should be placed on the age at which it is appropriate to bring children into the criminal justice system rather than on the concept of responsibility for criminal actions.  This is a difficult area as the debate in England about imputing responsibility to the killers of Jamie Bulger demonstrated. Because of this it is important that the principle is set by the Oireachtas rather than by Ministers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the new Children Court and the laying down of the terms and conditions under which children can be held in Garda stations.  It is good that judges will be appointed to the Children Court for periods of at least six months and will have the right to visit the new detention centres which are to replace the industrial and reform schools.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out in detail the principles and powers of the courts when dealing with children. The introduction of a wide range of sanctions and community orders restricting people's movement should be welcomed.  Until now the courts have, to a large extent, been obliged to devise alternatives to custodial sentences.  We have seen from court reports the imaginative things judges have tried to do to avoid imposing a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>Questions about the constitutionality of restricting the movements of children have been raised.  If it is acceptable to deprive a child of his or her liberty, it is also acceptable to take the less drastic step of restricting his or her movements. One could argue that the laws requiring the attendance of children at school during certain hours place a restriction on their movements.  It is good that the rights and freedoms of children are acknowledged in the Bill.  They will have the right to participate in any proceedings which affect them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the replacement of the old reformatory schools with detention schools, for children under the age of 16, to be run by the Department of Education.  I understand the allocation of responsibility between the various Departments involved caused the delay.  I hope the compromise will be workable.</P>
    <P>The principal objective is to promote the reintegration of children into society and prepare them to take their places in the community as persons who shall be capable of undertaking a positive and productive role in society and will observe the law.  The success of these schools in achieving that object will ultimately depend on the quality of personnel and adequacy of resources available to them.  We will have to look at the special qualifications that will be needed.</P>
    <P>Detention is to be used only as a last resort, when all of the other critical interventions have failed.  As the Minister said, by the time children reach that point they will probably have <Col N="1376" /> developed psychiatric and psychological problems. It will be difficult, therefore, to achieve success in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 138 provides that the Minister may, with the agreement of its owners, designate any place to be a children detention school.  This is an acknowledgement that the voluntary and private sectors have a role to play in this area of the criminal justice system, as they do in many other areas.</P>
    <P>The initial decision as to which detention school a child should be sent rests with the court, although there is a provision which allows the board to subsequently transfer the child from one school to another.  It is suggested that the board should have a role at the court hearing to decide which school is appropriate having regard to such factors as the needs of the individual child.  The board would be better placed to decide than the judge.  It will be important to keep children apart from the bad influences which may have contributed to their being sent before the court in the first place.</P>
    <P>The National Youth Federation suggests that St. Patrick's Institution is not an appropriate place for a detention school on the grounds that it operates in all but name as an adult prison offering minimal education or rehabilitative opportunities.</P>
    <P>Section 90 permits a court, which is satisfied as to the guilt of a child, to order that the parent or guardian of the child pay compensation.  That is a welcome measure.  I understand that the foster care association has raised a reasonable concern that the foster parent could be the subject of a compensation order.  Given that many foster children are placed with foster parents because of their troubled history, it is unfair that they might be punished in this way.  The concerns of the foster care association in that regard should be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of other useful provisions, such as the creation of an expressed statutory obligation to ensure reasonable care for the safety of children at entertainment events.  This substantial Bill is long overdue and its introduction is welcome.  It is probably one of the most important Bills we will debate in this House.  I would prefer if we were debating it at the beginning of a Dáil rather than in the dying days of this one.  It requires a detailed Committee Stage debate and Members to concentrate fully on the task in hand.  Being charged with putting this Bill through the House is a major responsibility.  I congratulate the Minister on publishing and introducing the Bill before the end of this Dáil.  It would be preferable if we had a longer time and more relaxed Deputies to ponder the difficult issues that will arise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The problem of homeless children, confined mainly to the Eastern Health Board area, does not appear to be highlighted in the Bill.  I raised my concerns about this problem with the Minister on a number of occasions.  In 1993, the most recent year for which figures on homelessness are <Col N="1377" /> available from the Eastern Health Board, 427 children were homeless, 42 per cent of whom had been formerly in care.  There is something wrong with a care system that turns out homeless children. An increasing number of homeless children are visible on the streets of Dublin which diminishes all who see them.  We need an assurance that this Bill protects those children.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the charitable agencies and voluntary workers who work with homeless children that it takes a very short time for a child who has just become homeless to become immersed in that street culture that can encompass crime, drugs, sexual exploitation and, in some cases, prostitution.  This is a major current child care problem visible on the streets of Dublin.  I am worried that the problem is being treated like that of children begging, that the authorities are turning a blind eye to it and that there is minimal intervention.  Very few outreach workers from Focus Point and other agencies, like CROSS-CARE, work with those children.  The Minister should take a particular interest in them as this problem is not getting the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>An interesting empirical study of 100 persons who came into St. Michael's assessment centre in Dublin was prepared by Dr. Noel O Gorman and Dr. Jim Barnes.  All those assessed were Dubliners under the age of 16 who had committed various offences ranging from school truancy to sexual offences.  I am glad the Minister mentioned the important truancy Bill that will dovetail this Bill, as truancy represents a reliable early detection and warning signal of future deviance and delinquency.  It is important that legislation should be put in place.</P>
    <P>The psychological findings of the 100 boys who were in deep trouble and sent to St. Michael's assessment unit are interesting, 94 per cent of those surveyed had a below average IQ while 62 per cent had a dull-normal IQ.  A quarter of the boys were illiterate and 86 per cent of the boys were four years behind in their numeracy.  They had self-destructive behaviour and suffered from alcohol abuse, drug abuse and self-abuse.  They were aggressive and disruptive.  They were typically emotionally immature, dependent on their peers for self-esteem, lacked initiative and had few life goals.  They were unreliable, impulsive and easily frustrated.  They showed a lack of guilt or remorse for their behaviour and its consequences for those around them.  Most were followers not leaders.  The boys who committed solitary offences showed more evidence of serious emotional disturbance.  All had low self-esteem and poor relations with others.  That type of empirical evidence is very useful and it highlights the problems with which we are dealing and the difficulties in drawing an age line in regard to criminal responsibility, particularly given that 94 per cent of the boys sentenced to detention were four years behind in their numeracy.  It is difficult to impute criminal responsibility to those boys and yet, in terms of public order, there must be some intervention by the State.  That is the purpose <Col N="1378" /> of this Bill.  I look forward to Committee Stage and I wish we had more time, given electoral and other circumstances, to deal with the Bill comprehensively.</P>

      <P>I was amused, as I often am, to hear Deputy O'Donoghue refer to Orwellian overtones in the Bill.  In some respects the Deputy is almost an Orwellian or a Kafkaesque character.  He has been a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party for seven years during which time this legislation on juveniles was urgently required, yet it has not come before the House until today.  It is extraordinary that the memory of that Opposition spokesperson is so short.  He also adopts a sanctimonious air when he addresses the Government parties.  As the last Deputy said, it is appalling we have had to wait so many years for this urgent legislation to come before the House.  The House has been incredibly lethargic in dealing with Dublin or urban issues; it has put those issues on the back burner when urgent responses were necessary.</P>
      <P>There is an assumption in the Minister's speech that much juvenile crime is petty, but much of the juvenile crime in my constituency on the north side is serious.  It is a serious phenomenon with which the Deputy opposite, who shares a Dublin Corporation ward with me, will be familiar.  Various households can suffer grotesque intimidation, harassment and be subjected almost to a siege.  They can be at their wits' end trying to cope with attacks on their houses, their children and constant unrelentless hassle often from eight, ten or 12 year olds, a significant proportion of whom are out of school and out of control.  About five years ago one of our Dublin City officials, Mr. Michael Kelly, produced a major report on the problem of harassment and intimidation in deprived Dublin estates, and five years on we have done little action to try to come to grips with the problem.  In recent weeks there has been a renewed upsurge in joyriding in some northside estates.  In addition there has been the grotesque and appalling problem of drug pushing and drug abuse.  In that context this legislation should have been presented by the last Dáil or earlier.  Teasing it out into the term of another Dáil is nonsense.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has put some emphasis on the role of parents and on parents taking responsibility because clearly many parents have been grossly irresponsible over the years.  I welcome also the Minister's emphasis on victims, the provision for victims to attend the proposed conferences, to be represented in court and to have a role in framing the punishment or rehabilitation of the juveniles who caused them such distress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many of the agencies have striven hard, <Col N="1379" /> there has been a total lack of resources very often in those areas where there is the most critical need.  I applaud the efforts of the Garda Síochána, under the new Commissioner Byrne and Assistant Commissioner King, to extend the concept of community policing throughout northside and Dublin Central estates, but there is still a great lack of Garda resources.  In my constituency there are about 200 gardaí to police approximately 80,000 people, and Dublin, with 70 per cent of crime, still receives less than 40 per cent of Garda resources.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that we still have not brought the school attendance Bill before the House because clearly the first step on the road for many juveniles who get involved in crime is running away from school or staying out of school, possibly from the age of eight or nine upwards.  That is the situation in my constituency.  At an important and well attended conference on drugs, organised by Dublin Corporation, in Dublin Castle at the weekend the point was repeatedly made by social workers in Dublin City that there was a huge responsibility on schools and vocational education committees to ensure that students were not expelled and left to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>There has also been a very lethargic response from health boards to the need for treatment facilities, in particular on Dublin's north side where the drug menace is at its height.  I am glad that at last the new administration in that area, under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Shortall, is adopting a much more proactive approach.  The same could be said of Dublin Corporation in relation to estate management.  It is only now that it has begun to get to grips with that.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a final point on the background to this Bill to which Deputy O'Donnell also referred.  My party's policy is to be tough on crime and on the causes of crime.  Being tough on the causes of crime means diverting resources to sporting and youth facilities, and to the deprived areas of the north side of Dublin.  Those areas received very little help over the years from the national lottery.  It is only during recent years, under the rainbow Coalition, that a Government has had the guts to vote resources to voluntary workers who give so easily of their time.  In those areas where juvenile crime has become such a major problem there has been an appalling lack of a sense of community.  Deputy O'Donoghue, cited another of his bizarre heroes, Mr. Paul Johnson, on the restoration of community and attacking the British Labour Party, but it was Mr. Johnson's other hero, Mrs. Margaret Thatcher, who devastated the English community and wrecked community spirit.  I hope Fianna Fáil will not go down that PD road and try to destroy what little sense of community spirit there is left in many of the more deprived areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concept of getting young criminals to accept responsibility for their actions under the diversion programme, the development <Col N="1380" /> of the role of the juvenile liaison officer and the family conference concept.  Gardaí have done a splendid job in those areas over the years, certainly in the Coolock and Kilbarrack districts and elsewhere in my constituency, and they are to be commended.  It is heartening that a legislative framework is being put in place to deal with this. The key recommendations in the JLO report should form the basis of it.  The development of the policy under the new legislation will depend on enhanced resources for Garda training and I hope the Minister will provide them.</P>
    <P>I note the safeguards which have been included in the Bill in regard to the interviewing of children in Garda stations, and the development of the new children's court.  The range of new community sanctions is an innovative and important development.  I welcome also the concept of compensation. Young people readily understand the idea that where an injury or damage is done they can be expected to repair the damage.  I welcome the new development of intensive supervision and other orders.</P>
    <P>The restriction on movement under section 12 is also an interesting development.  Parliamentarians across the water have had long discussions on the concept of curfews for young people in certain areas.  Given that there are very few ring-leaders the provision in section 112 could be important.</P>
    <P>Children's detention schools are dealt with under section 136 and it is crucial that we devote adequate resources to them.  We have established a system of children's detention centres without examining adequately the kind of resources and qualifications the staff of those schools should have &mdash; the Minister will recall our discussion on this at the Committee of Public Accounts.  It will be incumbent on the Minister for Education to ensure that the highest standards are adhered to in the recruitment of staff and the administration of those schools and centres.  I note also the general proposals for voluntary aftercare systems which will also be very important.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive Bill is long overdue.  It is good that it is at last before the House.  I look forward to its passage through the House and the setting in train, at last, of a system of modern justice for children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill.  It is almost 90 years since the 1908 Act was passed. That is a very long time when we are dealing with issues relating to children.  That Act is outdated. Its provision on the age of criminal responsibility is an obvious example of how outdated it is.  It is illogical and ludicrous that the age of criminal responsibility should be set and maintained at seven years, the age at which children in the Catholic tradition are supposed to have reached the use of reason and make their first confession. I am very pleased that the new age of criminal responsibility is set at ten with a phasing to 12, and that there is a rebuttable presumption of <i>doli incapax</i> to the age of 14, that is, that a person is <Col N="1381" /> not capable of committing an offence up to the age of 14.  That is the type of flexible approach we need in relation to criminal responsibility.</P>
      <P>Until recently, if a child was unruly he or she could be imprisoned and, in the past decade children of 13, 14 and 15 years were imprisoned in Mountjoy adult prison.  With the enactment of this Bill the horrors of child imprisonment and of the old industrial schools, for which the 1908 Act made provision, will be brought to an end.</P>
      <P>The diversion programme, which replaces the JLO system, will effectively, be put on a statutory basis.  The proposal to divert children who have accepted responsibility for their offences is welcome and underpins this important development.  The concept of the family conference involving the family and victim participation in the discussion process to determine what is the most appropriate way the child can be dealt with in terms of community involvement and kept away from crime is welcome. Also welcome is the obligation on parents or guardians to attend all stages of court proceedings when their child's case is before the children court as is holding parents legally responsible for exercising proper and adequate control over their children and making provision for parents as well as children to be subject to fines.</P>
      <P>These measures &mdash; diversion programmes on a statutory basis; the family conference, a unique concept virtually unheard of anywhere in the world in terms of its overall holistic approach, and the provision for parental responsibility &mdash; will revolutionise juvenile justice.</P>
      <P>We must remember that we cannot legislate for the context, ethos and underlying problems which so often give rise to juvenile wrongdoing.  Some of the young in our disadvantaged communities have turned to drug abuse which quickly leads to crimes such as larceny and assault.  This often results from the fact that they have had very little opportunity and hope in their lives.  We must focus our attention on eliminating the nightmare blackspots of unemployment in our urban centres.  I welcome the provision of a new local employment service in the Ballyfermot area because I consider it to be the most efficient way of bringing people into employment.</P>
      <P>We must make provision to remove licences from the proprietors of dance halls, discos and public houses where they regularly allow ecstasy and other drugs to be sold on their premises. They must be made responsible for the harm they do in allowing crime to be perpetrated on their premises.  That would be an effective deterrent in the case of discos and public houses where drugs are widely sold to young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must show our determination to eradicate the evil of heroin abuse which is the scourge of the youth in Dublin's blackspots.  We should ensure all the ill gotten gains of drug barons seized and confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau are channelled into the fight against drugs.  We should retain Jessbrook, the equestrian centre confiscated from John Gilligan, the self <Col N="1382" /> confessed prime suspect in the Veronica Guerin murder in the possession of the State, as either an equine centre for the socially disadvantaged or the disabled.  Alternatively it should become a treatment centres for heroin addicts or people who have suffered as a result of the drugs crisis.</P>
    <P>I am delighted no child shall ever be sentenced to imprisonment under this Bill.  It is nice to see that Loughan House will not be reopened because there is a statutory prohibition to that effect.  I am delighted District Court judges will visit child detention centres.  It is essential that those who mete out the sentences will see the conditions under which penalties are served.  I am also pleased that where there is a question of cruelty or neglect of children, with particular reference to begging, the finger is pointed at parents. It is important that parental responsibility is emphasised.  I am glad too that an amendment on the possession of pornography will be introduced.</P>
    <P>That detention is seen as a last resort is very welcome.  Combining the other interim provisions &mdash; day centre orders, intensive supervision, restriction of movement &mdash; is the way to proceed with young people who come before the courts. The most desirable development is the family conference and the equivalent of the JLO scheme.  Where responsibility is admitted, one diverts young people away from crime.  We must ensure detention really is the last resort because it seems so often to lead to a worsening of the situation rather than an improvement.</P>
    <P>The School Attendance Bill is being processed and will be before us shortly.  It is an important part of the combination of measures dealing with juvenile justice and problems relating to children. I look forward to its presentation and passage in this Dáil.</P>
    <P>We must ensure all professionals involved in child care operate in a co-ordinated fashion.  For too long that has been a problem, whether in education, health or justice.  Youngsters have fallen between two stools and have not got the attention and support they require.  We must ensure all our resources are targeted to support, protect and care for children because they are the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a children's Bill has been brought forward before the Dáil.  That the last legislation dealing with these issues was passed in 1908 and this Bill has been 20 years in the making demonstrates the apathy in regard to juvenile crime and young people in general.  That apathy should be acknowledged.</P>
      <P>It is a lengthy Bill with 220 sections.  It largely restates existing law, consolidates legislation and puts on a statutory basis many of the voluntary schemes.  That is welcome but the innovative parts of the Bill need to be looked at carefully and if any further innovations are necessary, they can be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt this is a difficult and complex issue.  Many interested parties will have views on every section and it will take a great deal of work to tease out its various provisions.  I hope the Bill <Col N="1383" /> reaches Committee Stage.  I re-echo the sentiments of Deputy O'Donnell.  This is an election year and it would be a shame if this Bill were to collapse because of that or if the remaining Stages had to be rushed.  I hope the Bill gets the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt juvenile crime is a major concern in society.  One only has to look at incidents of joyriding, vandalism, muggings, handbag snatching, slashing tyres and even cruelty to animals, an everyday occurrence in urban centres, particularly Dublin.  As a public representative from the north side of Dublin, I receive many representations about gangs of youths in lane ways or on greens having cider parties, drinking, playing ghetto-blasters loudly, being rude and abusive and indulging in antisocial behaviour. This is a major issue in this city and demonstrates the problem in relation to juvenile crime.  Deprivation is a major problem, particularly in urban areas, and must be seen against the background of the so-called &ldquo;dysfunctional family&rdquo; about which we have heard so much in the debate.</P>
    <P>How do we deal with this?  There are two approaches &mdash; one advocated by the &ldquo;hang 'em, flog 'em&rdquo; brigade and the other by those who suggest society is to blame for crimes committed. I welcome the Minister of State's theory on the justice versus the welfare model.  I agree with him that we need a mixture of both, particularly in an Irish context.  We need to look at the situation practically.  The concept of right and wrong must be the basis of our deliberations otherwise the system will collapse around us.  It will make everyone's work more difficult, particularly that of the Garda Síochána, if people believe they have no responsibility and there is no such thing as right and wrong.  I do not believe our society could survive that.</P>
    <P>A major problem in dealing with juvenile crime has been the fragmentation of services.  Studies and groups involved with juveniles have highlighted the fragmentation in the services provided for children.  There was much confusion about the responsibilities of the three Departments involved.  The Minister of State said that, to advance the situation, it had to be agreed that the Department of Justice was responsible for the detention of 16 and 17 year old young offenders, the Department of Education was responsible for young offenders under 16 years of age and the Department of Health and the health boards were responsible for disturbed non-offending children.  It is a complex matter.  The appointment of Deputy Currie as Minister of State at these three Department, has helped advance the situation. It was an innovative move which has enabled the three Departments to work together to deal with this problem.  I hope the confusion as regards the three Departments which has bedevilled attempts to deal with young offenders will be solved by this Bill.  I suspect it will not be but perhaps the Minister of State could assure me <Col N="1384" /> that the confusion which has haunted the juvenile justice system will end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the buck will not be passed as far as difficult offenders who may be homeless or present themselves in a Garda station late at night after committing a crime are concerned, because people do not fit into boxes. It will be difficult to solve that problem.</P>
      <P>The role of parents and parental responsibility generally must be central to this issue.  I welcome the provision whereby both parents will have to attend court.  That is the least we could expect of parents whose children offend.  I welcome the provision on the payment of compensation, which is important.  I am sure parents have a role to play in enforcing a curfew, although I am not sure what the Minister of State said in that regard. Parents should be obliged to play a greater role in the welfare of their children.  Parental responsibility and the role of the family conference, which is brought forward in the Bill, are extremely important and central to tackling this serious problem.</P>
      <P>This brings me to the question of parenting skills.  I am sure there are voluntary groups which teach parenting skills, but more needs to be done. New initiatives are required and parenting courses would be extremely beneficial.  The Catholic Church obliges young couples to attend a pre-marriage guidance course but the last thing on their minds are children.  These couples want to get over the wedding day and any discussion on children and the havoc they will wreak in their lives is limited.  There has been a decline in the role of the extended family, particularly in urban areas where grandparents are not available to give advice and assistance, and this brings tremendous pressure to bear on young parents in a modern world and, in many instances, they cannot cope.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of parenting skills given the decline in the role of the extended family.  Children need to be taught self-reliance and self-discipline.</P>
      <P>The role of the father, in particular, must be acknowledged.  The day where the mother raises the children is long gone.  Fathers also require parenting skills, a fact to which we should pay particular attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned homelessness.  I heard Fr. Peter McVerry at a recent conference claim that 400 teenagers become homeless each year in the Eastern Health Board area.  That is a frightening statistic.  Traditionally boys became homeless, but an increasing number of young girls are doing so.  Various reasons are put forward for this, including the breakdown of communications in the family, the decline of the extended family, marital breakdown, stress, unemployment and deprivation.  Not enough hostels are provided, whether through statutory agencies or the voluntary sector, to deal with the problem of homelessness which is becoming a <Col N="1385" /> major concern.  I hope it can be dealt with in the context of this Bill.  There is a lack of resources. Many of those involved will say there is crisis management in dealing with homeless boys and girls.</P>
    <P>My biggest fear is that there will not be enough resources available to implement the Bill's aspirations. Anybody with experience of a Dublin constituency must realise there is crisis management in many of the organisations and institutions dealing with young offenders.  Many organisations are involved: the Garda, juvenile liaison officers, health boards, probation and welfare officers and so on.  I hope we are not fooling ourselves by passing these wonderful measures which may turn out to be aspirational because the resources and the facilities are not available.</P>
    <P>The services provided should be community based.  Dublin is a huge place with a population in excess of one million.  Efforts to rehabilitate a young offender from, for example, Clontarf, Coolock, Malahide, etc. should be carried out in the area with which he is familiar and where his family is based.  There is no point in sending a young offender from Coolock to services in Tallaght. The community based approach must be integrated into everything proposed in the Bill. The home and the community environment are extremely important and people should be facilitated in the areas they know best.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiment that detention should be the last resort.  The Minister of State dealt at length with financial penalties and community sanctions.  The courts have a great flexibility in dealing with particular problems.  That flexibility is needed because some of the people involved have extremely complex problems.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement to replace the reformatory and industrial schools by children detention schools.  In the past some of these institutions did good work but they get a bad press today.  I have in mind in particular the industrial school in Artane which was run by a religious order.  That order was asked to deal with impossible situations and those who were put in their care ended up with a sense of discipline &mdash; maybe I am being nostalgic in that regard.  The order did good work.</P>
    <P>There was insufficient attention paid by the Minister in his speech to the problem of drug addiction.  In Dublin city there are heroin addicts as young as 13 years.  The three types of crime associated with drug addiction and juvenile offenders were outlined by Deputy O'Donoghue. The drugs problem must be central to the whole question of juvenile crime.  Rehabilitation services and so on are required.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement that the possession of child pornography and issues arising from increased communication through the Internet will be dealt with.  I read the extensive articles in the press today and was disappointed the Minister did not dwell on them.  I look forward to the Committee Stage amendments which will deal with that horror problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> The role of sporting organisations, particularly in the voluntary sector, cannot be over emphasised. Those involved in these organisations are the salt of the earth.  All their free time is taken up with, for example, soccer matches every weekend. Those involved show an enormous amount of dedication and commitment.  Every effort should be made to encourage these amateur organisations because there is no doubt their activities give a sense of motivation and purpose to many people.  Anybody who is involved in a group sport, in a conscientious way, is most unlikely to end up as a young offender.  It would be a shame to lose that sense of community and voluntary effort which is very strong in suburban Dublin.  Recognition of that effort through an allocation of lottery funds would pay great dividends for the small amount involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions relating to children begging and putting the onus of proof on the parents. This is a major issue of debate and the more we can do to publicise the provisions of this Bill the more we will alleviate public anxiety.  The clean slate provision is welcome.  It would be a shame to see a young offender tarnished for the rest of his life and not able to obtain employment in the public service and so on because of some misdeed of his or her youth.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates much of existing law and more vision will be needed to deal with these difficult and complex issues.  The family conference is an innovative idea.  The age increase in respect of criminal responsibility is welcome.  More reform is required but my main fear is that the resources will not be provided.  The judges will think a wonderful system is in place but when the young offenders are dealt with by the courts the services will not be available.  I hope that matter will be addressed.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this extremely important legislation and I commend the Minister on bringing it before the House.  The manner in which a society treats its children, even when they offend, is a good indicator of the value of that society.  I recognise the historic nature of the 1908 legislation.  That liberal Government enacted almost all of the progressive legislation left on the Statute Book from pre-Independence times.  I am not sure that even the most staunch liberal supporter of that time would have expected that some of this legislation would be in place almost 90 years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill, which contains more than 200 sections, is extremely complex and, according to today's newspapers, the Government has approved further measures to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage.  I welcome in particular the provisions dealing with the possession of child <Col N="1387" /> pornography and its transmission on the Internet. People who use the Internet for study or work purposes say how easy it is to gain access to pornographic material and how unsought material advertising pornography is sent to them.  It is very important to legislate for this area and to monitor communications systems generally to prevent people using them for perverse purposes and to eliminate this evil trade.</P>
    <P>All Members are aware of the circumstances surrounding this Bill's sister legislation, the Child Care Act, which was enacted in 1991 but whose provisions have only been implemented during the past two years following the allocation of substantial funds.  Dublin Deputies in particular are aware of the significance of the provisions of that Act.  One must ask whether this Bill will suffer the same consequences as the Child Care Act.  I have been bemused in recent months by the political debate on public spending and the attempts by Opposition parties to create the impression among the public that spending is out of control. They may see political benefits in doing this but the chickens will come home to roost if those parties are returned to Government.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity to raise the age of criminal responsibility to 12 years after three years.  This is a very worthy aim and I can only assume it was decided not to raise the age in a single move because of the cost implications for health boards.  However, this is not the view of my constituents who continually refer to new problems which need to be solved.  Neither is it the view of Opposition spokespersons who hope after the general election to be in charge of the Departments which will carry the can for the political failure to deliver in this area.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of services.  I commend the staff and management of the health board but there is room for improvement, particularly as regards child care matters.  Last week a radio programme referred to a difficulty in my constituency &mdash; the programme did not identify the area and I do not wish to do so either.  The programme interviewed residents of the area about a house rented by the Eastern Health Board in which five children from another part of the city live.  According to these residents the supervision of these children by the health board is not adequate because they damage windows, smash cars and wreak havoc in the area.  They accept that these children need to be rehabilitated but their patience is running out because this project is not being properly managed or monitored.</P>
    <P>One of the most noteworthy provisions in the Bill will give parents a greater responsibility for the behaviour of their children.  This measure is necessary but it may give rise to resentment among some of the parents most affected by it. Nevertheless, I believe it will prove popular among the public.  It is important to strike a proper balance so that the provisions regarding parental responsibility are not used as a tool with <Col N="1388" /> which to punish parents who, for one reason or another, are not in a position to fulfil their obligations.</P>
    <P>In many housing estates in the north and west of the city very young children between the ages of ten and 12 years are out of control.  In some cases parents are afraid to control their children. Dublin Corporation has had to move families who were being harassed and attacked by young children out of estates for their own safety.  This happens in my constituency on a regular basis and I welcome the provisions which will deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a number of interesting comments.  For example, he referred to one of life's perennial truisms, namely, how each generation believes the next generation to be more lawless than it was.  I think even Aristotle had something to say about this.  The Minister stated that life goes in cycles, and if this is true then the concerns about this issue are very appropriate.</P>
    <P>The emergence of non-controlled drugs during the past decade and the exposure of children of an increasingly younger age to them is a major source of concern.  I deplore the use of young children as couriers or touts by drug dealers; it is one of the worst forms of exploitation.  Children nowadays have a much shorter childhood than previous generations and many of them do not have time to enjoy their childhood because of the drugs menace and other antisocial behaviour which impacts on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the typical juvenile delinquent is a male from an underprivileged and dysfunctional background.  This is a depressingly accurate and predictable description and I have no doubt the profile was the same 100 years ago. This is a timely reminder that despite all the progress made in the State during the past century certain problems still remain.  This re-emphasises the significance of the programmes initiated by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and the early start and breaking the cycle programmes initiated by the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach.  The early start programme was launched in the primary schools in Darndale in my constituency where there is now one teacher for every 11 students in junior schools and one teacher for every 15 students in secondary schools.  If we want to tackle the problems which affect children at a very young age then the breaking the cycle and early start programmes give a good lesson in this regard.  I think it was a Jesuit who said, &ldquo;if you show me the boy I will give you the man&rdquo;.  If adequate resources are allocated to a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio then teachers will have more time to devote to children with special needs and those who come from a disadvantaged background, thus giving them an opportunity to continue in education to third level and to secure jobs in banks, insurance companies and financial institutions.  This will give them an opportunity to become part of a society from which they have been excluded up <Col N="1389" /> to now because of a lack of a good primary education in the areas in which they live.</P>
    <P>I have already welcomed the decision to raise the age of criminal consent for children.  I am also reasonably satisfied at the delineation between the responsibilities of the Departments of Justice, Education and Health in terms of the different problems encountered by children.  The most important aspect of the Bill is the balance struck between the services provided by the State and the duties imposed on children through their parents. The Minister has done a very good job in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time.  I welcome this long overdue Bill which was first promised approximately 21 years ago. The delay in its introduction is a serious indictment of the political system, successive Governments of all hues and society as a whole.  The serious institutional difficulty in putting the welfare of children at the top of the agenda is inexcusable. It is totally unacceptable that the unwieldy Departments of Justice, Education and Health have responsibility for children.  Young children come bottom of the list in terms of glamour and the priority given to them by these Departments.  We have witnessed a series of buck passing between these Departments in terms of responsibility for juvenile crime and young offenders.  This is inexcusable and an indictment of us all.</P>
      <P>In view of the serious difficulties caused by the &ldquo;turf war&rdquo; and the inflexibility of those three Departments, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, on bringing this complex legislation before the House in a relatively short period of time, just over two years.  We were told on many occasions that the legislation was at an advanced stage.  That is a serious indictment of previous Ministers for Justice who failed to prioritise this important area during their tenures in office.</P>
      <P>Without criticising the Minister of State, who has succeeded in straddling three Departments, we must go further and establish a special Department and a senior ministerial position which would have responsibility for children's affairs.  This important area should not be tagged on to other ministerial responsibilities.  If we are serious about putting the welfare of children to the fore, such reform will have to be introduced in the near future.  I do not underestimate the achievements of the Minister of State, but children's affairs must be given greater prominence in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of juvenile crime is escalating because of our failure to tackle many areas relating to the welfare of children.  The public demand that this problem be dealt with as a matter of urgency with an emphasis, fuelled by Opposition parties and certain sections of the media, on the protection of society.  Society must be protected and individuals going about their daily lives have the right to demand such protection, whether <Col N="1390" /> committed by juveniles or adults.  I am concerned, however, that because this problem has escalated we will forget about the need to cherish children and concentrate solely on the protection of society.  Both aims must be given equal prominence. In an ideal world the emphasis would be on child welfare, but that has not been the case over recent years and we are now paying the price. That price is extremely high in terms of the difficult circumstances into which many children are born.</P>
    <P>People working in the child care area, including social workers and teachers, believe it is impossible to identify with any degree of accuracy the young children who will grow up to be criminals. If we were really a caring society prepared to put our money where our mouths are we would implement the measures necessary to deal with these problems.  We must make the necessary investment at the early stages in the areas to which Deputy Kenny referred.  The Government has begun that programme of investment in education, housing and health but there must be ongoing and substantial investment in those areas.</P>
    <P>It is sickening to listen to some Opposition spokespersons on justice who recite, on a regular basis, utter cant about tackling the problems of crime.  Crime, particularly juvenile crime, is an extremely complex issue and there are no quick fix solutions.  Intensive and costly long-term solutions are required to deal with these problems. Those who maintain we can solve the problems of crime, while cutting back substantially on Government spending, are codding themselves and the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of the Bill as a legislative framework for the juvenile justice system. It is complex legislation containing 230 sections but I look forward to making further contributions on the Committee Stage debate when we will deal with the Bill in greater detail.</P>
    <P>A welcome provision in the Bill is the establishment of the legal obligations of parents.  Over recent years there has been much talk about rights.  It is important that we protect people's rights in various areas, but coupled with those rights are responsibilities and we must concentrate more on the responsibilities of parents. Sadly, many parents abdicate those responsibilities and we must stress the importance of taking responsibility for our children.</P>
    <P>Parents are currently under attack from various sources and that affects their confidence to rear their children.  We must encourage them to be clear-minded in what they are doing and to take a strong stand with their children.  They should trust their own instincts and not fear unpopularity in the eyes of their children.  Children who are set limits in relation to their own behaviour are happier because they do not have to deal with complex issues which they are incapable of dealing with at a young age.</P>
    <P>I welcome the raising of the age of criminal responsibility to ten and eventually to 12, but 12 <Col N="1391" /> should not be regarded as a final age of responsibility. In Scandinavian countries the age of criminal responsibility is 15 and we should move in that direction.  I understand the health boards could not cope if the age were raised to 12 immediately which is a serious indictment of us all.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in relation to the Children Court and the referral of all persons under the age of 18 to that court.  I welcome also the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The problem of begging has been appropriately dealt with in the Bill.  I welcome the fact that causing children to or procuring them for begging will be an offence and I hope more action will be taken in that regard.  It is indefensible that children beg on our streets on cold, wet days for money to bring home to their parents.  That is serious child abuse.</P>

      <P>There is no excuse for children begging on the streets, regardless of a family's circumstances. Our welfare system assists people living in poor circumstances.  They may not get much comfort from it but there is no reason for somebody to beg or go hungry.  This problem must be given greater prominence because sending children out to beg is one of the worst forms of abuse.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well with this legislation and I look forward to debating it further on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to be able to speak in the Dáil on another Children Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.  When he reflects on his period in office I am sure this is the monument of which he will be most proud. I have a particular interest in this legislation because when I was first elected to the Dáil I had responsibility for the preparation of the early stages of a children Bill.  In 1980 a task force report on children recommended that a comprehensive Bill on children should be introduced to cover the care and status of children, adoption and juvenile justice and we thought we had achieved that in 1981.  From then until this Government came into office we have not had a Minister of State with responsibility for children and, consequently, progress on legislation has been extremely slow.  The appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for children was essential in bringing forward this substantive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was fascinated by Deputy O'Donoghue's jackboot tactics directed at the Minister, Deputy Owen.  I am sure the Minister of State would be willing to take the criticism as well as the credit for this legislation.  Deputy O'Donoghue's remarks were a double insult to a person who has worked extremely hard in preparing the legislation. <Col N="1392" /> I am sure he would be prepared to debate any of the substantive issues the Deputy might wish to raise.</P>
    <P>The 1980 task force report identified a legislative vacuum of 80 years in the area of child care. Deputy O'Donoghue castigated the Minister for rewriting sections of the 1908 Act.  In compiling a Children Bill it is logical to include relevant sections of earlier legislation.  I should not have to argue the sense of that.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains a comprehensive package of legislation.  However, it does not cover everything and the Minister did not pretend that it could ever be the final word in this area.  It is a broad legislative framework under which we can develop laws and services for our children We have been operating Dickensian style laws up to now.</P>
    <P>I welcome the earlier sections of the Bill and share the concerns of Deputy Shortall.  We represent many of the children who will be cared for under the provisions of the legislation.  Deputy Haughey and the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, are also familiar with such children.  Between the four of us we represent a fair proportion of young people who will be directly affected by this legislation.  Some of those children are members of criminal families who would have encouraged them in the direction of crime and others have been affected because of various circumstances in their lives.</P>
    <P>When dealing with young children great emphasis should be placed on care, protection, family support and prevention measures and I am sure all the major child care organisations would support that point of view.  However, when one has to intervene, the probation service is crucial. I am pleased it has been set up on a statutory basis and, similar to all other services for children, it must be adequately resourced.  I was encouraged to hear the Minister talk about creative alternative programmes.</P>
    <P>The age of criminal responsibility is a fascinating topic.  Two issues caused particular difficulties in 1981 &mdash; what Department should have responsibility for children and the age of criminal responsibility.  While the Bill has made major improvements, we are not to the forefront in regard to the age of criminal responsibility.  In most other European countries the age of criminal responsibility is between 13 and 15.  In Great Britain is it lower and we are moving carefully in this area.  It has been increased from seven to ten in the legislation and I am sure it will be a topic of further debate.</P>
    <P>I am not sufficiently skilled to comment on the sections dealing with child suspects.  I will leave them to Members who have more experience of the courts.  This matter will probably be discussed at a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs which I am sure will receive representations from many organisations.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Donoghue's concern about a children court.  There has been much debate about children and family courts but the matter <Col N="1393" /> has not been resolved.  We made piecemeal improvements in appointing judges with special experience and training in this area.  Since 1980 a children court has been identified as the proper environment to hear cases involving children.  The ISPCC and other organisations continue to campaign actively in that regard.  The question of independent legal representation is also relevant in this area.  The legislation has not gone as far as I would like in that regard.</P>
    <P>Child detention schools are a necessary evil. Many young children know the only way they will get a place in care is to come before the courts.  In many cases local authorities are forced to make provision for children when they appear before the courts. This is an ongoing problem.  Now that the Minister has completed this legislation, I hope he will examine health board policy in terms of providing places for children.  Young children know the only way they will be placed is if they are charged before the courts.  Sadly, the places which should be special places of last resort for youngsters with special needs are the places of only resort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I concluded by stressing that the prison system is not an inconsequential, irrelevant, insignificant or immaterial arm of the State, as this Administration would have us believe.  It is a crucial and fundamental need within the criminal justice system and is part of the infrastructure of that system.</P>
      <P>In any society where the message went out to the criminal community that the penal system was not all it might be, crime increased.  If a criminal justice system will not adequately punish offences, the system of law and order is undermined, society is undermined and a clear message goes out to criminals and potential criminals that their crimes will either go unpunished or will be half punished.  We have witnessed that here in recent years.</P>
      <P>It is of no use for the Minister for Justice to come into this House and wash her hands of this by saying she is not really the cause of it and that it was caused by previous Administrations.  This Minister has been in charge of the Department for more than two years.  She has presided over a legislative drought.  Any solace people received relating to solving the crime problem came from the Opposition benches when the Minister either accepted or plagiarised legislation presented on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gives me no great pleasure to say the Minister's contribution to the debate in this House last night was nothing short of a disgrace and amounted to little more than vulgar abuse.  The <Col N="1394" /> Government should not be surprised by this.  I was certainly not surprised because there is no reason anyone should think the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is capable of opening a debate when she is not even able to open an envelope.  Any Minister who has presided over as many fiascos as the Minister for Justice should not use the sort of language she used in this House last night unless addressing a mirror.</P>
    <P>The Minister is clearly in a state of denial about Castlerea prison.  The project was cancelled by the Cabinet in the absence of the Minister.  It says a great deal about her standing with her colleagues when they cancelled this extremely important project in her absence.  It also says a considerable amount about her commitment to her portfolio that she was absent when such an important decision was made.  Unlike the situation relating to the delisting of Judge Dominic Lynch, it appears she was definitely notified on this occasion.  We know this because she subsequently supported the decision taken by that new convert to the fight against crime in the Republic of Ireland, Deputy Quinn.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice threatened to resign because the Minister for Finance cancelled the prison programme in her absence at a kitchen Cabinet meeting.  This led me to remark at the time that, when the kitchen Cabinet meets, it appears the Minister, Deputy Owen, is sent out for the buns.  Since the Minister threatened to resign, in hindsight the Taoiseach probably regrets that he did not accept the resignation.</P>
      <P>We would have been expected to believe the Minister for Justice was not notified of the cancellation of the prison project at Castlerea were it not for these salient facts.  We would have probably been told the message was lost in the post or that it fell out of the sky into the courts section in the Department of Justice and no one knew how it got there, no one ever saw it and no one ever handled it.  One could be forgiven for making the argument that the public should not be surprised that a Minister who does not read her post would not read her Cabinet papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's most innovative contribution to the creation of additional prison places is that there will be vacant places on many occasions over the coming years when Owen's own 16 litigate the Minister's incompetence throughout Ireland and into Europe.  The consequences of her incompetence will be debated long after she has left the Department of Justice.  It begs the question as to whether the creation of additional judicial posts was part of a grand design by the Minister for Justice.  In any event, I am glad to report that the additional judges are now fully occupied, not least because of the Minister's prowess in creating confusion where previously there was only calm.  Monuments to the Minister's <Col N="1395" /> incompetence will turn up daily outside the Four Courts and other salubrious buildings around Europe in due course.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised but I am confused by the attitude of Deputy O'Donoghue to criminal justice matters.  He is probably one of the most negative politicians in Leinster House yet he censured the Minister for Justice for engaging in vulgar abuse.  He should examine his statements on legislative and justice matters.  He has poured abuse on the Minister for Justice almost daily since she took office and has never acknowledged his party's responsibility for the gross negligence and lack of activity in the criminal justice area.  Almost every time he speaks he calls on the Minister to resign.  He has done so on 14 occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by my calculations and I am sure he will do so again.  That is the typical manner in which Fianna Fáil addresses these matters. The party is not prepared to acknowledge the great work of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  She has reformed a number of areas in the criminal justice sector which had been neglected for too long.  Fianna Fáil was in Government, although Deputy O'Donoghue might not have realised it, from 1987 to 1994.  To suggest that this Government must solve all the problems in two years indicates that the Deputy has little experience of what his party did in Government for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity presented by the introduction of this Bill to discuss prison reform which is an important issue in maintaining law and order.  The Bill also gives me the opportunity to express my gratitude to the Minister for Justice for taking on the drug barons, an accomplishment for which she will always be remembered.  For the first time, serious criminals are under pressure. Her task will be further helped when the bail legislation is brought before the Dáil following the recent successful referendum.  All parties deserve credit for this important referendum, although the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, turned down a request to hold such a referendum in 1988.  However, Fianna Fáil, having believed a referendum unnecessary, <Col N="1396" /> discovered it was necessary in 1995 when Deputy O'Donoghue became its spokesman on justice.  It is a measure of the credibility appertaining to that party that when in Opposition it appears to have a different policy from when in Government and in a position to implement its policies.</P>
    <P>Over the years there were inadequate resources for the prisons service.  All political parties, particularly Fianna Fáil, said something must be done about prison reform and prison building. However, not one prison place was provided by that party to deal with the problem.  In contrast, the present Ministers for Justice and Finance were able to ensure that the necessary resources were and will be available in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 to provide up to 800 additional places.  That will go a long way towards providing a solution to the problems of prisoners on remand and the revolving door syndrome.  We are lucky, too, that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, has personal experience of the building industry and has been able to apply his considerable expertise to ensure the building programme is carried out in a cost effective way.</P>
    <P>The recent crime figures indicate that, for the first time since 1988, the level of crime is decreasing. We must congratulate the Garda Commissioner, Pat Byrne, and the Garda authorities for the manner in which they have fine tuned their policies to deal with serious criminals in urban and rural areas.  The enthusiasm with which Commissioner Byrne has applied himself to the task since his appointment last July is refreshing. Not a day passes without the public seeing solid evidence of the effectiveness of the policies he put in place and the new laws introduced by the Government, particularly the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation, to deal with serious criminals and drug barons.  The public will acknowledge the record of this Government, compared with that of other Governments, in dealing with law and order issues.</P>
    <P>A £135 million prison building programme over three years has been put in place.  However, building prisons alone is not a solution to the problem of crime.  It is unacceptable that people convicted of petty crime, such as non-payment of fines or television licences, are jailed.  We should examine other ways, such as the extension of community service orders, of dealing with such people.  The education system has a vital role to play in educating people, particularly in primary and post-primary schools, about the drug problem. The Department of Health can also play a role by disseminating information through health centres and clinics.  The wider community must take personal and parental responsibility for the activities of their families in the community in dealing with petty and serious crime.  Crime is not just a legislative matter.  Each citizen has a duty to help the fight against crime, if only to reduce the level of personal taxation which is how moneys to deal with the problem must be generated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> There were 490 drug seizures in 1996, a record and a clear indication that present policies are working.  The Department of the Marine, the Department of Justice and the Revenue Commissioners have joined forces and have effectively, and not before time, co-ordinated their work to achieve high profile drug seizures.  The drugs seized had the capacity to cause considerable damage to our citizens, particularly young people.  Cannabis resin and other drugs have been a plague for too long.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue her efforts to eliminate the great evil of ecstasy.  It is still a major problem in urban communities and the Garda authorities must redouble their efforts to tackle the problem, particularly where it affects teenagers still at school.  Individuals who have vital information should pass it to the Garda authorities to stamp out this menace once and for all.  Parents also have a vital role in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of additional judges to deal with the backlog of court cases which had built up under Fianna Fáil led Governments. The High Court Judge in Cork has dealt expeditiously with an enormous number of cases. His success is acknowledged by solicitors and barristers in Cork as a major step forward.  Deputy Quill will join them in acknowledging that success. A Corkman, Judge Seán O'Leary, has made a major contribution to the south-eastern circuit and ensured that the lists for Circuit Court cases is at an all-time low.  The speed with which the new judicial appointments have tackled such matters deserves acknowledgment.  I hope other circuits will take note of the progress that can be made if there is the will.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the advantages of speaking on the second day of Private Members' debates is that it gives one an opportunity to examine the contributions of those who spoke earlier.  Last night's effort, with the exception of Deputy Michael McDowell's contribution, was solely motivated by the dictates of political knock-about.  Deputy O'Donoghue, whom we heard earlier this evening and who has remarkable capacity in that regard, gave another fine performance of political knock-about. <Col N="1398" /> In terms of substance, one is left wondering, in the words of another colleague, where is the beef.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to disagree with the comments of the Minister for Justice on the unspecified nature of some of the Bill's provisions.  The use of Bills to prolong Private Members' time on what some people consider to be politically juicy subjects has become a habit of the Opposition in the past two years.  Deputy O'Donoghue spent most of the day today claiming credit for Bills he produced, and far be it for me to diminish in any way the contribution he made and the work he put into producing Bills, but the most important step taken in the recent past was the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, which has a significant effect in curbing crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's speech of last night stood out in terms of its constructiveness.  While I share reservations about the Progressive Democrats Bill, I understand Deputy McDowell's concern about the staff-prisoner ratio in the prison system. That should be examined.  Deputy McDowell and his colleagues in the Progressive Democrats continually allude to parties of the left as being soft on crime, but neither I nor my party are soft on crime.  I reject the accusation by Deputy O'Donnell last night that parties of the left are more concerned with the perpetrators than the victims of crime.  That is bunkum.  Most victims of crime live in areas where there is strong support for the Labour Party &mdash; many victims of crime are supporters of the Labour Party.  Victims of crime and those who live in areas scourged with crime want to see criminals put out of business, as do I and my party.  It is profoundly dishonest to suggest that because one believes there is a relationship between deprivation and crime one is soft on crime.  That is nonsense.  Being tough on crime means much more than posturing in this Chamber or outside it.</P>
    <P>In a recent statement, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats compared her party to Tony Blair's Labour Party in Britain.  For those of us who share Tony Blair's view of new social democracy, that is a distortion of logic.  It is a ridiculous statement by Deputy Harney, who is normally a sensible woman.  The new Labour Party in Britain believes in the primacy of the community over the individual.  It believes that each individual has a responsibility and a duty to his fellow citizen and that criminals should take responsibility for their actions and face the consequences.  I am a strong supporter of Mr. Blair's philosophy in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney, on the other hand, believes in liberty for the individual.  She alluded to responsibilities and duties but was not specific in that regard.  Contrary to the content of many of her press statements, she is the country's greatest advocate of untrammelled rights.  She does not talk about the common good or the need for social cohesion as the basis for economic progress. She does not recognise that the huge growth rates of recent years have been achieved <Col N="1399" /> through social cohesion, by various elements in society working together towards shared objectives. Deputy Harney said that Gordon Browne's proposals on tax have a lot in common with those of her party, but the Progressive Democrats proposes to significantly reduce the top rate of tax, which would have the effect of putting more money in the pockets of the very well off.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats is using the current crime crisis as a vehicle to improve its support.  It is attempting to tell middle class voters that it is acceptable to withdraw from society and leave others to deal with the problems.  I reject that philosophy.  It is not a communitarian approach to crime and it would not be advocated by Tony Blair.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, more prison places are needed and progress is being made in that regard.  Better management practices in prisons should be introduced and there is scope for progress in that area. The availability of drugs in prisons, particularly Mountjoy, is unacceptably high and the level of treatment for drug addicts leaves great scope for improvement.  All these issues are being tackled and greater progress can be made.</P>
    <P>A solution will not be found to the crime problem until the attitudes of society change.  The concept of social obligation must be reintroduced as a matter of fundamental importance.  Nobody should be allowed walk away from their responsibilities. Greater emphasis should be laid on the fact that everyone has a responsibility to others. We are preoccupied with rights and are very lax in terms of spelling out duties and obligations. Anybody who seeks to remove from criminals their responsibility is encouraging them to continue in their evil ways.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise with the Minister the non-payment of large fines by people who are given the option of going to jail for a period of time.  There is economic sense in convicted people opting for jail sentences instead of paying a fine of, say, £30,000, £40,000, £50,000 or £100,000.  Will the Minister say whether that practice prevails?  If so, it should be curbed.  The courts should have power to take the money from the bank accounts of criminals.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak in defence of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen who, as will be proven in future, is one of the best Ministers for Justice for many years.  When this Government took office she had to face many problems. Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats policy at the time was to close down rural Garda stations and post offices.  People in the west were afraid they would wake up in the morning with a gun to their heads.  Those people are very grateful to the Minister who, as a result of meeting the Garda <Col N="1400" /> Commissioner, succeeded in curbing attacks on the elderly.  Last Christmas was the first Christmas in many years that there was no attack on an old person in the west.  The Minister did a good job in dealing with that serious problem.</P>
      <P>When the Minister took office she faced many problems which were not of her making but were the fault of previous Governments.  I listened to the Progressive Democrats last night talking about closing down Mountjoy, but where would we put the criminals?  For too long no action was taken against criminals.  I am talking about drug barons.  When Deputy Owen was appointed Minister for Justice, the first problem she identified was that of people committing crimes while on bail.  She did not get much support from the Opposition or this side of the House but she identified and resolved the problem.  I am glad to say the referendum on bail was successful and I compliment the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister was appointed when there were problems in the Garda Síochána.  There was disarray in two Garda organisations which she resolved.  She also identified the prison space problem.  She did not get the support she needed from the Cabinet when Castlerea prison was built.  On behalf of the people of the west of Ireland, I compliment her on getting her way. Castlerea prison is now set up and people are being detained there.  That is testimony to the strength and power of this Minister.  She is an excellent Minister of whom I am proud.  I assure the people of the west that there will be no more closures of rural Garda stations, a policy started by Fianna Fáil in 1989 and continued in 1991. There have been no closures of Garda stations since this Government came into power and there will be no more closures under the present Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Owen is a good Minister who understands the problems.  She has tackled these problems just as she tackled the drug barons.  She was criticised by both sides of the House when she brought in all the necessary legislation.  She has proven she is a Minister of quality who is here for the long haul.  She will go down as one of the best Ministers for Justice for many years to come.  As a backbencher, she has my full support as well as that of the people.</P>
      <P>It was heartening to hear the Dublin Chamber of Commerce a number of weeks ago complimenting the Minister on the action she had taken to resolve the crime problem in Dublin city.  Like the people of the west, the people of Dublin have also suffered from crime.  Now they know there is a Minister who cares, who is prepared to take on the drug barons and put those who commit serious crime behind bars.</P>
      <P>The Minister has my support.  I would like to speak for longer but I want to give my colleague, Deputy Boylan, an opportunity to speak.  I ask the Minister to keep up the good work.  I know no more rural Garda stations will close.  I know she has her finger on the pulse and that the people have full confidence in her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Progressive Democrats on giving us the opportunity to reaffirm our support for the Minister for Justice. I cannot see any great proposals in the Bill. Nevertheless, it is important that we publicly support a Minister who, more than any other in recent times, has devoted much time and effort to tackling serious crime.  She is making substantial progress, which is acknowledged by all fair thinking people nationwide.</P>
      <P>There were sickening crimes when Deputy Owen was appointed to this important ministry. The attacks on the elderly had not been curtailed, despite attempts to do so.  These were well-organised crimes.  Old people were living in terror.  We saw photographs and heard reports of the brutal attacks on helpless elderly people.  As Deputy Ring correctly said, this winter and Christmas the elderly felt safe in their homes.  Unfortunately, the padlocks have to remain and the windows have to be barred.  I believe that in time they can be removed and we can go back to the great tradition of leaving our door on the latch.  We can do that as long as we have a Minister of the calibre of Deputy Owen.  She is getting support from the highest ranking garda to the lowest, in Garda stations or on the beat They have confidence in this Minister.</P>
      <P>We also had the scurrilous carry-on of drug barons.  I did not believe it was a serious problem. I read daily about the massive assets these people have built up.  They did not do this overnight. Obviously they have been gathering money from the youth of our country on whom they inflicted the scourge of drugs.  Millions of pounds has been collected by these people as a result of their evil ways.  Nothing was done to curtail that activity. Over the past ten years, these people have been gathering money like wild bees at a honeypot. They have massive houses and farms.  Where did this money come from?  Where were previous Ministers for Justice that they did not recognise the evil these people inflicted?  At last they are being hit hard and drugs are being taken off the streets.  Young people can move around in freedom and those of us with young families do not have any fears that young people's discos will be infiltrated by ruthless people hoping to get them addicted to drugs and onto their payroll.  Such addiction leads to other serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many places in prison are taken up by people who committed minor crimes such as non-payment of road taxes, speeding offences and nonpayment of television licences.  They could best pay their debt to society by doing community work.  There is an attitude among a certain element, to which Deputy Upton referred.  People who commit petty crimes or are fined large amounts for tax evasion and other illegal activities are fined £30,000 or £40,000 or given a month in jail.  How can a district justice equate a month in jail with £30,000?  The person gets out of jail after ten or 12 days for good behaviour.  It does not make sense.  Of course, people will ask to spend time in jail.  Their spouse or family member <Col N="1402" /> will say they have gone to the Riviera on holiday or on business.  They will have saved £30,000 by opting for jail.</P>
    <P>Community service is the answer.  There is so much work to be done for the public.  They should wear an illuminated blazer just as community and road workers do when on various schemes.  I do not want to make any comparison between people who are doing this and those who have to pay a penalty.  They should be seen in public cutting hedges, cleaning drains and visiting the elderly. They should pay their debt to society rather than hide away in what is hotel accommodation in many of our prisons.  A number of people have drawn this to my attention.  Obviously, people are beginning to realise it is simpler to go to an open prison, take a little holiday, clear their debt and then go on their merry way.  That is not acceptable and should be nipped in the bud before it becomes a policy among these people.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on opening prisons to journalists and featuring them on television programmes.  I and many of the public who had no knowledge of what happens inside a prison have been educated.  I could see the sadness of fine young boys and girls sitting in a cell reading a book or just lying there, although educational programmes are provided.  I heard interviews with some of them and their lives have no meaning. They have no future.  They had nowhere to go when they were released.  They were involved in crime again and were sent back to prison.  That problem must be seriously addressed.  On their release from prison they should be able to avail of community employment or FÁS schemes to give their lives meaning.  There are good people in the community who are prepared to offer them hostel accommodation as part of an organised programme. Some, through no fault of their own given that they come from broken homes and deprived areas, did not get the same start in life as the rest of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, is doing an excellent job.  She has my full support, long may she continue in office.</P>

      <P>Law and order has been the subject of more debates in this House in recent years than in any previous period.  This is a source of some satisfaction.  It has suddenly dawned on the Legislature that the problems in towns throughout the country but particularly in Dublin are serious.  Deputy Upton gave the impression that the situation in Dublin is much improved; it is not, it is as bad as ever, although I am aware the Garda Síochána is doing everything it can with limited resources to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operation Dochás will continue until such time as the Garda Commissioner and, in particular, <Col N="1403" /> Assistant Commissioner, Tom King, are satisfied it has achieved its purpose but there is a need for more personnel on the streets.  That is the call made at every meeting that I, Deputy Upton, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and Deputy Eric Byrne attend, particularly in the inner city of Dublin where crime is rampant and where we spend well in excess of 50 per cent of our time as public representatives, even though the return in terms of votes is small.</P>
    <P>Whenever I speak about this topic I never make exceptions or claim that Fianna Fáil has done better than Fine Gael or the Labour Party; all parties are to blame.  When Charles Haughey took over the leadership of the party in 1979 I indicated to him that the issue of law and order was more important than inflation, which was raging at 16 to 20 per cent, and unemployment and had to be tackled.  However, it received little attention.</P>
    <P>I agree with one comment made by Deputy Boylan in relation to who should be placed in prison. White collar criminals could be accommodated in open prisons, if necessary.  However, those guilty of crimes against the person should be required to serve their full sentence.  The Minister said that a new Bill is about to be published to deal more stringently with possession and use of syringes.  As Members are aware, the number of crimes involving the use of a syringe has increased dramatically in Dublin.  People would be ill-advised to walk the streets in certain areas of the city at any time of the day or night as they may be confronted by someone carrying a syringe.</P>
    <P>Anyone found guilty of threatening another with a blood filled syringe found to be HIV positive should serve a minimum of five to ten years in prison for attempting to take the life of another.  Even if the blood is not found to be HIV positive, this does not make the offence less serious as the person concerned has been terrified out of his or her wits, particularly if he or she has been stabbed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the new remand centre at Wheatfield is to open.  It will cater for 400 prisoners. Many people are disturbed about the practice of placing remand prisoners in a normal prison setting, particularly those who did not commit a crime previously.  Spaces in prison should be saved for those with a long record of crime, the length of one's arm, as they deserve no quarter.</P>
    <P>The recent hostage-taking horrified us all.  I sometimes wonder with astonishment where &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; finds people to interview.  In this instance, a woman who had been interviewed previously &mdash; I will be charitable by not using an adjective &mdash; was interviewed again.  When she spoke about the moderate treatment of the hostages all one could do was wince.  As we are all aware, the prison officers concerned were treated savagely.  It will take many of them a long time to recover from what was a terrifying and traumatic experience.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> We are dealing with people who deserve no quarter.  I would throw the key away.  Even if they have to serve 15 years, I would still be terrified at the prospect that they will be allowed out again. Those who take hostages are a danger to the public. It is imperative that they should serve their full sentence.  Sometimes the victims are forgotten.</P>
    <P>There are criminal families in my constituency and everybody is aware of them.  One hears stories that certain members are out of prison and on the rampage again.</P>
    <P>Car stealing, or joy riding as it is fondly described in the media, is on the increase.  There has been a spate of car thefts in my constituency. Last night as I was driving along Sundrive Road I came across a Garda car which had smashed into a car which I presumed was being driven by a car thief.  Incidents such as these are extremely dangerous, particularly on wet surfaces, as was the case last night.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent Garda superintendent in Crumlin who is doing a wonderful job against all the odds.  He served in the area as a garda initially and has made a huge impact for which he should be congratulated.  I have been pleading for some time in this House &mdash; it will eventually happen &mdash; that cases should be processed through the courts by Garda inspectors; gardaí should not be required to attend court following each arrest. This practice is followed successfully in England.</P>
    <P>There are 25 gardaí attached to one of the stations in my constituency which covers a huge area.  This appears to be a marvellous figure but only seven gardaí are on duty on each shift.  The people of the inner city of Dublin want to see more gardaí on the street.  It is not fair, however, to expect an individual garda to patrol the streets alone, foot patrols should consist of at least two gardaí.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised that some young people choose to follow a life of crime.  I do not know how many Members have seen tender documents for the supply, in the language of Dickens, of &ldquo;vittles&rdquo; to prisons.  Those criminals do not suffer hardship.  They are well fed, warm and eat meat twice a week while many others are lucky to eat meat once a week bearing in mind its price.  Ice cream and Guinness are listed on the tender documents.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed with last night's contribution <Col N="1405" /> by the Minister for Justice, the tone and language she used in response to Deputy O'Donoghue and the manner in which she dismissed Deputy O'Donnell's efforts to bring this Bill before the House.  The Minister accused my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, of being an idiot. She should be most careful indulging in such name calling.  That appellation comes to mind when we recall the Minister's handling of the Judge Lynch affair.  Her response to the current crisis in the prisons system is equally idiotic.  She wants time to consider the needs of the prisons system for the past three years and to ignore the current crisis.  While adopting that ostrich-like behaviour, she is engaging in name calling rather than addressing the real issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not read her mail.  It appears she does not read the press either.  Because the prisons system is in such chaos there are practically daily reports on it in the media and the position is so bad that prison authorities publicly admit the system is in chaos and that they cannot cope.  The Minister does not need reviews, three year plans or consultants' reports.  All she needs to do is to read the newspapers and she will learn there is a crying need for additional places.  Perhaps she is assisting in institutionalising the revolving door policy by her approach to the Judge Lynch affair &mdash; create vacancies by screwing up convictions and relieve the pressure.  It may be less embarrassing than having prisoners sent home, often having been given lunch the day they were sent to prison by the courts.</P>
    <P>I agree that planning for the future needs of the prisons service is not only laudable but necessary. However, we must address the immediate crisis before we can afford the luxury of planning for the future.  The Minister is currently presiding over a scandal.  The gardaí are overstretched fighting crime and bringing criminals before the courts, the courts are jammed trying and sentencing criminals and taking them off the streets but the prisons are refusing them entry and putting them back on the streets to reoffend.</P>

The Minister would do well to get organised and put her house in order rather than engage in name calling.  If she is successful, she <Col N="1406" /> might eventually shed the appellation she is trying to hang on my colleague.  The postponement ordered by the Minister, be it for a thorough review of the needs of the prisons service or otherwise, is the cause of the current crisis.  The Minister must accept responsibility for that now. It is her responsibility to resolve the crisis urgently and to restore public confidence in the justice system and the morale of the gardaí and the prison authorities.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed at the manner in which the Minister treated Deputy O'Donnell's efforts to bring this Bill before the House.

It may well be that the outburst occurred because Deputy O'Donoghue struck a sensitive nerve with the Minister.

No one on this <Col N="1407" /> side of the House is suggesting the Minister is responsible for creating all these problems, but for the past few years she has been in charge of the Department that operates the system and it is perfectly legitimate to question her stewardship, as she will undoubtedly do when she takes her place on this side of the House in a few months' time.</P>
    <P>It is as clear as daylight that the great majority of the problems in the prisons system are due to a lack of sufficient space.  That has arisen for two reasons, a failure to provide the necessary funds to proceed with a major prison construction programme and, in the meantime, a failure to modify the sentencing system which tends to exacerbate the accommodation problem at present.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison suffers most because of its age and the fact that it draws most of its prisoners from the most underprivileged and drug infested areas of Dublin.  Having watched the recent excellent television programmes on Mountjoy and discussed some of its problems with its governor last night, I can only marvel at what is clearly a heroic performance by the staff and support services operating there.</P>
    <P>Mountjoy Prison has an annual turnover of more than 6,000 prisoners per annum.  On any day there could be as many as 150 prisoners over and above the number that can be accommodated in even the least acceptable circumstances.  That includes as many as 40 people sleeping on mattresses on the floor.  Many of those people should not have been there in the first place, if certain changes had been made in the manner in which offenders are dealt with by the courts.</P>
    <P>I recently read that a substantial farmer was convicted of using illegal and dangerous growth promoting drugs.  He was fined a substantial amount of money, but with the alternative of a few weeks in prison.  Naturally he accepted the prison sentence which is to be served in one of the most comfortable cells in Castlerea prison.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the courts system. By accepting a short spell in surroundings a great deal more comfortable than Mountjoy prison that man saved himself £20,000 or £30,000. Faced with the same choice I am sure most of us would adopt the same course.  Many other prison spaces are probably taken up by similar cases, some of them <i>in lieu</i> of small fines.  In the case I have just quoted, which involved a serious crime against the community, the fine should have been doubled without any option or alternative.</P>

      <P>As far as what are described generally as petty crimes are concerned, it is high time the community service option was developed <Col N="1408" /> to a greater extent.  I am aware of examples of this type of sentence being handed out in my county with significant success.  It is especially to be recommended in dealing with young people who for various reasons embark on a bout of vandalism such as damaging private property or destroying young trees that have been planted at considerable expense by either the local authority or voluntary groups.  The punishment is twofold. First, compensation is demanded and, second, the offender is made to publicly assist in repairing the damage.  There are many other possible variations of this method.  The most valuable outcome of this is that the young offender is not brought into the prison culture which so often involves the hard-boiled criminal getting satisfaction from introducing young people to the rather questionable delights of drug addiction or the equally questionable attractions of a life of crime.  The other advantage is that there would be more space to accommodate real criminals.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the prison problem we cannot get away from the question of drugs.  I am told that up to 80 per cent of prisoners coming into Mountjoy have at some stage been involved in drug taking. Sixty five per cent are into heroin and 55 per cent into heroin injections.  The treatment unit can only deal with about ten or 12 at a time.  On any day there are 40 to 50 men and 20 to 25 women on the detoxification programme.  This can last for no more than 14 days, although experts recommend at least 18 days.  There are substantial problems with programmes providing heroin substitutes. Some produce their own addiction problems and there is a reluctance to continue with an indefinite maintenance programme, although I am convinced that inmates who have already been on such a programme before arriving in prison should be enabled to continue the treatment. A modern prison should be designed in such a way that from day one no drug free prisoner should be housed or in contact with drug addicts just as young first time offenders should not be in contact with habitual criminals.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes setting up a prison service which would take over prison management from the Department of Justice and provides for an Inspector of Prisons who would be totally independent and have access to all prisons.  One of the prime benefits would be a system of equal standards.</P>
      <P>Mental instability is a condition which covers a wide field and no lay person, such as a prison officer or a member of the Garda Síochána, is in a position to recognise the variations of it.  A man or woman could be found wandering through the streets causing a general nuisance and appear to be drunk.  To get the culprit out of the way, a charge of vagrancy could find the person ensconced in Mountjoy, even for a very short time.  That person could be a perfectly innocent victim of some kind of psychiatric disorder and the consequence of even one night in prison could be disastrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> A recent report of an inquiry into the prison service in Britain included some dire warnings about the consequences of locking up or continuing the incarceration of inmates with psychiatric problems.  The recommendations came from Sir Donald Acheson, former chief medical officer, who concentrated his efforts on special secure units at three different prisons.  He noted the dangers from claustrophobia in these units where there was little meaningful work or incentive and an almost total lack of social contact.  He stated clearly that a proportion of these men would develop significant adverse mental health effects over the course of sentences.  Sir Donald has since said prisoners held in these units had the same rights with regard to health care as any other person. He said &ldquo;It is not part of the punishment that they shall be treated in such a way that their health invariably suffers.&rdquo;  I am quite sure very few of us, if any, disagree with those sentiments. The possible effect of any type of prison regime should be studied very carefully as part of the overall question of rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>There are compensating factors in consigning certain people to prison.  It has been frequently noted, for instance, that many drug addicts who arrive in Mountjoy undergo a significant improvement in their health and physical appearance after a relatively short time.  This comes about because of a drastic change, albeit temporary, in their lifestyles.  They are put on a healthy regime of good food, eight to ten hours sleep daily and, as far as possible, some worthwhile exercise.  If we had a much more effective set of facilities for drug treatment instead of the present minimum procedure, many inmates would have a much better chance of withdrawing from the drug and crime culture when they are released.  At that stage a proper monitoring system would be desirable to help them avoid being dragged back into their old habits.</P>
    <P>A gigantic task faces all of us but the domino effect of one thing leading to another simply must be tackled and society must have the patience and determination to do it properly.  This includes dealing with the many social problems endemic in such places as inner city Dublin.  Drugs, alcoholism and mental instability are related and are responsible for a great majority of the prison population.</P>
    <P>There has been a tendency over the years for the establishment to listen politely to such groups as prison visiting committees and then forget what they have said.  Without wishing to criticise civil servants who are such a vital part of democracy it is generally accepted that by their nature they are fairly conservative, especially where spending public money is concerned.  It is, therefore, a welcome feature of the Bill that it proposes the setting up of a prison service divorced from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do well to take Deputy O'Donnell's proposals on board.  Deputy O'Donnell's Bill has created a debate.  The Minister would do well to enter into the spirit of what <Col N="1410" /> motivated Deputy O'Donnell when she drafted this Bill.  When the Government votes this measure down, it should come forward quickly with what it regards as a better Bill.  Unfortunately, the Minister has little time to do that.  She should accept this Bill now but it will probably be left to this side of the House to provide the necessary legislation shortly.</P>

      <P>There has long been a need for comprehensive prisons legislation which would repeal antiquated legislation dating back to 1826.  Unfortunately, this Private Members' Bill does not even come close to meeting that need.  I appreciate the difficulties encountered by Opposition Deputies in drafting legislation, and that the expertise available to Government is not always available to Opposition Deputies.  Nevertheless, if a Deputy presents a Bill in the Dáil it should stand up to scrutiny, and this Bill has so many holes in it that it amounts to little more than a legislative sticking plaster applied at random.</P>
      <P>Recent polls show that crime is a major concern of the people, and that is due in part to the continual raising of the matter in forums such as this.  However, populism is no substitute for a coherent prisons policy.  Let me point to just a few of the more glaring anomalies in this draft legislation.  Deputy O'Donnell, in common with other Members of this House, has consistently decried the absence of a separate remand facility. She is right to do so.  I have often supported her in that.  In holding remand prisoners together with convicted prisoners we are in breach of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, but at no point is it specified in the Bill that remand prisoners will be held separately. It is simply left to the Minister to make regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is also aware, as are other Members of this House, of the isolated but serious instances where prisoners have been abused.  Those instances have been documented. Despite that, Deputy O'Donnell does not seek to incorporate the draft prison rules or the European Commission's Prison Regulations into her Bill.  Having discussed those over a long time and on many occasions, I would have thought that they would have been at the top of any agenda for inclusion in a Bill of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is aware of the serious overcrowding in many of our prisons, but at no point does her Bill lay down a minimum cubic footage per prisoner although, since it repeals all other prisons Acts, it should be the last word on prisons <Col N="1411" /> legislation.  This must be included in comprehensive legislation dealing with our prisons into the future because we should not have to come back every year to patch up ineffective legislation or put new legislation in place.  Legislation should be wide-ranging and comprehensive and should last for at least ten years with reviews during that time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section of the Bill that proposes the establishment of an independent prison service. This has been a long-standing demand of Democratic Left.  In that regard, I am sure Deputy O'Donnell welcomes this Government's establishment of an expert group to advise the Government on the best way of establishing a new agency to run the prisons.  The <i>ad hoc</i> and unplanned evolution of our prison system predates the foundation of this State.  The crisis facing our prisons requires that very careful consideration be given to the composition of the new prisons agency, to its remit and its executive functions. There is also a need to ensure that appropriate lessons are learned from international experience, and to ensure that the administration of our prisons conforms with all the relevant European Union and the United Nations instruments. The establishment of an independent prisons board was first recommended by the Whitaker report over a decade ago.  Until this Government assumed office, that report gathered dust on the shelves of various administrations, including the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Administration of 1989-90.  Democratic Left has been consistent in its support for the Whitaker recommendations, but the worst possible response to the Whitaker report would be rushed and badly thought out legislation of the kind being debated tonight.  Rather, we should await the conclusions under the chairmanship of Mr. Dan McAuley, and then proceed to establish a prisons agency which can form the basis of a progressive and responsive prison service of the kind envisaged in the Whitaker report.</P>
    <P>Above all, we need to ensure that the prisons agency is truly independent and that it is not subject to ministerial shackles.  However, in drafting this Bill, Deputy O'Donnell has proceeded to emasculate her proposed prison service.  Section 12 of her Bill provides for the Minister to retain responsibility for the appointment of governors, deputy governors and prison officers as well as a myriad other issues concerned with the day-to-day running of our prisons.  That could not be considered independent, so we are back to the <i>status quo</i>; the independent prison service will be no more than a dream.  I refer Deputy O'Donnell to the excellent suggestions regarding the proposed independent prisons board made by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, which, I am sure, will be taken on board by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>These are just a few of the omissions from the Bill.  This Bill is a rehashing of old ideas many of which are, nevertheless, welcome.  The debate is <Col N="1412" /> welcome because this is something that concerns people and should be debated.  However, there is one new proposal for the establishment of a temporary release register open to inspection by the general public.  There are certain crimes in respect of which people should be notified before prisoners are released back into the community. However, I have great difficulty with Deputy O'Donnell's proposal which would essentially mean that every self-appointed vigilante would be entitled to see who is out on temporary release and, presumably, where they are living.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell is not simply suggesting that crime victims should have the right to know when their assailants are being released, nor is she suggesting that communities should be notified when, for example, sex offenders are released back among them.  In section 15 of this Bill it is suggested that all members of the public should have the unhindered right to see the temporary release details of all prisoners, regardless of individual circumstances or of the possible danger to the individual concerned.  That is very worrying.</P>
    <P>Rather than legislating for vigilantism, Democratic Left has long advocated the establishment of an independent parole board which would ensure that early and temporary releases are fully monitored and that the conditions of release are tailored to the history and needs of individual prisoners.  In particular, it is vital to ensure that prisoners are not simply dumped onto the streets when prison space is needed, in conditions which may positively encourage them to reoffend.  In the run-up to an election, I have no doubt that the establishment of a temporary release register would, at first glance, prove extremely popular with voters.  However, our job is to draft legislation which will stand the test of time.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion before to reflect in this House on the possible outcome of the next election when we might see Deputy McDowell assuming the helm at the Department of Finance, with his counterpart, Deputy McCreevy, holding sway in the Department of Social Welfare.  That spectre struck the public imagination recently, and I am sure it will again in the run-up to the election.  Having seen this Bill, I would be very alarmed at the prospect of Deputy O'Donnell as Minister for Justice in an unholy alliance with Deputy O'Donoghue as Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>Anyone who brings a Bill before this House is to be congratulated.  It must be a mammoth task, especially if one does not have the support and back-up which is available to Governments. However, if one is going to do it, it should be done properly.  I look forward to a debate in the future on legislation which will fulfil all our needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt Deputy O'Donnell's sincerity in bringing forward this legislation.  However, if she or the Progressive Democrats believe it will solve the problems in prisons, they do not have the type of experience <Col N="1413" /> they will need if given the reins of Government after the next general election.</P>
      <P>For a long time I listened to people talk about the ills in the prison service.  While I am not an expert in this regard, it is clear that over the years many changes should have been made.  It is surprising that there is a concerted effort to try to put the spotlight in a negative way on the Minister for Justice, although I understand that is what politics is about.  It appears Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats believe crime will be a huge issue at the next general election.  It has always been an issue, as they well know. However, the record of all parties will be considered. We only have to look back three or four years.  No remarkable changes were made by Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats when they had the opportunity to implement them.  It is easy to talk on the Opposition benches but I have not seen any initiatives which would improve the prison system.  I am the first to admit that things have to change.  The Minister for Justice has done more in the past year or two than was done in the previous eight to ten years.  Fundamental changes have taken place or are in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>We have a prison population of about 2,300 and some 800 extra spaces will be created over the next 12 months.  Places have been found at about five or six centres and the Castlerea complex is coming on stream, which is a welcome development.  According to this Bill, we could put more people in jail at less cost and with fewer staff.  That would be a fair economic trick.  The Progressive Democrats would be doing something which no Minister for Justice or Government could do.</P>
      <P>There are considerable inefficiencies in the system. An independent prison agency is a good idea, but it will take time to implement.  We are living in an increasingly aggressive society. Nobody could say it is fun to look after some of those in our prisons.  There are some vicious characters in our jails and while I would not deny these people their rights, some have shown scant regard for the rights of their victims.  There is a tendency among those who have not been affected by these vicious people to have a do-gooder attitude.  I believe rights must be balanced. We need professional prison staff.  I find no fault with the staff as they do their job as best they can.</P>
      <P>When there is even a small breach of security, the Opposition throw everything at the Government. When a prisoner escaped from Shelton Abbey to go for a pint, one would have thought there was a huge breach of security and Deputy O'Donnell tried to make a meal out of the escape.  I do not know exactly what happened but in an open prison one must expect people to be given certain liberties.  I hope the inmates placed in open prisons are suitable.</P>

I have no doubt that if I am here after the election the same will apply because political parties have the answer to every question confronting the nation when in Opposition and none more so than those on law and order.

I am not blaming the Progressive Democrats unduly for the situation.  As Deputy Connaughton said, the problem which most concerns people is law and order.  The economy is at an all-time high &mdash; we have never had it so good.  However, people's overriding concern is law and order &mdash; the right to sleep in their beds at night without fear of their lives being taken.  Last year unfortunately 18 women were murdered here.  Over the years I have been described here as a member of the &ldquo;hang 'em and flog 'em&rdquo; brigade.  My views are hard-line and I make no apologies for them. I am closer to the people and to law and order than most Deputies here, many of whom I would describe as &ldquo;bleeding hearts&rdquo; and people who believe, more particularly, in civil rights.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming in to listen to the matter I wish to raise.  In his Second Stage speech on the Employment Equality Bill, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, said:</P>
      <P>It fulfils our commitment to introduce broad ranging legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment on the grounds of gender, marital and family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race and membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary the Minister did not refer to need for the Minister for Health to amend the Medical Practitioners Act to ensure the discrimination against doctors who have long periods of temporary registration here will be ended.</P>
      <P>For some time now I have raised the question of the implementation of section 27(2)(d) with the Minister for Health and also with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the way in which it is used by the Medical Council to discriminate against doctors, including those who have taken Irish citizenship.  Under this section the Medical Council insists that doctors who have had temporary registration here for long periods re-sit basic medical examinations before getting permanent registration.  For example, I have a case of a doctor who practiced in a speciality here for ten years and is being refused permanent registration on the basis that qualifications earned at that time from reputable universities are not recognised.  In other words, a person who was recognised as being suitable to practice here is now deemed not to be suitably qualified.  It is obvious that the purpose of this legislation is not to ensure standards but to inhibit the registration of foreign doctors here.  In one case the doctor is an Irish citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most forms of discrimination are subtle and include putting clever barriers in the way of <Col N="1416" /> people.  This would seem to be a classical example of same.  A recent newspaper article stated that the Medical Council intended to introduce a written examination and a language test in English for all doctors seeking temporary registration in Ireland from this month onwards.  Apparently this requirement will apply to all non-European graduates, including those coming from English speaking countries, such as the US, Canada and Australia.  It is extraordinary that doctors coming from European countries where English is not the normal spoken language are not required to pass a language test while those coming from countries where English is a common language are required to pass this test.</P>
    <P>The Medical Council should be asked to explain the reason this practice was introduced and on what grounds it can be based on language requirements.  I have raised this question with both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform over a considerable period.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform dodged the issue of discrimination and passed it on to the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health has hidden behind the Medical Council.  In a reply on 3 July 1996 &mdash; Official Report, vol. 468, col. 196 &mdash; the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Medical Council under the provisions of section 27 of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 has statutory responsibility for granting full registration in the General Register of Medical Practitioners if it is satisfied that the applicant meets the criteria for full registration.</P>
    <P>The council has been given these responsibilities because it has the particular professional expertise required to carry out these functions.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to interfere or try to interfere with the independence of the Council in the carrying out of these functions.</P>
    <P>This is a total cop-out by the Minister as it is under an Act which he has not yet amended, that the Medical Council is acting in a discriminatory fashion.  I hope the Minister will bring this discriminatory practice to an end by introducing amending legislation immediately to ensure everybody is treated equally.</P>

      <P>A significant amount of preparatory work has been done on a comprehensive amendment of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  Among the issues to be addressed are the criteria for temporary registration and full registration. In framing these provisions we will take full account of case law in this area as well as adhering to the principles of natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the primary functions of the Medical Council is to protect the public from, among other things, inadequately educated or poorly trained doctors.  The council must exercise vigilance in granting full registration to overseas <Col N="1417" /> doctors who thereby acquire the same rights and status as the graduates of Irish medical schools.</P>
    <P>It should be understood that the category of &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; exists to facilitate overseas doctors who wish to pursue post-graduate training in Ireland.  The extent of temporary registration is limited by statute to a total of five years.  There is no automatic entitlement to progress from temporary registration to full registration.  The Department of Health and the Medical Council have examined these issues in some depth in preparing amendments to the Act and are agreed that changes need to be made to allow the council greater discretion in granting full registration to doctors whose training experience would not qualify them for full registration under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendments to be made in this area will not be designed to discriminate intentionally against any particular group.</P>

      <P>The future prospects for this plant have improved significantly since I attempted to raise the matter on the Order of Business this morning.  While I was glad to hear this, the future of the jobs at Youghal Carpets continues to be of concern.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to secure the future of the plant and the majority of the 320 jobs.  The workforce at Youghal Carpets (Yarns) Limited is highly skilled and motivated.  It has undergone extensive restructuring in recent years and operates to high efficiency and low cost levels.  It is important to acknowledge this.</P>
      <P>The unemployment figures for Cork city continue to be unacceptably high.  For example, the number on the live register increased from 17,106 in November 1994 to 17,280 in November 1996. Since then Cork Crown at Holyhill has closed with the loss of 110 jobs.  Even as I speak, a number of jobs in the road haulage sector are seriously at risk because of the difficulties at Bell Lines Freight Transport Group.  I appreciate that some new jobs have been created in the Cork area but they have not kept pace with the number lost.  As I have previously stated in the House, it is just as important to save existing jobs as it is to create new ones.  I ask the Minister to spare no effort in ensuring that the majority of these jobs are secured for the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the news that a compromise has been reached and that Youghal Carpets has once again been saved from closure. However, this ongoing saga cannot continue and there must be greater consolidation of the industry <Col N="1418" /> in that area.  The yarn and textile industry cannot continue to endure the stop-go policy pursued in recent years.  The number of jobs created in the textile industry last year was 282, approximately half the number of 558 created in 1992.  This is not satisfactory.  The people in the south west cannot continue to be left without industries.</P>
      <P>I was saddened this morning to hear of the problems at Youghal Carpets.  The majority of jobs are created in the Dublin region and the people of the south-west were the losers last year in terms of job creation.  We have a Dublin oriented Government but this does not mean it should ignore the south-western area.  Last year 1,189 jobs were created in the south-west, one of the largest areas in the country.  In 1990, 10,254 jobs were created.  When I previously stated that the people of the south-west were the losers in terms of job creation the Minister denied it.  I do not want to be too political or hurtful but I want him to address the problems in the south-west and the surrounding regions.  I welcome the limited number of jobs created in the south-west but we want more flagship industries.  Cork and its surrounding regions are very progressive and if Youghal Carpets had closed we would have lost another flagship industry.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for sharing her time with me.  This is not the first time she has done so.</P>
      <P>Youghal Carpets (Yarns) Limited in Cobh is a unique industry.  To the best of my knowledge, it is the only plant in Ireland which dyes and spins yarns for use in carpet making.  Its workers have built up great skills over the decades and the Government cannot turn its back on them. Countless Government agencies have been set up to help industries in trouble and it is time they took action in this crisis.  I ask the Minister to send his best official to Youghal Carpets tomorrow to ensure all possible steps are taken to save the jobs and help keep this valuable industry in the east Cork region where there is high unemployment. I accept that 700 jobs were created in a factory in Youghal some months ago but the loss of 320 jobs in this plant would be a catastrophe for the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue.  They will be aware that the future of Youghal Carpets was discussed in the House before Christmas.  At that stage I outlined the background to the changes which had taken place in the company in recent years and the ultimate decision by the current owner, Carpets International, to divest itself of all its axminster carpet operations.  I also indicated that there would be full co-operation between the State agencies, particularly the IDA, in the efforts to sell the business as a going concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had established from my contact with the company that Carpets International would fully co-operate in the efforts to secure a prospective <Col N="1419" /> buyer which would help to protect the maximum number of jobs at the plant.  On 17 December I met a number of local public representatives and the union delegation and assured them that every effort would be made to keep the plant open.  I have kept in very close contact with developments and I was hopeful in recent weeks that a deal could be completed with a potential buyer.</P>
    <P>As part of the sale agreement being negotiated, the workforce was to be presented with a restructuring package.  The parties availed of the services of the Labour Relations Commission prior to finalising the proposals to be presented to the workforce.  These were presented at a general meeting of the workforce last Monday.  While some of the workforce accepted them, the majority declined to vote and as a result the proposed sale could not proceed.  In the light of this development Carpets International informed the workforce of its intention to cease operations with a loss of 315 jobs.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, today I requested the Labour Relations Commission to place an officer on standby in Cork this afternoon to provide any further assistance to the parties in an effort to finally resolve matters.  I have been informed that the restructuring proposals were discussed further at a meeting of the workforce this afternoon and a vote was taken on the package. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has indicated that the unionised workforce at Youghal Carpets had accepted the position put forward by the company.  This decision has been conveyed to Carpets International and the prospective purchaser.</P>
    <P>The situation remains delicate.  I understand that the Labour Relations Commission officer on standby in Cork has convened a meeting of the company and unions tonight to consider the outcome of the ballot.  I urge all sides to reflect very carefully on the current situation with the objective of securing a viable future for the company. I also urge them to take adequate time to work out the details and to make good sensible long-term decisions for the future.  It is clearly in the interests of all parties to continue the endeavours to secure the future of the plant and to maximise its employment potential.  I assure the House that the State's dispute settlement agencies and IDA Ireland will continue to be available to assist the parties in whatever way possible.  A very experienced officer is on standby in Cork to assist the parties in their efforts to resolve the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I know you have a particular interest in it, coming from the south-eastern area, as do my colleagues, and I thank the Minister for coming to reply.</P>
      <P>We were all surprised last week when an examiner was appointed to Bell Lines.  Some of us were aware of poor trading results at Bell Lines, particularly since the cranes toppled over last October. I do not wish to comment on the role of the examiner at Bell Lines.  My main purpose in raising this matter is to highlight the crisis facing the workforce at Bell Lines and other haulage firms.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that credit facilities were withdrawn by lending institutions to the haulage firms on the day the examiner was appointed.  I am disappointed that lending institutions, which make profits of £1 million per day, acted in that way.  Haulage firms are mainly family-run by fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters.  They operate on slim profit margins in the region of 3 per cent. They have enormous financial commitments and leasing arrangements; many of us are aware of the capital cost of outfitting a tractor and perhaps several trailers.</P>
      <P>Most of the people concerned are small haulage contractors; there are 103 companies which includes 173 trucks.  Many hauliers have just one or two trucks and they have not been paid since October or November 1996.  I acknowledge some running costs were paid last week but that was only a small amount.</P>
      <P>These people have shown goodwill since the crisis developed at Bell Lines and have operated since the time the money was owed.  They are prepared to continue to do that but they must have some support for their operations.  Evidence suggests that a large number of these small operators will not survive until restructuring has been carried out at Bell Lines.  We are talking about a total of 450 jobs which could be saved at a cost of £1.8 million, approximately £4,000 per job.  That is fair value when one considers what it currently costs for the IDA to provide a job in this country.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed to hear that a large number of hauliers had their credit facilities withdrawn last Friday, and some leasing companies are already demanding the return of their trucks.  The Irish Road Haulage Association wants Bell Lines to continue and will do everything in its power to ensure that it does.  These people are not looking for handouts; they are prepared to pay back anything that may be given to help them survive.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will take note of these facts. I am not sure what he can do but I ask him to do everything possible to ensure the jobs at Bell Lines are saved and that the workforce is given some hope in that regard.  The Minister is aware of the enormous investment by various Departments, Kilkenny County Council and the Waterford Harbour Board in the Belview port development. I hope there is no hidden agenda here and I ask the Minister to do all he can to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern must be expressed about the corporate tactics being employed relative to Bell Lines and I ask the Minister to investigate the machinations involved.  There is a strongly held view among members of the public and those who have dealt with the company that it has been set up for a sell-off and that as part of that sell-off there will be cherry-picking of the most profitable sections.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the major financial difficulties facing the haulage contractors involved. They are mostly small, family-run firms which will be forced to close unless something is done for them.  It is important to contrast the cost of an IDA job in this country from a multinational mobile investment company against the cost of saving what could be a viable and profitable company. I urge the Minister in the strongest terms to do something immediately to alleviate the hardship faced in particular by the family firms of contractors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at what is happening in Bell Lines, the flagship company of the Irish roll-on/roll-off modern container service. This crisis is affecting jobs and creating uncertainty in places like Little Island and Mallow railway station where there are a number of jobs involved.  I am aware some hauliers are owned between £30,000 to £300,000.  I am aware also of a meeting which took place in Kilkenny on Sunday at which people were in tears as a result of what is happening.  That is serious.</P>
      <P>I question the management practices at Bell Lines, particularly in regard to the incident involving a crane crashing into another during a storm.  Safety was an issue in that incident because I understand cranes must be tied down during storms and it is obvious that was not done in this case.  The cost of replacing the two cranes was £10 million yet this company is complaining it has lost business because of the opening of the tunnel between the United Kingdom and France.</P>
      <P>It is important to protect the hauliers who have lost substantial amounts of money and incurred enormous debts.  It is not good enough for them to be told that storm damage is the cause of their problem; the problem goes deeper than that.  I would like to see an investigation into this company.</P>

      <P>I would not have chosen to raise this matter on the Adjournment &mdash; a different mechanism is required to deal with it &mdash; and I will be seeking the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle's office to raise it another way.</P>
      <P>The matters involved here are of the utmost gravity.  I am aware there are forces at work in this whole area &mdash; I am pleased the Minister for the Marine is present &mdash; that deserve investigation. I want the message to go out that if any attempt is made at what can only be described as corporate piracy off the backs of the management, workforce and hauliers in this company, this House will not stand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> I want the Minister to examine closely the examinership process and the reason it was put in place.  I ask him to examine also the competition laws and I want the Competition Authority involved in this matter.  These are matters in which the State has a huge investment and we will not be manipulated by corporate factors external to this country to suit somebody else's agenda.</P>
    <P>These are serious matters of which I am sure the Minister is abreast but they cannot be finalised this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and I am impressed by their strength of feeling and their concerns about the development. I will certainly reflect on what they said.</P>
      <P>The position is that an examiner has been appointed.  The purpose of an examinership is to provide a procedure for the rescue and return to financial health of an ailing but potentially viable company.  Upon appointment of an examiner the company is placed under the protection of the court.  During the period of the protection and while the examiner is preparing his report, no proceedings may be instituted either against the company's assets or to wind up the company.</P>
      <P>As an examiner has been appointed by the court to Bell Lines Freight Transport Group, I have no function or involvement under the Companies Act with this company.  I understand my colleague, the Minister for the Marine, is keeping in close contact with the Waterford Harbour Commissioners on the implications of current developments for the commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time I have had to raise the issue of the Foyle fisheries and the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  I hope the Minister of State is not reluctant to give me a response on the matter.</P>
      <P>On the first occasion I raised the matter I asked that we abandon the crazy suggestion that the commission should take over sea fishing within and outside the Foyle.  I am glad this idea has been shelved.  It was a sign of how out of touch are the hierarchy on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now face the issue of licences, licence fees and fishing opportunities for driftnet fishermen. The Minister recently published regulations, recommended in the Salmon Management Task Force report, on other fishery areas.  He set out details on licences, fishing hours and so forth and Foyle fishermen looked on in envy.  There was no mention of increases in the cost of licences, the standard fee remained at £150 &mdash; it is £302 in the Foyle area.  Why is there discrimination in that regard?  The Minister stated that fishing times would begin at 4 a.m. and end at 9 p.m. Fishermen in the Foyle area work between a 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. deadline.  Why is there discrimination in this area?  The number of fishing days per week in regional areas is being reduced to four, but <Col N="1423" /> fishermen in the Foyle area have worked this reduced week for a number of years.</P>
    <P>A reply to a parliamentary question, dated 4 February, stated &ldquo;the fees charged have not, however, had an unfavourable impact on demand for licences, which continue to exceed supply&rdquo;. This gives the impression that people applying for licences have not expressed concern previously and I refute this.  Members of the Foyle Area Driftnet Association have documentation which shows this matter was raised on at least ten occasions since 1987.</P>
    <P>The reply to the parliamentary questions admits that licence fees have been historically higher than those in fishery board regions, but the aim, role and function of both are essentially the same.  To say the commercial licence fee remained static for a number of years in the 1980s is simply not good enough when one considers the historical framework of the commission since it was set up in 1952.  Surely with inflation this licence &mdash; which entitles the bearer to limited fishing only &mdash; should be less than £100 and not more than £300.  Foyle fishermen want to pay £150 which is what everyone else is paying.  Surely that is not too much to ask.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland the Conservancy Board is able to issue approximately 12 licences, only five of which, to my knowledge, are used.  The cost of those licences is approximately £240.  There is no point in saying the licence fee will not increase for 1997.  Fishermen have been fobbed off with that statement on previous occasions.  If there was no increase in one year, there is a double rise in the subsequent year.</P>
    <P>One hundred and twenty of the 130 applicants &mdash; 92 per cent &mdash; have informed the commission they are not prepared to operate a Foyle area driftnet licence under the current extortionate licence fees and the reduced access to fishing.  The fishermen did not take this decision lightly and have tried to provide constructive options to show how the same finance could be generated by different and more acceptable means.  This is a serious problem which I hope the Minister will consider urgently.  He can correct me if I am wrong, but the entire argument is about approximately £18,000 which is generating huge emotions in the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Area Driftnet Association suggested this could be addressed by the harmonisation of other licences.  If this were done, the association claim it would generate much of the needed revenue. I would appreciate if the Minister would give his views in that regard.  If there are objections to that proposal, there must be other equally valid book-keeping measures that could be used to create similar gains.</P>
    <P>The reply to the parliamentary question stated that the commission had informed the advisory council on a number of issues, but driftnet fishermen withdrew from this council on the 31 July 1996 because of a lack of confidence in the commission <Col N="1424" /> and its consultation process.  Is the hierarchy aware of this?  If not, why?</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine is represented on the commission, it binds the decisions of the commission and the Foyle is under co-jurisdiction. Donegal fishermen on the Foyle want the Minister, who ultimately has responsibility for their welfare, to address their valid concerns.  I understand the commission will meet in the near future.  Will the Minister impress on this meeting the necessity for immediate action on licence fees, hours of fishing and length of season?  The matter should not be allowed get out of hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation of the commercial fisheries of the Foyle area is the responsibility of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, subject to the general requirement that the regulations are approved by the Minister for the Marine and the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Foyle Fisheries Commission was established in 1952 under parallel primary legislation enacted by the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland parliament.  The commission's current core functions are the management, conservation, protection and improvement of the salmon and inland fisheries of the Foyle area generally.</P>
      <P>The commission consists of four members, two each appointed by the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland and the Minister for the Marine.  The chairmanship rotates on an annual basis between the senior commissioners from each side.  As has been the norm for many years, the commissioners are drawn from the two sponsoring Departments.  In addition, the statutory consultative forum of the Foyle Fisheries Advisory Council represents local commercial fishermen and anglers.</P>
      <P>I am advised the specific concerns raised by the Foyle Area Driftnet Association have been put to the commission and are being examined.  These concerns relate to licence fees, the length of the fishing season and daily opening hours for fishing. All of these matters are primarily the responsibility of the commission.  I have agreed to meet a deputation of the Foyle fishermen to give them an opportunity to express their concerns to me directly.</P>
      <P>Existing driftnet licence fees for sea only and lough only licences are £276 and £302 for lough and sea licences.  The licence fees in the Foyle area have remained static in real terms since the early 1980s, apart from increases in line with inflation.  The commission advises that the fees charged for commercial licences have not had an unfavourable impact on demand for licences, which continues to exceed supply.  I understand the Commission has already informed the advisory council that licence fees will not be increased for 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission's revenues, which constitute about 37 per cent of total annual income, have <Col N="1425" /> been traditionally insufficient to meet its costs and the income deficit, amounting to approximately 63 per cent of total annual income, is funded jointly by the Irish and United Kingdom authorities.  Licence fees account for almost 90 per cent of total revenues and given the stated objective to reduce progressively the deficit, a reduction in licence fees is not a feasible proposition.</P>
    <P>The Foyle Area (Close Season) Regulations, 1993 provide for a driftnet open season from 15 June to 31 July, inclusive.  I understand, following representations the commission made proposals last September to the advisory council which would allow, among other matters, for a review of target escapement figures following completion of habitat surveys and scientific assessment of the catchment.</P>
    <P>The commission's scientific advisers expect to be in a position in the coming weeks to give an assessment of the salmon escapement targets. The commission may then propose an extension of the commercial netting season to 6 August on the condition that the revised target escapement figures are met.  I understand the commission has advised the Foyle Area Driftnet Association of this approach.</P>
    <P>The existing daily opening hours are between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m.  I understand that the Foyle Area Driftnet Association has sought an extension to allow fishing between 4 a.m. and 9 p.m.  The commission considers that an increase in fishing effort through extending the fishing day cannot, on the basis of all the scientific evidence, be justified.</P>
    <P>While these specific issues are primarily a matter for the commission, it would be useful to put the concerns of the Foyle fishermen in the wider context of the challenge facing those involved in salmon management.  We have the common task of delivering on the conservation policy objective while having due regard to all legitimate interests in the salmon fishery.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently introduced a new package of salmon conservation measures designed to secure and augment salmon stocks and which have brought in major restrictions on the interceptory drift net fishery in terms of season, area, and permitted fishing effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>May we have the same restrictions, please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>New conservation and management strategies are essential if we are to reverse <Col N="1426" /> the decline in salmon stocks over the past three decades.  We are now taking steps to put a comprehensive new regime in place beginning with the conservation measures.  It would be inconsistent and inappropriate to seek to have a relaxation of the management and conservation regulations operating in the Foyle area unless the commission and its scientific advisers considered these to be justified by reference to the state of stocks.</P>
      <P>Stocks of salmon in the Foyle area declined dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s.  The real time fishery management system introduced by the commission in the mid-1970s in response to the decline relates fishery management activity to actual levels of escapement.  The commission has, since 1975, expressed the objectives of its conservation work in terms of the maximum sustainable yield of salmon from the Foyle.  Generally, its conservation operations have been effective in recent years.  I am aware that last year was a difficult one in the Foyle fishery because target escapement figures were not met and thus netting was suspended on two occasions during the season. The effect of conservation measures, including the reduced season introduced in 1993, and the reassessment of target figures will inform future management decisions by the commission.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that following a comprehensive review of the operation funding structure and staffing of the commission, a number of proposals are being brought forward which will enable the Foyle Fisheries commission to realise new opportunities for development and strategic planning on an efficient and effective basis.  It is proposed to expand the statutory role of the Commission to include, for the first time, the development of the fisheries resource and the promotion and development of angling facilities.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to restructure and enhance the role of the advisory council to enable it to play a more strategic, executive role in setting future directions for the commission.  This will enable all the users of the resource, including commercial fishermen, to play a more substantial role in decision making and will allow for a greater degree of consultation and input on management and conservation strategies in the Foyle area and for better understanding by all the sectoral interest of the rationale behind those strategies.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13 February 1997.</P>

    <P>In December 1995, I launched the competitive tendering scheme (AER II) to secure an electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatts using biomass or waste as a fuel.  I have received and considered the recommendation of the independent assessor which I appointed to assess the applications received under AER II</P>
    <P>Under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme, a capital grant of up to £7.5 million is available for this project.  The allocation of this grant is subject to certain conditions.  In particular, my Department is required by the European Commission to undertake a socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis study of the recommended project.  This study is being carried <Col N="1429" /> out by an independent consultant appointed by my Department.  I will announce the result of the competition on completion of the study in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>In April 1996, I launched a long-term strategy for renewable energy entitled <i>&ldquo;Renewable Energy &mdash; A Strategy for the Future&rdquo;</i>.  Under the strategy I have set targets for the development of renewables in Ireland up to the year 2010.  My strategy sets a target of an additional 100MW from renewables by the end of 1999.  This consists of 90MW from wind energy, 3MW from hydro and 7MW from biomass/waste.  I have also allowed for the construction of Ireland's first wave energy to electricity pilot plant.  I propose to allocate £7.5 million under the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme to support projects up to the end of 1999.</P>
    <P>The process of appointing an independent agency to conduct the competition to secure these targets is now under way.  My strategy also set targets for the period 2000 to 2010 consisting of a target of 30MW for wind energy and 1MW for hydro each year.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the EU Thermie programme which provides significant financial support for energy demonstration projects, including renewables.  In recognition of the positive impact of this on renewable energy development in Ireland, I have included a special Thermie support initiative in my renewable energy strategy which guarantees electricity market access for successful renewable energy Thermie projects.</P>

      <P>Ireland has international obligations arising from European Union Directives and membership of the International Energy Agency to maintain at all times the equivalent of 90 days stocks of crude oil and/or oil products, based on the previous year's consumption.</P>
      <P>Our national oil stocks consist of operational stocks held by oil companies and major importing consumers at various locations around the country for the purpose of trade; stocks held in Ireland by or on behalf of the National Oil Reserves Agency at Whitegate Refinery, Whiddy Oil Terminal and at oil company facilities at Dublin and Shannon, and stocks held abroad under bilateral agreements on behalf of NORA in Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK.</P>

    <P>We have 1.6 million tonnes of oil stocks.  All our fuel oil requirements are held in Ireland.  We <Col N="1430" /> have approximately 42 days petrol and diesel stocks held abroad.  Under the International Energy Agency method of calculation which is based on net imports of crude oil equivalent stocks amounted to 102 days of net imports.

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland's geographically-based national radon survey is progressing and is continuing to assist in identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.  Recently, the results of the average radon concentrations for houses measured in counties Cavan, Dublin, Louth, Monaghan and Wicklow were published and these are available from the Institute.  Data for the remaining counties will become available, on a phased basis between now and 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Ministers for Transport have made it clear that they wish to see the highest possible degree of accessibility to public transport services for wheelchair users and other people with mobility impairments, having regard to the resources at the operators' disposal. That is also my policy in this area.  The development and implementation of specific proposals for accessibility enhancements is a matter for transport operators themselves.</P>
      <P>In response to that policy, the CIE companies in recent years have made considerable efforts to make their services more accessible to passengers with mobility impairments.  A very significant degree of accessibility has already been achieved on the railway and the two CIE bus companies continue to give a high priority to accessibility requirements in the course of their fleet replacement programmes.</P>
      <P>The single most difficult challenge facing bus operators in this regard is that of making their services fully accessible to wheelchair users. Because of the additional costs and possible operational limitations associated with buses which are fully wheelchair accessible, neither of the CIE bus companies has vehicles of this kind in operation on mainstream scheduled services. However, I understand that both companies are undertaking initiatives to test low-floor buses under normal operating conditions.  I warmly welcome this practical evidence of their commitment to the search for an affordable and operationally-proven strategy to meet the needs of mobility-impaired and disabled customers on a cost-effective basis.</P>

    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, has received the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The report is being considered at present by an inter-departmental task force established by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform which has been asked to draw up a plan of action based on the report's recommendations.  My Department is represented on the task force which, it is anticipated, will have prepared its plan of action by <Col N="1432" /> mid-year.  Until the task force has reported and the Government has been given an opportunity to consider its recommendations, it would be premature to enter into any commitments in relation to either the report's individual recommendations or possible future developments in public transport accessibility policy in general.</P>

      <P>Cellular telephony is a radio-based technology and is only made possible by the erection of transmitting and receiving antennae at locations which enable radio signals to be accessed.  Where possible the antennae can be mounted on a tall building.  More often, a suitable existing structure is not available and a purpose built mast must be erected.  I fully understand the conflict that this engenders in certain areas between inclusion of the area within mobile telephone coverage and preservation of a mastfree environment.  There are unfortunately no technological solutions which avoid this conflict most particularly where there are no existing suitable structures.  It is, however, a matter for the planning authorities to seek to find the appropriate balance and there is, of course, a general right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála.  However, my Department did assist the Department of the Environment in preparing the guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures which were published last year by my colleague the Minister for the Environment. These guidelines go a considerable way towards clarifying the issues for local authorities.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No. 9 on 5 December 1996. The position as outlined in that reply remains unchanged.  It is still too early to say if the deposit will be economical to develop to the stage where a State mining facility might be considered, and I do not expect the company to be in a position to provide any information for public consumption for very many months yet.</P>
      <P>It might help the Deputy to appreciate the situation if he considers that prospecting licences are normally issued for six year periods subject to renewal at the licenceholder's request in the event that all technical and expenditure commitments entered into have been met in full.  Where an exploration company finds promising signs of mineralisation it will seek a renewal of the licence to facilitate further exploration and allow for consideration of development of a mine.  It could take over two years from the time that a company is satisfied that it has a commercial deposit and a decision is made to apply for a State mining facility, together with planning permission and an integrated pollution control licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, through to opening of a mine.</P>
      <P>Because of the amount of information which already existed about the Glangevlin deposit it was decided to limit to two years the period of validity of the current prospecting licence for the area, that is, to 31 March 1998.  I would not expect the licenceholder to be in a position to make an informed decision as regards the future of the deposit before 31 March 1998.  The question of renewing the licence might be considered if favourable grounds emerge and the licenceholder wishes to continue exploration there with an acceptable work programme.  However, if meanwhile the licenceholder obtains a significant amount of unfavourable data over a prolonged period the licence might be surrendered.</P>
      <P>I do not have any information available to me at this stage which could usefully indicate what the company's intentions might be in six or 12 months' time.  The technical staff of my Department are, however, satisfied with the progress made on exploration of the deposit to date and will continue to monitor exploration activity by the licenceholder.</P>

      <P>To date three groups holding offshore petroleum authorisations have made firm plans to undertake drilling programmes in the Irish offshore during 1997.  Both Marathon International Petroleum Hibernia Ltd. and Total Oil Marine plc. intend drilling exploration wells under their Frontier Exploration Licences.  It is likely that Total will drill in the Porcupine Basin, commencing in May or June, where they have already carried out a site survey.  Marathon will also drill in the Porcupine Basin this year but have not yet indicated a firm commencment date.</P>
      <P>Statoil Exploration (Ireland) Limited hold a Lease Undertaking in the Connemara Field and plan to drill an appraisal well, starting in March or April, on which an extended well test will be carried out.  They then propose to drill a second appraisal well, to be followed by a detailed test. Should the result of the two wells be encouraging, the company will proceed to declare the field commercial and will move to full production requiring possibly up to ten development wells to be drilled.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil plc were prepared to drill in the Kish Basin last year but were unable to do so.  It is expected that they will seek approval to drill there this year.</P>

      <P>The essential elements of the political agreement arrived at in the Telecommunications Council on 18 December 1996 are: the defining of the minimum universal service as the permanent provision of a postal service of specified quality at all points in the territory at affordable prices for all users including door-to-door deliveries five days per week as well as ensuring that the density of contact points is adequate for the needs of users; rules on quality of service for both national and cross-border mail, cost accounting and terminal dues &mdash; the arrangements by which postal operators compensate each other for delivery cross-border mail &mdash; which are related to costs; the designation of a national regulatory authority in each member state legally separate from and operationally independent of the postal authority; a reserved area of letter mail costing up to five times the basic tariff and weighing up to 350 grammes to support the universal service.  Any mail outside these parameters will be liberalised when the Directive comes into force; that the Council and the European Parliament will decide not later than January 2000 on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of the postal sector on the basis of proposals to be made by the Commission before 1998 following a review of the sector &mdash; this further liberalisation to take effect from 2003.</P>

      <P>In May 1995, the Government approved in principle the injection of equity in three tranches into Bord na Móna and a corresponding reduction of an average £6 per tonne in 1993 prices in the price of milled peat sold to the ESB.  These measures were designed to deal with Bord na Mona's unsustainable debt problem in an open and transparent manner, and to enhance the economics of electricity generated from peat.</P>
      <P>The first tranche of equity, £49 million, was injected into Bord na Móna in December 1996 upon receipt of the decision from the EU Commission which found that the proposed equity injection did not constitute State aid within the meaning of the provisions of the EU Treaty.  I intend, with the concurrence of my colleague the Minister for Finance, to inject the remaining two tranches of equity into the company over the next two to three years.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna have been instructed to make the necessary arrangements, in consultation with the ESB, to implement the first phase of the reduction in the price of milled peat.  Further phased reductions in the price of milled peat sold to the ESB will be made in line with further injections of equity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 42 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January 1996, at a public planning inquiry in Cumbria, I set out the Irish Government's objections to the underground rock laboratory at Sellafield currently being proposed by Nirex which I saw as the precursor to a nuclear waste facility for the area.  Recently, there has been a spate of media publicity relating to information which has emerged concerning the scientific and economic arguments about this project.  I welcome the debate which this has engendered and regard it <Col N="1439" /> as playing a positive role in furthering opposition to the proposal.</P>
    <P>Taking this information into account and given the prospect of a decision by Secretary of State John Gummer, MP, I wrote to him last week reiterating Ireland's strenuous objections to the Nirex proposals and highlighting the fact that there has been an absence of a fully open and transparent site selection process with independent review.</P>
    <P>I indicated that this made it impossible to understand the environmental basis on which the choice of location for the project, so near to the Irish Sea, was made.  I called for the plan to be abandoned and maintained that more research should be undertaken into alternative sites and disposal options which would avoid an environmental threat to the Irish Sea.  I urged him to refuse Nirex's appeal, or at the very least, to re-open the inquiry so that the many scientific and geological factors which have come to light could be properly assessed.</P>
    <P>I reiterated my objections to the Nirex facility at a meeting with the British Ambassador last Friday and I expressed my concern that if eventually approved, this facility could, unfortunately, prove a permanent and constant bone of contention between our two countries.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the UK Government has now decided to engage in a public consultation process about a whole series of additional information which has come to light in the recent past about the Nirex proposal.  My Department will be included in this consultation process.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the results of this new consultation will eventually be considered by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment when he adjudicates on the Nirex appeal.  Accordingly, my Department will now examine this new area of consultation and elaborate, as necessary, on our strenuous opposition to the Nirex proposal because of the environmental risk which it represents.</P>
    <P>I have previously made firm commitments about the Government's determination to prevent this dump being located at the Sellafield site.  We will not shrink from pursuing the case further if the rock characterisation facility is approved, drawing upon the best scientific and legal advice to advance our case.</P>
    <P>The UK nuclear industry has been operating for many decades.  All the benefits of the electricity production, and industrial activity which derives from it have accrued to the UK.  At the same time the threat of hazard from UK nuclear reactors and waste inventories affects neighbouring countries who do not share these benefits.  We therefore have the absolute right to insist that the UK bear the cost of keeping this hazardous waste totally contained and isolated from our shared environment.</P>

      <P>Offenders are liable on summary conviction to a maximum fine of £800 and or a maximum of 12 months imprisonment or, on conviction on indictment, a fine of up to £50,000 and or imprisonment for up to five years.  I am aware that, with equipment currently available on the market, there is the possibility of listening to conversations on the analogue (088) mobile system and while the practice is illegal, it is very difficult to detect.

      <P>The annual accounts of the Aer Lingus Group for the year ended 31 December 1996 are in preparation and will be published in the near future.  Prior to publication they will, as is customary, be presented to Government and subsequently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to discuss specifics at this stage, but I am aware that the Aer Lingus Group performed satisfactorily in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that not too long ago Aer Lingus was in the grip of a financial crisis which, if it has not been satisfactorily addressed, would have led to the demise of the airline.  A restructuring programme covering the periods 1993-5, supported by Government equity of £175 million, was implemented which was designed to <Col N="1441" /> save the company in the short term and alter its commercial outlook in the longer term.</P>
    <P>Successful implementation of the restructuring programme required radical change in Aer Lingus.  Substantial cost savings were achieved and changes in work practices and employment were implemented.  These measures, with the disposal of non-core assets, refocused the efforts of Aer Lingus on the core business of air transport.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the objectives of the restructuring programme resulted in the Aer Lingus Group returning an operating profit of nearly £50 million, and a net profit in excess of £15 million, in the year ended 31 December 1995. The coming years will be a testing period for the company.  Deputies will be aware that aviation is a cyclical industry which is at present enjoying a period of global profitability.  Aer Lingus, like all other airlines, must use the opportunity afforded by the current upturn to position itself to withstand the effects of the inevitable market decline. To achieve that, the 1993-5 restructuring programme must not be seen as a one-off exercise.</P>
    <P>State aid and the protection of flag carriers are things of the past.  The Aer Lingus of the future must operate in a resolutely commercial manner, concentrating on its core business &mdash; air transport. In a liberalised airline environment, the secret of success lies in a commitment to service and value for money, allied to a constant focus on reducing costs.</P>

      <P>Mr. Doyle's contract involves the preparation of a synopsis on issues relating to the Dublin light rail project based on, <i>inter alia,</i> an examination of relevant documentation interviews with interested parties including CIÉ, local authorities, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Garda; participation as an observer at meetings involving the above organisations.</P>
      <P>Since the December 1995 launch of the CIÉ public consultation programme in relation to the Tallaght-Dundrum light rail line numerous studies have been prepared by the CIE Project Team and I have no function in relation to these.  My Department has commissioned one study which was a comparative socio-economic evaluation of the Tallaght-Ballymun and Tallaght-Dundrum lines.

      <P>The air transport liberalisation measures adopted in the EU allow for free access to the market.  It is open to individual airlines to operate whatever international routes they wish depending on their own commercial judgment.  From 1 April 1997, this freedom will be extended to include operation of internal point to point services in any member state by air carriers licensed by other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> EU Council Regulation 2408/92 allows for the attachment by a member state of public service obligations in respect of scheduled air services to airports serving peripheral or development regions in its territory to routes to any regional airport in its territory where the traffic is thin and which are considered vital for the economic development of the region served by the airport. Under the regulation a member state may reimburse an air carrier for the discharge of public service obligations.</P>
    <P>Public service obligations have been attached to the air routes linking Dublin and the regional airports at Carrickfin, County Donegal, Sligo, Galway and Farranfore, County Kerry.  Operating contracts were awarded following a competitive tendering process for three of these routes &mdash; Dublin-Galway, Dublin-Kerry and Dublin-Carrickfin. Proposals for the fourth route, DublinSligo, are at present being examined in my Department with a view to early commencement of an operating contract.  The provision in my Department's 1997 Vote for the programme is £1.6 million.</P>
    <P>The public service programme improves access to the north-west, west and south-western regions of Ireland through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin.  I do not consider that it is necessary to attach public service obligations to any further routes.  Aer Lingus operates services on a commercial basis between Shannon Airport and Dublin and between Cork Airport and Dublin.  As I mentioned, Irish airlines or airlines from any other EU member state are free to operate internal services if they wish to do so, with effect from 1 April 1997.  They would, of course, have to satisfy themselves that the services would be economically viable.</P>

      <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for nuclear safety, I have availed of all opportunities to highlight the concerns of the Government and Irish people about the safety of the British nuclear industry generally and Sellafield, both bilaterally and at a wider international level.</P>
      <P>My main concerns include the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the THORP plant at the Sellafield complex, the ageing Magnox reactors at the site, the facilities for the storage of high level radioactive liquid waste and proposals by UK Nirex Limited for a nuclear waste repository.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I in the recent past have written to the UK authorities and expressed the concerns of the Government and the Irish public about Sellafield's activities generally and more particularly about the age, safety and reliability of such Magnox reactors, increased levels of Technetium-99 in the Irish Sea from discharges from the Sellafield plant, Nirex's proposals for an underground nuclear waste repository and the level of safety in the UK's nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, I met, at my request, the British Ambassador.  I conveyed to her the Government's concerns about the recent reports of incidents at the Sellafield complex, our concerns about the possibility of an accident at the high level waste tanks at Sellafield which the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has identified as a major accident risk, and our objections to proposed further developments by UK Nirex Limited of a nuclear waste repository near Sellafield.</P>
      <P>I called on the British Government to carry out an independent engineering study on the probability and possibility of an accident involving the storage of high level waste at Sellafield.  I also requested copies of documentation of probability risk assessment which up to now BNFL have refused to release publicly.</P>
      <P>I requested that an independent safety review of all the operations at the Sellafield complex be undertaken.  I also asked that information relating to safety reviews carried out for the various UK nuclear installations be made public.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador assured me that she would convey our concerns to the British Government. I will continue to press for action on these issues. It should be evident from the above that this Government is committed to pursuing all realistic and effective courses of action to convey to the British authorities the concerns of the Irish people about the British nuclear industry.</P>

      <P>The taking of an action against Sellafield by the State itself has been and remains a very complex and difficult legal matter.  It would be highly irresponsible of me or the Attorney General to commence such a case without having the crucial element on which grounds for legal redress by the State relies, namely firm scientific evidence.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the State's general approach to the current high court action taken against BNFL by the County Louth residents. This was outlined in the Minister for the Environment's answers to Questions Nos. 28, 53, 71 and 120 of 13 November 1996.</P>
      <P>Following the Supreme Court decision of 24 October 1996 the ministerial committee on Sellafield met and the proposals were brought to Government leading to the decision to offer State financial assistance and other support for the residents in respect of specific items of scientific investigation, research and other work to be identified and to seek agreement for the removal of the State as the defendant from their action.  This general approach still stands.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental working group, subordinate to the ministerial committee on Sellafield, was also set up and is continuing to assemble and provide the County Louth residents with all available documentation in Departments and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to assist them in their case against BNFL.</P>
      <P>As I said on many occasions, detailed consideration continues to be given to all options for legal redress but a sustainable legal case which relies on sound scientific evidence is, of course, a vital element in this matter.</P>
      <P>Sellafield will remain a priority for this Government and it is committed to taking all feasible action open to it to secure the objective of the eventual closure of Sellafield.  Concerns about Sellafield will be highlighted and pursued in every appropriate international forum at every opportunity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> In line with the mechanisms which have been established, whereby access and infrastructural projects for islands are selected and prioritised at local level, Cork County Council submitted a list of projects to the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee for consideration for funding from the £1 million.  Following consultation with their islands committee, the council identified the development of the Lough Beal (Pontoon) pier at Castletownbere as the priority access project for the Cork islands.  On the recommendation of the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, I allocated a grant of £328,000 towards the cost of the project.</P>
    <P>The extension of the pier at Whiddy Island was one of a number of other access proposals which were included in the list of projects which Cork County Council submitted last year.  The council have been asked to supply technical details of these proposals for assessment by the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee, with the expert assistance of the Department of Marine. The allocation of funds for further island access proposals, over and above funds which have been allocated for priority projects, will be made on the basis of the recommendations of the inter-departmental co-ordinating committee and the availability of funding.</P>

      <P>In considering the overall thrust and impact of spending financed from the surplus of the national lottery, the group should focus on the allocation of funds administered by Departments under discretionary schemes involving financial support for voluntary, e.g. sporting and community, agencies.</P>
      <P>The group should review the procedures for processing applications and should recommend such improvements as it considers necessary to ensure maximum transparency in the allocation of the lottery surplus.

The group should submit its report to the Minister for Finance by end-February 1997.</P>
      <P>Subject to the foregoing, the group will review the procedures by which all allocations from the beneficiary fund for cultural purposes are proposed to Government; and will recommend whatever changes may be necessary to ensure the beneficiary fund contributes effectively to development of the arts, heritage and Irish language sectors as intended at the inception of the national lottery.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in the taxation of cross-Border workers were thoroughly investigated by an interdepartmental committee which I established in 1995. This committee found that the treatment of cross-Border workers for the purposes of income tax is fair and reasonable <i>vis-á-vis</i> other Irish taxpayers. Consequently, the committee felt that there is no justification for any special income tax treatment of these workers as compared to any other category of Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
      <P>However, the committee did make other recommendations, most notably to exempt cross-Border workers from the health and employment and training levies.  I announced such an exemption in last year's budget and this was introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also recommended that cross-Border workers should avail of the direct debit system as a means of paying their Irish tax liability and this now applies for the preliminary tax <Col N="1451" /> payment which was due on 1 November 1996 and which will fall to be due on 1 November of subsequent years.  Full details of this system, including an explanatory leaflet are available from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>That is the current position regarding cross-Border workers.  Like all other Irish taxpayers, these workers must meet their tax liabilities and there are no proposals to modify such liabilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>At present, access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the considerations and implications involved in such a step.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a new and comprehensive legal framework for access to birth records by adopted persons and for post-adoption contact is a priority of the Government.  It is my firm intention that the necessary enabling legislation will be brought forward as quickly as possible after a number of legal and constitutional issues have been clarified.  These legal and constitutional issues will have a direct bearing on the nature and scope of the framework that will be put in place.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I am proceeding with arrangements for the establishment, on an administrative basis, of an adoption contact register to assist adoptees and birth relatives who wish to be put in touch with one another.</P>
      <P>It was decided not to include adoption information under the Freedom of Information Bill as that Bill is essentially a framework piece of legislation. Given their complexity and sensitivity, the issues surrounding adoption could not be adequately dealt with within that framework and are more appropriate to adoption legislation.  I have signalled my commitment to the introduction of such legislation and, therefore, the issue of the compliance of the Freedom of Information Bill with the UN convention on the rights of the child does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that there is some doubt as to whether or not the release of birth information to adopted adults comes under the terms of the <Col N="1452" /> UN convention.  I expect that this issue will be clarified by the UN committee on the rights of the child.  The first national report of Ireland under the convention is due to be heard by the committee in Geneva during 1998.</P>

      <P>Under the Child Care Act, 1991, it is a function of each health board to provide or <Col N="1454" /> ensure the provision in its area of a service for the adoption of children.

      <P>The registration of adoption societies is a function of the adoption board under Part IV of the Adoption Act 1952 and the board shall not register any body of persons unless it is satisfied that the body is competent to discharge the statutory obligations imposed on registered adoption societies.  The board may refuse or cancel a registration if it appears to the board that any person who takes part in the management or control of the body or is engaged on its behalf in connection with the making of arrangements for adoption is not a fit and proper person to act.</P>
      <P>It is open to a person not satisfied with his or her treatment by a registered adoption society to request that the case be referred to the adoption board for determination.

    <P>It is estimated that there will be between 10,000 and 15,000 farmers &mdash; landowners in the areas proposed for SAC status.

      <P>Traffic and parking by-laws made by the Garda Commissioner under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, provide that only omnibuses, i.e. buses operating in a definite route, pedal cycles, and taxis being used in the course of business as taxis and bearing the required roof sign, may use &ldquo;with flow&rdquo; bus lanes.  Contra flow bus lanes are reserved for the use of omnibuses only.  While the by-laws will be replaced by comprehensive traffic and parking regulations which I will make under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, I do not intend to alter the provisions in relation to the use of bus lanes to allow additional categories of vehicles to use such facilities.</P>

      <P>Section 72 of the Roads Act, 1993, gives extensive powers to road authorities to make by-laws to regulate and control skips on public roads.  Such by-laws may, <i>inter alia</i>, specify requirements in relation to the lighting and marking of skips for the purpose of making them readily visible to road users.  A decision to make such by-laws is a <Col N="1460" /> matter for the elected members of individual road authorities.</P>
      <P>I intend shortly to make regulations under section 34 of the Waste Management Act, 1996, in relation to the granting by local authorities of permits to private waste collectors.  Such regulations may specify conditions to be attached to a waste collection permit; the question of mandatory reflectorised markings for waste skips is being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>New legislation is not needed to change the name from regional technical college to institute of technology.  Consultations regarding the implementation of my decision have begun with the Waterford college authorities and the process will be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In line with existing practice, capital and recurrent funding for Waterford will continue to be determined on an annual basis having regard to the college's proposals in its annual programmes and budget submission and the overall funding available.</P>
      <P>Under the National Development Plan 1994-99, £4 million was allocated to Waterford regional technical college in respect of capital developments. This sum has been set aside and remains available for investment in a new library-information technology building which is at present being planned for the college.</P>

      <P>There is nothing further that I can add at this time &mdash; the applications are still being considered.</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a serious problem arising from the increasing use of syringes to threaten, injure or intimidate people.  While there are many provisions in the existing law which can be used to counter this activity, I accept that there is now a need for new and explicit provisions, aimed specifically at this form of criminal conduct.  As I announced on 20 January 1997, I hope to publish shortly a Bill to amend the law relating to nonfatal offences against the person.  That Bill will contain new provisions aimed at people who use syringes to injure or threaten others.</P>

    <P>The figures in the table above represent those candidates who were successful at the competitive interview.  A number of factors, including withdrawal of applications and failure of postinterview medical examinations account for the <Col N="1468" /> difference between the number selected after interview and the number recruited to date.  Also, a number of candidates would be awaiting call-up to the Garda training college.</P>
    <P>Competitions for recruitment of Garda trainees are conducted by the Civil Service Commission on behalf of the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities.  I am informed by the Civil Service Commission that information relating to recruitment competitions is not stored in such a way as to readily facilitate an analysis of those recruited by home address and that given the size of the applicant population, such an analysis would require the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time which could not be justified.</P>

      <P>The Commissioner and the Minister for the Environment have had under consideration the making of such temporary rules to prevent the parking of heavy vehicles in residential areas in the Dublin area.  However, I understand that the drafting of the regulations referred to above is at an advanced stage.  The regulations will include a specific provision to enable local authorities to restrict the parking of large vehicles in specified places or areas.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to the person concerned qualifying for an old age contributory pension.  To qualify for this pension at age 66, a person is required to have been in insurable employment or insurable self-employment before reaching age 56 and satisfy the PRSI contribution conditions.</P>
      <P>Under existing provisions, the individual is required to have, <i>inter alia</i>, a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited to the end of the last tax year before reaching pension age to qualify for the maximum rate of pension or a yearly average of 20 contributions to qualify for a minimum rate of pension.</P>
      <P>The individual to whom the Deputy refers has a yearly average of 11 contributions and accordingly does not qualify for an old age contributory pension under the current provisions.  There is no provision for the payment of additional contributions to gain entitlement.</P>
      <P>However, as the Deputy will be aware from the recent budget debate I announced my intention of extending entitlement to old age contributory pension to individuals who have a yearly average number of contributions from ten to 19.  I will be providing that a yearly average from 15 to 19 will give a pension entitlement of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average from ten to 14 will give a pension entitlement of 50 per cent, as long as the individual has at least 260 paid contributions. I intend to introduce these measures in November 1997.</P>
      <P>As the individual concerned has over 260 paid contributions and a yearly average of 11 contributions, he would appear to be eligible for an old age contributory pension, at a rate of 50 per cent of the maximum rate, when the proposed provisions are implemented in November 1997.</P>

    <P>The scheme provides an allowance for up to three years at the rate of 75 per cent of the relevant social welfare payment for year one, 50 per cent for year two and 25 per cent for year three. A total of 237 persons have completed the scheme.  A total of 4,914 have terminated during the course of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme has proved to be a very worthwhile initiative in encouraging the long-term unemployed to take up employment and self-employment. There are over 16,600 persons currently in receipt of the weekly allowance.  An independent evaluation of the scheme has concluded that it has played a significant role in enabling long-term unemployed people to take up a job or become self-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias de Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware one of the recommendations of the special task force on security for the elderly established in 1996 was that my Department introduce a one-off £2 million grant scheme to provide grant-aid to voluntary organisations in relation to security initiatives for the elderly.  That recommendation was accepted.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I established a National Advisory Committee, on which the National Council for the Elderly, the Irish Association of Victim Support, the Reach Out Campaign, Muintir na Tíre, the Irish Country Women's Association and the Garda Síochána &mdash; Neighbourhood Watch &mdash; were represented, to advise on a suitable scheme that would ensure that the available funds were targeted on the most vulnerable older people and the best possible value for money was achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of the advice of this advisory committee and taking into account the amount of money available and the cost of security equipment, I decided that funding could be provided for: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window <Col N="1473" /> locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
    <P>It was decided that to make the funds available through voluntary organisations was the most appropriate way of ensuring that the most vulnerable older people are targeted by the scheme.  I was aware that many voluntary organisations were already providing services such as those covered by the scheme and had developed expertise and local contacts.  Voluntary groups operate close to the ground and are aware of the greatest need in their communities.  Working with the voluntary sector to deliver these funds to the most needy has the advantage that individual older people need not make an application and can have their needs met with the minimum of administration and without the need for a formal assessment of their circumstances by departmental staff.  I was satisfied that this was the most appropriate way in which to structure my Department's response to the situation.</P>
    <P>The scheme was operated on a one-off basis and was reviewed by the National Advisory Committee at the end of December 1996.  Based on their recommendation and the obvious need to ensure that the most vulnerable older people continue to be assisted I obtained a further £2 million in this year's budget to enable the scheme to continue in 1997.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be advertised shortly in the national papers and will be open for all community and voluntary organisations working with, or providing support for, the elderly to apply.  I have no plans to change the way the scheme operates in 1997 as I consider that the current arrangements are most effective.</P>

    <P>I have again reinforced and emphasised with the industrial development agencies Government policy on the regional distribution of employment opportunities.  There are, however, limitations to the extent to which that policy can be enforced nationally in relation to inward investment projects. In the final analysis, individual foreign investors themselves decide on the particular locations which best suit their own range of requirements.  The strategy being undertaken by the industrial development agencies to ensure the best possible regional spread of new employment opportunities is fully informed by the need to anticipate and meet the requirements of potential investors.</P>

While there is a high level of awareness among specialist IT people in business, there is a need to make senior managers equally aware of the scale of the problem and the timely actions needed to deal with it.

      <Quest>the action, if any, he or State agencies under the aegis of his Department propose to take to ensure that employment is maintained and maximised in Ballinasloe, County Galway; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3988/97]</QRef>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department work hard throughout the country to ensure that new employment opportunities are maximised and that existing jobs are sustained.  I outline below, for the Deputy's information, the efforts being made in this regard in Galway, in particular.</P>
      <P>Over 4,300 people are employed in 260 Forbairt manufacturing and international services companies in County Galway.  Preliminary results from the 1996 Forfás Annual Employment Survey indicate a positive net change of 317 in Forbairt assisted client companies in Galway over the period 1995-96.</P>
      <P>Ballinasloe has an indigenous base of 20 companies, employing approximately 500 people. These companies are supported by Forbairt and include Dubarry Shoes, one of the major employers in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Forbairt is in discussions at present with local community groups, particularly the chamber of commerce in Ballinasloe, with a view to assisting them to progress the establishment of an enterprise centre in the town.  I understand that <Col N="1476" /> the local chamber is currently preparing an application for a feasibility study grant.</P>
    <P>Forbairt plans to continue to encourage the development of existing industry in Ballinasloe through its various support programmes.</P>
    <P>There are 60 overseas companies in the west extending across a wide range of sectors.  These companies provided permanent job opportunities for over 9,100 people last year &mdash; this represented an increase of 7 per cent in the numbers employed in overseas firms in the county in 1995. This increase was the third highest regional increase in the country.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very good performance for the western region, IDA Ireland is acutely aware that the majority of new jobs created in the region were in fact created in the city and its environs.  In full recognition of this, IDA proposes to redouble its efforts this year to achieve a more balanced dispersal of new jobs across the whole region.  Considerable effort and resources have been, and will continue to be, invested in securing this important objective.  More than half of all job creating investments are not mobile because they come from expansions of existing overseas companies which usually take place on their existing site.  Also, many of the new technology-based and large scale investments have specific locational requirements and choose to locate near large urban centres.</P>
    <P>This year, IDA Ireland hopes to achieve a better dispersal pattern in the western region, including Ballinasloe, by taking the following steps: favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible, including the provision of higher grant levels, as appropriate; stimulating and supporting, in conjunction with private sector investors, a major programme of modern advance factory construction at key locations and working closely with local authorities to have available quality sites at priority locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>However, IDA stresses that the final decision on location is made by the investor, not the agency, the investor's decision being based primarily on the competitiveness and general attractiveness of individual locations.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, the Galway county and city enterprise board (CCEB) has supported 49 projects in the Ballinasloe area in a range of sectors, including manufacturing, engineering, tourism, crafts and horticulture.  Grants approved for the projects amount to over £258,500 of which over £178,000 has been drawn down to date.  The projects have resulted in the creation of 66 full-time and 21 part-time jobs in the area.  Galway CCEB will continue to promote local enterprise throughout all areas of the county, including Ballinasloe.</P>

      <Quest>the efforts, if any, which are being made to ensure that the offshore islands will receive additional incentives and assistance under the reviews of the rural environmental protection scheme, agri-tourism scheme and the Leader II programme in view of the extreme peripherality and additional transport costs faced by island communities.</Quest>

      <P>Farmers on offshore islands have benefited from a number of recent initiatives in relation to REPS.  These include: a concession introduced in the 1996 budget, whereby the first £2,000 of REPS payment is disregarded for unemployment assistance means testing purposes &mdash; costs incurred in complying with REPS measures may also be offset against income for social welfare purposes &mdash; the inclusion of grazing rights in eligible areas under REPS; the employment by <Col N="1478" /> Teagasc of a planner, nominated by Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann, to assist in REPS planning work on the islands.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to learn that after a slow start, the level of REPS participation among island farmers has increased substantially over the last 18 months.  My Department will continue to review the operation of REPS in all areas, including the offshore islands, to ensure that the scheme is applied in the most effective and practical way possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the agri-tourism scheme, higher grant rates, compared to those for the rest of the country, already obtain as regards capital investment projects on the islands.  These take account of the additional costs involved in island communities. There are no plans to review the scheme in this context at the moment.</P>
      <P>In relation to Leader, my Department is considering proposals for changes in the programme rules in the context of the mid-term review of the Leader programme which is under way at present.</P>

      <P>Investigations have already been carried out by my Department's Veterinary Laboratory Service (VLS) in relation to two decomposed carcases suspected of bacillary haemoglobinuria (BHU) in the Limerick area.  However, it was not possible to make a conclusive diagnosis owning to the degree of decomposition.  There was not therefore a confirmation of BHU in either case.  The herdowner has received appropriate veterinary advice from the VLS.  The VLS is available to carry out any further necessary investigations at the request of either the landowner or his veterinary practitioner.</P>

      <Quest>the number of recommendations from the National Minerals Policy Review Group report, implemented to date; the number to be implemented in 1997; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4027/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>My 1997 priority in regard to the minerals industry is to progress the permitting of further responsible new mining projects by private investors, leading to worthwhile new job creation, and my Department's endeavours are directed accordingly in close association with the other permitting authorities.  My Department will also continue to proactively encourage minerals explorationists to focus more on identifying further commercial mineral deposits for development. Our commitment to maximising responsible mining and exploration is clear and sustained.</P>
      <P>I am proposing that responsible mining and exploration will also obtain strong Government endorsement in the National Sustainable Development Strategy which will be published in the coming months by the Minister for the Environment. The review group's recommendations 1, 33, 34 and 35 refer.  I will also be reviewing with that Minister the permitting arrangements for mining projects in the interests of further improving the permitting processes and minimising delays to mine start-up and job creation.  The review group's recommendations 29 to 32, 39 (part) 40, 42 and 43, and also paragraphs 6.21 to 6.23 of Partnership 2000 as recently agreed with the social partners refer.</P>
      <P>To date, 20 recommendations of the national minerals policy review group have been implemented, with significant benefit for the minerals industry and the public.  The following table gives details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> I indicated, in answer to Question No. 14 on 5 December 1996, as reported at column 1049, volume 472, No. 5 of the Official Report, that I am favourably disposed to legislating in due course in relation to recommendation No. 14 concerning section 20 of the 1979 Act.  Other suggestions made by the review group for new legislation involve complex legal issues which require further consideration as and when other priorities permit.  The Finance Bill 1997 will give effect to the recent budget provision for a further reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax, from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, and a reduction from 30 per cent to 28 per cent in the corporation tax rate applicable to the first £50,000 of taxable income of companies.  Any further reduction in corporation tax rates or new or enhanced tax allowances for the minerals industry are matters for consideration in the ongoing review of tax policy.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to give effect to recommendations Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 37, 50 and 51.  My Department has no funds at its disposal to give effect to recommendation No. 46, as I explained in reply to Question No. 163 on 4 December 1996, as reported at column 954, volume 472, No. 4 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Recommendations Nos. 47 and 48 are essentially matters for the minerals industry to pursue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Recommendations of the National Minerals Policy Review Group which have been implemented to date</i>
    </P>
    <P>Twenty of the 52 recommendations have already been implemented, notably:</P>
    <P>&mdash; enactment of legislation to provide for renewal of minerals prospecting licences (R.9);</P>
    <P>&mdash; retention of Minister's exclusive right to work minerals (R.13) and holding of meetings with minerals industry representatives (R.23);</P>
    <P>&mdash; provision of incentives to direct attention to underexplored ground (R.19);</P>
    <P>&mdash; more flexible arrangements for approval of joint ventures between minerals prospecting firms (R.20);</P>
    <P>&mdash; further environmental protection at both minerals prospecting and development stages (R.17, 27, 28, 36, 38, 39 (part), 44 and 45);</P>
    <P>&mdash; streamlining of the mine permitting process through closer co-operation between the permitting authorities, namely, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Environmental Protection Agency and the local planning authority &mdash; this applies for example to the detailed assessment of two mine projects, <Col N="1482" /> at Lisheen, Co. Tipperary and Kilbreckan, Co. Clare, currently requiring permits (R.41 (part));</P>
    <P>&mdash; development of financial services for the mining sector (R.49);</P>
    <P>&mdash; responsibility allocated to Geological Survey of Ireland for promoting the Irish minerals industry at home and overseas (R.2 and 24);</P>
    <P>&mdash; ongoing review of levels of taxation etc. affecting the minerals industry (R.3) and of potential viability of evolving smelter technologies (R.52);</P>
    <P>&mdash; 1996 Finance Act provision of a tax allowance for mine rehabilitation expenditure (R.5 (part)); and</P>
    <P>&mdash; 1996 Finance Act reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax (R.4 (part)) from 40 per cent to 38 per cent, and to 30 per cent in the rate of corporation tax applicable to the first £50,000 of taxable income of companies: The 1997 Finance Bill will provide for a further reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 38 per cent to 36 per cent and from 30 per cent to 28 per cent in the rate of corporation tax applicable to the first £50,000 of taxable income of companies.</P>

      <P>During his meeting with the board of Aer Rianta on 13 November 1996, my predecessor asked the company to look at its airport charges to see if they could be reduced further.  While noting that charges at the State Airports compared favourably with charges elsewhere in Europe, he asked whether, in the light of growth in passengers and revenues, Aer Rianta could be even more competitive on charges.</P>
      <P>Following a review by Aer Rianta of airport charges, I recently approved a proposal from the company for a new rolling 5 year traffic growth incentive scheme at the State airports with effect from 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>I will arrange for copies of the relevant press releases to be transmitted to the Deputy.</P>

At this stage, the mandate does not allow for negotiations on traffic rights.  The first round of negotiations took place on 30-31 October last.  It is too early to speculate on the outcome of these negotiations and any consequent implications for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the introduction of Teilifís na Gaeilge (TnaG) has caused disruption to the reception of RTE 1 or Network 2, or to the television programme services provided by licensed cable and MMDS operators.  The Deputy, may, therefore, by referring either to difficulties with the direct reception of television services coming from the UK or even to the re-transmission of those services by unlicensed UHF deflector operators.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that my primary role in the area of interference prevention is to ensure the clear reception of the Irish national services.  In so far as it did not conflict with this role, we have made every effort not to impinge on the direct reception of television services from the UK when assigning frequencies to national services.  I must make it clear that off-air reception of UK services in Ireland is something that is purely fortuitous.  The UK authorities do not plan for the reception of their services here; these signals are simply overspills which can be picked up.  Up to recently, because only two of the four Irish services were in operation we have not had to draw on our entitlement to these frequencies, and we were able to plan things so that off-air reception of both sets of national services was possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that since the advent of TnaG, difficulties <Col N="1492" /> have been encountered in the direct reception of services from the UK in some areas.  This is not surprising and is a result of the fact that, by and large, all the Irish and UK services are operating in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) band.  The use of that band was never planned for the reception, in any one place, of all those services for the simple reason that there is not enough space available in it.</P>
    <P>As new services, such as TnaG and the proposed TV3, are added, and the coverage and reception quality of the existing RTE services are improved, the UHF television band will become so congested that some interference to foreign stations will be unavoidable.  The situation is being reached where the spectrum available to Ireland will increasingly have to be used for the development of the Irish national services.</P>
    <P>Because unlicensed UHF deflector systems are similarly dependent on off-air reception of television signals from the UK, the priority given to our own national services will impact on these systems as well.</P>

The information sought by the Deputy on the number of acting higher paid ranks as well as the net cost to the exchequer is not readily to hand and would involve a disproportionate amount of time and effort to research same.  It is estimated, however, that in the region of 110 plus appointments per annum are involved.</P>
