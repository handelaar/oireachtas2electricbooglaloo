      <P>A Thaoisigh, a Thánaiste agus a chairde Gael, before proceeding with the Order of Business this morning, may I be permitted to make a statement for the information of the House?  Since there is much speculation as to when the dissolution of this Dáil will occur, and while I am not privy to the thinking of the Taoiseach in the matter, I deem it timely and important to make an announcement to the Dáil so that you, my peers, will in the first instance be aware of my intentions.</P>
      <P>Under section 36 of the Electoral Act, 1992, if the outgoing Ceann Comhairle does not wish to become a Member of the next Dáil, he or she is obliged to announce to the Dáil that he or she does not desire to become a Member at the ensuing general election.  If such an announcement is not made, then the outgoing Ceann Comhairle is automatically elected to the Dáil at the next general election.  Accordingly, in accordance with section 36 of the Electoral Act, 1992, I wish to formally announce that I do not desire to become a Member of the Dáil at the next general election, consequent on the dissolution of this, the 27th Dáil.  I will not, therefore, be availing of my constitutional right to automatic re-election to the new 28th Dáil.</P>
      <P>I am now in the twilight of a long public career and I deem it far more desirable and appropriate that the people of South Tipperary, who have so consistently honoured me with their votes, should now decide who shall represent them in this new Dáil.  I give to all concerned fair notice of my intentions to hand down the torch of unsullied public service to others in the hope and belief that they too will continue to uphold the best and noblest traditions of the premier county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I count myself most fortunate to have served my country and constituents of South Tipperary for so long and in such exalted positions at home and abroad.  To all who helped me along the way, I extend to them heartfelt everlasting gratitude. To have presided over this great democratic assembly for so long was a dream fulfilled for me <Col N="238" /> and to have shared in the respect, support and the friendship of you, its Members, is a memory I shall cherish most of all.  I extend my gratitude and thanks to the wonderful staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas, of which you should all be proud, and to the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the House, <i>par excellence.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Members, I pay tribute to your service to this House and to the people of Ireland throughout your political career as a Dáil Deputy since 1961.  You are jointly father of this House with another Member who was also elected in that year.  During your political career, you have put the interests of working people very high on your agenda.  You have spoken for all Irish people in your often trenchant contributions from the Opposition benches which I remember.  As Ceann Comhairle, you have treated all Members of the House with consummate fairness.</P>
      <P>You have also, in the decision you have taken and announced today, shown a willingness to put the interests of the people of south Tipperary first and before any personal interests.  The comfort of being re-elected to the Dáil without contest is something that, to my knowledge, no one has ever willingly given up.  You have done so because you are anxious to see active service in this House being available to the people of south Tipperary and to the nation.  That is a unique and selfless decision on your part because you could have remained a Member of this House without contesting the election and without making any great effort subsequently.  You believed it would be an inappropriate way to serve the people and you have taken a selfless decision in that regard, for which Members of this House wish to pay tribute to you.</P>
      <P>I especially enjoyed working with you in various capacities in this House.  I have the most vivid and happy memories of attending at least one parliamentary union meeting with you in London where you conscientiously represented this country.  While other members of the delegation might have been tempted to avail of the opportunity to look around London, you conscientiously attended every session and urged other members to do likewise.  You recognised that, when Members of this House are abroad, they represent their country and must be seen to represent it in a hardworking and conscientious way.  You led in this, as in other matters, by example and that is something I want to put on record.</P>
      <P>I also appreciate the support your wife and family have given you throughout your political career, enabling you to do what you have done. Your work, as is the case with other Members of the House, involved being away from home more than most would normally expect to be.  That would not have been possible for you, just as it is not possible for any of us, without the support of your spouse and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the people of Clonmel might <Col N="239" /> be happy to see a little more of you in future. Your proudest boast was probably not being a Member of the Dáil, Ceann Comhairle or a member of the Presidential Commission but being a distinguished member of Clonmel Corporation. You are a proud servant of the people of Clonmel, south Tipperary and Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not every day the father of the House and the Ceann Comhairle announces his departure from this House at the end of the current Dáil.  I join with the Taoiseach and every Member of both Houses in thanking you for your courtesy and the distinguished way you have handled matters for the 15 years you have been in the Chair.  You were Ceann Comhairle in the 1970s, before I entered the House, and for the past ten years, which is a long time to hold a difficult office.  You have always demonstrated the impartiality of your high office and maintained the dignity of the House.  This made us proud during the many visits of Heads of State in the last decade.  We were lucky as a national Parliament that, almost every year or second year, a world figure visited us.  On those occasions, when you represented the House, you brought us great satisfaction.</P>
      <P>In times of political turmoil, whether it was the political cut and thrust of this House or the unruly behaviour of some people, you always managed to keep proceedings going and that was not always an easy job.  I am sure I can apologise on behalf of members of my party for any time we caused you anxiety but I think you enjoyed it as much as we did.  We are sure you were not too upset.  I know, from talking to you over the years, that you are proud of your achievements.  You were your party's spokesperson on the old Departments of Local Government, Industry and Commerce and Labour.  It is 40 years since you were mayor of Clonmel, an honour with which I know you are very pleased.  You held that position on more than one occasion.  You were also Chairman of Tipperary South Riding County Council for a number of terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank you for those reasons, a Cheann Comhairle, as well as the way you are following the spirit of the constitutional provision.  You could have gone on your holidays during the next election and been safely returned.  Many people in the House would like to be in that position but you are the only one and you have foregone that to give someone else an opportunity of serving your constituency.  You say you are in the twilight of your career but the way you perform your duties, both at home and abroad, belies that.  On your recent visit to India you put in a gruelling work schedule.  When politicians go on parliamentary trips, the public believe it to be a few days off for them to have a rest.  Anyone who has been on those trips knows it is not so.  You have gone on many trips representing this House but I am sure you felt a weekend in Tipperary would have been better.  I appreciate your performing those duties. <Col N="240" /> No one gets a line in newspapers for them and, if they do, it is usually bad.  I appreciate the way you led those delegations.</P>
    <P>On behalf of every member of Fianna Fáil and everyone in this House, I thank you, your wife Catherine, your extended family and friends in Clonmel and thank you for a job well done and hope you are not troubled with too much work over the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste:</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my fellow leaders in paying tribute to you this morning on your decision that you will not seek to return here as a Member of the next Dáil.  The end of the 27th Dáil will, in your case, bring to an end a long and distinguished career in the service of the people of Tipperary as a Dáil Deputy and an equally distinguished contribution to parliamentary democracy.It is in many ways a sad day for us but it is also one in which we can collectively take pride in your performance as Chairman of the most democratic assembly in the country.  You have been Ceann Comhairle for 14 years and you have served Dáil Éireann with sensitivity and fairness to all sides in this House.  There have been, as Deputy Ahern said, many difficult and stormy political occasions over the last ten years, over which you, as Ceann Comhairle, had to preside. I suppose I can claim to be one who might have given you some anxiety in the distant past but I offer you my warmest congratulations for a job well done.</P>
      <P>In your time as Ceann Comhairle and before your commencement of that distinguished period of political service, you were a strong advocate of the rights of the people of south Tipperary and, both as a trade unionist and as a representative in Dáil Éireann, you were always faithful to your strongly held beliefs in your political persuasion. You were a successful mayor of Clonmel and you were very proud of having that duty in Clonmel Corporation.  It puts it into context, a Cheann Comhairle, in terms of your contribution to Irish politics, that I was seven years of age when you contested your first parliamentary election in 1957.  You have had a long and distinguished career and when the 27th Dáil comes to an end I wish you and your wife Catherine, who has been a great supporter of yours, a well earned and happy retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, this is the last occasion on which there will unanimity between the leaders in the dying days of the 27th Dáil.  I thank you for bringing that about.  You have served this House with great distinction, particularly in the role of Ceann Comhairle.  It is said that patience is a virtue and you have it in abundance.  You remained calm on so many occasions in the eye of a political storm.  You showed respect for all Members.  Although there were many occasions when my colleagues and I disagreed with your decision, we did so in the knowledge that you never conducted the proceedings of this House in a partisan manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> At a time of so much cynicism about politicians and politics your decision to retire rather than seek automatic re-election will help restore faith in politicians.  This is a selfless decision.  You could have been automatically re-elected and need never have turned up in the House.  You chose not to do so.  I am delighted that you are serving out your term.  In so doing you are showing that the office of Ceann Comhairle is independent and neutral.  That is how it should be.</P>
    <P>When President Clinton visited this House you spoke about the need for the Ceann Comhairle to have increased powers.  Perhaps you will tell us more about that when you retire.  You were serious on many occasions but you also had a wry sense of humour.  There were occasional effective put downs of misbehaving Deputies.  Many of us will remember such occasions.</P>
    <P>I wish you and your wife Catherine the best of luck in your retirement.  I hope you have many happy years in your native Clonmel.  I do not welcome your retirement for one reason.  It seems to have put a temporary smile on the face of the Coalition, particularly Deputy Ferris.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa):</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, on behalf of Democratic Left I join with the tributes paid to you. Forty-two years is a long time to be in the eye of the political storm.  You have served this State exceptionally well as a Deputy, a Member of the European Parliament, a member of the Council of State and in other functions.  However, you will be best remembered for your role as Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle's role is a thankless task. It is difficult to satisfy everyone.  Inevitably Deputies will feel sore about some decisions made.  As an Opposition Deputy I felt your hand on my collar a number of times.  I never had any hard feelings about that.</P>

      <P>Both.  One needs a hard neck in this House.  The best tribute I can pay to you is that you have served the office of Ceann Comhairle with distinction.  It is one of the key offices in the maintenance of confidence in the democratic structures and procedures of this State.  The fact that you have served with distinction and won tributes from all sides of the House is the best tribute I can pay to you.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, you have served in this House with myself and two other members of my family since 1961.  You are truly the father of the House.  There are two pretenders to that title but you were elected on the first count in 1961.  You are truly the longest serving Member of the House.</P>
      <P>I served with you in the Dáil, in Europe and on the county council.  You have never shown bias in this House, indeed you showed some leniency from time to time for which I was grateful.  You have been a tremendous leader in many areas, on the county council, Clonmel Corporation and as Mayor of Clonmel.</P>
      <P>I am not sure that Deputy Ahern is correct when he speaks about hard working delegations. They were hard going delegations if not exactly hard working and I enjoyed every one on which you played a role.</P>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, you have served the constituency of South Tipperary for a long time and you will be a loss to the people.  This is the right decision for you to make so that the constituency will be represented by a third candidate.  Your decision means that some of our novenas have been answered.  The Holy Cross novena on a Sunday evening is very good.</P>
      <P>I wish you and your wife Kitty, who has not enjoyed the best of health recently, every success and a happy retirement.  We look forward to seeing you in a more casual role in more off licensed premises.  We hope that you will live as long and as happy a life as you have done in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Ceann Comhairle, this House has been graced by your presence.  I cannot imagine what politics in South Tipperary will be like when all other names are not drowned by the name of Sean Treacy, which has dominated politics in the constituency for the past 33 years. Members of the House may not know that the gospel in South Tipperary for the past 33 years is that the problem which Sean Treacy cannot solve cannot be solved by anyone.</P>
      <P>Canon Hayes of Muintir na Tíre said that where Tipperary leads Ireland follows.  As a Deputy for South Tipperary and as Ceann Comhairle you led the constituency, this House and Ireland with style and dignity.  You served the people of South Tipperary with tremendous dedication and affection.  Everyone's problem, whether large or small, was your problem.</P>
      <P>The people of South Tipperary were proud to have you as their Deputy.  This was proven by the numerous occasions on which you topped the poll.  We were proud that you occupied the role of chairman of this House for so many years.</P>
      <P>This is the end of an era in South Tipperary politics.  You will take an important place when the history of politics in the constituency is written.You deserve that place.  I was proud to be a colleague of yours on South Tipperary County Council and in this House.  However, I am prouder to consider myself a friend of yours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us starting in politics could have <Col N="243" /> aspired to a better image than that of Sean Treacy, so successful has been your career.  I look forward to your memoirs, which would make interesting reading.  Your decision changes the situation in the election in South Tipperary.  We will need more conventions and the canvassing cards will have to be changed.  You served with style and dignity for 33 years and the announcement of your departure from politics was marked with the same style, dignity and fairness.  I wish you and Kitty many years of happiness in your retirement.I sincerely want you to know, and I am sure I speak for the people of south Tipperary and everybody, that we really appreciate the time you gave for the people of the constituency throughout your 33 years of dedicated service to this House.  I am proud to have been a colleague of yours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes being paid to you, a Cheann Comhairle. Yours has been a lifetime of service to the electorate, in particular of south Tipperary but, I might add, also of west Waterford &mdash; the constituency of south Tipperary and west Waterford &mdash; where some 8,000 voters gave you a leg-up over the past 36 years when you badly needed it.  When the Davern boys and the redoubtable Jackie Fahey were breathing down your neck the people of west Waterford were a great source of strength to you.</P>
      <P>We all appreciated the manner in which you led parliamentary delegations abroad.  It was not just the manner in which you over-shadowed people like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton in this House but, whenever you went to foreign climes, your performance as leader of Irish parliamentary delegations was awesome; all of us who accompanied you could only describe it as such. Whether meeting democratically elected leaders or dictators, they were somewhat in awe of you. That speaks for itself.</P>
      <P>You have done a great service to this nation, the electorate and we here particularly appreciate it.</P>

      <P>I join other Members in paying tribute to you, a Cheann Comhairle.  As you probably know, it is not just in south Tipperary that you are well respected but right across the country, especially in Wicklow where you are affectionately regarded as the greatest referee of all times.</P>
      <P>I wish you the very best in your retirement when I hope you will learn to slow down and take things easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I join my constituency colleagues in paying tribute to you, not only on the most important, courageous decision you have taken today.  In the history of this House very few people have taken such a decision, particularly when, as Deputy Theresa Ahearn said, it would have been so easy to decide <Col N="244" /> to be a Member of the next Dáil and just go on a holiday.  Of course, it is no secret that your decision will influence the political landscape of south Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I want to say very sincerely &mdash; very few other Members can make the same claim &mdash; that during all our years in the Tipperary South constituency, when I served under your chairmanship in the county council, campaigned with you over some 25 years to ensure you did not need a leg-up from anybody but always topped the polls, you represented the electorate with pride and distinction. That was what was so important about your service.The people of south Tipperary were so proud of the manner in which you represented them at all levels, whether in the course of your mayorality, as chairman of the county council, as a Deputy here, at the European Parliament but particularly as Ceann Comhairle.  It was a wonderful honour for the people of south Tipperary and Clonmel that you held one of the highest offices in the land with a distinction never equalled and unlikely to be in the future.</P>
      <P>As a colleague, having sat with you at all levels of your public representation, particularly within the parliamentary party, I was privileged to have followed in your footsteps.  I might add that I do not aspire to any higher office than that which I hold at present, with the exception of being re-elected a Member of this House.</P>
      <P>I wish you and Kitty the best of good health, in particular, and happiness to enjoy the retirement you so richly deserve.</P>

You were so typically a native of Tipperary.You know everybody and I am very aware of the great respect in which you were held by constituents and others.  Over the years, when we worked together for the whole of County Tipperary, I built up a friendship with you.  As other Members said more succinctly, as I leave, I do so along with a great Tipperary man.  I wish you and your wife every happiness in your retirement.</P>

      <P>On promised legislation, will the Taoiseach indicate when the Statutory Compensation Tribunal Bill will be published?  Will the Taoiseach confirm the Minister for Health is planning enabling legislation only, and to establish the compensation tribunal by statutory instrument.  Is the Taoiseach aware this is unacceptable to the victims of the hepatitis C scandal?  What has happened to the tribunal to investigate haemophiliacs and HIV victims, which was promised in January, and for which there are still no terms of reference?  How is it expected to deal with the aggravated damages claim of everybody concerned when the Minister for Health is specifying that only the Finlay report will be taken into account in assessing those damages? What provisions will be made for other victims who are awaiting these other tribunals?</P>

      <P>The position in regard to this legislation, as I have explained in a number of days in succession in the House, is that consultation is taking place between the Minister and <Col N="247" /> the various groups affected.  A number of groups were met yesterday and in previous days.  At least two organisations will be met today.  The views of all of them will be taken into account.  In so far as there are heads of a Bill which are unlikely to be the subject of change arising from this consultation, the drafting is proceeding to accelerate the final consideration and clearance of the Bill when all the consultation is complete and the decisions finally taken.  The Minister for Health and the Government are working with great care to be as helpful as possible to all those who have been involved in this very tragic situation.  They are working with all the groups to assure them the arrangements being made to deal with their rights will be put in place in a way that is compassionate and based, as far as possible, on their views and on consultation with them.</P>

The Government will make its decisions.  The Deputy is asking specific questions about individual aspects of the legislation.  Those questions will be answered when the legislation is decided on and produced.  It would be premature to answer questions on the detail of a matter which is still the subject of extensive consultation.

The Ceann Comhairle determined that the matter was not one of such urgency or public importance that it could not wait until the Minister for Health's Question Time in two weeks.  Given the unfortunate deterioration in this ongoing situation, can the Ceann Comhairle indicate if I should submit another Private Notice Question on the matter today, and whether he would regard a strike of this nature as a matter of such importance that there could be a question and answer session with the Minister for Health this afternoon?</P>

That allowed me to make a statement, after which the Minister of State at the Department of Health made another statement.  That is the procedure for Adjournment debates.  However, with respect to the Chair, I wish to put down a Private Notice Question today because the matter is of such urgency and importance and is of such a deteriorating nature that we need a special procedure that will go beyond formal statements and will allow Members to ask supplementary questions in order to deal with the matter properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I offer the Ceann Comhairle my good wishes. His courtesy to new Members of the House and the manner in which he conducted the business of the House have been a great example to all Members.</P>
      <P>This is an important day for the country and I thank the Opposition parties for their co-operation in agreeing to take all Stages of the Chemical Weapons Bill, 1997 today.  As we approach the end of the 20th century, with all its turmoil and tragedies, it is gratifying to be involved in efforts to finally eliminate one of the great obscenities of our time &mdash; chemical weapons.</P>
      <P>While chemical warfare probably goes back to earlier centuries when opponents used poisons to incapacitate their enemies, the first major use of chemical weapons was in the First World War and many of us will recall stories of the terrible injuries inflicted by chemicals in that conflict. Since then chemical warfare has moved on from the relatively simple weapons of the First World War to the more sophisticated and deadlier weapons of today.  As technology progresses it has become easier for so-called &ldquo;rogue states&rdquo; with sufficient resources to buy a chemical sector &ldquo;off the shelf&rdquo; and use it to produce chemical weapons.There is also the disturbing problem of individuals obtaining highly toxic chemicals and using them in public places, as in the chemical attack on the Tokyo underground a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Many efforts have been made to curtail the use of chemical weapons over the years going back to the Brussels Declaration of 1874 which prohibited the use of poisons and poisoned bullets in warfare.  In 1925 the Geneva Protocol banned chemical and bacteriological warfare.  Despite this, the threat and the fear of chemical warfare remained.  World powers continued to produce, develop and stockpile chemical weapons with the implication that, if sufficiently threatened, they would use these weapons.  Thankfully there have always been countries and individuals who were sufficiently concerned to persevere with efforts to finally put an end not just to chemical weapons but to the fear of such weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 24 years negotiations took place in Geneva under the auspices of the Conference on Disarmarment.Agreement was finally reached in 1992 and the convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction was opened for signature on 13 January 1993.  The convention represents a radical departure in the concept of disarmament and Ireland was one of the first countries to sign.  Not only does the convention prohibit warfare in chemical weapons, it also sets up an organisation &mdash; the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons &mdash; with <Col N="253" /> wide-ranging powers to enforce the convention at international level.</P>
    <P>I will put on record a summary of Article I of the convention because it represents the essential commitment required by the convention.  Each state party to the convention undertakes not to develop, produce or otherwise acquire, stockpile or retain chemical weapons or transfer, directly or indirectly, chemical weapons to anyone; not to use chemical weapons; not to engage in any military preparations to use chemical weapons; not to assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a state party under the convention; to destroy chemical weapons it owns or possesses; to destroy chemical weapons production facilities it owns or possesses; not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare.  The commitment is not limited to the non-use of these weapons but to their elimination over a specified period.</P>
    <P>However, commitments are not sufficient. There must be a confidence within the international community that countries who have ratified the convention are abiding by its terms.  Over 70 per cent of the text of the convention, the verification annex, is concerned in one way or another with ensuring the terms of the convention are kept by the states which ratify it.  This shows that the convention is not merely aspirational but that there is an extensive verification mechanism which will ensure that state parties are complying with its terms.  It is this enforcement element to the convention which perhaps makes it unique among disarmament conventions.</P>
    <P>Under its terms, a new UN body will be established called the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which will be based in The Hague and oversee implementation of the convention.It will also have the power and resources to ensure the ratifying states comply with the convention's terms.</P>
    <P>I will describe in greater detail the verification aspect of the convention.  The system is based on declarations by state parties which can be verified by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  The most important declarations refer to chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities.  Within 30 days of the convention entering into force, 29 May 1997, state parties must make declarations in respect of chemical weapons as to quantities, location, type of chemicals concerned, storage facilities, etc. Similar declarations must be made in respect of chemical weapons production facilities.  As well as declaring the existence of these weapons and facilities, state parties must submit plans for their destruction.</P>
    <P>The verification aspect of the convention then comes into play.  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will have an inspectorate whose function will be to ensure state parties keep to their commitments.  The inspectorate will have diplomatic status and the convention <Col N="254" /> obliges state parties to grant inspectors rights of access to facilities covered by it.</P>
    <P>One of the reassuring uses of the international inspectorate will be the undertaking of &ldquo;challenge inspections&rdquo;.  This is a mechanism whereby state parties, concerned about possible non-compliance by another state party with the convention, have the right to request the international inspectorate to inspect a specific site.  I will come to the implications for Ireland of this inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The international inspectors will be appointed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  By 29 May, the names of every inspector, together with their qualifications and experience, will be notified to state parties which have the right to object to the appointment of any inspector by giving 30 days notice.  If an objection is lodged, that inspector will not be involved in any inspections in the territory of the objecting state party.</P>
    <P>When an inspection team arrives, it has the right to assistance from the state party and of access to the site it wishes to inspect.  Facilities, in the nature of offices, communications, interpretation where necessary, transportation, etc., must be provided.  Any cost to the state or companies will be reimbursed later.  The inspection team must be able to reach its target site no later than 12 hours from arriving in the country.  While on site, it has the right to unimpeded access to the inspection site or factory.  It has the right to inspect documents and records it deems relevant and to interview personnel.  Samples of chemicals may be tested on site and taken away for further analysis.</P>
    <P>No later than ten days after the inspection visit, the inspection team will submit a report which will deal with matters relevant to compliance with the convention.  The report will also refer to the level of co-operation the inspection team experienced.I have dealt with this aspect of the convention in some detail because I wish to emphasise this is an agreement which will be enforced.</P>
    <P>The powers of the international inspectorate which I have described are far reaching but necessary, given the subject matter of the convention but what will be the impact of the international inspectors and the convention itself on Ireland?  I have mentioned the declarations state parties have to make regarding chemical weapons and chemical weapon production facilities.  These declarations will have to be made in respect of Ireland by 29 May 1997.  Declarations are being prepared to enable me to say Ireland neither holds chemical weapons nor does it have chemical weapon production facilities.  We will still have to make declarations, however, in respect of the chemicals set out in the convention and repeated in the Schedules to the Bill.  This is a statistical exercise but important nevertheless.</P>
    <P>Because the chemicals which can be used to manufacture chemical weapons can also have a legitimate use for industry, their use is permitted under the convention so long as it is for peaceful <Col N="255" /> purposes.  Because of the potential of these chemicals, their use must be controlled in the case of the most toxic.  For the rest, detailed records must be kept by companies and returns made each year on the quantities produced, consumed and transferred.  Even though we do not hold or produce chemical weapons, it is important that the information required by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons be accurately and efficiently collated.  The international inspectorate will have the same powers to enter and inspect sites which are involved in the peaceful use of the designated chemicals as it has for sites involved in the production of chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>It will be obvious that the chemical industry in Ireland will be directly affected by the convention and the Bill.  Far from viewing the Bill as another regulation imposed by the State, the industry welcomes it because of its implications for trade.  All 15 members of the European Union have now ratified the convention.  The latest information available to me is that 74 states have ratified it but this number is increasing as the date on which the convention enters into force, 29 April 1997, approaches.  I am informed the United States Senate will vote on ratification on Friday, 25 April 1997.  It is clearly important that such an important country in the disarmament area ratifies the convention.</P>
    <P>I mention the number of states which have ratified the convention to raise the issue of trade.  As more and more states ratify the convention, industry becomes more positively disposed towards it.  In the United States, I understand it is the chemical industry which is most anxious for ratification to take place.  The reason is the convention will restrict trade in the chemicals covered by it.  In the case of First Schedule chemicals, trade will only be possible with other state parties.  In three years time, trade in Second Schedule chemicals will only be permitted with other state parties and for Third Schedule chemicals the position will be reviewed after five years.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was being drafted, industry, through its representative associations, and relevant academic institutions were consulted. There have been no objections to it.  As for compliance costs, there will be few, if any, extra costs involved in companies complying with the convention.The principal obligation on companies will be to keep records of their use of the chemicals covered by the convention and to allow inspectors to enter their premises to check compliance.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the enforcement of the convention in Ireland.  The Bill will appoint the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health as the national authority for the purposes of the convention.  The Authority which was established in 1989 has proved in its relatively short life that it can take on a challenge such as the convention.  It has the necessary scientific and technical expertise to carry out its function of <Col N="256" /> national authority and the benefit of being regionally based.</P>
    <P>The Authority will not just be a post box for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.  An important function of the Authority will be as a focus for the communication of information-instructions from the organisation to Irish industry and accompanying the international inspectors on their inspections to Irish firms.  In ratifying the convention we undertake to abide by its terms and need to have the powers necessary to ensure compliance.  The Bill will give the Authority wide-ranging powers to enforce the convention.  By this means, we can assure ourselves and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that we are abiding by its terms.</P>
    <P>In June last year, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs brought forward a motion which asked the House to approve the terms of the convention.  I am pleased the House approved that motion which enabled Ireland to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with what is contained in the various sections of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 are the usual citation and interpretation sections.  The National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, the HSA, is defined as the national authority for the purposes of the convention.  Section 3 prohibits the production, development, use, retention or transfer of chemical weapons.  The use of premises or equipment for the production, development, etc. of chemical weapons is also prohibited.  The maximum penalty for contravention of this section is life imprisonment. Section 4 places restrictions on the use of certain toxic chemicals.</P>
    <P>Section 5 to 8, inclusive, are concerned with inspection and enforcement.  Inspectors of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will be allowed to enter the State under the terms of the convention.  Section 5 gives such inspectors the same powers as an inspector of the HSA.  Sections 6 and 7 are concerned respectively with the appointment of inspectors by the HSA for the purposes of the convention and their powers of inspection.  Section 8 gives to a member of the Garda Síochána the powers of an inspector under the Bill in addition to his or her existing powers.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, are concerned with the information needed by the national authority to comply with the convention.  Companies which produce, consume, etc., the chemicals listed in the Second and Third Schedules to the Bill must provide information and keep records in accordance with the requirements of the HSA.  Any information obtained pursuant to the Bill or the convention is privileged but may be disclosed if there is a severe danger to the public.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides powers to the Minister to make regulations to give effect to the convention. Section 13 outlines the penalties for offences under the Bill.  Section 14 provides for the forfeiture and destruction of chemical weapons seized by the authorities as required by the convention. <Col N="257" /> An appeals procedure against forfeiture is provided.Section 15 states that prosecutions may be brought by the HSA.  Section 16 states that the expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as sanctioned by the Minister for Finance.The Schedules list the categories of chemicals covered by the convention.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  Ireland has always been to the forefront in advocating peace and disarmament.It took 22 years to draft this massive convention.  I am pleased Ireland was one of the first signatories.  I am sure the Bill, which gives effect to that commitment and which will put in place the structures which will enable Ireland to fulfil its obligations under the convention, will have the unanimous support of the House to which I commend it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I wish the Ceann Comhairle well in his retirement from his busy life in the Dáil.  It is sometimes difficult to keep order in the House and many of us have ended up on the wrong side of his firm stewardship.Nevertheless we appreciate his contribution to public life, the way he upheld the dignity of the House and the welcome he extended to many dignitaries over the years.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil warmly welcomes this Bill.  This convention, which has been in gestation for many years, had its origin in the UN Convention on Disarmament negotiated in Geneva more than 20 years ago.  I know from my interest and involvement in international debates on peace and disarmament that many parliamentarians throughout the world will welcome the developments taking place in the countries which ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>As the Minister correctly said, the key is to get the major players, China, Russia and the US, to ratify the convention.  Ireland is meeting its obligations in this regard.  As many countries as possible must ratify the convention by the end of the month.  The convention is important not only from the point of view of preventing stockpiling and research but also in ensuring that chemical weapons are not used.  Seventy four countries have ratified the convention to date.  We have no chemical weapons but the convention will ensure that such weapons are destroyed in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the historical context of the debate and to the use of chemical weapons during the First World War.  It goes without saying that one of the most evil products ever produced by mankind is chemical weapons.  It is a sad reflection on society that some countries are still producing and stockpiling chemical weapons. Chemical weapons were used during the war between Iran and Iraq.  While there is a public perception that this issue has been dealt with and that we have moved to deal with other threats in regard to arms, it is clear that we need to put <Col N="258" /> in place a legislative framework to deal with this issue.</P>
    <P>The US Senate at its meeting next Friday has some very important work to do in this area. There has been some reaction to the move by President Clinton to bring this matter to a conclusion and to ensure that the Senate ratifies the convention.  Failure by the US to ratify the convention will send a wrong signal to the other key players.  The Russians have not yet ratified the convention and it is obvious that they will follow the US.  China has its instruments of ratification ready and the decision of the US is obviously crucial in this regard.</P>
    <P>A very important element of the convention is the verification process.  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will be established in The Hague.  This organisation, which will come into being on 29 May when countries have fulfilled their obligations, will have an inspectorate.It is important that we follow through on its commitments.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the UN Convention on Chemical Weapons is to prohibit the acquisition, development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and to require their destruction.The terms of the convention are very comprehensive and the key element is the reference to &ldquo;destruction&rdquo;.  Ireland will fulfil its role in this regard by enacting this Bill.  One may say that what we are doing is symbolic as we are a non-possessor state.  However, it is important that we are to the fore in enacting legislation of this kind. This is in line with our foreign policy position to promote peace and disarmament and to protect human rights throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The main impact of the legislation will relate to the controls imposed by the convention on a range of chemicals which have the potential for use in making chemical weapons but which also have wide legitimate commercial uses.  I am glad the industry has broadly welcomed the Bill as this has clear implications for trade.  There will be annual declarations on the production and, in some cases, consumption, processing and transfer of chemical weapons.  These matters are dealt with in the schedule to the convention.  Companies which are required to make such declarations will also be subject to inspection.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for the setting up of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the OPCW.  I am glad this organisation which will oversee the implementation of the convention will be based in The Hague.  It is important that the role of the European Union is centre stage in any debate on disarmament and the promotion of peace.  I was very vocal during the debate on French nuclear testing and many of my colleagues in the House shared my concern that a EU member state should adopt such an independent line on nuclear testing.  In many ways it demonstrates to us yet again the lack of cohesion in EU policies on disarmament.  I hope the establishment of the headquarters of the OPCW in Europe will ensure a more cohesive <Col N="259" /> approach at EU level on the issue of disarmament.</P>
    <P>The OPCW will establish an inspectorate which will have the right to conduct, at short notice, a range of on-site verification and inspection activities and to establish and confirm the validity of each state's returns.  The convention imposes restrictions on trade in certain chemicals. In some cases these restrictions will prohibit trade in these chemicals with states which have not ratified the convention.  The legislation clearly recognises that a mechanism is required to encourage those countries which have not ratified the convention to do so.  Many countries similar to Ireland will ratify the convention on the nod.  I do not envisage a lengthy debate on the Bill as the Minister and the Government have fulfilled their obligations in this area.  However, the key point is that we must use the legislation internationally to bring on board those countries which have decided not to ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with the broader issue of the arms trade.  The Minister will be aware that other Deputies and I recently raised Ireland's links with the arms trade and military industry.  We should use this debate to add our concerns to those of the AFrI organisation, which raised legitimate points in its report regarding Ireland's links with the arms trade and the military industry.  Following the publication of that report, I stated in the House that Ireland must ensure it does not have any links with the international arms industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland has rightly questioned the connection between some European countries and the involvement of people in the arms industry in countries like East Timor.  Indonesia could not have carried out its genocidal policy against the people of East Timor without the support of some European states which supplied them with arms.  It is important we follow through on our principal position, enunciated in the White Paper, that we want to see an end to the arms industry. The AFrI report produced evidence of links between some European states and the arms industry.</P>
    <P>I do not condone attacks on Irish industries &mdash; the IDA is trying to attract industry to this country, particularly in the electronics area &mdash; but we must have a mechanism in place to ensure Irish industries do not have any connection with the international arms industry.  The AFrI report suggests some subcontractors are supplying main contractors in the international arms industry.  If that is true, it is a matter of great concern but further evidence is required in this respect.</P>
    <P>The AFrI report refers to the role of the arms industry in Nigeria, the destruction of Ogoniland and the crisis in East Timor.  The involvement of some EU states in supplying arms to these countries is deplorable.  That practice is continuing, despite protestations from countries like Ireland and many non-governmental organisations.  I hope consensus will be reached on this issue at <Col N="260" /> EU level because, from my experience as a Minister of State, double standards are being applied.</P>
    <P>We hear much talk about promoting human rights, ending the arms industry and bringing peace to developing countries, yet some of the countries whose leaders are making these pronouncements are involved in the supply of arms. Ireland must ensure it does not have any links with the activities of some of our European colleagues in regard to this issue, and that agreements are reached at EU level in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The origins of this debate date back to the UN conference on disarmament in Geneva 24 years ago.  Many parliamentarians, from this country and abroad, have been directly involved in advancing this matter.  It is unfortunate that Ireland has taken such a long time to ratify this convention, but we are fulfilling our duties in bringing this Bill before the House, which I welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin my brief contribution by adding my voice to the tributes paid this morning to the Ceann Comhairle.  Deputy Sean Treacy brought unique qualities to the office of Ceann Comhairle.  He conducted his business with a mix of intelligence, patience, charm and good humour.He brought dignity to this House which, by its very nature, can be a place of controversy and conflict.  He always dealt with that in a very efficient manner.  By his long years of service to this House and to democracy in general, he has done his country and himself great credit.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill to the House.  It is right that Ireland should support the terms of this convention.  It is a milestone that there is total unity among the parties in the House with regard to the objectives of the Bill.</P>
      <P>At the heart of this convention is a strong attempt to ensure that good triumphs over evil. The development of chemical weapons in this century was one of the most destructive purposes to which human intelligence could have been put, not only in terms of the devastation it wreaked on human life and health, but the environmental contamination that followed the use of chemical weapons during two world wars.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we seek to undo the damage caused by the use of chemical weapons.  Civilised nations should seek to put in place mechanisms whereby the further stockpiling of chemical weapons would be brought to a halt.  Small nations like East Timor should not be the pawns of larger countries.  We must try, in so far as we can, to bring about a moral climate, particularly at EU level, in which the continuation of the use of these weapons is not condoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the putting in place of an inspectorate.I ask the Minister of State to outline in her reply the way the inspectorate will link up with existing bodies which inspect the commercial chemical industry in Ireland.  Will points of conflict arise with Irish health and safety personnel and the Environmental Protection Agency, which <Col N="261" /> sets very high standards for our chemical industry?The new chemical industries, which are prolific in my area, comply with very high standards and in most cases have exceeded the requirements placed on them by Government appointed bodies.</P>
    <P>I record my concern and that of my party about what happened at the Beaufort Dyke, one of the largest munitions dumps in the world, which lies six miles off the coast of Northern Ireland.  Over the past 50 years successive British Governments may have dumped up to 9 million tonnes of munitions into the Beaufort Dyke, including phosphorous bombs, waste artillery shells and possibly even nuclear waste.  It is important that we establish exactly what is deposited in the Beaufort Dyke and the dangers from these deposits.  The Beaufort Dyke has been described as an environmental disaster waiting to happen.  I have argued for a long time that the site deserves closer attention from the Irish authorities.  It is important that the matter should be raised again in the context of the convention for which we are signing on.  It is equally important that the inspectorate to be put in place as a result of this convention should direct its attention to what is happening at the Beaufort Dyke.  That and Sellafield represent the two greatest threats to our environment.  I will not deal with Sellafield today because it is a nuclear issue, separate from the issue of chemical weapons, but it is certainly a parallel issue.</P>
    <P>In matters of this nature that pose such a huge threat to human life and to human health in every sense of the word, directly through killing and maiming and indirectly through damage done to our physical environment, to our soil, to our air, to our water and to the food that is grown in our soil, it is of key importance that as we turn away from the destructive elements of the 20th century and face towards the 21st century we should seek, with might and main, with all the technology and moral and practical force at our command, to confront the constructive elements of chemical weaponry and of the nuclear industry in terms of a cross-boundary, cross-member states inspectorate that will seek to fulfil the objectives of this convention to which Ireland is signing on.</P>
    <P>I endorse fully what has been said by the Minister of State and by Deputy Tom Kitt.  They have both spoken for the vast majority of our people. There is no point in my repeating what they and other Members have said.  The objectives of this Bill have the total support of me and my party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members opposite for supporting the Bill.  We are <i>ad idem</i> in this House on the importance of this convention.  Would that the same unanimity were to prevail in the US Senate. However, I am glad to say that we are giving a lead here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the issue of the Russian ratification.  There is work before the Duma at <Col N="262" /> the moment.  The EU states have offered assistance with the destruction of weapons, which would be a major problem for them, as part of the package of European aid to the former countries of the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill raised two points, the first in relation to the Beaufort Dyke.  This is a concern that is shared right across this House.  It was investigated by the British-Irish Parliamentary Body.  Scientific studies concluded that there is currently no biological or chemical contamination of fish life or marine life there and that it would be better not to disturb the material because it could cause worse trouble if material broke up in the process.  There is joint monitoring of the area by the British-Irish Parliamentary Body.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill's other point relates to the role of the inspectorate.  International inspectors will be appointed by the Hague and they will work alongside the health and safety authority inspectors.There are requirements for record keeping. We have no chemical weapons and no chemical weapon production here, so their destruction does not arise.  However, there may be minor quantities of toxic chemicals in use for peaceful purposes that could potentially be combined into chemical weapon format.  For that reason, and to guarantee that nothing wrong or untoward is being done in the Irish chemical industry, there must be inspections and schedules and listed information handed to the Hague.</P>
    <P>That work will be done by the safety inspectorate as part of their routine inspection of the chemical industry.  They have built up a very good expertise in this area.  Dr. Pratt would be regarded as one of the international experts in the chemical area.  This work will be done by the inspectorate as part of their mainstream job.  The powers for inspectors in section 7 of the Bill are almost identical to the powers in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  The Garda Síochána are being given similar powers to look for documentation, seize materials and so on because, although it is hoped that it will never arise, there could well be cases where the Garda will be required to act in support of the civil authorities, the Health and Safety Authority.  I am happy with the support the Bill has received on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney):</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution of £13 million by the Irish Government to the 11th replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association &mdash; IDA &mdash; which is an affiliate of the World Bank.  It is one of the bank's main instruments in the fight against extreme poverty.  It was set up in 1960 to assist the poorest countries which cannot afford to borrow money from the World Bank on its normal terms.  These countries have an annual <i>per capita</i> income, in 1995 terms, of $905, or IR£588, or less.  There is also an exception for small island economies that have limited creditworthiness.</P>
      <P>IDA beneficiaries are the people of the world's 79 poorest countries, which have a total population of 3.3 billion.  That is equal to 57 per cent of the world's population.  The IDA is the world's most important source of global multilateral concessional assistance.  Its activities span the globe, including China, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Egypt, most of sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in Central and South America.  Some 41 IDA-supported countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
      <P>Sustainable poverty reduction remains the overarching objective of the IDA and, indeed, is the overarching objective of development.  Broad-based economic growth led by the private sector and environmental sustainability are two key supporting objectives of the IDA.  The IDA also recognises that development requires growth accompanied by a broad-based investment in basic health, education and infrastructure.  The critical underpinning requires macro-economic stability accompanied by structural adjustment and the building of civil society.</P>
      <P>The IDA is mostly funded by regular grant contributions from its richer member countries. These resources need to be replenished from time to time, normally at three year intervals.  The negotiations for the 11th replenishment were completed in 1996 and this replenishment will cover the period from June 1996 to June 1999. These funds are supplemented by repayments made by IDA's borrowers in respect of earlier loans and transfers from the available net income of the World Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the United States is contributing only to years two and three of the IDA 11.  Because of this, it has been necessary for IDA to establish a one-year interim fund on an exceptional basis.  The absence of the US contribution <Col N="264" /> for the first year prevented the other donors from agreeing an adequate and fully burden-sharing funding basis for the full IDA 11 period.Hence the need to split the three-year period into a once-off year-long fund without US participation, followed by a two-year arrangement inclusive of US involvement.</P>
    <P>A figure of 7.1 billion special drawing rights &mdash; SDRs &mdash; about IR£6.67 billion, will be provided in donor contributions to enable IDA to commit a total of about 14.5 billion SDRs, about IR£13.6 billion, during this period.  Of the total donor contributions to IDA 11, some 2.1 billion special drawing rights, about IR£1.97 billion, will be provided to the interim fund and five billion special drawing rights, about IR£4.7 billion, will be provided for the association's operations in 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>The agreement to the 11th replenishment was achieved under difficult budgetary circumstances for many of the contributing countries.  It will allow the IDA to continue its activities at current levels for the next three years.  This is a noteworthy achievement in itself.  However, it also gives cause for concern for the longer term as it reflects a decline in donor contributions to a level below those of the 9th and 10th replenishments. During that period the Irish contribution to IDA has increased by 2 per cent in absolute terms.  The Irish contribution to IDA 11 will amount to IR£13 million which is equivalent to 0.13 per cent of total donor contributions.  Of the 36 donor countries, Ireland, Brazil, Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland increased their basic shares from that in IDA 10.  Ireland's total commitment of IR£4.3 million in 1997 will be to the interim fund. The balance of the Irish commitment will amount to IR£8.7 million and will be devoted to operations in financial years 1998 and 1999.</P>
    <P>The actual cash payments for IDA 11 will be made over a seven year period beginning in 1997. Contributions to the IDA are payable from the Central Fund.  Ireland's contributions to the International Development Association count as part of our official development assistance programme, about which I will comment further at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Apart from the critical question of the size of the replenishment, during the negotiations attention also focused on other key policy issues, such as the poverty focus of the association, the environmental impact of its projects and the problems facing low income highly indebted countries in servicing and, in some cases, redeeming their debt.  To ensure IDA resources are applied effectively in the programme for a given country, the development effort is centred around what is referred to as a country assistance strategy.  These strategies, which have evolved in recent years, are a more effective instrument for prioritising activities.</P>
    <P>Poverty assessments are one of the main pieces of analytical work available as background for individual country assistance strategies.  Officials and citizens of borrower countries have also been <Col N="265" /> encouraged to participate in preparing the country assistance strategies and in some countries, with government consent, interested citizens and NGO representatives have been invited to discuss lessons learned from the implementation of national adjustment programmes.  However, evidence from the field and from NGOs indicates that the country assistance strategies process has some way to go before it can be truly classified as highly participatory.</P>
    <P>IDA recognises that the impact of its programmes on poverty can be judged only by the results of its operations achieved in the field.  It has taken significant steps to better define how its projects will contribute to poverty reduction. Monitorable indicators, related to the objectives of each new project, are defined and recorded at the design stage.  IDA attaches great importance to the completion of country poverty assessments for all major IDA recipients.  It continues to emphasise social sector lending for health, education and social welfare and poverty-targeted investments that disproportionately benefit the poor or contain specific mechanisms for identifying and reaching them.</P>
    <P>Total IDA disbursements on social sector investment projects have been increasing rapidly. These disbursements under IDA 10 amounted to US$3.5 billion or IR£2.27 billion.  Total disbursements increased at an annual rate of 24 per cent during the IDA 10 period which compares with an average annual increase of 11 per cent during the IDA 9 period.  The bulk of this assistance helps meet the basic needs of the poor, such as the provision of primary education, basic health care, access to clean water, and low-cost sanitation, in the poorest countries</P>
    <P>IDA is now the largest external financier and source of advice on social sector policies in poor countries and disbursements for social sector investment projects are expected to continue to increase rapidly.  IDA also plays a key role in the economic and social development of these countries.Its purpose is not to provide short-term humanitarian aid, but to create the conditions in which the countries concerned can permanently raise the living standards of their peoples.  Its lending programmes are primarily aimed at providing resources for investment projects that are not only essential for the economic and social development of the borrowing country, but also technically and economically sound.  The IDA also lends for more comprehensive economic programmes which facilitate the long-term growth of the economy or of a sector.  In recent years, it has increasingly provided financial aid to enable poor countries to introduce and implement urgent economic policy reforms and structural adjustments.</P>
    <P>IDA remains committed to sound environmental stewardship and has financed a significant and increasing number of projects specifically aimed at environmental objectives such as conservation, sustainable resource use and pollution management.Even more important is IDA's continuing <Col N="266" /> effort to thoroughly integrate environmental considerations across the spectrum of its projects and other activities.  IDA employs an environmental assessment process to ensure its operations meet a high environmental standard.</P>
    <P>The acceleration of development in Sub-Saharan Africa remains IDA's greatest challenge. Those African countries which are trying to perform well on a sustained basis will continue to receive priority in the allocation of IDA resources.  Approximately 40 per cent of IDA's financial support goes to sub-Saharan Africa, making IDA the most important source of concessional lending for the region &mdash; concessional lending means lending at less than the normal commercial terms.  Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have recently experienced an upturn in growth which reached 4 per cent in 1995 after averaging just 0.7 per cent in the previous four years.  This recovery was due in part to the effect of reforms undertaken by a number of countries. Many countries persisting with reform programmes, such as Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda, have recovered dramatically from economic decline in the 1980s.  Africa is now just working its way from stagnation to recovery and carrying out important political reforms in parallel.  The aggregate figures mask great variations in performance between countries in the region.  While the growth of GDP of some African borrowers began to improve in recent years, poor policy performance and civil conflict in some countries have made it difficult for IDA to support the desired level of investment in the area.</P>
    <P>The problem of the crushing burden of service payments, in respect of debts incurred in the past, faced by the poorest countries provides a grim background to the activities of IDA and the World Bank.  An equitable resolution of this problem is the aim of all parties.  Members will already be aware of the main features of the debt initiative, agreed by the IMF, the World Bank and bilateral creditors last year.  I do not propose to repeat them here.  However, the establishment of a debt initiative of any description is a major achievement in itself and a testimony to the negotiating skills of the managing director of the IMF, the president of the World Bank and their staffs. This could not reasonably have been foreseen a number of years ago.  Now it is becoming a reality and countries are being considered for assistance under it.  Members might wish to be reminded that because of their high grant element, IDA credits do not generally worsen borrowers debt service burdens.  This grant element consists of long maturities &mdash; often 30 years or more &mdash; significant grace periods of approximately ten years in which there is no capital repayment and negligible interest rates of approximately three-quarters of 1 per cent.  This is a particularly important consideration in the case of the 41 IDA borrowers which are classified as heavily indebted poor countries.  Specific measures are being taken to ease the burden on those countries.</P>
    <P>I will now report on the use of the funding provided <Col N="267" /> to IDA under the 10th replenishment from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1996.  During the period of IDA 10, the association has promoted economic and sectoral reforms in recipient countries as a means of encouraging growth and development. Concern with basic social services has been another major theme for IDA.  It has made provision for specific budgetary allocations for these sectors as well as the promotion of arrangements on the ground to make optimum use of scarce resources.</P>
    <P>In general, Ireland welcomes the increased priority accorded to investment in people under IDA 10 and particularly the incorporation of gender and policy issues into country assistance strategies.We also strongly support the highlighting of child labour, forced labour and environmental procedures under the country assistance strategies.</P>
    <P>The specific highlights of the period covered by commitments from 10th replenishment include the following.  The number of eligible countries increased from 70 to 79.  Most of the new borrowers are newly independent countries, such as Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Eritrea and Tajikistan, in need of exceptional assistance with policies, institutions and aid co-ordination.  IDA was able to respond and did so in partnership with other agencies.  Sound economic and social policies are a prerequisite for effective resource use and, thus, for accelerating growth and reducing poverty.  IDA resources are allocated primarily on the basis of country performance.  Poor countries with the best policy performance receive the largest relative commitments.  IDA's implementation efforts have resulted in a marked acceleration in the pace of disbursement.  Total disbursements during the IDA 10 period exceeded US$17 billion or IR£11.04 billion, some 20 per cent more than during the IDA 9 period.  The evolution of disbursements during the IDA 10 period reflects the increasing priority accorded to investments in people.  Disbursements for social sector investment projects to improve education, health care, nutrition, water supply and sanitation for poor people increased by nearly 70 per cent relative to the IDA 9 period, reaching US$3.5 billion.  Many countries have made formulating and adopting policies conducive to poverty-reducing growth their highest priority.  During the IDA 10 period new adjustment operations which accounted for one-quarter of commitments supported policy reforms in more than 30 countries.  A total of 41 of IDA's borrowers are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of them depend on aid flows to a great extent.  Because these countries must grow rapidly if they are to offer their expanding populations a way out of poverty, this region has the greatest concentration of IDA activities.  Individual operations, as well as country assistance strategies, are increasingly designed following consultations and drawing on lessons learned not only in IDA operations but also by other agencies. Nearly one-half of IDA 10 operations made use <Col N="268" /> of one or more of the four strongest forms of participation which include joint assessment, shared decision-making, collaboration and empowerment of beneficiaries.  Formulation of country assistance strategies benefited from consultations with a wide range of policy makers and representatives of civil society.</P>
    <P>The IDA 10 period saw a continuation of IDA's efforts to develop and implement effective programmes of assistance, focused on country specific poverty reduction strategies.  Progress was made in many areas.  However, much remains to be done to further improve ownership of reform programmes and foster local institutional capacity, to sharpen the poverty focus of IDA activities, to enhance project effectiveness and to strengthen partnerships with all stakeholders, both internationally and within the poor countries it is IDA's mandate to serve.</P>
    <P>Other areas which have been prioritised under IDA 10 include research into disadvantaged areas, involvement of non-governmental organisations and gender sensitivity, recognising in particular the role of women.  Some specific actions taken by the IDA during the 10th replenishment include the following: in Africa more than six million textbooks were distributed, mainly to primary schools; in Pakistan more than 7,000 school classrooms were constructed; in India 64,000 health care workers were trained; and in Bangladesh, more than 250 kilometres of rural roads were improved.  Overall, given that development is predicated on sound economic and social policies, it is not surprising that the poor countries with the best performance receive the largest relative commitment from IDA.  Ireland supports the concentrated use of scarce resources on good performers, but is concerned that this policy should not be pursued to such a degree that the poorest countries might irretrievably lose out and we have continued to make that point in discussions with the various agencies.</P>
    <P>Ireland's key focus in its dealing with the International Development Association, specifically with IDA 11, is to ensure that adequate resources are provided to Sub-Saharan Africa, which is a particular objective of Irish policy; IDA resources be used efficiently and effectively in terms of lowest possible amount of administration; funding be linked to sound economic practices, including good government; and progress is made on creating the conditions that will promote the development of civil society.</P>
    <P>Our Government accepts that an important determinant of good performance is whether the borrower's macro-economic and structural policies contribute significantly to the central objective of reducing poverty within a framework of good government.  This brings me to the issue of Ireland's contribution to the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility known as ESAF. With regard to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMF, which refers to cheap loans granted to the poorest countries, I state again that the Government does not propose to <Col N="269" /> authorise Ireland's contribution to ESAF in advance of a satisfactory operational implementation of a comprehensive debt relief framework. The Government accepts that the debt initiative adopted at the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in October 1996 represents a step in the right direction.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, indicated on behalf of the Irish Government to the executive director of the Irish constituency at the IMF that the Irish contribution to the current ESAF would need to follow rather than precede implementation of the debt initiative for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries known as HIPCs.  Ireland's contribution to ESAF remains conditional on a satisfactory operational implementation of the debt initiative.  The same considerations will apply to any other source of funding that might become available as a result of the optimisation of the use of resources by the IMF.</P>
    <P>A preliminary review of the debt initiative will take place at the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, which are due to commence this weekend.  The review of the operation of the debt initiative will provide an opportunity for Ireland to consider again how Ireland's participation in the initiative might best be effected.</P>
    <P>A key concern is the view, widespread in Ireland and indeed shared by Deputies on both sides of the House, that the conditions attached to ESAF programmes may impact disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the community.  I note and welcome that the IMF has commissioned a small number of independent consultants to carry out an evaluation of several aspects of ESAF-supported programmes.I very much welcome the focus of the consultants and their concentration on three key topics, namely, developments in countries' balance of payments during ESAF-supported programmes; social policies and the composition of Government spending during ESAF-supported programmes; and the determinants and influence of differing degrees of national ownership of ESAF-supported programmes.</P>
    <P>The consultants' findings will be relevant to the Government's consideration of Ireland's contribution to ESAF, particularly in the context of the evolution of IMF policy on ESAF conditionality. In this context, I acknowledge the contribution of the non-governmental organisations in highlighting the impact of excessive debt and the difficulties this poses for the affected countries in reducing poverty.  Several of these agencies have an impressive track record in working to ease the lot of the poorest.  Their considered and thoughtful opinions on a wide range of developmental issues, forged out of long experience in the field, provide a valuable perspective which has not been in any sense ignored by the Government.  In our consideration of developmental matters, we have accepted their voice is a valuable contribution at national and international level and I pay tribute to their work and commitment.</P>
    <P>Turning to the linkages between our contributions <Col N="270" /> to the IDA and Irish Bilateral Aid Programme, Deputies will appreciate that contributions to multilateral bodies, like the IDA, are only part of Ireland's overall contribution to overseas development.  Inclusive of bilateral and multilateral funding, Ireland's official allocation to aid has risen to IR£122 million in 1997.  This is the highest level ever in monetary terms and as a percentage of GNP.  This also accords with the Government's stated policy to move steadily towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  I should say that this year the figure is 0.31 per cent of GNP.  As recently as 1992, the figure was 0.16 per cent of GNP, so we have doubled the amount in the intervening years.  I emphasise it is a time of high economic growth so any percentage of a rapidly increasing GNP is valuable in real terms on the amount of money provided.</P>
    <P>The priority for Irish Aid is to contribute to the long-term economic and social development of the poorest countries, especially those in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Irish Aid has identified six priority countries for the receipt of assistance &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania, Zambia, Ethiopia, Uganda and Mozambique.  The bilateral aid programme also co-funds aid projects with Irish and international non-governmental organisations.</P>
    <P>Irish Aid works closely with the host governments in partner countries at national, regional and local levels.  This approach has the advantage of increasing the likelihood that individual projects will be maintained beyond the duration of direct Irish Aid involvement.  More generally, Ireland's primary focus on the poorest countries of Sub-Saharan Africa dovetails well with IDA's emphasis on assisting the poorest developing countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland's membership of IDA was authorised by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  Our contributions to the various replenishments have been authorised by amendments to that Act and this Bill will enable us to make our contribution to IDA 11.  The Bill is essentially a one section Bill authorising Ireland's contribution to the replenishment.  The table in section 1 merely sets out the historic pattern of contributions made by Ireland since the inception of the IDA in 1960.</P>
    <P>In summary, the Government is determined to continue to work effectively with the IDA in the interest of promoting development in the poorest and least developed countries.  This is not to say that the IDA is blemish free.  It is quite clear that, in the context of further progress toward the global economy, specific measures are necessary to ensure that the least developed countries get a fair opportunity to participate.  First, if this is to be achieved, the developing countries will have to play a greater part and essentially take charge of the development processes.  Second, it will be necessary for the IDA to continue to take action to refine its policies and programmes to address real needs in the countries concerned.  Third, it will be necessary for IDA to ensure its services are provided in an efficient and effective manner. <Col N="271" /> I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Minister's last point, he said: &ldquo;this is not to say that the IDA is blemish free.&rdquo;  While we support this Bill, and Governments through the years have provided for replenishments for three year periods, there is much concern about giving loans, whether &ldquo;soft&rdquo; loans or interest free loans, which may impose much hardship on the poorest countries.  Many of the NGOs, which contacted me and other Deputies, said that when we talk about the objectives of the IDA being closely related to the bilateral aid programme, we are talking about two different things because the bilateral aid programme provides grants to the poorest countries. A major concern is that we are giving loans to countries which cannot pay them back.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we have supported International Development Association (Amendment) Bills in the past.  I notice on this occasion we will make a total payment of £13 million to the 11th replenishment of the International Development Association, which is welcome.  I hope the funding we provide, whether loans, credits or grants, will focus on poverty reduction and on human development in poor countries.  We hear much about restrictions which are sometimes laid down, particularly in relation to ESAF about which I will speak.  If restrictions relating to economic reforms and cutbacks are laid down, they will cause more poverty in these countries. There are examples of countries with low inflation but where poverty has increased. Uganda is a particularly good example.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear that the US contribution will not be available in the first year of the three year period and will be available only in the second and third years of the IDA 11th replenishment.This has led to the need for a one year interim fund to which Ireland will commit £4.3 million in 1997.  I am worried that the richest countries are not providing funding, not meeting the UN target as regards GNP and have cut back. The balance of the Irish commitment will amount to £8.7 million in 1998 and 1999.  I hope we use our considerable influence to try to get rich countries to commit themselves to meeting the UN target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago, at a time when countries tried to increase their efforts to meet the UN target, 21 of the richest countries in the OECD reduced official development assistance.  The figure for 1995 was 0.27 per cent GNP, which was appalling and an indictment of the richest countries.  It is welcome that we have managed to increase our percentage of GNP to 0.31 per cent this year.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis last weekend I welcomed that increase and said we would increase our commitment to ODA when in Government. The proposal made by groups such as the Debt and Development Commission and NGOs such as Trócaire for what they call a once off arrangement <Col N="272" /> for the writing off of the debt of the world's poorest countries should also be examined.  I hope the Minister will press for that when discussing this issue with other Government Ministers.It sounds very simple but it has been sought for years.  No previous Government did it but it is the way to solve the serious problems.</P>
    <P>One of the issues raised by the Debt and Development Coalition regarding Uganda was the disappointment that the heavily indebted countries initiative of which the Minister spoke has been postponed for two years.  Uganda, the first country to qualify under that initiative, will not now qualify for two years unless there is a change in attitude.  Countries, such as the US, Japan, Germany and Italy, have used their considerable clout to delay that decision.  It means that one million Ugandan children, who would receive basic primary education, will not get it unless there is a change in the thinking of rich countries.  It is most important that that initiative is pursued.  I agree with the Minister that we must first have the initiative before we contribute to ESAF.  Full marks go to the Minister for Finance who pointed that out in his discussions with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Development Co-operation.  I hope we pursue that route so that we first take the initiative involving countries in severe debt before we make contributions to ESAF.</P>
    <P>I received a figure from the Debt and Development Coalition stating that African countries are making $12 billion in debt repayments to their creditors in rich countries.  That is a frightening figure and, combined with the strict conditions attached to structural adjustment programmes, the situation is serious for people in these countries. The IDA and the World Bank have been praised for their initiatives but the Debt and Development Coalition states that two thirds of repayments go to the World Bank.  I hope it deals with the issue of debt relief and cancellation.  While it may be part of the problem, it can also be part of the solution.Pressure should be brought to bear on it to establish a system of debt relief.  Commercial banks also make loans as well as the IDA, the soft loan arm of the World Bank.  I have seen figures which indicate that 10 per cent of African debt is owed to commercial banks.  I hope the World Bank leads the way on debt relief and that there will in future be more direct grants, which is the route of the bilateral aid programme, rather than loans with strict repayment conditions.</P>
    <P>The comments of the Minister of State on ESAF are welcome.  At meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and its Subcommittee on Development Co-operation, the issue was raised of what drastic and immediate action can be taken.  One of the subcommittee's suggestions was that the IMF should sell some of its gold but I do not know how successful that would be. A delegation from the Debt and Development Commission, meeting the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs this afternoon, made this suggestion as part of the solution to serious debt.  Any <Col N="273" /> initiative we can take should be pursued.  Repayment conditions are laid down and poor countries are told to reduce spending and inflation, yet poverty has increased in some of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of the exploitation of workers, especially child labour.  The West has a major role to play in helping with the trade questions which have arisen in discussions in this House and at committees.  If we do not impose restrictions on trade with these countries, a contrived situation will continue to exist where production costs are kept low and there will be continuing exploitation of workers and child labour. The latter aspect was well highlighted by some NGOs during the Christmas period when they launched an effective campaign against toys produced in these countries for Christmas.  It was an excellent campaign and brought home to people the conditions under which very young workers produced these toys which we take for granted.  I hope we continue to highlight that and that the Minister of State takes up the matter with his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>Arms are still being sold to people involved in many conflicts.  Some EU countries involved in arms trading make high-minded and lofty statements about stopping fighting and ending wars. They encourage conflicting countries to get involved in peace negotiations, yet they hypocritically sell arms to those involved in such conflicts. We can make a strong stand on that in the EU and explain to our European colleagues that they are adding to conflicts and serious problems.  The figures we obtained from the international alert group, which we met at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, was that there are 32 major conflicts throughout the world, some of which involved western countries, and that must be tackled.</P>
    <P>When debating the drugs trade, we should remember that much of it in the poorest countries is affected by how we act here.  If western European countries have dealings in the drugs trade, it adds to conflict and exploitation, especially in African countries.  A sustainable development plan must be drawn up, especially for central Africa.  When discussing the debt problem, all problems affecting Africa should be addressed, especially the Saharan and sub-Saharan areas.  We cannot have a situation where ever more money is taken from these countries by restrictive decisions under ESAF or loans which are not suitable to people who live in those countries.  This legislation is welcome but there are other issues which need to be looked at.  I hope the Minister will respond in more favourable terms when he has the opportunity.</P>
    <P>There were contradictions in the Minister's speech.  He spoke about countries which have done well.  However, the actions of some of the richer countries have delayed many programmes such as the programme for Uganda.  We must use our influence to ensure real progress is made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="274" /> Since the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs introduced the Irish Aid Consolidation and Growth Strategy Plan in 1983 we have added three countries to the bilateral aid programme. That programme is most effective and is referred to in the Tánaiste's speech.  I hope other initiatives will be in line with that programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I hope richer countries will come on board whether by increasing their overseas development aid or by involvement in initiatives to help heavily indebted countries.  Programmes for Africa, in particular, must not be delayed again and we must not fall behind in our attempts to reach the UN's 0.7 per cent of GDP target, as happened in 1995.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that western and northern European countries have made great progress in trying to reach this target.  However, the G7 countries have not lived up to their commitments.  The same is true with regard to UN funding.  We have to make a stand on this issue and I hope the Minister will be successful in trying to achieve this target.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to participate in this debate.  I welcome this enabling Bill so that Ireland can contribute to the 11th replenishment of the International Development Association.  I have contributed to every IDA debate in the Dáil and Seanad since 1981.  In each of those debates it was necessary to criticise the USA's overseas development assistance policies.  In the 1980s this criticism related to its welshing on its contributions to IDA.  The Cold War criticism of the USA was often linked to its attaching political strings to overseas aid.  The US gave assistance to countries with appalling human rights records. This assistance often went on purchasing arms at the expense of humanitarian assistance on education and basic sanitation.</P>
      <P>It is a pity we must still be critical of the US in the post Cold War era.  The US has decided not to make any contribution in one of the years included in this replenishment.  As a result, an interim fund has had to be established to compensate by drawing additional funds from other donors.  The US is friendly towards Ireland but I cannot understand why the wealthiest country in the world is again shaming itself by failing to contribute a minuscule amount of money by its standards.IDA loans and concessions assist countries and people who are poverty stricken and debt distressed; the poorest of the poor.</P>
      <P>In 1993 I spoke from the Opposition benches on the 10th replenishment.  The number of countries qualifying for IDA assistance increased between the 9th and 10th replenishments.  The level of destitution in certain countries in Africa had increased.  Five or six countries which did not qualify for the 9th replenishment qualified for the 10th replenishment.  Poverty was becoming more pervasive, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  All of the new countries which qualified were from that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure if any new countries have qualified <Col N="275" /> in the intervening three years.  I hope not, and it may be a hopeful sign that the Minister did not refer to this in his speech.  However, we are delighted that this replenishment is taking place. Governments must ensure that moneys borrowed are spent on basic infrastructures and human needs such as education, sanitation and health care.</P>
    <P>The UN Development Programme publishes a yearly report entitled <i>The State of the World's Children</i>.  It is frightening to read the key indicators of human welfare used by this report.  In countries such as Sierra Leone, Mali and Guinea Bissau a huge number of children have no access to primary education.  The mortality rate among children under five years of age is extraordinarily high.  Very few people have access to clean water or any kind of primary health care.  If one compares the current statistics with those of five or six years ago, one finds there is relatively little improvement in the welfare of people in these countries.  A great deal of development policy is not working.</P>
    <P>Ireland is fortunate to be one of the 33 donors to the IDA fund.  According to the OECD, we are the 17th or 18th wealthiest country in the world.  Too often policies do not meet the genuine welfare needs of people.  There are successes but many countries remain in grinding poverty.  Much of this is due to bad government but there is also bad trading practice by the West which keeps these countries in grinding poverty.  They cannot trade with the western world or even between themselves on any kind of equality, very often because of our trade policies.  That issue needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt dealt with the overall issue of debt and its grindingly destructive effect on so many poor countries.  It is still true in the case of many countries that their repayment outflows are greater than inflows of assistance in any one year, an utterly unsustainable position.</P>
    <P>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the so-called Bretton Woods institutions, the main lenders to countries like sub-Saharan Africa that do not have an equity or loan market at home have contributed to their debt problems.  Eighty per cent or 90 per cent of our national debt is generated within our own resources, borrowed from our own people, but theirs is enormous.  In a poor country, they would not obtain 1 per cent or less of their borrowing needs from their internal markets and must seek it abroad.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the nature of that debt and the fact that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been examining it over the past five or six years.  We have had the recommendations of the Paris club, John Major's set of concessionary suggestions when Chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain many years ago, which were presented to the Trinidad Commonwealth Conference, the so-called Trinidad terms. They are inadequate to address the problem, <Col N="276" /> although they are not yet even part of the policies of these Bretton Woods institutions in terms of debt forgiveness.  While some progress has been made it has not been anything like adequate.</P>
    <P>We are a small, generous country particularly, in terms of what our non-governmental organisations do, on a voluntary basis.  Trocaire, GOAL and all the other NGOs, small and large, are to be congratulated on the quality of their well-targeted work and the manner in which they identify the issues needing to be tackled.</P>
    <P>With Deputies Kitt and Gallagher I have seen our official overseas policy being implemented in places like Tanzania, Uganda and elsewhere.  It is well focused on the real issues, building the people's capacity to eventually grow sufficient food to build their education system, provide sanitary services and so on.  These agencies work with the people in a spirit of partnership, seeing and treating them as equals, which is extremely important.</P>
    <P>No doubt our anti-colonial nightmare past helps us in assisting the peoples of Africa, with a total colonial history at least in the 19th century and helps our image there.  Our Governments are to be congratulated, since the initiation of an official assistance programme in 1974, whose basic philosophy has been informed by the principle of tackling basic needs in a spirit of partnership with the recipient country.</P>
    <P>While there are some appalling cases worldwide, I shall deal with Zaire for a few moments. Zaire a sub-Saharan country, one of the largest, most important countries in Africa, located in the middle of Central Africa.  Since the mid-1960s it has had an appalling history of bad governance, dictatorship and corruption.  It is amazing the country has held together at all.  Some people attribute its survival to President-for-life, Mobutu, although I doubt that.  It is now rapidly approaching the post-Mobutu era; I believe, the rebels who have captured more than half the country within a relatively short time will capture the remainder.  In development terms that country has been driven down in terms of economic development and the welfare of its people.</P>
    <P>The international donor community, including this country, has a special responsibility to take on board a country like Zaire which has suffered the worst ravages of colonial and post-colonial exploitation, bad governance and corruption.  The sufferers are the mass of its population which runs into some tens of millions.  Zaire has the worst education system in the world that probably touches less than 5 per cent of its young people, the worst health care system in that some 2 per cent or 3 per cent only of Zairean babies are immunised against common diseases like diphtheria although it would only cost a few pence per child.</P>
    <P>We must start at the very beginning in that very large country.  If it breaks up, its effect on the stability of a dozen countries surrounding it will be enormous.  Nowadays we live in a global village and while we might think a country like <Col N="277" /> Zaire is very far away, it is very close in that our welfare and the stability of our system is very much bound up with retaining a level of stability and human rights, ensuring that human dignity is respected in countries as far away as Zaire.</P>
    <P>In this post-Mobutu era we should take the lead in ensuring Zaire is made a special case for development assistance.  The mistakes of the past must not be repeated; development assistance should no longer go to &ldquo;security&rdquo;.  The purchase of arms or ammunition should not be part of development assistance policy.  Development assistance will have to contribute to the building of a judicial and educational system, health care and, above all, to good governance in that country, lack of which has damned it and many another developing one.  Such countries have been damned by the foreign and external aid policies of many major powers in the western developed world who have actively supported bad governance and allowed development assistance to be expended on the purchase of arms that eventually were used to kill hundreds of thousands of people and to lay hundreds of thousands of mines which today kill and maim people in Angola, Mozambique and in every other country where there has been major conflict over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>We must remember that very often funds contributed through development assistance policies were used to purchase those weapons of death still sown in the ground in so many countries.  A country with an excellent reputation like ours, which has never played any part in that, must give a lead and insist that type of genocide is never repeated.</P>
    <P>One of the best methods by which Zaire &mdash; one of the largest countries within Africa, driven down by what has taken place there over the past 35 years &mdash; can be assisted is by our adopting an entirely new approach to development assistance.</P>
    <P>I will comment on some of the Minister of State's remarks on our development assistance programme in recent years.  I am not being self-congratulatory merely because I find myself on this side of the House.  What we have done for such countries in recent years has been truly praiseworthy.  In 1993 the value of Ireland's ODA was £54.6 million, 0.2 per cent of our GNP.  We have steadily progressed at least half way to the United Nations goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  In 1996 the value of our ODA was £106 million and this year it stands at £122 million or 0.31 per cent of GNP which includes the growth in the value of our GNP in the meantime.  There is not a major growth rate between 0.2 per cent and 0.31 per cent but there is a huge difference in monetary terms.  In three years we have more than doubled the amount of money we are contributing to overseas development assistance and should be congratulated on that.</P>
    <P>We live in a world where there is a certain amount of what is called &ldquo;donor fatigue&rdquo;.  Many Governments including the UK and Germany &mdash; even though their position is good from the point <Col N="278" /> of view of the United Nations target and their generosity is well noted &mdash; are cutting back on their overseas development assistance.  During its economic recession Sweden, one of the most generous countries in terms of ODA, cut back in a major way.  There is &ldquo;donor fatigue&rdquo; about ODA. which donor countries suggest is related to public opinion.  I do not believe that.</P>
    <P>Last week I attended a conference in Holland which dealt with public support and public opinion in relation to overseas development assistance.  The Irish Council for Development Education, set up by the Government some years ago, gave an excellent paper to that conference on public attitudes and support for ODA in Ireland, especially among young people.  A scientific survey carried out by IMF showed 74 per cent of young people were aware of overseas development issues and they supported the idea of countries like ours making a major contribution towards development in the Third World. In other words young people understand the main tenet of the development issue, the need for the transfer of resources by better off countries to less well off countries.</P>
    <P>Papers were read to us by people from Holland, Germany, France and all the other European Union countries.  Each one had conducted a similar survey which showed, despite policies at home and public opinion among the adult or the younger population, support for a greater level of resources from all these countries being paid in overseas development assistance.  As Members we must learn that lesson.  We are always acutely aware of public opinion.  Clearly it is saying there is no objection to us spending £122 million, which would build many roads, on overseas development assistance.  The other eloquent statement of our generosity and public support is the voluntary contribution made by NGOs in the amount of money raised and the number of young people GOAL can recruit, for example, engineers, nurses and doctors who give two or three years of their professional lives working for nothing in the development of poorer countries.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am pleased to support this Bill.  In my short time here this is the second International Development Association Bill we have discussed and the second time the House has been asked to approve an extra contribution by Ireland to the International Development Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rightly, we are critical of much of the work undertaken by the international monetary institutions and some of the work they do not undertake.It is widely recognised that one of the areas in which they have been most successful in their efforts to alleviate poverty in the poorest countries is through the work of the International Development Association, because it works from a development perspective and not from a short-term financial or monetary perspective; the finance is available on attractive concessionary terms and the criteria by which the IDA works in <Col N="279" /> disbursing the money are, in relative terms, progressive.I compliment the Minister on his comprehensive overview when introducing the Bill of the work of the International Development Association, the particular situation affecting the 11th Replenishment, the key issues in the negotiation of the IDA 11 and his further contributions on the ESAF.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons the House supports any increase in our contribution to the International Development Association is because of its clear focus on poverty reduction and poverty elimination.One of the criticisms we make of many of the programmes undertaken by the IMF and the World Bank is that they focus on the macro situation without taking the micro needs of the economy or parts of the economy of the country concerned into account.  The Minister correctly outlined during the negotiation of the 11th Replenishment that the key issues included fine tuning the poverty focus of the association, introducing proper assessment of the environmental impact of its projects and concentrating on the problems of the low income highly indebted countries in servicing and redeeming their debt.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last year and the previous year on the question of Ireland's possible contribution to ESAF &mdash; the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility of the IMF &mdash; it was pointed out by Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas and by NGOs that if Ireland was considering making an extra financial contribution to the international financial institutions, the IDA was the more preferable place in which to lodge our contribution than the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.  I am pleased policy had changed in relation to contributions to ESAF and that an increased contribution is being given to the International Development Association.  The clear view of Members was that we should contribute more money to the International Development Association and that we should use an amount of our direct aid budget to finance not initiatives by the international institutions but small scale local initiatives in countries such as Tanzania and Uganda.  Those of us who have had the opportunity to visit those countries will be aware much work has been done in setting up small local credit schemes, many of which are focused on the needs of women.  In Tanzania I saw many credit union style operations set up at local level which, in some cases, helped women get out of prostitution and in other cases helped widowed women with large families to get back into some form of economic activity and away from the enslavement to the relatives of their dead husbands to which some of these societies still condemn them.  Our view was that we should support this initiative as well as the small local scale credit interventions.  We did not believe it was appropriate for Ireland to contribute at this <Col N="280" /> stage to the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was to monitor implementation of that programme.  The seven trade union, employer and farm organisations &mdash; ICTU, IBEC, CIF, IFA, ICMSA, ICOS and Macra na Feirme &mdash; responsible for negotiation of the PCW were members of the committee.  The PCW expired at the end of 1996 and has been replaced by Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Under Partnership 2000 a variety of monitoring mechanisms have been put in place and these are set out on page 74 of the partnership document. They include: (i) an annual meeting of all the parties to the partnership, which I will chair; (ii) six monthly meetings with those parties that negotiated the pay agreement and who have a specific interest in the modernisation of enterprises and the modernisation of the public service, chaired by the Secretary of my Department; and (iii) quarterly meetings of members of the four pillars, that is, trade unions, employer and business organisations, farming organisations and community and voluntary sector organisations, chaired by the Secretary of my Department, to review and monitor the operation of the partnership.</P>
      <P>In addition to these arrangements, any party to the partnership may raise an issue regarding any aspect of the partnership with the Secretary of my Department, who may convene a special meeting to discuss that issue.  The NESC will play a role in the monitoring process by benchmarking progress in areas covered in the partnership.  The NESF will also play a role by monitoring the implementation of the social inclusion and equality elements of the partnership.  All 19 organisations which took part in the negotiations will be involved in monitoring the implementation of Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>Who are the people on the Central Review Committee, which still exists?  Who are the negotiators and what organisations are represented on the negotiating body?  Who does the Taoiseach consider were the negotiators of the agreements last Christmas?</P>

      <P>The Central Review Committee existed for the purposes of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  That programme was more confined in terms of the number of people involved in negotiating it.  In the case of Partnership 2000, we extended the range of organisations involved in the negotiation, partly at the prompting of Members of the House.  It includes, for example, community and voluntary organisations, women's groups, the unemployed and so forth.</P>
      <P>As the number of people involved in aspects of Partnership 2000 was much wider than the number involved in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> we had to find new, more flexible arrangements than the Central Review Committee, which was basically one core group with everybody else on the edge.  We have now agreed multi modal arrangements.  There will be an annual meeting involving everybody.  There will also be six monthly meetings, the first of which I held two weeks ago, with the employers and trade unions on pay issues.  The six-month period is a minimum and we can meet more often if necessary.  In addition, there are quarterly meetings with the trade unions, employers, the business sector and the voluntary sector regarding their areas of interest in the partnership.</P>
      <P>The arrangements are designed to cope with the more diverse range of people involved in the negotiation of this agreement.  A more narrow range of organisations was involved in the negotiation of the previous agreement.</P>

      <P>While I am in favour of the participation of more people, is the Taoiseach satisfied the system of annual, six monthly and quarterly meetings with different groups to deal with different issues is workable?  Even though it is only months since the agreement, there are strains in many areas and many representations have been made to Opposition Deputies about aspects of the partnership which I understood had been negotiated and concluded.  If the Taoiseach is not satisfied with the system, would it be possible to devise an easier structure?  The Taoiseach did not design the structure and it appears to be cumbersome.  Even the Taoiseach's explanation of it &mdash; some are involved in meetings each year, some are involved in the six monthly meetings and some are involved in the quarterly or monthly meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The pay aspects are always difficult.Are meetings on those issues only held with the employers led by IBEC and CIF and the trade unions led by ICTU?  In other words, on matters relating to pay are we effectively back to <Col N="282" /> the old Central Review Committee, excluding the farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The first meeting to discuss pay took place two weeks ago.  However, there are contacts about pay issues between my Department, the Department of Finance and other Departments which have daily responsibility for these matters and either employer or trade union organisations.  These contacts are ongoing in regard to all areas of difficulty.  The Deputy referred to current areas of difficulty.  It is important to point out that these arise under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> They are claims which have not been settled or agreed under clause 2 (iii) of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> not Partnership 2000, and relate in particular to changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service. They are currently the source of some public concern.There is no mention in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> of relativity as a basis for claims.  The basis for claims under clause 2 (iii) negotiated by a previous Government is changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service.  It is stated that no form of industrial action or pressure shall be taken by either side in furtherance of claims.  This explicitly excludes industrial action.  The clause was agreed and signed up to by all of the social partners.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to do so as my colleague, Deputy Cowen, is dealing with the issue.  I do not understand why the Government is adopting this as a negotiating tactic.  In the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Labour Court was appointed guarantor.  If agreement could not be reached on a particular issue, it was open to the Government to ask the Labour Court to deal with it.  It is open to the responsible Minister, in this case the Minister for Health, to refer this matter to the Labour Court under the appropriate clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  We are turning what is a simple industrial relations matter into the most complicated one we have ever had to deal with.  I cannot understand why it has not been dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to any of the parties involved to seek the assistance of the Labour Court in the resolution of the dispute.  The Government is approaching all disputes with a view to reaching agreement based on negotiation but without industrial action being taken by either side.  The clause under which all of these claims are being considered excludes specifically industrial action or pressure by either side in furtherance of claims.  So far as using the conciliation and adjudication arrangements of the Labour <Col N="283" /> Court is concerned, the Government is open to approaches in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As the member state holding the EU Presidency, it is for The Netherlands, in the first instance, to propose the matters for discussion at the Amsterdam European Council.  The Presidency has not yet finalised its proposals in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council in December reaffirmed the importance of completing the Intergovernment Conference at the Amsterdam Council.  It is clear, therefore, that the Intergovernmental Conference will be the principal item on the agenda at this Council.  It is likely that a special meeting of the European Council will be held in advance of the Amsterdam Council to assist the objective of concluding the Intergovernmental Conference but this has not yet been officially confirmed by the Presidency. Other items likely to be on the Amsterdam Council agenda are economic and monetary union, employment, the report of the high level group on organised crime and the Union's external relations.</P>
      <P>As regards my 1997 commitments to other formal foreign engagements at Head of Government level, I will attend the United Nations General Affairs Special Session in New York in June and the Council of Europe summit meeting in Strasbourg in October.  I will also be representing Ireland at the 500th anniversary celebrations in Newfoundland &mdash; a part of Canada with which we have significant historical links &mdash; in June.  In addition, arising from my meeting with the Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, in Shannon in February, I have accepted his invitation to pay an official visit to Russia in 1997 at a date yet to be arranged.</P>

The subject matters for discussion and decision are well known and have been set out in clear terms, most recently in the draft Treaty prepared by the Irish Presidency for the Dublin summit. They are currently the subject of lively debate in Britain.  There is no possibility, therefore, of an information deficit on these issues.  One would expect the incoming Government in Britain, whether it be the existing Government or a new composition, to be fully informed of all the issues for decision.  I am, therefore, confident that we will be able to conclude the Treaty in Amsterdam as agreed in Madrid.  This was reaffirmed in Dublin.The most likely date for the informal meeting is 23 May.</P>

Will he raise with member states the need to keep in place and honour the principle of the free movement of persons and goods?  Some 500 Irish trucks carrying 12,000 tonnes of goods, much of which are perishable, are being held up because of a dispute by French fishermen.  This is not the first time Irish trucks have been held up at the French border because of internal disputes.

      <P>The free movement of people and goods is one of the fundamental pillars of the success of the European Union and it is probably fair to say that France has benefited more than most countries from that principle.  France is visited by a very large number of tourists from all parts of the European Union availing of the free movement principles created by the Union and this is of great benefit to that country.  French goods can be exported without interference to all the other states of the European Union which is the largest market in the world for French goods. France is a significant beneficiary of the free movement of goods and persons and it is important for all French people and other Europeans to realise that it is in their interests in terms of the law and in terms of individual practice in the pursuit of disputes to respect the free movement of goods and persons.</P>

The point is that at the end of the day the treaty will be signed at Head of Government level.  It is important from the point of view of the dynamic of the discussions that a meeting between the Heads of Government should take place close to the final meeting so that they have a sense of collective achievement being within reach and a sense of collective purpose to reach that agreement.</P>
      <P>I agree with the approach of the Dutch Presidency to call a meeting at this time.  I have been in favour of such a meeting for some time and have urged the Dutch Presidency to call it around this time.  Holding the preliminary meeting a month ago would not have served very much purpose as it must be held fairly close to the date on which we intend to reach final agreement.  The date chosen, which is less than a month from the date of the summit, is about right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a definitive Irish position on the issue of foreign policy and security and defence?  I appreciate the work done by the Irish Presidency but the information in many of the documents was vague.  Will the Taoiseach outline our definitive position on these issues before the Amsterdam summit and does he envisage that the conclusions will be meaningful or that there will be some sort of fudge and opt-outs for different member states?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said publicly and privately that I abhor the concept of opt-outs as it is contrary to the principle of the European Union <Col N="287" /> and the principle of the community approach. There should be a community approach and even if it is not as ambitious as some people wish it is better than a patchwork of opt-outs.</P>
      <P>One of the issues which remains to be considered is the notion of a flexibility clause which would put a structure on the situation whereby some member states move forward at a greater speed than others.  This is a potentially contentious issue but it is preferable to <i>ad hoc</i> opt-outs. At least it provides collective rules for regulating varying speeds towards a common destination rather than establishing the principle that there is not any common destination and there is just a mixture of opt-outs on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
      <P>The Government's position on this matter has been set out in considerable detail in the White Paper on Foreign Policy.  The Deputy will be aware that the Government is protecting Ireland's interests very strongly on a range of issues, notably the Irish Commissioner position and other important issues.  I do not wish to go through them as I do not want to suggest that those mentioned are more important than others which are not mentioned.  The House can be assured that the national position will be very strongly protected in these negotiations right through to the Amsterdam summit where I believe decisions will be reached.  During the second half of the year we will hold a referendum to ratify the Amsterdam treaty.</P>

      <P>Tá ionadaíocht ar an gCoiste Monatóireachta ó na trí Chomharchumann Forbartha ar na hOileáin Arann, ón Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, ó Roinn na Mara agus ó Roinn an Taoisigh.</P>
      <P>Déanann an coiste plé ar nithe a bhaineann le sólathar na seirbhísí farantóireachta a bhfaigheann fóirdheontais ón Stát Chiste.  Is é atá i gceist agam ná na seirbhísí lasta/phaisinéirí a oibríonn ó chathair na Gaillimhe agus an tseirbhís phaisinéirí a oibríonn ó Ros A'Mhíl, Contae na Gaillimhe.</P>
      <P>Cuireann O'Brien Shipping an tseirbhís lasta/phaisineírí ar fáil ó Ghaillimh de réir conradh buan cúig bliana.  Beidh an tréimhse cúig bliana istigh ag deireadh mí Lúnasa i mbliana. Cuirtear deontas £550,000 ar fáil in aghaidh na bliana don tseirbhís seo.</P>
      <P>Cuireann Island Ferries Limited an tseirbhís phaisinéirí ar fáil ó Ros A'Mhíl faoi chonradh bliantúil.  Cuireadh £60,000 ar fáil i ndáil leis an tseirbhís seo i 1997.  Beidh an conradh istigh 30 Aibreán 1997.</P>
      <P>Tionóladh an criunniú is deireanaí den gCoiste Monatóireachta Dé hAoine, 11 Aibreáin 1997. Shocraigh na hionadaithe ó na h-oileáin gan freastal ar an gcruinniú.  Mar gheall ar sin, bheartaigh an coiste a gcuid gnó a chur an ceal go ceann tamaill.</P>

    <P>Táim ar aon fhocal leis an gcoiste faoin bpointe seo agus tuigim gurb é an Coiste Monatóireachta an forám cuí chun nithe a bhaineann leis na seirbhisí seo a phlé.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's question, there are two points in question.  There will be a mid-term review <i>vis-á-vis</i> Structural Funds in July this year which will look at the question of allocations of spending in the period 1994-9.  Quite separate from that, the milk regime guarantees quotas to the year 2000.  Thereafter, there will be no such guarantee of quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to what would be in the best interest of Ireland, I set up an expert private non-representational group who will shortly present its conclusions.Any reform of the milk sector will have to take into account the next round of the WTO and enlargement of the European Union.  My own view is that there will be no quick abandonment of milk quotas, but they are unlikely to remain in perpetuity because Europe's share of the global market since the introduction of milk quotas in 1983 has dropped from 50 per cent to 30 per cent.  However, we have maintained dairy incomes and a price for milk which is not obtainable outside the Union.  For those reasons we favour a transitional approach.  There are a number of options, but we will be seeking two basic principles, full compensation in terms of a dairy cow premium if there is any reduction in price, and that there will be no renationalisation of the dairy sector in terms of aid to producers.  The House <Col N="293" /> can be assured that because we have about 40,000 family farm dairy producers I am very anxious to ensure that the maximum number of them survive into the future.</P>

      <P>It would be wiser for us to await the detailed EU market analysis for the dairy sector. I have just returned from Brussels.  Only yesterday the Commission circulated an initial market prognosis for the next number of years in terms of demand for world product and supply from Europe and other countries.  It is expected that within the next two months there will be a more detailed analysis of the dairy sector.  It is expected that there will be detailed discussion on the dairy sector at the informal council in Holland on 24 and 25 May.  It would be better for all interests to keep our powder dry other than to establish the tenets of full compensation, no renationalisation and the maximum level of supports to ensure the retention of dairy farm numbers.</P>

What are the Minister's views on recent merger proposals in the dairy industry?

      <P>The claw-back is working well.  We have effectively put a 10 per cent penalty on private transactions.  The chequebook should not determine who gets milk quota.  That should be done through the co-operatives.  I favour mergers and consolidation in the dairy and the beef sectors.Any specific proposal is a matter for shareholders.We can obtain efficiency gains of 5p a gallon in milk or 2p or 3p a pound in beef by obtaining the latest technology and volume processing.The question of any restructuring fund would require the allocation of extra resources of Structural Funds which would have to await the mid-term review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>A wide range of special measures have been or are being taken to support farm incomes.  A special BSE package worth £70 million was negotiated in June 1996 and was paid out to beef producers last October.  This brought total direct payments to farmers to over £909 million in 1996, the highest ever level.</P>
      <P>A further BSE compensation package of £30 million will be paid out shortly.  In addition, the conditions for payment of the deseasonalisation premium were renegotiated in 1996 and special agreement was reached on continuing this very important scheme in Ireland in 1997 and beyond. The scheme will be worth over £20 million to winter finishers this spring because of the high levels of slaughtering &mdash; it was about £15 previous to that.  A further £15 million was negotiated under the extensification scheme, and this will be paid out to beef producers in 1997.  In addition, a compensation package worth £75 million for green £ revaluations in November and January has been agreed and will be shortly paid out to producers. Additional EU funding of approximately £25 million will be provided to compensate for the latest green rate revaluation on 28 March.</P>
      <P>I have raised the matter of export refunds at the EU Council of Ministers and with the Commissioner for Agriculture, and have asked for the restoration of rates to their former level and for other measures to support Irish beef prices.</P>
      <P>All these measures underline my determination to protect farm incomes which have been affected by a number of factors, including movements in world prices, the BSE crisis, export refund cuts and the revaluation of the Agricultural Conversion Rate.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this morning the Leader of the Opposition raised the question of a public meeting that Deputy Walsh and I will be attending this evening.  I had a meeting at lunch time with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, and a statement will issue tonight.  I intend to pay some national compensation to beef farmers who I consider have been very badly affected. I do not have a copy of that statement with me but, because I do not want to be discourteous to the House, I can say here first that it is my intention to invite applications from farmers for a national scheme, which will be subject to Commission approval as is the normal procedure, of some £50 per head of steer and heifer slaughtered in an export meat plant or domestic abattoir in Ireland from 1 April to 10 June.  The Deputy will be aware that the last revaluation took place on Easter Saturday.  The meat factories opened for business on Easter Tuesday, subsequent to the Easter break.  Prices dropped over Easter by about 5p or 6p a pound.  I have decided to target this £50 a head at the most needy.  This is equivalent to 7p a pound and will compensate people for the very serious body blow inflicted on beef farmers since Easter.  This will run until 10 June which is the end of the DSP period.  From an administration point of view we will be doing this by way of top up to the DSP premiums.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Last year I introduced a compensation scheme which I extended to marts and serious problems arose in regard to dealers and agents who were paid moneys.  There will be a retention clause in this scheme.  The DSP is straightforward.  Since heifer prices are affected, it is my intention that those farmers will be included.  It is not administratively possible to telescope money, but we are talking about a national payment in the order of £17 million. There has been no precedent since we joined the European Union, apart from some drought and weather related payments, for national payments to beef producers.  This scheme is paid for by the taxpayer.  The House will be aware of the difficulty with public finances with reference to the Maastricht Treaty.  For that reason this scheme is the most appropriate in that it will target those in greatest need and most deserving of funding.</P>

      <P>Cattle farmers will be disappointed to learn that there is no provision for those who sell through the marts.  Will there be any payment for the 40,000 hard pressed dairy farmers to whom I referred earlier, who suffered about 25 per cent loss because of revaluation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent focus of lobbying has been on the beef sector and the meeting to be held tonight will also concentrate on that sector. In the context of the £26 million that will be paid for the revaluation of 28 March, the Government is considering further measures for payment to the non-beef sector.  There will be compensation for other sectors, but it will not be on the same scale of generosity or resource allocation as for the beef sector.  In equity, given the limited resources, that is the right thing to do.</P>

      <Quest>if the official of his Department serving at the Permanent Representation of Ireland in Brussels who is personally currently handling the Government's response to the Commission's Article 169 Infringement Proceedings against Ireland in the Emerald Meats matter, is the same official who was involved with documentation in his Department in February 1991 which the State relied upon in the Irish courts in the Emerald Meats case, recently finally decided by the Supreme Court; and if so, the reason therefor.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 169 infringement proceedings referred to by the Deputy have been in abeyance since their suspension by the EU Commission in January 1991.  Responsibility for handling the Government's response to Article 169 proceedings is discharged in Dublin.  The main responsibility of the Permanent Representation in Brussels in the matter is to act as a conduit between my Department and the European Commission and this responsibility is discharged by the Agriculture Counsellor in the Representation who has never had any involvement in the court action.  One of the other officials of my Department currently employed in the Permanent Representation was involved in the documentation relating to the Emerald Meats case, but the official in question is not personally handling the involvement of the Permanent Representation in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware I have in my possession a letter from the Commission DG6 signed by Mr. Gui Legras, Director General, stating that the official concerned who dealt with this documentation replied to a number of letters from that directorate general seeking information about this case?  He forwarded in particular a copy of the judgement of the Supreme Court delivered on 3 March 1997.  This is the same official who dealt with the documentation in the case and apparently has admitted to the Garda altering that documentation, to the detriment of the plaintiff in the case concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the correspondence the Deputy has, but the person in question would be merely acting in the same way as a postal conduit.  The key decisions in regard to Article 169 proceedings and others are taken at a <Col N="297" /> very senior level in the Department.  The person in question is an assistant principal officer.  There is a principal officer in the Permanent Representation, Mr. Michael Corry, who is not the person referred to, but I have been assured the person to whom the Deputy refers does not make substantive decisions.  They are made in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has no difficulty in identifying the person concerned, which is a significant matter.  Irrespective of whether the important decisions relating to this matter are made in Dublin, is there not a gross conflict of interest in that somebody who was involved in this matter in a dubious fashion in 1991 is now handling, in whatever capacity, the State's representation in respect of the proceedings the Commission has brought against Ireland?  Since there are 70 or 80 officials in the Permanent Representation surely somebody else could deal with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the agriculture side there are four or five officials.  The name I mentioned is not the person to whom the Deputy referred, he is the person in charge of the agriculture division.  I looked at this file this morning and, in regard to the incident where the papers were altered, there was no attempt by the person to disguise the change.  This was supplementary data sent in a few days after closing date.  The person kept a copy of the original on the file and on the top changed the date.  A valid application came in from a meat company on time, but the company omitted to include details such as the origin and destination of the beef.  That information came in on supplementary paper and it was on the supplementary paper the official in question made the alteration.</P>
      <P>The senior officials who administer this matter on behalf of the EU do not consider this to be defacing or forging of documents.  I am told there would have been other cases where a similar helpful attitude was taken to deal with what would be considered as red tape.  The issue of Emerald Meats, where the Department was found in the wrong &mdash; I accept the Supreme Court ruling and we are not taking that matter further &mdash; is entirely separate from what is called the Ballywalter case, to which the Deputy referred.  Irrespective of one's opinion of the Ballywalter case, the AP in question is not handing any dealings involving the EU Commission and Ireland.  Therefore, there is no conflict of interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister's comments.  Is the Minister aware that, irrespective of his reading of the file, only one application for the licence was received by 25 January 1991, the final date for receipt of applications?  A number of applications, dated 5 February 1991, were received on 6 February and the official concerned backdated them, thus conspiring against the plaintiffs in this case.  The findings of the High Court and the Supreme Court are unanimous in <Col N="298" /> that regard.  This was an act of gross impropriety on the part of the official, presumably done with the connivance of his superiors.  That is different from what the Minister outlined to the House. Backdating a document by ten or 11 days is not a minor clarification.  The date stamp on the Department's original document has apparently been defaced to make it more difficult to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I are talking about two different files.  The official, who is an AP in Brussels, dealt with the Ballywalter application. He was not involved in the incident to which the Deputy referred concerning Emerald Meats.  The dates in that case are different from those in the Ballywalter case.  In the Ballywalter case a meat factory submitted an application before the end of April 1991, but did not supply answers to all the questions asked.  A few days later supplementary data were submitted, on which the date was altered but photocopies were taken of both dates. The Ballywalter incident took place 12 months after the events which led to the Emerald Meats court case and is not the subject of the Article 169 inquiry.  The gentleman in Brussels was not involved in that aspect of the Emerald Meats case and the file I saw this morning did not relate to Emerald Meats.  It related to the Ballywalter application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have copies of the Ballywalter documents before me which I will submit to the Minister.  He should look at the alteration and tell the House whether he approves of a person in his Department backdating the date of an application from 5 February to 25 January to suggest the application was received on time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted to receive data on this matter from the Deputy, but the application on the file I saw this morning was received on time.  Supplementary data were not included on the application, but my Department ruled that there was ample precedent for taking such a benign view of a marginal gap in data.  That is the matter with which the officer in question was involved.  The Emerald Meats case is a separate matter and the Supreme Court has found the Department guilty in that respect.  I have submitted a four page letter to the Deputy on this matter.Neither I nor the officials in my Department, as far as I am aware, are covering up on this matter.I am anxious that the truth is told, whether at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, in this House or through correspondence.If the Deputy feels I am not supplying accurate information, I will be happy to consider the matter further.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with the industry, my Department is developing a national beef assurance scheme which, as agreed in Partnership 2000, will be fully implemented by spring of 1998. The purpose of the scheme is to reinforce consumer confidence in beef products and to provide a comprehensive tracing system for cattle and carcases destined for the human food chain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree he has been promising the implementation of such a scheme since 20 March last year when a debate on BSE erupted in the House of Commons and caused difficulties for us in markets at home and abroad?  The spring of 1998 is too late for the implementation of such a scheme.  Can the Minister assure our exporters, cattle producers and meat plants he will introduce the scheme sooner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter high priority during the past 14 months.  This is an extremely major undertaking, requiring significant resources in computerisation, technology and administration as well as the commitment of the food chain.  An outline of the main elements involved in the operation of the scheme will highlight the difficulties involved.  A computerised movement monitoring system must be put in place to trace animals to their current locations and all residencies throughout their lives.  This will involve a census.  Thus, at the point of slaughter it will be possible to trace each farm on which animals were kept.  It will also be necessary to agree a Protocol at factory, farm, feed compounder and mart levels, including registration and compliance with the provisions set out in the quality assurance scheme.  This will require independent verification from a vet.  It will also be necessary to introduce a system of penalties and to make the scheme compulsory.  I converted the TB forum into an animal health forum to provide for a maximum level of consultation on these matters.  I said the scheme would be launched by Easter, but we have reached an impasse in that the IFA considers that contiguous TB testing and the payment of same is an obstacle to finalising the scheme.  The scheme is 95 per cent agreed and I hope to launch it soon.</P>

      <P>If possible I will introduce the scheme at an earlier date, but its details will be launched soon.  From my discussions with the Russians I do not believe, even if such a scheme were in place, they would have altered their decision.  I am pleased the incidence of BSE is on the decline.  The figures for March and April are promising.  The figures for the latter half of last year were less than for the first half.  The scheme is targeted mainly at the retail premium European market rather than third country trade.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that normally there are very detailed specifications on certifications for beef exports to those countries, but this scheme will be of particular value to high quality premium retail markets.  A labelling and identification directive agreed in Luxembourg this week is currently being dealt with by the Council of Ministers in Brussels and we will have to comply with its provisions.  The scheme will not have that much bearing on world trade, but it will have a significant impact on European business in the long run.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is talking rubbish.  I have taken giant steps forward before the implementation of this scheme.  All meat plants now have a system to check the person who brings in cattle for slaughter.  Each bullock can be traced back to the ten month or 22 month premium schemes and there is a permit system in operation for males.  Prior to this ear tags were taken out of cattle on boats to Egypt and recycled.  There was a lack of control in the system, but rigid controls are now in place.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and enforce the regulations on animal permit movement.  We have invested several million pounds in computerisation of DVOs, meat plants and ports.  We have agreed the bones of a farm Protocol and a factory Protocol with the meat factories and farming organisations. They cover the type of animal feed used and the use of illegal substances.  The Deputy will be aware of the strong line I took on that matter and <Col N="301" /> the spectacular convictions for breaches of the Animal Remedies Act.  It would be wrong to say if this scheme was up and running tomorrow there would be an upward flip in prices.  The introduction of this scheme is not related to prices, but to the integrity of our beef product and ensuring state of the art policing of beef production.This measure has not been put in place in any other country except France.  We can look forward to a major launch of the scheme very shortly.</P>

      <P>Three weeks ago I received a technical delegation from Libya who visited Ireland to observe our controls first hand.  They told me they were impressed with the control measures we have and they would make a favourable report to the authorities in Tripoli.  I have written to my opposite number in Libya to emphasise to him the need for an early favourable decision and I am keeping the matter under close review.</P>
      <P>I plan to travel to Egypt early next month, regardless of an election, and will use the occasion of the Cairo Food Fair to continue my efforts to have the market for live cattle reopened, and I intend to meet a number of members of the Egyptian Government.</P>
      <P>On Iran, Ireland has never sent live cattle to this market, but we have a substantial, albeit periodic, trade in beef.  In so far as the beef trade is concerned, technical discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing a mutually acceptable veterinary Protocol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone listening in will be disappointed with the Minister's answer.  We have listened to the same type of drivel since he came to office.  Does he agree that live exports to third countries are an important aspect of our beef industry?  I presume he will not suggest, as he did in regard to the quality assurance scheme, that the ban on live trade to those countries has not affected the price of beef.  In January the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said he was optimistic about the reopening of live trade with third countries.My colleague Deputy Walsh and I met the Egyptian Ambassador yesterday who said a six month ban was imposed on our live trade with Egypt.  Will the Minister tell us what was the cause for the optimism expressed in January and the talk about the market being reopened sooner rather than later?  Did this give farmers false optimism and cause some of them to keep cattle which otherwise they would not have kept, as a result of which they have suffered financial loss? Last autumn the Minister told us a team of vets was due to come here immediately and I assumed <Col N="302" /> they would arrive in October, November or December.  What is the position on that?</P>

      <P>I told the people what the Libyans told me.  That they changed their minds is a matter for themselves.  I cannot oblige anyone to visit Ireland.  Their visit has taken place, their recommendations are in the system and we await developments.This matter is not only a veterinary issue in those countries, but a demand issue in terms of the availability of cattle in other countries.</P>
      <P>In relation to Egypt, we wanted to get our level of beef exports right.  The volumes are very large and to date this year the volume of exports to Egypt is greater than that to Russia, which is very satisfactory.  We have a new certification system which is working well.  There is a problem with the price.  The market is very competitive.  The Argentinians and Australians are active in all third country markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always hope, but I cannot say that my visit to Cairo will be a success.  It is the first of its kind in so far as Bord Bia will have a trade presence at the Cairo Food Fair and my visit is also political. I assure the Deputy and the House that the timing of my visit is based on advice I received from the ambassador, the Department of Foreign Affairs, Bord Bia and my Department.  They felt that once the issue of the export certification for beef was resolved, and given that the ban was due to be reviewed from June onwards, May was the right time to visit.  I do not know what the outcome will be.  There is a tradition that Ministers do not travel unless there is a reasonable prospect of success, but I do not want to raise expectations there is any guarantee of success.  We must await developments, although I will do my utmost to convince them about the controls we have in <Col N="303" /> place and the reduction in the incidence of BSE in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that many people might suggest his visit to Cairo is a pre-election stunt?  I do not believe that, but many might.  The Minister said he told the truth when he said the visit of a team of vets was imminent last autumn.  I would not like to suggest the Minister is not telling the truth but recently he said he was in Dublin Airport when we knew he was in Kavanagh's pub in Enniscorthy.  I would like the Minister to make more definite statements in future.  This will help to build confidence in the farming community which has not been as low for some time.</P>
      <P>Before the decision was taken to withdraw our ambassador from Iran, why was the trade commission not convened so that we could export live cattle to Iran?  Has the ambassador of any other European country been withdrawn from Iran?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland never exported live cattle to Iran and there is no prospect of doing so.  Iran has taken substantial quantities of beef from time to time, although currently there is a ban in place. An Iranian veterinary delegation visited last autumn and a follow up technical mission is being organised for the coming weeks.  The mission was to have taken place next week but was postponed for logistical reasons in the wake of the Mykonos judgment and the subsequent recall of our ambassador to Iran and the Iranian ambassador to Ireland.  We are maintaining a diplomatic presence in the country and there is every reason to believe diplomatic relations will not unduly delay efforts to reopen that market.  The Deputy would be better off allowing us to pursue the Iranians in the normal diplomatic way.  Perhaps the less publicity attaching to that, the better.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to recover the sums lost to the Exchequer and to the community funds in the matter of export refunds unduly paid on foot of four Bureau Veritas certificates proven by the Commission not to comply with the terms of Regulation 3665/87; and if not, the reason therefor.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The disallowance imposed by the EU Commission in respect of some 1989 export <Col N="304" /> refund payments represented 7 per cent of the export refunds paid to eight beneficiaries in respect of these transactions.  These transactions were proofed by four Bureau Veritas certificates. The disallowance was imposed because at the time of the Commission audit in 1992-3 detailed back up documentation relevant to these certificates was not available as it had been destroyed in Baghdad during the Gulf War.  However, supporting documentation which was still available at the Paris headquarters of Bureau Veritas was accepted as sufficient import proof to confine the disallowance to 7 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is not the case that the Commission proved that these certificates did not comply with the terms of Regulation (EEC) 3665/87.  If there had been any evidence that the beef concerned had not in fact reached Iraq, the Commission would have a full 100 per cent disallowance.</P>
      <P>By 1992 when the EU auditors reviewed these cases the processing of the files had been completed and almost all the securities relating to this 1989 trade had been released.  Security releases must be done in a timely manner to avoid disallowances which can be imposed on grounds of delay alone.  It was not possible to pass on the disallowance to the exporters concerned given the decisions taken and acted upon in the early 1990s and the fact that no fraud was ever alleged.</P>
      <P>With regard to a review of more recent years, the Deputy may be interested to learn the results of an intensive systems audit carried out by the Commission into beef export refund prefinancing expenditure in six member states.  In Ireland the total expenditure audited amounted to £361 million in 1993 and 1994.  The results have just been received &mdash; major disallowances of the order of 5 to 10 per cent of total expenditure have been imposed on the other five member states concerned, with no disallowances for Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in June 1994 when these matters came to light and the shortcomings in the certificates were drawn to the Department's attention Mr. Gerry Cody wrote a memorandum to his superiors saying that in the circumstance we would have to consider living with the level of disallowance and recovering same from either AIBP or BV or both?  That advice was given in the Department by Mr. Cody.  Why was it not followed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of that advice.  The advice I received, however, was that something like the general EU beef fine was not specific to a particular consignment or company and that it was not appropriate to do this.  There was also a question of the EU changing the goal posts subsequently.Eight exporters were the beneficiaries of the disallowance of £2.29 million, a percentage of four Bureau Veritas certificates covering 89 exports to Iraq.  Recovery was not possible where decisions had been taken and acted on in early 1990 and where no fraud was proven or alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Deputy's point on the defacing of certificates, <Col N="305" /> apparently there is no disallowance on the 1998 certificates.  This relates to a point made by the Deputy at the Committee of Public Account that there was defacing of certificates. No disallowance from the EU relates to those certificates.  The dates were independently verified and there was no undue benefit to any individual.I was told that it was not possible to recover for two reasons.  First, the decisions had been acted on so that when the matter came to light in 1994 in the clearance of account, it was too late and, second, the disallowances were a general 7 per cent of the overall tranche and did not relate to a particular consignment of meat where civil proceedings were under way, for example, in the Rathkeale case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rathkeale case has nothing to do with export refunds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  I said there was a difference in the fines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a specific supplementary question and he read out points he said he was asked to make which had nothing to do with the question.  It is extraordinary that the Minister sees himself as a messenger for other people who wish to make points which he makes irrespective of the question he is asked.  If the Minister is not aware of the advice of Mr. Cody of the trade mechanisms division which deals with this, will he make himself aware of it?  Was Mr. Cody overruled by a senior official who did not want proceedings taken against AIBP or BV or both, as was recommended?  Is the Minister aware of his obligation under article 8 of the governing regulation, regulation 729/70, where he must recover all sums lost?  If he fails to make an effort, the Exchequer, as in this case, must bear the burden rather than the EU which would otherwise assume liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy slightly misrepresented the point I was trying to make.  In terms of the briefing I received, there is a view in the Department that the Deputy is confusing two separate types of Bureau Veritas certificates which were discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I made those points so that the Deputy might be relieved of any misapprehension he may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the Deputy's net point on recovery. Recovery of the disallowance which was imposed is unfortunately not possible.  A huge number and variety of import proof documents from custom services and agencies around the world are received by this Department under the export refund system.  The acceptability or otherwise of these documents must be judged on a case by case basis and there are few hard and fast rules upon which to rely.  It is only at a stage when decisions have been made and acted upon and there is no legal recourse against the exporter that the Commission auditors <Col N="306" /> pass their judgement on the decisions taken and can impose disallowances.  The fact that a disallowance is levied on Ireland does not of itself give entitlement to recover any part of the disallowance from companies.  Proceedings brought against companies must be based on a recognised course of action in Irish law and be proven in accordance with the ordinary rules of civil proceedings.The cause of action must be essentially related to alleged wrong doing by the companies concerned and, in this case, no fraud has been proven or alleged.  The Commission did not relate the amounts given to individual exporters, files, consignments, etc., to any specific loss of Community funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard that before but why does Mr. Cody of the Minister's Department, who has it as part of his duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>16 June 1994.  Why did he recommend that the Department should recover same either from AIBP or BV or both?  He is an expert in these matters if he works in the Department's trade mechanisms section.  He does nothing else except this.  He knows what he is talking about and that the money is recoverable under 729/70.  It is nothing to do with Irish law but the obligation under European law.</P>
      <P>Why are these companies consistently doing this?  This is the third or fourth example I have given where export refunds were unduly or wrongly paid by the Department and the securities wrongly released, only for the Department to say that, although those people were improperly paid and enriched, the taxpayer can pay for it and those people can be allowed to keep the money.</P>

I sent a lengthy, four page letter to the Deputy on 21 April about the Bureau Veritas certificates.  I also suggested to the Assistant Secretary in the Department, Mr. Denis Byrne, that he should try and reach the Deputy, as these are very technical matters.  We will try to improve on any information the Deputy has with which he is dissatisfied.Irrespective of what Mr. Cody advised or did not advise in June 1994, the advice now available to me at the most senior level in the Department is that there would be no winnable case for the <Col N="307" /> recovery of the money and it would be putting good money after bad to pursue a case which would be unsuccessful.</P>

      <P>Why did the Minister tell me on 26 March that there was only one Bureau Veritas certificate not signed by Mr. Gurney when I have since sent him three?  Was that not misleading this House?  Did the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to a written question on the same date, not say the same, apparently basing it on information from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  It has been shown to be untrue and the Minister acknowledges that in the letter he sent to me.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17, 23 and 31 together.  I am very unhappy with the prices paid by factories for cattle at this time.  The price is now approximately 10 per cent lower in national currency than this time last year.</P>
      <P>The main cause of the current difficulties is the reduction of export refunds which has been brought about by the EU Commission in an attempt to stay within the GATT limits on subsidised exports.  These limits have been put under further pressure in the past year due to a substantial fall in EU beef consumption arising from the BSE situation.  This has significantly increased the surplus of beef on the Community market and made it more difficult to stay within the limits on EU subsidised exports agreed in the context of the last GATT agreement.  The effect of these reductions in exports refunds on Irish producers has been exacerbated by the revaluation of the Irish agriculture conversion rate.</P>
      <P>The changes in export refunds over the past years are as follows: 1 May 1996 &mdash; 12 per cent increase in refunds; 14 January 1997 &mdash; 10 per cent reduction in refunds; 26 March 1997 &mdash; 7.5 per cent reduction in refunds; 18 April 1997 &mdash; 5 per cent reduction in refunds for bone-in male beef, boneless male hindquarter beef and live exports of male cattle; 15 per cent reduction in all other categories, mostly female.</P>
      <P>I have made strong and frequent representations to Commissioner Fischler regarding these cuts, most recently at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg earlier this week.  I have emphasised the specific problems the Commission's approach has created for beef producers, especially our winter finishers, because of the heavy dependence of the Irish beef trade on third country markets.  I have asked the Commission to abandon this approach and, instead, to manage the licensing system through the application of reducing coefficients.  I stressed the importance in that context of reversing the recent reductions in export refunds and I am taking other actions to support market prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> As regards reductions in cattle prices arising from the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate, I have already answered that question and pointed out the measures we intend to implement.  I have also pointed out the adjustment to the deseasonalisation slaughter premium I secured last year which is worth £20 million or 7p per pound.  I consider that extremely important in alleviating farmers' difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the position reached with these constant reductions over the past 12 months of export refunds has been further exacerbated by the revaluation of the green currency?  The losses suffered are not just the accumulated reduction in beef export refunds but are augmented by the green currency revaluation.  All of it together has resulted in a disastrous situation in which there has been a serious fall in the price of cattle, many markets are closed at the same time and there is much less competition for cattle than one or two years ago. This is highly unsatisfactory.  What does the Minister propose to do about it?</P>

At national level I propose to pay £50 per head for every steer and heifer slaughtered from 1 April to 10 June which is the end of the DSP period.  This will affect those who suffered most.  After the latest revaluation on Easter Saturday prices dropped by 5p or 6p per pound.  The £50 per head being paid for by the Irish taxpayer is separate from the £11 million which we will be paying in further compensation and results in a £184 million package over one year for beef.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter of the export refunds.  The cumulative effect of the cut in refunds would be approximately 25 per cent.  The effect of the revaluation is about 6 per cent.  This means a 30 per cent reduction in subsidies.  The GATT quota is impacting severely.  Consumption of beef in Europe is down by approximately 500,000 tonnes as a result of BSE.</P>
      <P>If beef is not eaten in Europe and does not go into intervention, it must be sold outside Europe. The GATT quota is 1 million tonnes and it is declining each year.  We carried forward 100,000 tonnes of unused GATT licences from last year. From now until the end of June there is only 16,800 tonnes left per week.  If trade is to continue there must be an orderly disposal.  Even since the refund cut last Thursday, prefixations for licences are 22,000 tonnes.  Despite efforts to take the heat out of the demand for licences, we will find it difficult not to exhaust the GATT quota before the GATT year expires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have put detailed proposals to the Commission in relation to a different way of sharing the limited licences such as the application of a coefficient and the introduction of a differential rate of licence for non-transferrable licence so people cannot speculate on them.  One would only take out a licence for what one was likely <Col N="310" /> to export oneself.  There is so little to distribute between now and the end of the GATT year that this will continue on a weekly basis.  The latest cut should be enough to see it through this year.  The Commission's management of the quota will have to be revised.  It will be much tighter next year because the GATT quota will decrease by 220,000 tonnes.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for doing his best in difficult circumstances.  The measures which are causing the collapse in the price of beef are beyond his control.  The disastrous GATT negotiations concluded by the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. McSharry, three years ago are responsible for the considerable reduction in export refunds which impact upon the price of cattle.  People should bear this mind and stop being unfair to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Are meat factories exploiting the situation, as generally perceived by the farming community? What additional moneys should they be paying in comparison to the present prices?  Is it 2p, 4p or 7p per pound?  What is the Minister doing to knock together the heads of meat factory proprietors who are trying to exploit the situation to their advantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Deputy Deasy.  As a former Minister for Agriculture he knows the reality of the situation and his analysis is correct. The GATT deal agreed in 1993 set out the terms, coupled with the CAP reform.  The CAP reform took away the safety net.  When BSE struck in 1990, there was an intervention safety net.  Nine out of every ten bullocks went into intervention. The safety net for intervention beef for Ireland is 72p per pound.  It is not worth a damn to us.</P>
      <P>The liberalisation of agricultural trade in the Blair House agreement has resulted in a situation whereby we are prohibited by a legally binding agreement from giving a subsidy, which was 64p per pound, to beef which we cannot sell in Europe.  Once one reaches 1 million tonnes that is it, not one more ounce of beef can be subsidised.That is the difficulty because three out of four cattle in Ireland are exported to third countries.We are more dependent on that trade than any other member state.</P>
      <P>There is no black and white analysis which will say to what extent the meat factories are responsible for the current low price.  The factories need to answer certain questions.  Regardless of the fact that they have 30 day prefixations at refunds before they are cut, why do they apply the cut immediately?  If a meat factory has a consignment of beef which it is going to fill from something prefixed four weeks ago, why does it apply a price cut immediately even though the effect takes some weeks to work through the system?  The factories must state whether they are profiting from the rapidity with which they apply the refunds.</P>

      <P>Farmers have always believed that when there is no live trade to compete with the mart, the meat factories seem able to collude in what appears to be a cartel in that there is no difference in the price they offer for Us, Os or Rs.  Why is this?  Some of them have business with Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the UK and so on.</P>
      <P>The factories must also explain how it is that, with the same level of refund and intervention, there is such a discrepancy in prices between Ireland and the rest of Europe.  Beef prices are 20 to 30 per cent higher on the Continent.  We would supply most of those markets only with cow or heifer beef but why is female beef not more reflective of the price in the UK or the Continent?The meat factories have exacerbated a bad situation.</P>
      <P>I will take my share of the responsibility but with BSE and GATT I am in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I have to work through a system of trying to find compensation and stopgap supports in the most difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>What is the point of the Minister's complaining?  Impoverished beef farmers want to know what the Minister is doing about introducing a system of transparency.  This would allow us to know whether factories should be paying 2p or 3p more or less per pound.  For example, in the diary industry there was a lot of transparency introduced so that they had to pay the going rate.  The House and farmers want to know what the Minister is doing to insist that factories pay the prevailing rate?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I was in Luxembourg this week and Agriculture Commissioner Fischler said to me that given the GATT quotas and that there are six weeks to run, Ireland could not seek non-existent refunds, and would have the same rate as any other member state.  I proposed APS to deal with residual winter fatteners, 20,000 tonnes of beef, to raise prices in the short-term.  However, when I returned this morning I discovered the meat factories will not operate APS, they do not want to know about it. There appears to be a conflict between the legally possible and affordable measures I am endeavouring <Col N="312" /> to take to support prices which the Commission is examining, and which may or may not be accepted at the beef management committee on Friday next, and the meat factories concentration, not on reflecting producer prices but on their own returns.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Fischler believes Irish meat factories bear some responsibility for the prevailing price here.  While I do not suggest they should take all the blame, neither should they escape their responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In relation to third countries, the same GATT quota would apply to live or dead exports, animals on the hoof or processed beef.  While I am open to any suggestions on transparency, whenever the export refund is suspended or reduced, invariably one hears of some meat factories that had prefixations while others had not.  Yet, when prices drop, they all pay the same, which smacks of collusion.</P>

      <P>We are experiencing difficulties <i>vis-à-vis</i> three markets only, Egypt, Iran and Libya, because there were 73 cases of BSE here last year, compared with 16 cases only the year before.  Had numbers continued to decrease we would continue to export to all of those markets. A number of countries were picked out &mdash; France, Portugal and Ireland, all next in league after the United Kingdom, which had 180,000 cases.</P>
      <P>It is not a matter of lack of political, diplomatic or veterinary activity &mdash; the record speaks for itself.  There is a direct relationship between BSE cases and difficulties in the markets.  Whenever the incidence of BSE decreases here our exports are more readily accepted.  On Wednesday last our BSE eradication plan was endorsed by the standing veterinary committee, comprised of the chief veterinary officer in each of the 15 member states, in respect of which we will receive refunds from Brussels.  That is an endorsement of ours being the most stringent and effective BSE eradication plan in Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Many Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs support Ireland's contribution to this fund, particularly to small, local credit-type schemes in Africa, but strongly oppose any Irish contribution the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>I was glad to note the amended Government stance with regard to ESAF, the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the IMF &mdash; to which the Minister of State referred this morning &mdash; resulting from the many representations received from non-governmental organisations and the many points put to him by the sub-committee on Development Co-operation and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I was happy when the Government decided not to advance proposals to authorise Ireland's contribution to this fund in advance of the satisfactory implementation of a comprehensive debt relief framework.</P>
      <P>In contributing aid we must remember that we are providing certain welcome relief and support measures within a wider global context to alleviate the international debt problem and international trade relations which militate continuously against the efforts of many of the poorest countries in Africa to drag themselves up from the level of poverty into which they have descended to an even keel of economic and social development.  Debt is having a disastrous effect on many of the world's poorest countries.  While they may obtain help from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund they must engage in structural adjustment programmes which result in the burdens of adjustment being borne heavily by the poor, those in ill health, the poorly educated and women.  Before the world community takes serious steps to address this debt issue, it would not be appropriate for Ireland to contribute to the enhanced structural adjustment facility of the International Monetary Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the position advanced by the Government on this fund.  While I welcomed the announcement in the autumn by the IMF and the World Bank of an initiative to help the heavily indebted poorer countries I am disappointed at the slow response in implementing it.  I acknowledge the work done by senior officials in the IMF and the World Bank in responding to the concerns expressed by the NGOs and their states. Mr. Camdessus took a particularly progressive line.  It was amazing how in a short period somebody at the top of such an organisation could say it could not sell gold but was prepared to recognise <Col N="315" /> the debt alleviation strategies it had pursued for some time had not worked and another approach was needed.  However, the response has been slow and I am concerned that if the initiative to help the heavily indebted countries is not implemented quickly it will be too late for many.</P>
    <P>Since the debate adjourned at 1.30 p.m., Deputy Kitt, other Members and I have had an opportunity to inquire further into this issue. Ireland, in preparation for the spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank next week, needs to press strongly for speedy implementation of the HIPC initiative.  If not, by the end of the century this initiative will not have got off the ground in any practical sense in even the countries which were reckoned to be the first candidates for inclusion, for example Uganda.</P>
    <P>Uganda is one of the few African countries which has been prepared to take the medicine the international community has prescribed for it in the past ten years.  It was expected that Uganda would benefit from this initiative.  The Ugandan Government had proposed to use the resources which would become available from this fund to increase funding to primary education.  Only half the children in Uganda attend primary school, and many drop out.  On a visit there two years ago I found that parents in poor families were paying up to three-quarters of the cost of primary education for their children while at the same time students in Markerere University were getting full tuition and accommodation costs.  When choices had to be made in those families the boys, not the girls, were educated.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Uganda which should be an ideal candidate for relief under this initiative by the international institutions, is being put back. The Ugandan Government had to take the unusual step recently of writing to newspapers in this part of the world expressing its disappointment that having taken the medicine it was prevented from benefiting from the cure.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the executive director who represents our constituency in the IMF and the World Bank, i.e the Canadians, are not pressing for early implementation of this initiative in countries such as Uganda.  We form a constituency with a number of other groups and take turns in representing each other there.</P>
    <P>In preparing for next week's meeting, I appeal to the Minister to urge our executive director to support the immediate implementation of this initiative.  I understand the Canadians are seeking an intermediate period and suggest implementation in 1998.  Some of the G7 countries having been forced or shamed into supporting this initiative on debt are trying to drag their feet and delay its implementation until 1999.  I ask the Government to urge the Canadians to push for the implementation of that initiative, otherwise it will be too late.  If countries, such as Uganda, cannot benefit how will the other 40 interested countries receive help from the fund?  In implementing this initiative for the heavily indebted countries <Col N="316" /> the IMF should not be allowed use the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility as its contribution. The IMF must be required to dispose of some of its gold stocks, which it has admitted can be done without upsetting world gold markets, and contribute to the trust fund the World Bank has proposed to undertake this initiative on heavily indebted countries.  ESAF is not a developmental intervention, it is a financial and monetary intervention.The type of relief needed will be of a developmental nature.  At least the World Bank has recognised a special trust fund must be set up.  Ireland should urge the IMF to contribute by selling some of its gold stocks and putting money up front for that fund.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on opening up the decision-making process in the interventions the IMF and the World Bank make in recipient countries.  They are making only limited moves in response to strong pressure.  Ireland which has sought greater accountability and openness in the proceedings of these organisations must continue to be to the forefront of those demands.</P>
    <P>The participation of debtor governments in the heavily indebted poorer countries' initiative should include involvement by the governments at all stages.  In respect of the final stages of the negotiations the Ugandan Government was kept in the dark.  The welcome initiative of the HIPC was leaked by the World Bank last year.  This is not good enough.  Governments, NGOs and the wider society in the recipient countries must be involved at all levels.  I want our efforts to be continued.The Irish Government must, in so far as it can, as a direct contributor to the IMF and the World Bank and through our Canadian executive director ensure the definition of &ldquo;debt sustainability&rdquo;, being adopted by the institutions, is reviewed.  Debt sustainability is being assessed using a ratio of debts to exports.  We should include human and social development indicators in any assessment of debt sustainability.  It has been brought to my attention that a child born in one of these 41 countries today is 30 per cent less likely to reach her first birthday than the average for all developing countries where a mother is three times more likely to die in childbirth. Uganda is spending $175 million on debt repayments but only $120 million on health and education.The debt repayments exceed by a considerable factor the amount available to that Government to spend on health and education. The door is not being slammed in the Ugandan's face but it is not being opened to them in a welcome fashion.  Countries such as Uganda and Bolivia need priority treatment but the indicators used to measure their performance must include those which look at progress in social infrastructure, education, training, women's participation in society, the economy and health.</P>
    <P>During the past three years when the Sub-Committee on Development Co-Operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs addressed this issue we found successive Ministers and <Col N="317" /> officials open to considering our views.  Through the efforts of the sub-committee, in consultation with the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, we managed to make progress in moving the Department's position on the ESAF question.  Whenever we asked the Minister to come before the sub-committee to discuss Ireland's position at the IMF and World Bank meetings we had no trouble.  I would like that arrangement to be put on a formal footing.  To ensure openness and accountability on Irish policy in the IMF and the World Bank a regular arrangement should be made whereby a report of the institution's spring meeting and the AGM in the autumn, and the policies promoted by Ireland at these meetings, would be submitted to the Sub-Committee on Development Co-Operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs for consideration.  In the past three years we have made much progress in opening up the process here.  That type of standing arrangement would ensure that those who have an interest in this area can remain convinced that Ireland is adopting a progressive approach in this regard.</P>
    <P>We can make an important contribution as a link between the needs of the developing world and the needs of the northern hemisphere.  In the period before and since our entry to the EEC we had to undergo structural adjustment.  Our towns lost traditional industries and for many years they waited to benefit from the economic upturn promised by membership of the EEC.  However, at least we were given a long period of adjustment and strong financial support and Structural Funds to help us make the adjustment.  We were also given long derogations from the most rigorous impositions which participation in the single market would bring.</P>
    <P>Ours was a relatively developed country when we entered the European Union.  Since we benefited from a long period of adjustment, significant financial and structural support and a long period of time to get our economy and society ready for the demands of free trade and a more liberal market, we should argue for greater supports and allowances and longer derogations and periods of adjustment for countries in the developing world which are starting from a much lower base, a base which could not be contemplated here.  Those countries are being asked to adopt debt initiatives and structural adjustment programmes in order to comply with the freer trade regime which has been brought about by the world trade organisation and GATT.  They are being asked to make those adjustments in a short period with little support, so we should continue to be a strong advocate of their case.</P>
    <P>We have been effective in this regard in the European Union.  Although our voice in the IMF and the World Bank is relatively weak, we should continue to use it.  The case we make is listened to in those institutions, and the example we give encourages public representatives and NGOs in other northern countries to press their governments <Col N="318" /> to change their policies in that regard.  If we continue the policy adopted in recent years by the Minister and his Department, in consultation with our NGOs, we can ensure that countries burdened with a debt problem who cannot even get on the first rung of the development ladder will have an advocate and will receive a response from richer countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill.  An additional £13 million is badly needed for overseas development and the Government is to be complimented on the hugely increased amount of money it is providing.  The sum has increased from £44 million in 1992 to £122 million in 1997.  I doubt that any developed country has increased its contribution to overseas development to such an extent.  Our contribution represented 0.16 per cent of GNP and it now represents 0.31 per cent. We are approaching the goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP which was laid down by the United Nations. There has been considerable growth in recent years and we should be proud of the Government's work in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that one country, North Korea, was omitted in the Minister's statement, in view of the famine there at present.  It behoves us to bear in mind that every country in need should be given assistance.  Have we pledged specific moneys for aid to North Korea, a country which is seen as an adversary by many countries? It is a diehard communist country, one of the last such regimes in the world.  It is militaristic to a frightening degree and is in possession of nuclear weapons.  However, the country was struck two years ago by a natural disaster and reports from international news agencies indicate that tens of thousands of people have already starved to death.  Its situation has not improved in the meantime and remains serious.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to Irish aid organisations who have done and continue to do incredible work which we probably do not fully appreciate. Some of the men and women who have gone to developing countries have sacrificed their lives. Most of them have sacrificed well paid career opportunities in this and other developed countries.It has been a labour of love and they deserve our gratitude and that of the people in the countries where they served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should consider a more elaborate system for placing personnel in countries where their expertise is badly needed.  The missionary zeal of the Irish race has never been found wanting. However, that zeal has not been maintained in its original form.  Previously, missionary zeal consisted of priests, nuns, christian brothers and other clerics going to all corners of the earth and assisting the poorer communities in those countries.With the reduction in vocations, that system has largely petered out.  However, that does not mean there are not many young, and not so young, men and women here who are still anxious and have the vocation to help the most needy. We should be able to devise a system, with the <Col N="319" /> assistance of the European Union, similar to that of the Peace Corps of the United States in the 1960s.  People who wish to assist their less fortunate brothers and sisters throughout the world should be given every opportunity to do so whether it is by way of sabbatical leave or financial assistance from the European Union.</P>
    <P>A person cannot visit an underdeveloped country without people in authority speaking of the magnificent work which was done over the years by Irish missionaries, teachers and medical personnel.They admit their countries have progressed as a result of the educational facilities which were provided.  They tell of the lives that were saved due to the work of Irish nurses, nuns and teachers.  It is a fantastic achievement by this country and people at home do not appreciate it. We should endeavour to have that work done in a more organised and co-ordinated way.  We should get the European Union involved in ensuring that the thousands of Irish young people who are anxious to help can do so.  People today are as genuine and good as they ever were and we should give them the opportunity to go abroad and help people who are in need.  Our progress in overseas development has been tremendous and the Minister and the Government deserve our compliments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who participated in this debate.  Deputy Michael Kitt expressed the view that loans might not be appropriate for many poorer countries and that grants might be more helpful.</P>
      <P>IDA loans are among the softest available. They are repayable over long periods, in the order of 30 years; there is a moratorium on capital repayments for a period of approximately ten years and an interest rate of 0.75 per cent.  They are as near as one can get to grant aid.  Deputy Kitt said the countries receiving loans should not be overburdened unnecessarily by restrictions and conditions.  I take his point.</P>
      <P>On the issue of arrears, practically every speaker expressed disappointment at the position adopted by the United States.  I understand, however, that it is bringing its affairs up to date and will participate fully in 1998 and 1999.  That is to be welcomed.</P>

    <P>The NGOs have been lobbying to have debts written off.  Deputy Kitt mentioned the huge amounts owed in debt repayments by some sub-Saharan African countries alone.  This is a contentious issue.  The problem is that in writing off debts one creates awkward precedents for the World Bank and lenders who expect to be repaid at some stage.  On the other hand, there is no point shackling countries which have no prospect of repaying outstanding debts.  We have been to the forefront in pushing some of the larger countries into confronting this problem.  Now that the IMF and the World Bank have put a programme on the table &mdash; the debt initiative &mdash; it behoves <Col N="320" /> member countries to deal with it as quickly as possible.  We are encouraging them to move in that direction and will do so again through our representative at the meeting due to take place this weekend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt laid emphasis on the evils of child labour and exploitation.  I take his points.</P>
    <P>The selling off of IMF gold stocks is an emotive issue.  The NGOs and those concerned about what is happening in many parts of the Third World regard it as unacceptable that the IMF is hoarding a colossal stockpile of gold.  It is the IMF's position, however, that one does not sell off the family silver which needs to be saved for a rainy day.  The admission that it is possible to do this in an organised way without upsetting world markets is a significant move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt referred to the drugs trade and suggested the west has to take some responsibility for the way the production of drugs has led to gangsterism and profiteering in many poor countries.He mentioned that Uganda is not receiving the level of support it believes it is entitled to receive in view of its good record and the structural changes which have been made.</P>
    <P>I have noted Deputy Connor's views which were eloquently expressed.  He said that, as we clap ourselves on the back for our efforts in providing overseas aid, the problem in many cases is getting worse.  He alluded to the fact that in underdeveloped countries education is the exception rather than the norm, that infant mortality rates can only be described as disgraceful, that it is rare to find clean water, that health services which we take for granted here are non-existent and suggested that this is something we cannot continue to accept.  He said it is unacceptable that many of these countries are required to repay more than they are taking in and devoted much attention to the wonderful work of NGOs which are doing an exceptional job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor referred in particular to Zaire where he foresees the beginnings of a new era following many years of dictatorship and corruption on the part of the Mobutu regime.  He suggested Zaire should receive priority given its location in a critical position in sub-Saharan Africa to ensure its economy continues to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor praised the Government for the progress made in achieving the target which has been set of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  The figure currently stands at 0.31 per cent.  The Leader of the Opposition stated recently that it was his intention to provide a further £50 million.  The effect of this would be to increase the percentage above 0.4 per cent.  That would be a significant development.  He did not explain, however, where the money would come from but his heart was in the right place and I support the concept.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor spoke eloquently about the commitment of the Irish people to supporting underdeveloped countries.  He mentioned the work of our missionaries, that we do not have a <Col N="321" /> colonial past and that it was the strong view of the Irish people that the Government should be generous in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher expressed strong support for the work of IDA in poverty striken countries.  He also supported the Government's position on ESAF and its decision to withhold our contribution until progress is made on the debt initiative.He spoke eloquently about the benefits to be gained from local initiatives.  He expressed disappointment at the progress of the debt initiative and asked the Government to push Canada, which will represent us next week, to move it forward.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the experience in Uganda and its very heavy debt repayments.  He said that even though that country had adhered to the requirements of prudent management of its economy and the structural changes required for progress, there is still a severe shortage of resources to fund education, health and other programmes and the very heavy debt repayments ought to be alleviated.He said the definition of &ldquo;debt sustainability assessment&rdquo; should be changed to take account of the problems of very poor countries and asked that the excellent informal reporting arrangements between my Department and the Sub-committee on Development Co-operation and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs should be formalised so that there would be at least a twice yearly report on the activities of the World Bank, the IMF etc., our policy positions and how we implement policy.  I will bring these matters to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to North Korea.  This country is not covered by the Bill and has not in the past been a primary target of the ODA programme.In many ways the urgent problems highlighted by the Deputy are matters for the Red Cross and real emergency aid.  I did not expect Deputies to refer to North Korea but I take on board the points made.  While we need to focus on countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which deserve our support, we need to be aware of emergencies of the type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke eloquently about the overseas voluntary work done by missionaries, professionals, doctors, nurses and NGOs.  We are all proud of the work done by them.  I thank the Deputies for their contributions.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this short but important Bill is to provide for validation of marriages where the three months' notice of marriage requirement under the Family Law Act, 1995, was given by some couples to the wrong Registrar of Marriages.  The Bill sets matters right in those cases by validating, with retrospection, the marriages concerned.  It also prevents such cases happening in the future by providing that a marriage shall not be deemed to be invalid in law solely by reason of notification being given to the wrong registrar.  The opportunity is also being taken to make some useful technical legal changes to the law on barring orders granted in the case of cohabitants, on irrevocable powers of attorney and on disclaimers of interest in cases of intestate succession.</P>
      <P>Section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995, requires parties to a marriage to notify the Registrar of Marriages for the district in which the marriage is to be solemnised of their intention to marry not less than three months prior to the date of the marriage.  The effect of section 32 is that, unless special exemption has been obtained from the Circuit Court or the High Court under section 33 of the 1995 Act, a marriage shall not be valid unless the parties have met the notice requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy enshrined in section 32 of the 1995 Act derives from a considerable body of sources. It was recommended by the Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown in 1985 and it formed part of the Government's statement of intentions with regard to marriage, separation and divorce in the run up to the 1986 divorce referendum, while the merits were discussed in the Government's White Paper on Marriage Breakdown in 1992.  During the Government's information campaign prior to the divorce referendum in 1995 the section was highlighted as one of the Government's measures to protect and support marriage.  The provision now contained in the 1995 Act was the subject of debate during February 1994 and September 1995 and was welcomed by both sides of the House.  The period of three months, as provided for in the Act, was considered appropriate to allow for a period of reflection on marriage as an institution of the greatest importance.  The provision was welcomed <Col N="323" /> by all interest groups, including the Churches.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Health, who has responsibility for the Office of the Registrar-General of Births, Deaths and Marriages, has informed me that considerable steps were taken by the Office of the Registrar-General to advise the general public, clergy and registrars of the new notification requirements.  Those steps included the production of information leaflets for couples intending to marry, for celebrants and for registrars as part of a process which began early in March 1996.  Notices in relation to the new requirement appeared in all national papers, the Sunday papers, 40 provincial papers and some magazines, while there were advertisement slots on RTE and commercial radio.  In addition a number of circulars were issued to registrars reminding them of the importance of those procedures and of the need for strict compliance with the guidelines.  Training courses were also held for registrars.</P>
    <P>Since introduction of the notification requirement on 1 August 1996, the notifications which have been processed by registrars have not given rise to difficulties in 99 per cent of cases.  I understand that between May 1996 and April this year notifications of intention to marry were received in respect of approximately 17,500 marriages and of this number 167 cases were referred to the Office of the Registrar-General for review.  While 42 cases were found to be in order, 84 were found not to be in order because the parties failed to give any notice, gave notice short of the three months required or gave notice in error to a registrar for a district other than the district in which their marriage was to be solemnised.  The remaining 41 cases are currently being examined to establish if the requirements of the Act have been met.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the substantive requirement under section 32 of the 1995 Act of three months notice of intention to marry is not affected by this Bill.  Neither does the Bill provide for the validation of marriages where parties failed to give notice in time or failed to give any notice.  Circumstances can arise, however, where the inflexible application of the notification rule under section 32 could be unfair to parties.  In recognition of this, it is provided for in section 33 of the 1995 Act that a person can apply to the court for an exemption from the notice requirement.  In line with the substantive nature of section 32, exemptions by the court shall not be granted unless the applicant shows that its grant is justified by serious reasons and it is in the interests of the parties to the intended marriage.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with those cases where doubts have arisen as to the validity of marriages where notice was given to the wrong registrar.  In those cases, it is reasonable to assume it was the intention of the parties concerned to comply with the law.  For one reason or another, the notifications <Col N="324" /> were unfortunately placed with the wrong registrar and the mistakes, having been made, were not discovered in time for all concerned to do anything about them.  The Minister for Health has stated on several occasions in the House his concern about the matter and his regret about the position that has ensued for the parties concerned.The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has shared that concern and, in consultation with the Minister for Health, indicated his intention to bring forward amending legislation. The Bill implements the commitment of both Ministers in that matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sections 2 and 3 amend the 1995 Act in relation to the notification of intention to marry provisions in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(a) inserts a new subsection (5) into section 32 of the 1995 Act to enable health boards pay fees to certain Registrars of Marriage to compensate them for processing the marriage notices they receive under the section.  The certain registrars comprise about half of all registrars.They are not officers of health boards and their remuneration is currently made up of fees paid by the public and by the appropriate health board for each registered marriage.  The new subsection provides that the level of fee to be paid to those registrars will be specified in regulations to be made by the Minister for Health under section 32(4) of the 1995 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 2(1)(b), which substitutes a new subsection (6) for subsection (5) of section 32, contains a definition of the Registrar of Marriages for the purposes of the Act of 1995.  In relation to a marriage to which section 11 of the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863 applies, it will mean the registrar appointed under section 10 of that Act or a person authorised to act on his or her behalf.  In relation to any other marriage, it will mean the registrar appointed under section 57 of the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844 or a person authorised to act on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) introduces a degree of flexibility as regards the jurisdiction of the Circuit Family Court to deal with applications for exemptions from the marriage notice requirement.  Under section 38(4) of the Act, as it stands, exemptions may be given by a judge of the circuit in which any of the parties to the proceedings ordinarily resides or carries on any business, profession or occupation.  Accordingly, the parties to an intended marriage have to apply to that circuit for such an exemption.  Section 2(2) provides that applications for exemption from the marriage notice requirement may be heard by the judge of any circuit.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the validation of marriages where notification was given to the wrong registrar.Subsection (1) provides for validation where notice was given, under section 32 of the 1995 Act, to a registrar appointed under either the Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1844 or the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act, 1863, and that registrar was not the registrar for the district in which <Col N="325" /> the marriage was intended to be solemnised.  It also provides that, in the future, where couples give notification to the wrong Registrar of Marriage, this will not of itself invalidate the marriage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) validates any marriages which have taken place since 1 August 1996 where a judge of the Circuit Family Court may have granted an exemption from the notice of marriage requirement in cases where the court did not have the jurisdiction to do so because the parties did not ordinarily reside or carry on any business, profession or occupation in that court's jurisdiction.  The provision is for the avoidance of doubt and is a logical consequence of the amendment being proposed under section 2(2).  That problem, if it exists at all, will not arise in the future because of the provision in section 2(2) which allows the judge of any Circuit Family Court to grant exemptions.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions amending the notification of &ldquo;intention to marry&rdquo; rules.  I now turn to the amendments in relation to other areas of the law that are provided for in sections 4, 5 and 6.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, a cohabitant who applies for a barring order must have lived with the respondent for a period of not less than six months in aggregate during the period of nine months immediately prior to the application for a barring order.  It has come to notice that there may be a difficulty of interpretation of the Act in those cases where a cohabitant is seeking the renewal or extension of a barring order.  For the removal of doubt, section 4 inserts a new subsection into section 3 of the 1996 Act.  It provides that where, by reason only of a barring order or interim barring order, the parties have not lived together for the requisite period prior to the application, they shall be deemed for the purposes of the application for a further barring order to have lived together for the requisite period prior to the application for a barring order.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends the law on certain powers of attorney.  The Powers of Attorney Act, 1996 is detailed and complex legislation.  A main feature of the Act is that it introduces a power of attorney which endures notwithstanding the mental incapacity of the donor.  Common law rules had been to the effect that a power of attorney must cease in the intervening event of mental incapacity of the donor.  The Act repeals sections 8 and 9 of the Conveyancing Act, 1882 under which certain powers of attorney could not be revoked by the donor's death, mental incapacity or bankruptcy.  Both sections had been widely criticised as being confusing and failing to provide adequate protection for third parties.  Section 20 of the 1996 Act made it clear the only powers which ought to be irrevocable should be those given by way of security, for example, to protect a mortgage in the event of default in repayments by the donor of the power.  This section applies to powers of attorney whenever created.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> When the 1996 Act was introduced, it was widely understood there were no cases where powers of attorney had been granted otherwise than by way of security.  However, the attention of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has recently been drawn to a case where a person had given a power of attorney which was expressed to be irrevocable and was in consideration of an annual payment to the donees.  The intention of the donor was that the donees should be in a position to act in the event of the donor's incapacity. Legal advice was obtained by the parties to the effect that the power was valid under section 8 of the 1882 Act.  Although there may be other similar cases, none has so far been reported.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform is of the view that any power of attorney given before the date on which the 1996 Act came into operation under the 1882 Act, otherwise than by way of security, should not be so affected by section 20 of the 1996 Act.  Accordingly, he has provided in section 5 that section 20 shall not invalidate powers of attorney given otherwise than by way of security under sections 8 and 9 of the 1882 Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 6 is to clarify the law in relation to the disclaimer of interest in cases of intestate succession.  The section is being included following submissions made to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform by the Incorporated Law Society and the Revenue Commissioners for clarification of the law in this area.</P>
    <P>The rules governing the distribution of an estate on intestacy are set out in Part VI of the Succession Act, 1965.  There is some doubt as to the position of the State, as ultimate intestate successor under section 73 of the Succession Act, 1965, when the next of kin of a person who dies intestate disclaims an interest in the deceased's estate.  Section 73 of the 1965 Act provides that, in default of next of kin, the estate of an intestate shall pass to the State as ultimate intestate successor.Section 6 makes clear that the disclaimed estate shall be distributed as if the person disclaiming had died immediately before the death of the intestate, and if that disclaimant is not the spouse of the intestate or a direct lineal ancestor of the intestate, it shall be distributed as if the disclaimant had died without leaving issue.  The effect of section 6, which in effect is a codification of existing practice, is that where there are any possible successors of the intestate, other than the disclaimant, they will take precedence over the State for the purposes of intestate succession.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that while the provisions will possibly affect only a small number of people, they are nonetheless important in their own right and for the people concerned.  The Minister is happy to respond, by way of this Bill, to the various submissions made to him on these issues.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill which is a technical measure to tie up the serious loose ends in relation to marriage licences and barring orders.  We have raised this matter on the <Col N="327" /> Order of Business on a number of occasions and, therefore, we will facilitate its passage through the House before the dissolution of this Dáil.</P>
      <P>I want to put a number of questions to the Minister of State by way of clarifying certain matters.My main concern relates to the marriages that took place between the passage of the Family Law Act, 1995 and now.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage on this but perhaps the Minister of State might clarify the matter in her reply.  The Bill, when enacted, will regularise the position but what about the marriages that are currently in limbo?  In her contribution, the Minister of State said: &ldquo;Neither does the Bill provide for the validation of marriages where parties failed to give notice in time or failed to give any notice&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify the position on that when replying.</P>
      <P>The current position is that marriages which did not meet the unnecessarily restrictive requirements of section 32 of the 1995 Act in relation to the district in which notice should be given for a marriage to be subsequently carried out are possibly null.  My amendment was intended to address this issue.  I raised the matter on the Order of Business.  Subsequently the Minister told me the form to be introduced was a matter for the Department of Health.  I have also received further letters from the Minister for Health, but he still has not cleared up the point I raised.</P>
      <P>The problem must be definitely resolved.  The couples involved deserve to be absolutely assured of the status of their marriage as this problem has potential ramifications far beyond the immediate and obvious ones.  If the validity of one of these marriages is successfully challenged in the future, perhaps far into the future, serious issues could arise.  It is important that we get this right once and for all.  Issues of succession, for example, for surviving partners and children arise, not to mention identity and status.  It is imperative that, we as legislators, can be absolutely sure that we have cleared out this Pandora's box.</P>
      <P>The other issue addressed in this Bill is that of barring orders for partners.  The provision here will make it easier for barring orders to be secured in relationships where the partners are not married and, Fianna Fáil welcomes this provision.</P>
      <P>The issue of violence against women is the subject of an important report about to be published by the Minister.  I have met several of the groups represented on the working party and, on the basis of what I have heard so far, I look forward to being able to support the thrust of the report. My party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, launched an important policy initiative at the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis last Friday.  He committed the next Fianna Fáil Government to enacting legislation providing for separate legal representation for victims in rape and sexual abuse cases.  I hope the Minister's forthcoming report will contain a similar commitment.  This is one of the most basic and important demands of women's organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="328" /> Regarding the point I raised in the Dáil on notification of the registrar of intention to marry, I still have difficulty with this on the basis that section 32(c) of the Family Law Act, 1995 makes it a substantive requirement of civil marriage in the State to register at least three months in advance of the date of marriage with the registrar of the local district where the ceremony is to take place.  That matter has been clarified by this Bill. However, the form provided by all local registrars is headed &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  Article 4 of the Constitution provided that in the English language the name of the State is &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, and in the Irish language &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.  To change the Constitution requires an amendment by the people.  By way of example let me put it to the House that if an extradition order were to be sought from Ireland to another jurisdiction and that request were to be made on a form headed &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; such request would be refused by the court.  As it is a substantive requirement that couples notify the registrar of their intention to marry, the notification paper causes a problem. Parties who furnish the application on the official form as it is now provided, will not have notified their request to the State &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  To accept the form as it is &mdash; and I will accept legal opinion in this area, but legal opinion may well be divided &mdash; is to deny the existence of the State &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; and replace that legal entity with an unrecognisable entity &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and it does not adhere to the substantive requirement of the Act. To rectify the situation we should delete the words &ldquo;Republic of&rdquo;.  If I am correct, there remains a complex issue which is the nub of my proposal, namely, that all notifications prior to the proposed amendment being made law are null and void, not having been properly notified to the State &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;, and these are in respect of couples who have married since the Act came into force on 1 August, 1996.  Having given such notice on the official form, it is open to legal opinion whether they are legally married, and cognisance of this will have to be included in amendments to regularise this dilemma.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform brought this matter up with the Minister for Health, and it is the Department of Health that is responsible for the notification of marriage form which refers to anybody intending to marry in the Republic of Ireland on or before 1 August 1996. The Minister for Health wrote me the following letter:</P>
    <P>You voiced your concerns regarding the wording of the form FLA 1.96 which may be used by couples to notify registrars of marriage of their intention to marry so as to comply with the requirements of section 32 of the Family Law Act, 1995 (Number 26 of 1995).  The provisions of section 2(1)(a)(i) of that Act require the persons concerned to notify the Registrar of Marriages (for the district concerned) in writing of their intention to so marry not less than 3 months prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised or to obtain an <Col N="329" /> exemption from this requirement from the Courts.</P>
    <P>I have had inquiries made with An t-Ard Chláraitheoir who is responsible for the administration for the procedures for the registration of marriages including notifications to registrars of intention to marry.  I understand that this form, which is not a statutory form, was one of a number of forms and documents produced to facilitate the introduction of the new marriage notification procedures which apply to marriages in the State.  I understand that the particular wording mentioned was noted after the form had been printed but that, as the form was purely for the convenience for couples rather than a statutory form and in order to avoid further delay it was circulated to the various information outlets.</P>
    <P>I maintain there is a problem there.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>I understand that a total redesign of the marriage information leaflet as well as the form in question, to incorporate additional information and clarify certain issues raised since its circulation is at an advanced stage.  The points you have raised in relation to the wording has I understand been taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues, and this I hope will satisfy married couples who have used the form:</P>
    <P>As persons notifying the registrar are not obliged to use the form and may if they choose write jointly or separately to the registrar giving the necessary information, the concerns you expressed as regards the validity of notifications and, by implication, marriages once solemnised would not appear to be justified.</P>
    <P>That still does not clarify the matter in this area. The Minister should look into the matter and clarify it once and for all.  It is a technical, legal matter about which I have some concern.  I would like to hear the Minister's response on it because it has been raised not alone by me but by senior legal colleagues whose concerns must be considered.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to engage in scaremongering, but we should get the legislation right.  If the document of notification to the registrar of intention to marry is not acceptable &mdash; the Minister said that another document is at an advanced stage &mdash; will the new document be headed &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;?  To prevent problems arising in five or ten years' time, this matter should be cleared up once and for all so that we can safely support the passage of the Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>We welcome the efforts made by the Minister. The Bill does not provide for validation of marriages where parties fail to give notice in time or fail to give any notice.  I put down an amendment to the effect that section 32 of the 1995 Act shall not apply to marriages solemnised between 1 August 1996 and 31 June 1997.  I recognise this matter was widely advertised, but if for some reason people did not give notification of their <Col N="330" /> marriage, they should be given further time, say, until 31 May 1997 to allow for retrospective registration.These matters should be clarified in the Bill.  I did not put down an amendment to omit &ldquo;Republic of&rdquo; because that is an issue that should be dealt with at another time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to oppose the Bill, which is mainly a tidying up of loose ends, and we wish it a speedy passage through the House.  The Bill provides for validation of marriages where notification was given in error to the registrar of marriages under section 32.  This whole issue is farcical and should not have occurred.  Registrars received the necessary training, advertisements were placed in newspapers and the whole process was open and easy to follow.It is farcical, therefore, that we now have to make provision to validate marriages people thought were valid.  I am glad the loose ends are being tidied up because we do not wish to leave people in what might be termed a state of 'unmarriage'.  One wonders what would have happened if any of those people had died.  What would be the legal position in those circumstances?I may sound a little facetious, but this is a very serious issue and I welcome the fact that it is being cleared up in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDaid that we need to get the legislation right this time.  This is not the only time doubt has been cast on marriages as a result of family law legislation.  Sometimes difficulties cannot be foreseen and in some circumstances warnings are not heeded.  With all due humility, perhaps the Minister's advisers will listen more carefully to the warnings of Deputies, particularly those with legal training &mdash; there are some eminent Members with expertise in family law and who are familiar with day to day cases. Deputy McDaid made interesting points on the document of notification of intention to marry.  It appears this is not now necessary.  Will it be sufficient to write to the registrar announcing one's intention to marry?  Questions such as that need to be clarified in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also technical issues involved relating to disclaimers, succession, powers of attorney and so on.  I wish to refer in particular to the issue of domestic violence.  I am glad the Bill deals with what was a gap in the legislation.  Rather than bring various issues of law together under a miscellaneous provisions Bill, I would much prefer to see domestic violence legislation amended because other matters need to be dealt with.  The loophole in this area caused a great deal of concern.The Minister said only a small number of people are affected by the Bill, and in regard to domestic violence in particular there may be a relatively small number of people affected, but it is important that we get the legislation right.  The domestic violence legislation is very good legislation.When dealing with that Bill we were at pains to introduce the best legislation possible.  It is important that we listen to the practitioners, those involved in women's refuges and women's <Col N="331" /> aid, and to women involved in domestic violence cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision dealing with barring orders.  While that provision addresses a shortcoming in the legislation, there are other gaps which could be addressed in amending legislation. The legislation on domestic violence must be monitored on a regular basis to ascertain its effecttiveness.As the gardaí play a major role in the implementation of that legislation, we should carry out an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of their policy on domestic violence.  The domestic violence and sexual assault unit of the Garda should publish accurate statistics on domestic violence.  Statistics show there were 3,986 cases in 1995, which ironically is only slightly more than those reported between May and December 1994.  We know that only 15 per cent of cases are reported.  How are Garda statistics compiled?  Are they an accurate representation of the true figures?  Women's Aid published figures on domestic violence in its publication Making the Links.  It is against those figures I am comparing the Garda statistics.  If this legislation is to be properly implemented, we need more information on the Garda statistics.</P>
    <P>The long delays in securing legal aid appointments and in having family law cases heard before the courts, particularly outside Dublin, must be addressed.  Those delays are crucial when women seek barring or safety orders.  Those working with victims of domestic violence maintain that sanctions for breaches of safety orders, in particular, are not sufficient.  They also maintain that women's lives are in danger during those delays and insist that sanctions imposed by the courts must be consistent.  This points to the necessity to train members of the Judiciary in the area of family law.  A total of 18 women were murdered in Ireland over a period of 12 months and 70 per cent of crimes against women are perpetrated by a person with whom they have had a relationship.  It is difficult for a women to secure a barring order if she does not own 50 per cent of the family home or if she has a child by a man with whom she does not live.  Therefore, we must constantly monitor this legislation to ensure all gaps are filled and attitudes must change.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about zero tolerance nowadays.The first time that term was used was when Women's Aid, who highlighted the appalling nature of violence against women, stated that no civilised society should tolerate such violence.  We cannot condone a society in which women are murdered, raped or attacked.  I am always pleased when I hear male politicians speak out against crimes against women.  They are excellent role models for changing attitudes towards women in our society.</P>
    <P>In making those points I am merely trying to ensure we introduce the most effective legislation.While I welcome the amendment to the domestic violence legislation I would prefer to deal with that type of legislation in isolation <Col N="332" /> rather than with a number of other matters. However, the Bill should receive a speedy passage through the House and I will support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for the constructive manner in which they approached the Bill.  Deputy McDaid referred to a form on which couples notify the registrar of their intention to marry which contains the heading &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  That form does not have a statutory function.  The Department of Health is in the process of replacing it with a form containing the correct constitutional terminology.  Couples who notified the registrar of their intention to marry on such a form will not face any legal difficulties.  The requirements of the Act merely state that couples must notify the registrar in writing, a specified form is not provided for.  Therefore, it does not matter if the couple's intention is written on a plain sheet of paper or on the form to which the Deputy referred.  We have received legal advice that marriages notified to the registrar on such forms are valid if the couple concerned gave sufficient notice.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDaid also referred to validating all marriages, irrespective of whether notice was given, as distinct from marriages where adequate notice was given but to the wrong registrar.  A three months' notice of intention to marry was agreed by the Oireachtas and forms part of an agreement dating back ten or 12 years.  The marriages of couples who gave such notice in good faith will be validated retrospectively.  If people were not in a position to give notice they can argue their case to get an exemption under section 33.  Notwithstanding that, if a couple proceeded to get married, they can validate their marriage in a registry office.</P>
      <P>Deputies McDaid and Keogh referred to violence against women and the loophole in the domestic violence legislation.  When introducing that legislation it was not intended that a barred partner would not count as cohabiting, but that is the way it has been interpreted by the courts.  That is why this is needed.  As the Deputies are aware, I chaired a Government task force on violence against women.  We have completed our work and a report should be published next week.  We have carefully considered the points raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh made a point about a couple who have a child.  The anti-stalking provision in the criminal justice Bill will substantially address that and the position is being kept under review in case loopholes arise.  The Deputies having dealt with my ministerial colleague, Deputy Taylor, will appreciate the constitutional problems concerning the 50 per cent ownership requirement.  I did not write the 1937 Constitution which appears to give sanctity to the role of private property, but there are constitutional barriers and this matter was pushed as far as it could be legitimately pushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keogh raised the point about delays in <Col N="333" /> receiving legal aid.  People who are seeking a barring order do not face any delays in receiving legal aid.  They are given immediate clearance and are not put on a waiting list for legal aid.  I am informed they are dealt with immediately by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>They were the main points of substance raised. I welcome the support for the Bill and I hope we can tidy up the position for people who, in good faith, followed what they perceived to be adequate procedures, but due to a technicality found their marriages were invalid.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Section 32 of the Act of 1995 shall not apply to marriages solemnised between the 1st day of August, 1996 and the 31st day of June, 1997.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to clarify a point made by the Minister of State.  Is it true that a number of people did not give notification of their intention to marry? The Minister said the remaining 41 cases are currently being examined to establish if the requirements of the Act have been met.  She also said the Bill does not provide for the validation of marriages where parties failed to give notice in time or failed to give any notice.  If they failed to give notice in time of their intention to marry, are their marriages valid?  Will the Minister of State indicate how many couples who believe they are married are not married?  There must be a number of people who fall into that category.  The amendment seeks to give those couples another chance to validate their marriages because, for one reason or another, they did not give proper notification.  Does the Minister of State know if there are a number of people who did not give notification who believe they are married but are not legally married?  What can be done for those people who did not give proper notification because they did not know about that requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather approximately 25 couples did not give notice of their intention to marry.  They would have been informed they had to give notice, but went ahead with, say, a Church ceremony knowing that they should have given adequate notice.  It is now open to those people to have a civil marriage ceremony and to give the registrar three months' notice of that ceremony. The Bill validates the marriages of people who <Col N="334" /> knew they had to give notice, but gave it to the wrong registrar.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's amendment would waive the three months' notification requirement for marriage, which is substantive and important as marriage is an important undertaking.  It was a commitment and the intention of all sides of the House that the three months' notification requirement would be binding.  If we lift that requirement in respect of marriages up until June this year, we are saying that requirement is trivial. The marriages of people who knew they should have given notice, who had been informed they had a right to go to court to seek an exemption and who would have got one if they had good grounds for seeking it but went ahead with a religious marriage ceremony will not be retrospectively validated.  Those people walked into the situation with their eyes open.</P>
      <P>My advice is that the marriages of the majority of people in the period in question are in order.  A total of 167 notifications were sent to the registrar general and it transpired that most of them were in order, but a number were sent to the wrong registrar and the marriages of those couples will be retrospectively validated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confused.  A couple who have a Church ceremony are not married in the eyes of the State unless they register their marriage. Surely all couples who registered their marriages had to ensure the correct notice was given and would not have proceeded with the ceremony unless the correct notice was given.  People can pledge their troth under a tree, but that is not recognised in the eyes of the State.  Are the marriages in question invalid through the fault of a registrar who said to a couple that even though they did not give the correct notice they could go ahead with the ceremony, or is it the fault of a clergyman or clergywoman who went ahead with the registration procedure even though he or she should not have done so having been told that three months' notification was required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the first two points made by the Minister of State and I do not have any problem concerning the area of registration. She also said that some people, for one reason or another, did not give notification.  In addition to the couples Deputy Keogh mentioned, there are also couples who, despite the television coverage and advertising campaign on this requirement, did not know they had to give notification.  The Minister of State said a number of couples fall under that category.  What will the Department do for those couples?  How many couples are involved?  Have they been told they can get an exemption at this stage, to reregister their marriage, or does this Bill cover them?  We need to tie up the loose ends.  I appreciate this is a legal matter, but this appears to be a grey area where people, for one reason or another, did not give notification of their intention to marry and at <Col N="335" /> some future date may find they are not legally married.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is not to seek to minimise the notification requirement.  While I fully agree notification must be given, my amendment gives people one last chance.  I do not know if the wording of the amendment is correct or if it should be worded differently.  I will accept any recommendations the Minister makes.  The amendment covers marriages, notification of which have not, for one reason or another, been given.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt properly with registration but there may be people who have not given notification who believe they are married and she mentioned 25 cases.  What is the position of the remaining 41 cases currently being examined to establish if the requirements of the Act have been met?  Has legal action been taken against the registrar general in relation to the operation of section 32?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>Legal action has been taken in one case.  The registration of marriages is a matter for the Department of Health, which runs the registration service, while legislation is a matter for the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  If somebody marries in a religious ceremony, whether that marriage is valid will only come to light when the celebrant registers the marriage with the registrar who must check if all the conditions have been met.  It is at that point an examination would take place as to whether the couple had given notice or if they had a valid exemption.  When the registrar checks the paperwork, the parties will be told the marriage is not valid and advised as to what to do or that the marriage is covered by this legislation and that it will be retrospectively put in order.  Nobody will be left in the dark as to their status.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that the Minister will produce a new form for notification.  Will the words &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; be changed to the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; on the new notification form, as I suggested?  The Republic of Ireland relates to the Republic of Ireland Act.  That is a territorial issue and does not apply to the legal entity of Ireland.  I have reservations about that.  The Republic of Ireland Act concerns territorial issues but this legislation deals with a legal matters.The term &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; is not correct in this context.  Will these forms include the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; as opposed to the words &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Does this mean something has clicked in the Department?  For the sake of those who will have problems in the future, would it not be better to ask people who have used this notification form to reregister?  If notification is a <Col N="336" /> substantive measure, despite the fact this is not a statutory matter with which I have problem, I would be afraid that in the future legal eagles will use this issue when dealing with marriages which will run into difficulties.  This begs the question, will it be possible to further amend section 32? The Minister's speech did not deal with the problem I have highlighted.  I am not trying to be difficult but to ensure this matter is ironed out once and for all.  This is a legal document and, therefore, must contain the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;.  This is a grey area.  Will we be able to further amend section 32 because it may be another six months before we deal with this issue again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained, it does not matter if people write on blue or pink paper or on the form once they give notice of their names and the date of the intended marriage and send it to the registrar.  Whether or not the form contains other writing does not affect its validity.  I am grateful to Deputy McDaid for raising the point about the Republic of Ireland.  He is correct in that the name of the State in the Constitution is Ireland.  The form is being reprinted to state &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; rather than the &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo;. However, it does not matter if a person uses a form or a piece of paper they find on the floor to notify the registrar, their marriages are valid.</P>
      <P>We also checked out a number of points raised by Deputy Shatter with the Attorney General's office.  We are satisfied the points he raised do not require amendments, that the legislation is in order and that marriages to which he referred are valid.  The marriages which are not valid are those where couples did not give notice or give adequate notice.  This Bill addresses cases where the notice was sent to the wrong registrar or where a person may have received their exemption from the wrong court.  The marriages of those two groups are being retrospectively validated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour this issue unduly.  I accept the point in relation to jurisdiction.The Minister is saying that some clergymen or women went ahead, despite the information they were given and requests made to them, and performed marriage ceremonies giving people the impression the ceremony was valid in the eyes of the State as well as the church.  Is that not the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if those clergymen or women gave the impression that it was anything other than a religious ceremony or if it was a religious and a civil ceremony.  The substantive requirement is that three months' notice be given.  It is not good policy to introduce a measure and then not implement it until June.  We are dealing with cases where people made an attempt to meet the substantive requirement and missed it for technical reasons.  Such cases are being retrospectively validated.  The marriages of those who did not meet the substantive criterion of the <Col N="337" /> three months' notice are not being retrospectively validated.  Those people will be informed that what they went through was a religious ceremony, whether under a tree or otherwise, and not a civil ceremony and that they will need to go through a civil ceremony.  It will be open to them to go to the courts to seek an exemption.  I am sure the courts will deal with them sympathetically.</P>

      <P>Notifications of intention to marry have been received in respect of 17,500 marriages.  As the Minister pointed out, notification may be given on any form of paper, jointly or separately.  I doubt if any of the 17,500 notifications were given on any but this specific form. I doubt if anyone wrote on a piece of paper that they were getting married and I presume everyone who used the notification process used this specific form.  If they did not, how did they know what questions to answer?  Anyone can give notice they are getting married by writing it on a piece of paper.  If they did it this way, how would they know the questions on the form which requires certain details?  The notification form is the main method of giving notice and I am sure none concerned has given notice in any other manner.  While I accept the Minister's point and do not wish to be contentious, I raise the issue to highlight what I see as grey areas which may still cause problems and which I presume will be a matter of legal argument.</P>

      <P>I have no comment on that. Last night I began my contribution on the national lottery by thanking the Progressive Democrats for raising the issue.  We all accept the lottery has been a success which has aroused the interest of a large percentage of people.  The manner in which lottery funds are distributed raises a similar amount of interest.  As with any institution, it is realistic to review the lottery ten or eleven years after its inception.  The issue of targeting lottery funding and its value to entire communities has been an interest of mine.  Over the <Col N="340" /> past year I have talked to many people from diverse backgrounds and interests.</P>
      <P>Before becoming a Member of this House I was a teacher in a large secondary school in the Creggan in Derry.  Within that school there was a huge investment in music resources; both in instruments and peripatetic and class-based teachers.  This resulted in children having in-school and after school activities whether in a choir, a band, an ensemble, individual lessons or events.  The pupils participated in feiseanna, musicals and other cultural events both within and outside the school.  These events were often linked to charities and benefited the local community by collecting money for valuable services.</P>
      <P>As a result of these activities, the children learnt a sense of discipline, the value of working together and pride in their own grouping and background.  Everyone benefited from this investment.The students were happier and happy students make for happy teachers.  The school had a good self-image and the community had a positive resource within its boundaries.  In the context of lottery funding, the importance of music must be taken on board even more than it is at present.</P>
      <P>Single allocations for large events are only one aspect of lottery fund distribution.  Schools such as the one I spoke of receive grants of tens of thousands of pounds for the purchase of instruments.According to a parliamentary question I tabled last year, three schools in County Donegal benefited from our type of grant for school orchestras and bands.  However, they only received £90 between them.  Our investment in these activities is incomparable.</P>
      <P>Much of what I am speaking of could be considered the responsibility of the Department of Education.  I have not touched on the educational value of music to the development of children. My argument rests on the societal benefits of such investment.  Therefore, while the reduction may seem slight, 0.2 per cent, I am disappointed to see that the lottery's arts, cultural and heritage estimate spending in 1997 is down from 26 per cent to 25.8 per cent.  This is not going in the right direction.</P>
      <P>In areas distant from large urban centres, such as the north west, there is a feeling that people are forgotten.  Whether perceived or real, it is felt that too many initiatives are not applied north of the line between Dublin and Galway.  The Department of Tourism and Trade's Celtic Flame initiative would suggest this is correct.  Some people seem to think Galway is next door to Donegal.  Dublin is almost as far away as Galway for many people in the north-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have debated and passed legislation throughout the year on issues such as crime, drugs and children.  Very bleak pictures were painted during those debates.  Recreational facilities could combat much of the boredom which lies at the root of problems.  Many speakers spoke of the need to better target resources at recreation.  Last year 33 per cent of lottery funds were allocated to youth, sport, recreation and <Col N="341" /> amenities.  This year an estimated 32.2 per cent will be spent on these facilities.  The reduction is small in percentage terms but it is a sizeable amount of money.</P>
    <P>If a community group is unsuccessful in seeking lottery assistance in providing sporting facilities there are no alternative funding bodies.  European funds exclude anything involving bricks and mortar.  The national lottery is the only source of funding for many community groups.  Small groups rely on this assistance to ensure that their young people have somewhere to go and something constructive to do with their time.</P>
    <P>The ideals of voluntary workers deserve support.Investment at the early stages would have cost-saving repercussions in later life.  There needs to be continued support which targets as many children as possible.  The downward trend in estimated expenditure on music and sport must be reversed.</P>
    <P>There needs to be a review of the lottery's objectives.  Measures prescribed ten years ago do not necessarily reflect today's needs.  Music and recreational activities are very productive activities for children.  They teach children how to work together in teams and how to listen to each other and get on.  If they do not get on, at least they learn to handle their emotions.  These activities take children off the streets.</P>
    <P>When one considers the money spent on young people involved in crime and on prison spaces, it is more prudent to invest money in preventative measures.  There is much good work being done which I hope will be recognised, leading to a revision of the capping provisions.  Whenever people are engaging in any positive activity for the benefit of the community, they should be helped rather than hindered.</P>
    <P>I am glad the national lottery has been such a success and I congratulate those who support it. When it comes to the targeting of its funds they should be allocated where most needed, benefiting as many as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring:</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with Deputy Keaveney's kind comments in relation to your retirement, a Cheann Comhairle, and wish you well.  I always remember the first occasion on which I walked down these steps and met you.  I will not remind the House of what you said to me on that occasion but I hope your remarks were correct, that I would be a Member of this House for many a long day.  No doubt the House will experience great difficulty in appointing a successor, following a person of such considerable panache and ability and fairness in rulings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the tabling of this motion by members of the Progressive Democrats. <Col N="342" /> I cannot understand Members from any side of the House wanting to divest politicians of their powers.  As somebody who progressed through the political system &mdash; by way of the urban council, county council to being a Member of this House &mdash; I cannot understand their objective.One only has to consider the manner in which the National Roads Authority distributes funds.  It is answerable to nobody and frequently does not respond to correspondence.  One cannot make strong representations to them on behalf of constituents.  The same is true of IDA-Ireland and other semi-State boards which are no longer accountable to politicians.</P>
    <P>We must remember that people elect us to this Parliament to represent them.  That is its <i>raison d'être</i>.  If they are not satisfied with us an interview board can be convened at any time, as it will be in the near future, when the electorate will decide who they want to run the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Progressive Democrats have tabled this motion and are being supported by the Fianna Fáil Party to prevent politicians from allocating national lottery funds &mdash; an objective I could never support &mdash; particularly when successive Governments and parties in Opposition have informed local authorities they will give power back to the people.  The proposal in this motion is quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>A young group in my constituency called Caoibh Rua applied for funding to the cultural relations section of the Department of Foreign Affairs in three consecutive years but received none.  It took me many weeks to obtain the relevant report to ascertain where that funding had been allocated.  I can positively inform the House that much of it never reached the west, just as in the case of the National Roads Authority and IDA-Ireland in the case of job creation.  If we in the west are to be dependent on those in Dublin to take decisions on our behalf, it is indeed a sad day.  I have been elected to fight for them and it is the responsibility of those in Government, to stand over any decisions taken.</P>
    <P>There always will be people who will never agree with any decision, such as those in sporting organisations or swimming clubs who will claim they deserve more funding than anyone else.  At the end of the day, politicians do take correct decisions, being familiar with circumstances on the ground.  I attend clinics every weekend and listen to my constituents.  I know what is taking place within my community and those local organisations in need of support.  I am proud that last year I was able to assist the Sacred Heart School in Westport to the tune of £50,000.  I listened to Deputy Keaveney quite rightly talk about schools.  Those funds would not have been allocated to that school had we been dependent on somebody in an office in Dublin 4, but I fought for it and explained to the Minister what the people in that school were doing.  In many other places such as Louisburgh voluntary groups are fighting hard to maintain people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I can never understand why any politician <Col N="343" /> would want to divest us of our powers.  I do not consider this or any future Government should engage in that practice.  I am sick and tired of tabling parliamentary questions, only to have the Ceann Comhairle inform me they are out of order or are not the responsibility of the Minister to whom they are addressed.  They should be the responsibility of the Minister, who should be accountable and responsible to this House, not to those in Dublin 4 or others who are answerable to nobody.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to have my name placed on the ballot paper in the forthcoming general election when the people will decide whether they want to re-elect me.  They will take the correct decision.  I cannot understand the Fianna Fáil Party supporting this motion, particularly when their rural representatives tell the electorate they will give power back to local authorities, whereas the objective of this motion is to take power from elected representatives.  I could understand and support it if its objective were to divest Ministers of those powers and vest them in local authorities but I cannot support the establishment of a review group, no doubt to be comprised of big business people or others from the east coast, when we know well where funding will go.  It annoys me to observe such occurrences.</P>
    <P>While not a Member of this House when the national lottery was established, I remember reading Deputy Creed's contention that it would never work whereas it has proved to the most successful operation.  I agree with Deputy Keaveney in that I would never wish to control any voluntary organisation or have any capped.  I believe in fair play and free competition and, if Rehab and others want to compete, they should be enabled do so on the same basis as the national lottery, offering the same prize money and leaving the best to win.</P>
    <P>I have a major problem in any effort to take powers away from elected representatives.  I appeal to the Progressive Democrats to withdraw this motion and to the Fianna Fáil Party to vote with the Government on its amendment.  They should think of all the good voluntary groups throughout rural areas that have obtained funding from the national lottery, whose very existence affords Members an opportunity to fight on behalf of their constituents and ensure fair play. If we must approach faceless people in Dublin 4, answerable to nobody, as happened in the case of other organisations who acted like little generals when they received some power, no doubt we will meet the same response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to join in the well deserved good wishes and tributes paid to you, a Cheann Comhairle, by other Members.  By any standard yours has been a remarkable career.  On a personal note, I always considered you to be at your best on big occasions, particularly on the occasion of President Clinton's visit here when you performed magnificently, with a most appropriate <Col N="344" /> speech, which again was remarkable and compared favourably with the best expected of any Parliament.</P>
      <P>In relation to the contribution by my colleague, Deputy Ring, about Dublin 4, I accept Dublin 4 is, to a large extent, a state of mind.  I do not represent Dublin 4 but its neighbouring areas Dublin 6, 8 and 12 which has are many areas which would be appropriate for lottery funding.  To the extent that one can analyse these matters on a <i>per capita</i> basis the Dublin area does not do well in respect of the disbursement of lottery funding.  This is something that may be forgotten in these debates.</P>
      <P>There is relatively little difference between the substance of the Government amendment and the motion proposed by the Progressive Democrats.It contains a certain amount of overlap and some of the language used is the type we associate with the Progressive Democrats in Opposition.When in Government, as with many of us, a different type of wording is used.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats want a review of the procedure for disbursing lottery funding.  The Government has established a body to undertake a review of the allocation of lottery funding. There is not much of a difference.  The proposed review deals with transparency, a concern expressed by the Progressive Democrats.  There is no doubt the lottery has been an outstanding success, to date it has generated of the order of £700 million which has been used to fund worthwhile projects in youth, welfare, heritage, amenities and so on.  The rate at which lottery funding is generated is of the order of £100 million per year.  That is not a huge amount in terms of the total budget but it is a significant amount and undoubtedly helps to greatly enhance the quality of life for many people.</P>
      <P>Despite its success in generating huge sums of money in the past ten years, the lottery is by no means perfect.  It is time a critical review of its workings was carried out.  By any standards, the £700 million which has been disbursed to date is a significant sum.  It is time we considered the question of carrying out a value for money audit on how that money was spent, whether it might have been better spent and the lessons for the future arising from the experiences of the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said &mdash; and Deputy Ring alluded to it &mdash; about the lottery being used as a slush fund for political purposes.  I do not want to amplify that view of the lottery or that view of politicians.  However, some of the behaviour associated with the disbursement of lottery funds in 1992 in my constituency left much to be desired.  At that time there was what might loosely be termed &ldquo;instant lottery disbursement&rdquo;. People were somewhat bewildered on receipt of the lottery cheques.  They did not really know what had happened.  Having attended a meeting and made application on the back of an envelope, lo and behold a few days later the cheques, some of which were made out to organisations that did not exist, were available.  This is an understandable <Col N="345" /> type of error when people are overcome by the nitty gritty of the detail of a retirement association or a youth club.  While the procedures followed at that time left a great deal to be desired, the end use to which the money was put was worthwhile.  The organisations and the people supported were worthwhile.  They made a contribution to the community prior to that and they continued to make a contribution to the community in my constituency.  Some of the money disbursed at that time went towards building community halls which have been a great help, even if the manner in which the money was disbursed was unorthodox.</P>
    <P>At a political level sometimes people under-estimate the wisdom and the cop-on of the average person.  The manner in which the money was disbursed made much political difference.  At that time, some of my supporters showed me the cheques for which they were grateful and assured me of their No. 1 vote.  There are limits to what that type of activity does in terms of political advantage.  We should all be a little more restrained in how we do the business.</P>
    <P>I differ from Deputy Ring inasmuch as I see a good deal of merit in establishing an independent agency to disburse lottery funding.  The Government should lay down standards and the money should be disbursed by an agency in accordance with those standards.  It is important that proper procedures be established for the disbursement of funding.  Clear guidelines should be laid down and a proper procedure established on how applications are to be made for lottery funding.  Prior to the events of 1992 and the subsequent hearings at the Committee of Public Accounts there was no formal mechanism by which to make lottery funding applications.  One simply made it up as one went along on a sheet of paper or on the back of an envelope.  Subsequent to the hearings at the Committee of Public Accounts the procedure was changed and that was a step in the right direction. The procedures for a review on how the money was spent could be enhanced.  Certainly procedures have improved arising from those events.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to regional disparities between disbursement of lottery funding on a <i>per capita</i> basis.  On the assumption that people contribute much the same amounts of money on a <i>per capita</i> basis, in other words that people from counties Donegal or Kerry play the lottery to the same extent as people in Dublin, it is hard to understand or justify the fairly considerable differences which exist on a per head of population regarding the outcome of lottery funds.  Some areas do five or six times better than others. While I realise I am taking the maximum and the minimum in those matters it is important to look again at that aspect of the process.</P>
    <P>The lottery generates and promotes a culture that there is an easy solution to almost every problem.  Many people seem to believe their difficulties can be resolved by winning the lottery. The chances of winning the lottery are so infinitesimal I cannot understand why anybody who is <Col N="346" /> serious about betting could indulge in buying lottery tickets.  One has about the same chance of winning as the roof falling in.</P>

      <P>The paradoxical aspect of the lottery is the bigger the jackpot the smaller one's chances of winning unless one buys a large quantities of tickets.  The bigger the jackpot the more people gamble.  There is an element of this which may be worth exploring.  Something which concerns me is the hype associated with the promotion of lottery funds, it is unbalanced.  There is another side to all this.  Most people who gamble in the lottery do not have a hope of winning.  That side of the case is never put.  It might not be out of place if some of the public service agencies in broadcasting were to state that side of the case. When the stakes increase there is huge hype to promote the jackpot and to suggest people should invest in the lottery.  The only people discussed after the big event are the winners.  They are a minority to which many of us aspire.  However, something should be said on behalf of the people who spend millions of pounds and get nothing. I am not saying one should not be interested in winners, but a case can be made for discussing the other side of the equation.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed by many people about the manner in which lottery funds have been substituted for Exchequer spending.  I accept their point, but I wish they would take the argument further and explain how they would replace the moneys in the Exchequer if lottery funds were not used.  Perhaps they would outline the cutbacks they would propose to make up the deficit.  In these matters, people cannot have it every way.</P>

      <P>The most telling comment this morning about the Ceann Comhairle's position was the Ceann Comhairle's own remark that, despite all that had been said, there would still be Members who would be happy to see the back of him.  That proved that despite the Ceann Comhairle's air of elevation and of being not quite of this world, he is a realist about politics.  That is why he has survived so well.  I have been a Member of the House for almost three years, which contrasts with the Ceann Comhairle's long service, and the Ceann Comhairle has always been most courteous, kind and helpful.  At a time when politicians thought little of themselves, the Ceann Comhairle thought more of us and always portrayed that.  I hope the Ceann Comhairle and his <Col N="347" /> wife have an extremely happy retirement and that he will not be too busy and will have time to relax.</P>
      <P>When the idea of a national lottery was first mooted, nobody envisaged its eventual success.  It was estimated at its launch that it might raise about £12 million over ten years.  However, since 1986 the national lottery has raised £700 million for worthy causes.  Everybody has a gripe from time to time about the lottery.  People are often disappointed when their project does not get approval for funding or does not get as much funding as expected while a nearby project does. It is natural for them to assume that if they had had better connections with the local politician or Minister they would have received more. However, in the past 20 years almost every political party has participated in Government and, since almost everybody in Ireland is connected with an individual politician or party, the spread of lottery funding must have been equal.  While there should be more openness and transparency in the disbursement of lottery funding, a politician cannot honestly call for its distribution to be taken out of the hands of politicians when each party has enjoyed its share of the distribution.That might not be right, but it happened.</P>
      <P>The lottery has become a national institution.  I smiled when Deputy Upton asked if anybody spoke for the losers.  We all speak for the losers every day of the week.  We have not yet hit the magic jackpot so we can speak for them. However, for a politician to say that everybody loves a winner is a huge understatement.  Of course they do, and nobody knows that better than a politician.</P>
      <P>Certain aspects of the lottery should be urgently reviewed.  Different regulations should be put in place to ensure certain practices do not continue.  I have spoken about this matter on many occasions and have always expressed concern about the lack of a ceiling on the advertising budget.  When one considers some of the gimmicks the national lottery have launched, particularly in the past year, most people would agree there should be restraint on what the advertising budget can be used for and how much money should be allocated to it.  At present, there is no cap on the budget and the amount of money spent on projects such as the millenium clock is sinful.  Everybody was amazed by that project. They knew even if it worked it would not be a great attraction.  In addition, what benefit would it be to people or to the national lottery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the sum of £140,000 which was spent to advertise the visit of the aircraft carrier, the <i>JFK,</i> was not as great, it was equally sinful if not immoral.  Why was the national lottery promoting the &ldquo;greatest killing machine in the world&rdquo;, as it was described in advertisements?  Nobody could get an answer to inquiries about its involvement in this visit and how much it spent on it.  Only in the annual report did we get a breakdown of how much was spent but the reason for the venture <Col N="348" /> was never explained.  That is disgraceful and such ventures should stop forthwith.  Gimmicks such as the two I have mentioned are only for the sake of spending money.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the national lottery which concerns me and on which I have spoken several times, is the use of unclaimed prize money.  It is estimated that it amounts to approximately £4 million each year.  What happens to that money? It is given out in special jackpots on occasions such as Easter, Christmas and St. Patrick's Day. The jackpots on those occasions are usually large anyway.  I do not seek to limit jackpots to £1 million or £1.5 million.  If somebody is lucky enough to win £3 million I wish him luck and hope he enjoys the money.  However, the unclaimed prize money should be put into a special fund and my preference for its use would be to provide services for the mentally handicapped.  I doubt that anybody in Ireland would object to the moneys being diverted for that purpose.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Members, particularly those expressed this morning, on the Ceann Comhairle's announcement of his retirement on the dissolution of the Dáil.  I also agree with the pride expressed by the Ceann Comhairle's constituency colleagues in South Tipperary.  As a Deputy representing the south-east, I believe we all shared in the pride and credit the Ceann Comhairle brought to the region and not just to his native town and constituency.  Following my election to the House for the first time in 1987 I always found you fair and helpful &mdash; the hallmark of excellence &mdash; in spite of my inclination at times to get excited on the Order of Business.  You carried out your duties as Ceann Comhairle to the highest possible standards.  There is a great sense of loss that you will not be with us in the next Dáil.  I wish you a long, healthy and enjoyable retirement with your wife, immediate family and friends.  Many of us could not aspire to match your contribution to public life.  It will be difficult to match your achievements over many years of public service at local, national and international level in which your family has every right to take great pride.  I wish you well.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak about the national lottery of which I am a supporter.  It is a worthwhile venture which has done enormous good in communities throughout the country. Nothing is perfect at its inception.  Now that the national lottery has been in operation for ten years there is nothing wrong with reviewing its operations, both internal and external, to assess its effectiveness in the allocation of funding under the headings of sport, the national heritage, health and welfare and to see if its achievements to date can be built upon.  Nothing is so successful that it cannot be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, I have no difficulty with the sentiments expressed in the motion but I take great issue with paragraph (c) to which I will return.  To understand what the national lottery is all about, <Col N="349" /> one needs to look at what is happening in various communities throughout the country.  We are best qualified to speak about what is happening in our own areas.  There is no doubt that in the allocation of national lottery moneys communities throughout Waterford city and county have been galvanised and given a great sense of purpose in maintaining the structures that hold them together.  We should not lose sight of the fact that it would be difficult to find these moneys in various departmental Estimates.</P>
    <P>When I look at national lottery allocations, on occasion I feel aggrieved that other parts of the country receive a disproportionate amount. While communities throughout Waterford city and county have benefited, funding should be allocated on an equitable basis.  If that is the central thrust of the motion, it is something I can fully support.</P>
    <P>There is a constant drift from rural communities towards urban areas.  The loss of the local post office or Garda station compounds the difficulties experienced in maintaining the fabric of rural Ireland.  We, therefore, have to find other ways of ensuring rural communities continue to grow.  There is a need to provide structures to retain young people in particular.  To this end, national lottery moneys have played a substantial role as seed capital.  The real benefit is that members of rural communities have been galvanised to raise funding locally to provide facilities which everyone can share.  This gives them a sense of purpose, pride and achievement.</P>
    <P>When the national lottery was first established it was suggested there should be regional centres to ensure equality of access to sports facilities.  I subscribed to this view.  While there was an initial rush of blood to provide such centres, they have not been developed to the level required.  We have lost focus in recent years.  This is understandable as it is difficult to refuse requests for funding for worthy projects.  Ten years on, however, we should be able to see facilities throughout the country to which as many sporting disciplines as possible have access.  It is not feasible to provide large structures in every town and village.  That would be the wrong approach.</P>
    <P>What Waterford Corporation has achieved in recent years is remarkable, given the lack of Government and national lottery funding.  If adequate funding was provided for the Waterford regional sports centre, the structure in place could be developed to the point where international events could be attracted to the area.  Every event does not have to take place in the capital.  This is an issue about which everyone outside Dublin feels strongly.  Regional centres, if properly funded, have the capacity to inject new life to the regions concerned.  This would make an enormous difference.  There would be a knock-on effect in the tourism industry in that many visitors would be likely to return.</P>
    <P>We will be seeking substantial funding to enhance the footballing structures with the county.  In this connection, I hope Waterford <Col N="350" /> Football Club will be returning to the premier division.  The athletics facilities need to be further developed, while additional facilities must be provided to cater for the very large crowds attending events in the area on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I regret the Government did not avail of the opportunity provided by our buoyant economy to pull back the national lottery funding made available to the health and welfare areas.  This funding was rightly allocated to these areas at a time when our economic position was very different. However, Departments should now be able to meet the requirements of these areas from their budgets.  Investment in sports, recreational amenities, the arts and cultural activities has many beneficial effects for communities For example, if young people, particularly those in disadvantaged areas, can be encouraged to get involved in sport they are less likely to get involved in crime or to take drugs, which are a major curse on society.  The provision of adequate sporting and other facilities has huge benefits in terms of health and welfare and I am sure Deputies will agree national lottery funding should be allocated for the purposes originally intended.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with paragraph (c) of the motion.  The standing of politicians in the community is low and the blame for much of this lies with this House.  However, it is not good enough to say to the public that we will bridge this credibility gap by setting up independent bodies and <i>ad hoc</i> committees to do our work for us.  If politicians want to regain the status they once held they must do this work themselves.  I am not saying there is no need for more openness and transparency in how funding is distributed &mdash; there is &mdash; but I will not be answerable to my constituents when a person on a committee or independent body which decides how Exchequer funding should be spent is not answerable to anybody.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired of political correctness which originated in America and was taken up here with no major benefits.  I accept some matters needed to be sorted out and tidied up and new directions needed to be found but it is a grave error to look to bodies outside this House, our most democratic forum to decide the distribution of national lottery funding.  This is a step in the wrong direction.  We have seen the effects of this at local level where local government was diminished almost beyond recognition.  I support many of the proposals put forward by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, on restructuring local government.  We had given so much power to <i>ad hoc</i> committees that no one was answerable to anyone for the spending of local government funding.  We must not go down a similar road at national level.  We have the capacity to stand over the decisions made and we must demonstrate this.  I accept there is a bias from time to time in the distribution of funding by Ministers.  However, this can be overcome by adopting a more transparent, structured and focused approach in terms of what we want to <Col N="351" /> achieve with national lottery funding.  The sentiments of the motion are fine but the proposal in paragraph (c) can be dealt with in another way.  I do not support the policy of going down the road of looking to independent bodies to solve problems.I hope the National Lottery Review Group will outline new ways forward, new areas on which to focus, new structures and projects which should be developed.</P>
    <P>There has been much reference to the millennium clock for which there are many euphemisms and which has been removed from the river Liffey.National lottery funding could be used to celebrate the millennium.  There are five county-city boroughs and it should be possible to have a project in each city which is linked &mdash; for example, a type of tourist trail &mdash; and which will attract tourists.I do not have a specific project in mind but Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford cities and counties have a role to play.  It was proposed to establish a five continents project where each continent would have a similar project to celebrate the millennium.  Waterford was chosen to represent Europe in this project.  This was an international honour for Ireland and a huge honour for my city and county.  I hope the necessary funding will be made available for such a project. It would be great to see Waterford representing Ireland and Europe at the dawn of the new era.</P>
    <P>Charitable lotteries have a role to play in the community.  However, they have been treated unfairly in recent years, for example, the cap on the prize money they could offer.  These charities must be given an equal opportunity to raise funds through their lotteries.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has achieved much but it can achieve more.  In a democracy the ultimate responsibility for this matter rests with the Dáil. If we want to have credibility we must accept this responsibility, get on with the job, ensure that the funding is allocated in a more open and transparent way and be responsible for our actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Keogh.  It is time after 11 years in operation for some fundamental changes to be made to certain aspects of the national lottery.  There seems to be a general acceptance that the national lottery is a great success because it brings in very large sums of money.  However, that is not the only criterion by which it should be judged. One of the consequences of its success is that it has all but destroyed charitable lotteries and has made it very difficult for people to raise money by way of a lottery or raffle for genuine charitable causes.  There is a limited amount of money in the pockets of the public which can be spent on lotteries or gambling in the widest sense of that word.  Because of the huge prizes it gives &mdash; some prizes are unnecessarily and unconscionably big &mdash; the vast bulk of this optional spending tends to go to the national lottery.  When one considers the way this money is used, I am not sure this is necessarily the best option.  I would like to see a <Col N="352" /> fairer proportion of this money going to genuine charities.</P>
      <P>At a time when the Government promotes and helps the national lottery it refuses to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, and thereby refuses to give genuine charitable organisations an opportunity to compete even in the smallest way. That is wrong.</P>
      <P>The odds involved in the national lottery, which unfortunately many people do not examine, are so large as to be meaningless. If the people who studied it were genuinely interested in trying to get some return on their stake, they would bet on lottery numbers in bookmakers' offices where their prospects are considerably better.  The national lottery odds are so great as to make the chances of success extraordinarily remote.  That is borne out by the fact that it is frequently not won for several weeks at a time.  The national lottery organisers are delighted when that happens.  They would like it to be won perhaps once in every two or three months because they could then hold up the prospect of a vast divided of many millions of pounds, which appeals to the basest instincts in people.  That is unfortunate because there are different ways of approaching it.</P>
      <P>When I say I am interested in the welfare of genuine charities, I bear in mind in particular the fact that the disbursement of lottery funds is one of its great weaknesses.  Section 5 of the 1986 Act, which allows discretion to the Government to expend it for such other purposes as the Government sees fit, is wrong because it has been abused.  In spite of the assurances given to this House at the time the legislation was passed, it is used as a substitute for Exchequer spending that would otherwise have to take place.  I regret that. We were led to believe at the time the Bill was being promoted that the vast bulk of the profits would be expended on sport and other socially beneficial activities.  That has not happened.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen believes politicians should continue to be allowed to disburse these funds.  I would agree with him if I were confident it would be done on a proper basis, but it is not.  In my constituency of Limerick East, which is by far the larger constituency of the two in Limerick, no national lottery money was disbursed for a period of two years.  All the money was spent in the smaller constituency of Limerick West because it had two Ministers at the time, whereas Limerick East had none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, from what I can see, it changed between east and west, but the leopard does not change its spots.  We still have a situation, as Deputy Keogh outlined last night, where the ear of the Minister and the Minister's perception of what might be done is more important than the genuine needs of organisations <Col N="353" /> in a particular area.  What went on in Limerick West at that time was disgraceful.  In 1989, the Progressive Democrats in Government sought to have that stopped and we were partly successful.  We insisted on some amounts being given to health boards, for example.  More money should be given to local authorities to enable them to disburse funds.</P>
      <P>One of the weaknesses of the national lottery, among others, is that there is no proper accountability for the disbursement of funds.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not have any audit functions in regard to disbursement except by accident where the disbursement is through the Vote of a particular Department.  If it appears as part of the Vote, he audits it.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, the Comptroller and Auditor General brought to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts activities in the Department of Health by the then Minister for Health, former Deputy John O'Connell, who disbursed large amounts of money in his constituency and apparently not too frequently outside his constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those activities came to the attention of the Comptroller and Auditor General because he could not find documentation to support these disbursements &mdash; applications did not appear to have been made.  The sums of money were disbursed in different premises late at night and requests were made to the beneficiaries, often by telephone, by the Department of Health some days later asking them to make an application to the Department for lottery funds they had already received.  It was documented in the Department that some of the applications were made five days after the cheques were cashed.  That is not transparent.  It is not disbursing lottery funds in accordance with set and proper criteria.  I make no apology for saying that method of disbursement is wrong and statutory provisions should be put in place to prevent it.</P>
      <P>The time has come to amend the 1986 Act.  It has been in force for 11 years.  We now have a great deal of experience of the way the lottery and its disbursement of surplus operates, and the House is now in a position to make a judgement. It is interesting to read some of the contributions made at the time the legislation was passed.  In fairness, several Members foresaw the kind of abuses that subsequently transpired, and they warned against them.  Unfortunately, they were not listened to at the time.  They were right and this is an appropriate time to amend that legislation.The amendment would be facilitated if the House passes this motion, which I urge it to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle.  The national lottery has made a major contribution in recent years to the funding of many areas such as <Col N="354" /> arts, culture, youth, welfare, sport and recreation throughout the country, including my own constituency.Many good causes have been funded that might never have been supported if it had not been for the national lottery.</P>
      <P>The figures speak for themselves.  Approximately £700 million has been made available over the past ten years for projects under the National Lotteries Act, 1986, benefiting many communities and voluntary organisations throughout the country.Sales have increased from £102 million in 1987, the first year of operation, to almost £308 million in 1996.  In 1996, £100 million was available for disbursement to the beneficiary fund. Though spending on lottery projects is beginning to even out &mdash; the sharp rise in the early years could not continue &mdash; the annual sum available for disbursement will continue to be very significant.The fact that the lottery has been so successful, with revenues greatly in excess of expectations, has allowed a broader allocation of funding than had been envisaged at the outset. Sport was particularly in mind when the lottery was set up, and I share Deputy Cullen's view that it is important.  I hope that, when the <i>Tour de France</i> comes through Carrick-on-Suir in south Tipperary next year, funding will be available to ensure the success of the race and that the regions of the country visited by the tour will be a showcase for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Act provides in particular for the use of lottery proceeds for sports and recreation, for national culture, for the arts and for health.  When lottery sales greatly exceeded original expectations the categories of youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities were added.  While lottery sales have exceeded original expectations, the range of recipients of lottery funding has also greatly expanded.  Needless to say, the demand for lottery funding is always considerably greater than the resources available, and it is only natural that organisations should apply for funds and that they are greatly disappointed when funds are not available, but all applications cannot be successful.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that in terms of transparency and accountability an independent board would be preferable to the present arrangement whereby the Government decides on lottery allocations as part of the Estimates process.  However, experience abroad has shown that this route offers no simple solution to this problem.  It is vital that everybody should have confidence in the procedure for allocating lottery funds.  The lottery Act contains provision to protect not alone the public put the people who play lotto.  The details of lottery allocations to organisations are always available, and they are contained in the annual Estimates and Appropriation Accounts.  Ministers are fully accountable in the Dáil for lottery spending as administered by their Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to further ensure maximum transparency in the allocation of funds, because some of Deputy O'Malley's accusations are quite true, the Government decided to examine the process <Col N="355" /> by which it would distribute national lottery surpluses.It has, in consultation with various voluntary agencies, set up the review group, and those of us who are serious about ensuring accountability should await the report of this committee which is an important committee chaired by a person of the highest calibre, Mr. Niall Greene, and two other independent members, Mr. Richard Burrows of Irish Distillers and Dr. Kathleen Lynch of UCD.  That committee is considering how, within its terms of reference, we can have a comprehensive review of existing arrangements which will shortly be submitted to the Minister for Finance.  This report will be available to all Members of the House when all Deputies will have the opportunity to look seriously at its recommendations and ensure that the public can continue to have full confidence that the lottery will continue to benefit projects that would never otherwise be funded.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Progressive Democrats are disappointed that lottery funds are used to replace departmental spending because I thought they were concerned about overspending in the Departments.  Here we have a fund available through the lottery and they are objecting to it being spent in this way.  I do not understand their economic argument, but they cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this timely debate.</P>
      <P>The question of the cap on other lotteries has been a cause of great concern, and I am pleased that a number of Deputies raised the fact that the cap on prize funds for charities of £10,000 is still in place, despite a commitment by the Government that something would be done about it.  I am extremely disappointed that, in the dying days of this Government, nothing has yet been done. It is appalling that organisations such as Rehab and other genuine charities find that their work is severely impeded as a result of the downturn in their funding because of the effects of the national lottery on their own lotteries.  Despite the success of the national lottery, it has had this negative effect which is very unfortunate and not at all desirable.  It is my belief that the general view among the public is that the cap on other lotteries should go.  It is not necessary, and it means that the national lottery has a virtual monopoly of lotteries which is not healthy.  Deputy Woods referred last night to the fact that Rehab's turnover had gone down by some two thirds.  This is quite extraordinary and unfortunate when one considers that its funding goes directly to worthwhile projects particularly for people with a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very pleased that so many Members spoke on this motion and that virtually everybody supported the spirit of it, even Members on the other side of the House.  There may be some reservations, but most people recognise that it is essential that the whole issue of lottery funding <Col N="356" /> be re-examined.  Everybody supports the spirit of the motion except, perhaps, Deputy Ring who thinks this is all a Dublin 4 plot.  If he were to re-examine the speech I made last night he would be reassured by the fact that what we seek is that the surplus from the lottery should be distributed equitably across the country.</P>
    <P>We heard from some Deputies, particularly Deputy Keaveney, that this is not currently the case.  Bearing in mind that everybody supports the motion, it is regrettable that the Government intends to oppose this proposal to establish an independent trust to administer the lottery.  That is proof, if it were needed, that the rainbow coalition Government's commitment to accountability and transparency was never for real.  The words which underpinned the rainbow Government's programme for Government have a particularly hollow ring when Government Deputies will troop through the lobbies in support of what is generally perceived as the slush-funding <i>status quo</i>.  It is difficult to understand how a Government could oppose a measure which is clearly designed to introduce fairness and justice into the administration of lottery grants.  Lottery games may be played by the people, but the proceeds of those games have in many people's minds become the playthings of politicians.  That is not desirable and must be eliminated.  It is not just desirable, it is vitally necessary that the administration of the funds should be kept out of the political sphere and left to independent assessors.</P>
    <P>Nobody doubts that thousands of projects have benefited from lottery funding since its inception. We heard much about that tonight and last night. Nobody disputes the fact that much of the money has been well spent.  I spoke last night about encouraging groups in my constituency to apply for lottery funding, knowing that even a small grant from the lottery would mean a great deal to such enterprises.  There are many groups who, when they receive money, spend it well.  There is much unease about the criteria used to decide who gets funding.</P>
    <P>By supporting this motion the Government could have sent out a message that it is prepared to loosen politicians' grip on lottery money and allow the process to be transparent and beyond reproach.  Why did it not do so?  The Government has become very cosy and comfortable in power. Perhaps it cannot bear the thought of having to loosen control of the purse strings.  It does not want to lose the political advantage which this pool of money has the potential to offer.  At the heart of this motion is openness, transparency and accountability, which the Government preaches but fails to practise.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State last night said if it is not broken do not fix it.  She detailed all the achievements made during the past ten years through the lottery, pointing to various controls that have been put in place.  Nobody denies there have been great achievements.  There is some control in place at present, but the Minister suggested it would be naïve to think that an independent <Col N="357" /> board would find a magic formula to reconcile demand for and availability of lottery funding. She conceded it is extremely important that lottery players and the public have confidence in the methods by which funds are allocated and that there should be maximum transparency.</P>
    <P>The Government recently announced the establishment of a national lottery review group and no doubt the very fine members of that group will come up with worthy proposals.  The Government has proved to be a dab hand at setting up review groups, but fails to act on their recommendations.Since we are running out of time, when will the review group bring forward its recommendations and will they be implemented?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the Government's record on reports and consultancies.  During the past two years in office the Government spent an average of £300,000 per year on consultancies.  A total of £31 million has been spent on external advice. That is a scandalous waste of taxpayers' money. In many cases consultants' reports are an expensive substitute for real action.  In the area of education in particular excellent reports have been put on the shelf.  There have been refusals to publish reports and we practically have to beg the Minister to place them before the House.  As well as being an expensive waste of taxpayers' money, to some extent reports have been a waste of time. There is no substitute for action, but in the main when reports are published no action is taken.</P>
    <P>There is no great science to the establishment of an independent lottery trust, a body which would highlight the inadequacies of the current system.  We all know from experience where the major failings are and where improvements can be made.  We all know, although some are not prepared to admit it, that the money raised through the lottery could be much better spent. Deputy Upton wondered why nobody talks about the lottery losers.  It is sad that many communities which suffer serious social disadvantage have been the real lottery losers.  Where the need has been greatest, the flow of funds has been slowest. Often the voiceless have been left penniless.</P>
    <P>Communities ravaged by drugs and crime have been left to fend for themselves, struggling to secure a place anywhere in the pecking order.  In <Col N="358" /> deprived communities there is no real evidence of lottery investment.  Where are the all-weather pitches, tennis courts, state-of-the-art gymnasiums and halls?  Last year RTÉ visited a boxing club in west Tallaght which was housed in a tiny basement and 60 young boxers were packed into the room like sardines.  There was hardly room to throw a punch.  Many of the trainers there reckoned they were keeping the young people away from a possible life of crime, but they were working against the odds.  Those people were doing trojan work despite the indifference of the State.  There are clubs such as that throughout the country and people who deserve medals for their human endeavour.  Volunteers have taken on the role of social workers and the least they should expect is lottery money to make facilities attractive for local children and a deterrent to life on the edge.</P>
    <P>Areas of greatest disadvantage have not received their fair share of lottery funding and that is a crying shame.  All politicians have a duty to do something about that.  Through this proposal the Progressive Democrats is seeking a fairer system of funding.  An independent trust may not have wisdom on every funding proposal, but it would be seen to be fair and would stand a greater chance in the long run of being fair.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Fianna Fáil Party support for our proposal and I thank individual Deputies for their contributions.  There is another side to this matter.  As soon as the rainbow Government leaves office &mdash; the sooner the better &mdash; we can return to this issue and ensure that accountability, transparency and openness is central to the lottery allocation process.  Shame on the Government for rejecting this proposal.  Perhaps it was too much to expect it would on this occasion rise above its mundane, muddled approach to policy and support a proposal which makes very good sense, as was admitted by many speakers.  The Government never made good sense on any policy issue.  Its departure from office in a couple of weeks will be greeted with a nationwide sigh of relief because never has a Government with so much done so little.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>Barrett Cheshire Home in Herbert Street has done extraordinary work for people down through the years.  That organisation also does good work throughout the country and in other countries.  It recently had an opportunity to acquire a property beside its premises.  The owner of that property was willing and able to lease it at a very reasonable price.  It was also told it could get a grant from the Department of the Environment.  As the home has undertaken a large residential care project in Blackrock, it could not meet the shortfall of £60,000 and applied to the Department of Health, but its application was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was thought that the building was no longer available, but it has come to light that it is available.Considering this organisation's record, the great work it does and the great demand there is for places in it, I ask the Minister of State to give this matter careful consideration.  If the home was given a grant of £65,000, it could provide full-time residential care for six or seven people.  That represents good value for money.  As the Minister of State is aware, there is a great demand for such care.  The home is anxious to obtain the necessary money to enable it acquire this building to provide six full-time residential care places in <Col N="361" /> additional to their existing facilities.  This is a simple matter and one the home is anxious to act on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to clarify the position about this proposal.  No direct approach was made to me, the Minister or to my Department seeking funds for the proposed extension to the Barrett Cheshire Home, nor has the home discussed the proposal with the Eastern Health Board.  I understand an approach was made to my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, for a one-off capital grant for the project.</P>
      <P>The Department has already made available to the Barrett Cheshire Home through the Eastern Health Board a capital grant of £300,000 for the building of an independent living hostel in Blackrock, Country Dublin, which is expected to be completed this year.  Revenue funding of £50,000 has also been made available from this year to enable this unit to be put into operation.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Barrett Cheshire Home discuss with the Eastern Health Board any proposal such as this for the development of its services so that the board can assess the proposal in the context of its priorities for the development of services in the region.  Moreover, there is in the Eastern Health Board a co-ordinating committee on services for people with physical disabilities on which the Cheshire Homes are represented.  Any proposal for the development of these services must be discussed by that committee so that it can be prioritised for development by agreement with the health board and other voluntary agencies in the health board region.</P>
      <P>I and the Minister are fully appreciative of the excellent service to people with physical disabilities throughout the country which the Cheshire Homes provide.  An indication of our support for the homes is the allocation to six of them this year of a total of £320,000 additional revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accuse the Government of once again putting the victims of hepatitis C through the wringer.  I call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan to quickly amend his proposals for aggravated damages to the victims and bring forward long-promised legislation to put the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ongoing delay in this matter is difficult to understand.  The Minister has tonight signalled to the victims that he has to go back to Government next Tuesday before he can give agreement. Either the Government does not trust the Minister to handle this matter and has not given him a negotiating mandate or it is once again playing games with the victims.  The Taoiseach, in replying to my many queries in the Dáil, said that getting agreement on this legislation is a top priority. Yet, the Minister for Health claims he does not have the answers to straightforward matters put <Col N="362" /> to him by the victims, which one would expect a junior official to anticipate as questions arise.  If the matter is as urgent as the Taoiseach claims it is, why is the special Cabinet meeting on the matter not being held tomorrow?  Will the Minister tell me tonight where matters stand and what work is really under way?</P>
    <P>The victims have been told by the Minister they must wait until next Tuesday at the earliest before they can get a reply.  This means it is most likely the legislation will not be passed before the general election.  At the rate the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is going, the victims will be lucky to get a reply, not to mention a Bill, before the election is called.</P>
    <P>Amendment must be made to the Minister's proposals on aggravated damages.  Fianna Fáil is concerned that the Minister is attempting to limit the scope of awards for aggravated damages to only some categories of victims.  This arises because the draft documents refer to the Finlay tribunal alone.  That tribunal investigated only matters relating to contaminated anti-D victims. Another tribunal is yet to be established to investigate matters relating to transfusion victims, haemophiliacs and kidney patients.  However, there is no reference to this tribunal in the Minister's documents.  Despite promises made in the Dáil as far back as January of this year, the terms of reference of this tribunal have not even been brought forward for consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is also concerned at reports that the Minister plans to introduce enabling legislation and will only then establish a statutory tribunal by way of statutory instrument.  The victims have always made it clear they wish the tribunal to be established under primary statute and not by a secondary measure such as a statutory instrument which could possibly be rescinded by a ministerial order that would not have to come before this Dáil.  A commitment to put a tribunal on a statutory footing in the aftermath of the biggest scandal in the history of the State should come before this House for the most intense scrutiny and examination.  If the Members of this House, as representatives of the people, are to be seen as righting the State's wrong, why is there continued reticence to publish the Bill or the heads, or to deal with the matter by enactment of primary legislation?  Why is there reticence about having a full and frank democratic debate on this issue in the House?</P>
    <P>All the evidence suggests a Government which continues to be more concerned with being saved from further embarrassment and is more sensitive to the protection of its image than addressing the substance of the just cause of these victims.  The enactment of primary legislation might exorcise the guilt of Members of this Government who have dealt with this matter ineptly and insensitively.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls on the Minister to clarify his proposals on compensation and the reparation fund.  What he has offered falls far short of what <Col N="363" /> the victims seek.  There is no agreement on this issue.  We are concerned the Minister has not fully addressed the issues raised by the victims, including Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, who have put forward a series of proposals which have not yet been included in the latest plan.  These include matters regarding the reparation fund, rights of appeal to the High Court, the application of the statute of limitations, life assurance and mortgage protection for victims, private hospital facilities, VHI care, increased funding for research and compensation for families of deceased victims.  If the State had treated the victims fairly and honestly from the start, there might not be a need for the payment of aggravated damages.  However, the oppressive manner in which the victims have been treated gives from strong legal rights which have to be acknowledged in this House.</P>
    <P>I also call on the Minister to explain the Government's decision to only admit liability in certain Hepatitis C cases.  A reply to a parliamentary question I tabled stated that the admission of liability is restricted to just 28 cases out of upwards of 1,800.  Why is the State admitting liability in those cases?  This smacks of more legal manoeuvring by the Government, rather than an upfront admission.  I hope the limited admission of liability is a precursor to the State admitting its role in the offensive legal strategy used against the late Mrs. McCole.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to commit himself to laying all Government memoranda and correspondence between State agencies on the McCole case before the Dáil.  I also call on the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to give a commitment that they will come before the Dáil Select Committee on Social Affairs to explain why they acquiesced in the use of heavy-handed legal tactics to intimidate Mrs. McCole against taking a High Court legal action.</P>

      <P>The Minister has already announced the Government's decision to, as a matter of priority, place the Hepatitis C compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  Last week, he gave each of the four representative groups a copy of the draft heads of the Bill placing the compensation tribunal on a statutory basis.  Since then, the Minister and officials of our Department have held a series of meetings with representatives of the groups.  While there was a broad measure of agreement on many matters among the different groups, there were a number of key issues on which different approaches were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One such area was the question of aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages.  In the light of the views expressed by the groups, the Government, at the Minister's request, yesterday approved the following approach.  The Bill shall incorporate a provision to enable claimants at the tribunal to establish an entitlement to aggravated, exemplary <Col N="364" /> or punitive damages.  Head 8 of the Bill provides that:</P>
    <P>The awards of the tribunal should be calculated by reference to the principles which govern the measure of damages in the law of tort, including consideration of an award on the basis which reflects the principles of aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages.  Awards of aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages may be made by the tribunal where a claimant establishes a legal entitlement to such damages against either the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the National Drugs Advisory Board or the State.  In making a claim for such damages, a claimant may rely upon the facts found by the Tribunal of Inquiry into Hepatitis C (the &ldquo;Finlay Report&rdquo;) which have been accepted by the State or such other facts as the claimant may wish to rely on, and which the claimant establishes to the satisfaction of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Government also decided that claimants after establishing their claim for damages, general and or special, at the compensation tribunal, will have two options.  First, they can seek to establish their entitlement to aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages at the compensation tribunal as set out in head 8.  Second, they can accept a payment from a special reparation fund which will be established by the Government.  This payment will amount to 15 per cent of the total amount of the award of damages, general and or special, made by the compensation tribunal.  The reparation fund would have the following advantages for the claimant; simplicity; ease of calculation, certainty of result and early conclusion.</P>
    <P>The Minister presented the Government's proposals last evening, and today to the four representative groups.  He is aware the Irish Haemophilia Society is concerned that head 8 does not refer to the findings of the forthcoming tribunal of inquiry on the HIV infection of blood and blood products.  The Minister has already made a commitment to the Irish Haemophilia Society that the next tribunal of inquiry will deal with the circumstances surrounding the hepatitis C infection of its members.  There will be further consultation with the society on the detailed drafting of the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry and it is the Minister's intention to proceed with the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The Minister's first priority however, is to ensure the enactment of the legislation on the compensation tribunal and he will have further discussions with the groups on the concerns they have expressed.  The preliminary advice available to me, however, is that it will not be possible to have a reference in the Bill to the findings of a tribunal of inquiry, which has not yet been established, for the purpose of determining liability for aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera:</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Ceann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter which is of great importance to the people of Kilrush. I hope the Minister will be able to indicate the Government's commitment to expedite this matter, the provision of a single site development for Kilrush community school.  I raised this matter a number of times in the Dáil, not least 14 months ago on 20 February 1996 on an Adjournment debate.  Indeed, it gives me no pleasure to have to raise it again.  I have continuously raised this matter in the House, but there has been no movement or progress.</P>
      <P>There is growing frustration among the parents, teachers and students of Kilrush community school.  Planning permission was granted but further steps have not been taken to advance the matter. No commencement date for the new school building has been set, although the Minister promised that this project would be accorded the highest priority to ensure the details in providing the new building are minimised to the greatest extent possible.  The parents are most frustrated by the lack of information, communication and commitment from the Minister.  Last November the parents voted to withdraw their children from school if there were any delays in the building process. Matters seem to have come to a stop, and if they do not receive a building commencement date by 28 April 1997, this action will proceed.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the board of management has been running the community school on split sites.  The board has directed the principal to give a letter to all parents with students in the school on Friday, 25 April concerning the proposed action to be taken on Monday, 28 April. ASTI and the TUI members have agreed that as and from Monday, 28 April, teachers will report for work at the CBS site and remain there to teach whatever classes can be accommodated and have agreed examination classes will not be disrupted.The unions are seeking an acceptable commencement date, a completion date and classroom accommodation for September 1997.</P>
      <P>I hope we will not hear further prevarication from the Minister.  The parents and teachers have been particularly patient and do not wish to take the proposed action because they want to get on with the job of educating future generations. Even at this late stage, there is an opportunity for the Minister for Education to take the appropriate action immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Currie):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the proposed extension to Kilrush community school, County Clare, and would like to give some details regarding the background.  In 1989 it was decided that the three post-primary schools in Kilrush, the Convent of Mercy, the Christian Brothers' school and the vocational school, should be amalgamated <Col N="366" /> into a single school to cater for 550 pupils in the long term.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the planning and building unit of the Department of Education purchased property from the Christian Brothers in Kilrush for the provision of the new community school.  The property comprised approximately 6.5 acres, a number of buildings used by the Christian Brothers' primary and secondary schools and a playing field consisting of approximately nine acres. In September 1995 phase one of the project, which involved the refurbishment of the existing Christian Brothers' post-primary buildings, was completed.  Currently, there are ten general classrooms, a physics room and a science laboratory located on the Christian Brothers' campus.</P>
      <P>At present Kilrush community school operates on a split site in the town while awaiting the construction of phase two of the proposed development.The architectural planning for phase two, which involves the provision of approximately 2,373 square metres of additional accommodation, is proceeding and the design team has submitted the developed sketch scheme for the project in the past two days.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that the architectural planning of a project this size and complexity, involving expenditure in the region of £2 million, takes a considerable length of time. However, it is accepted that there were delays at the initial planning stages due to problems associated with incorporating the Christian Brothers' primary school as part of the overall community school development.  Following various proposals for the inclusion of the primary school as part of the project, it was decided after quite lengthy deliberations that it would be more economically and architecturally feasible to demolish the Christian Brothers' primary school instead of renovating it.  I understand that the examination of the stage three documentation has already commenced and will be completed in a matter of days.  The next stage of planning is the preparation of the detail design and tender documentation.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education is fully aware of the urgent need for accommodation at the school and it was for this reason that last year, the project was designated as a priority to facilitate its inclusion in the 1997 building programme.  As I have already said, processing of the stage three documentation is already under way after which the design team will be asked to expedite the remaining work.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give a definite date for commencement of work on site.  However, the Department will continue to ensure that delays in providing the new buildings are minimised to the greatest extent possible and there will be no delay by the building unit in processing the remaining stages of architectural planning.  When the tender documentation has been completed, tenders will be invited immediately to enable construction of the extension to commence at the earliest possible date.</P>

    <Col N="367" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's announcement of 175 new jobs in teleservices in the west makes this matter more urgent.  Why have Border areas been ignored in relation to such development?  Efforts have been made in recent years to develop this service north of the Border.  Teleservices and telemarketing is a growth industry and accounts for a higher percentage of job creation here than in any other EU country or the US.  I understand 20 per cent of teleservices and telemarketing operations are located here.</P>
      <P>A Forbairt representative, speaking in my constituency 12 months ago, said telemarketing should be encouraged in Border areas.  He pointed out that although areas were isolated, road infrastructure was not critical.  He went on to talk about the need for languages.  Dundalk and Letterkenny regional technical colleges should be in a position to ensure sufficient graduates to demand such development.  Across the Border in south Fermanagh, teleservices have been established even in small bungalows and have provided employment in recent years.  Many jobs have also been created in the Scottish islands.  A Forbairt representative, discussing the 1996 annual report, said that employment had increased in the strategically targeted information technology sector and that its future would be enhanced by current developments in the regional technical college in Dundalk.  That indicates there would be enough graduates for those services if they were provided.</P>
      <P>When I tabled a Dáil question in November last asking the number of teleservicing operations grant aided in each IDA region, I was disappointed to find none in the north-east when there are 21 in Dublin.  This is the usual occurrence of Dublin attracting jobs when an area such as mine has a serious job creation problem.  There was an increase of 12 per cent in the number of people registered as unemployed between November 1994 and December 1996.  Cavan has a lower figure but a number of firms there have indicated there will be substantial job reductions soon.</P>
      <P>These areas must be considered and IDA Ireland and Forbairt should make a greater effort.  A reply to a Dáil question I tabled today stated that IDA Ireland is hopeful many more pan-European call centres will come on stream soon and that a regional spread of these projects is being pursued.  It went on to say, with regard to the indigenous sector, that Forbairt, in co-operation with Telecom Éireann, sponsored a detailed study on teleworking, &ldquo;Telefutures&rdquo;, in 1996 to promote teleworking throughout the country, including the Border region.  There were 12 seminars with the objective of creating awareness and promoting new teleservices opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had, since the peace initiative, more than enough seminars in the Border region on everything under the sun, but jobs are not being provided.  We cannot get inward investment <Col N="368" /> because we have not got UK or international industries to attract those jobs into the area. Some of the seminars were held in Letterkenny, Sligo and Monaghan with 100 people attending but we want to see a follow-up with resulting job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald):</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1991 IDA Ireland established a small team to investigate new areas of business opportunity for Ireland.  It identified the growth of telemarketing and teleservicing as a business tool in the United States and recommended the promotion by the IDA of Ireland as a location for pan-European multilingual telemarketing centres.  Subsequently, IDA Ireland announced its intention to create 2,000 telemarketing jobs in Ireland between 1993 and 1997.  Ireland has emerged as a significant player in the field of pan-European call centres in the past few years.  Over 40 overseas companies, employing approximately 3,600 persons, have chosen Ireland as the location for their new European telemarketing centres.  Dublin, Dundalk, Galway and Limerick have benefited from these investments to date.</P>
      <P>However, only one of these projects has located in the Border counties so far.  That is mainly due to the requirement for large numbers of persons with linguistic skills who are mainly located in university cities.  The site selection criteria for telemarketing projects include the availability of linguistic skills, a modern telecommunications infrastructure and suitable office accommodation.  A modern telecommunications infrastructure is now available in all but the most remote locations in the State.  IDA Ireland is working with private developers to ensure the availability of suitable office accommodation nationwide.  In addition, various significant initiatives are under way to increase the availability of language skills.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres is being implemented vigorously.  It is expected that, in line with other locations, the Border region will benefit from this recent development whereby financial incentives are biased in favour of regional locations.  I am hopeful many more pan-European call centres will come on stream in the near future and the regional spread of these projects is being pursued in line with the criteria outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the indigenous sector, Forbairt, in co-operation with Telecom Éireann, sponsored a detailed study on teleworking entitled &ldquo;Telefutures&rdquo; in 1996 to promote teleworking throughout the country, including the Border region.  Forbairt held a series of 12 seminars throughout the country with the objective of enhancing awareness and promoting new teleservice opportunities for Irish businesses.  Three of these seminars were held in <Col N="369" /> Letterkenny, Sligo and Monaghan respectively in October and November 1996 and in excess of 100 people attended.  The seminars were publicised through radio and local advertising.</P>
    <P>Forbairt will continue to promote new teleservice projects in Border regions in 1997, through <Col N="370" /> studies, promotional events, promotional literature and partnership programmes.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 24 April 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21, 28 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that Ireland is trading normally in cattle and beef on most international markets and it is against this background that we should look at the restrictions that have been imposed by a small number of countries arising from the BSE scare.  As to the specific markets mentioned by the Deputies, the following is the position.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago, I received a technical delegation from Libya who visited Ireland to observe our controls first hand.  They told me that they were impressed with the control measures we have in place and that they would be making a favourable report to the authorities in Libya.  I have written to my counterpart in Tripoli to impress upon him the need for an early and favourable decision and I am keeping the matter under close review.</P>
      <P>As regards Egypt, some weeks ago the Egyptian authorities approved a revised veterinary certificate to accompany beef exports to Egypt thus ensuring that the trade would continue unimpeded.  So far this year contracts have been signed for supply of 10,000 tonnes and a substantial portion of this quantity is currently being shipped.  In so far as live cattle are concerned, I plan to use the occasion of the forthcoming Cairo Food Fair to continue my personal efforts to have this market reopened.</P>
      <P>On Iran, technical discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing an acceptable veterinary protocol.  These are technical discussions and should not be unduly affected by the temporary difficulty in diplomatic relations between our two countries.</P>
      <P>In relation to Russia, notwithstanding the restrictions applied by the Russian authorities to cattle from certain counties, our exports to that market are continuing at significant levels.  Nearly 20,000 tonnes has been supplied to date in 1997. I hope to have further discussions with the Russian side in the near future in order to have the restrictions reviewed.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Gulf States, I have recently secured the reopening of the market in the United Arab Emirates and I am given to understand that this decision will be used as a model for those few countries in the Gulf which continue to apply restrictions to Irish beef.</P>

    <P>Under the revised arrangements for the TB <Col N="374" /> and brucellosis eradication schemes which were introduced from 1 April 1996 responsibility for arranging and paying for the first herd test in the calendar year is devolved to farmers.  The cost of these tests is a matter for negotiation between the farmer and the veterinary practitioner.  My Department will pay for any subsequent testing including subsequent contiguous tests in the calendar year.</P>
    <P>All contiguous brucellosis testing in 1997 is being paid for by my Department.</P>

      <P>During 1996 exports of beef to South Africa from Ireland amounted to approximately 12,000 tonnes.  On the basis of material drawn up by the South African authorities, imports of beef from the European Union in 1996 amounted to 39,360 tonnes.  The proportion of beef of Irish origin was, therefore, approximately 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>I am aware of newspaper reports which indicated that 95 per cent of EU sourced beef imported into South Africa was of Irish origin. The apparent discrepancy in the figures referred to may have resulted from the fact that beef of Irish origin accounted for approximately 85 per cent of South African beef imports in 1994.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a scheme of grant aid for investments in commercial horticulture under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, 1994-99 (OPARDF).  This scheme is primarily aimed at those in rural areas.  While the number and location of urban projects are not readily available in practice few if any projects in urban areas have been grant aided.  In any event since the assistance is mainly directed towards the purchase of specialised equipment for the horticulture sector this equipment would remain within the sector even if a grant aided project ceased.</P>
      <P>My Department also operates a scheme of grant aid for investments by local authorities in urban woodlands under the OPARDF.  This scheme encompasses urban afforestation projects and succeeded a pilot urban woodland promotion of two projects in counties Limerick and Wexford.</P>
      <P>To date 18 applications for grant assistance have been received under the Urban Woodland Scheme relating to counties Cork (8), Dublin (3), Louth (2), Kilkenny (1), Waterford (1), Westmeath (1), Wexford (1) and Wicklow (1).  These have been examined by my Department and subject to receipt of additional information it is expected that a number of these can be approved shortly.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any particular concern about land development referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>My Department has already been in touch with all local authorities and many of them have shown great interest in the scheme.  In addition my Department has supported the employment of an urban liaison officer, attached to the Tree Council of Ireland, whose function is specifically geared towards the promotion of urban planting and management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 30, 55, and 138 together.</P>
      <P>At the Council of Ministers meeting on 17-19 March I secured agreement to the payment in 1997 of EU funded compensatory aid of some £46 million to producers in the milk, beef, cereals and sugar sectors.  EU funded compensation of approximately £30.7 million will be available in 1998 and approximately £15.4 million in 1999. This compensation is for income losses suffered by producers as a result of price support cuts following the green rate revaluations of 8 November 1996 and 11 January this year.  I am planning for the payment of this compensation to producers in May.</P>
      <P>On 29 March 1997 there was a further revaluation of 2.765 per cent in the Irish green rate.  I expect that additional EU compensation aid amounting to approximately £25.4 million in 1997, £16.9 million in 1998 and £8.5 million in 1999 will be agreed at today's management committee meeting in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I would point out that the green rate applicable to the CAP reform premiums, including payments under the accompanying measures, was not affected by any of these green rate revaluations.</P>

      <P>Genetic engineering covers a wide range of bio-technologies many of which have potential benefits to mankind.  These include the production of vaccines and medicines, better quality and safer food, higher crop yields and a reduction in the use of chemicals in agriculture. To the extent that genetically engineered products, including fruit and vegetables, provide benefits, they are a welcome addition to the production of cheap and safe food products. However, we must ensure that possible risks to human health and the environment are adequately taken into account in releasing such products into the environment or onto the market.</P>
      <P>The EU has enacted legislation concerning the approval and condition of use of genetic modification techniques and genetically modified organisms and their release into the environment.  The Environment Protection Agency is responsible in Ireland for the implementation of this legislation. My Department has not undertaken any research into the possible effects of these developments.</P>

      <P>The importation of New Zealand lamb into the European Union is controlled by quota fixed under the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade, which came into effect on 1 July 1995.  Subject to the limits of the annual quota amount, the Uruguay Round Agreement did not provide for a formal restriction on the amount of fresh, chilled or vac-pack product which may be imported.</P>
      <P>However, a commitment was given by the New Zealand authorities in the form of a &ldquo;gentleman's agreement&rdquo; to discuss the projected importation plans with the EU Commission each year, as well as to manage imports so as not to disrupt the EU lamb market.  In respect of 1996, the commitment limited New Zealand's sale of fresh lamb to the EU to 17,000 tonnes, within the overall quota amount of 226,700 tonnes.  As this voluntary restriction has been respected, it was not open to me to seek the implementation of any additional enforcement restrictions under the terms of the GATT.</P>
      <P>I have been continuously vigilant in ensuring that the restrictions of the agreement between the EU and New Zealand on lamb imports are fully implemented.  I have raised the matter at the Council of Ministers, most recently in February 1997, and in addition my Department receives a regular report on developments in that trade from the EU Commission.</P>

However, no set-aside payment applies if the crop grown is sugar beet.  The only crop grown in Ireland under this system has been oilseed rape for use in the pharmaceutical industry.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that to date some £683 million has been paid to farmers under the various 1996 headage and premia schemes.  Payment of 20 per cent balances under the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme and the EU suckler cow premium scheme commenced on 19 February and 20 February 1996 respectively.  To date some 93 per cent of applicants have been paid their balances under the May 1996 suckler cow premium scheme while some 92 per cent of applicants under the 1996 special beef premium scheme have been paid their balances.  Full payments under the October 1996 suckler cow premium will commence at the beginning of May when the retention period has expired.  It is expected that payment of 1996 <Col N="381" /> extensification premium will commence in early May and be completed in all cases by the end of June in line with the Charter of Rights for Farmers and EU requirements.</P>
    <P>The estimated amount remaining to be paid by way of balancing payments under the 1996 suckler cow scheme is £8.6 million while the estimated amount remaining to be paid by way of balancing payments under the 1996 special beef premium scheme is £14.5 million.  The estimated value of 1996 extensification premium is £62 million.</P>
    <P>The Charter of Rights for Farmers provides that most balancing payments would be completed by the end of March and the remainder by the end of June in line with EU requirements. The fact that so many balancing payments have already been made is a very significant achievement given the increased levels of checks and controls associated with the land parcel identification system (LPIS).  This involves digitising all land parcels on maps submitted by farmers and the purpose of the LPIS is to provide my Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified, and have area values and land use attributed.  Furthermore, the system ensures that parcels of land are not overclaimed by farmers or that the same parcel is not claimed by more than one farmer in any given year.  In a minority of cases certain problems have arisen under the system in identifying all of the land parcels being claimed.  In come cases there are apparent overlaps between parcels being claimed by two or more farmers and in other cases the area aid application form was not fully completed which led to difficulties in associating parcels being claimed against maps supplied.</P>
    <P>My Department is making every effort, including making contact with farmers in many cases, to have the outstanding problems sorted out with a view to issuing outstanding balancing payments at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will appreciate the introduction of a land parcel identification system was an extremely large project involving over 130,000 farmers who between them submitted just under 500,000 maps comprising some 750,000 land parcels.Given the size of the project and the short timeframe within which to complete it, it was not surprising that some problems arose with its introduction last year.</P>
    <P>However, considerable effort has been devoted to addressing the problems which arose on the 1996 area aid applications.  Amendments identified on the 1996 applications have been taken into account in updating the system for 1997.</P>
    <P>Pre-printed 1997 area aid applictions have now been distributed to farmers.  Maps have also issued to the overwhelming majority of applicants.My Department has written to those farmers who, because of outstanding problems, will not receive maps.  These farmers have been <Col N="382" /> asked to identify the townlands in which their land is located and my Department will send them maps on which they can identify their land.</P>
    <P>As a further improvement on last year, the 1997 maps are printed against a photographic background and are centred on individual farms rather than on a townland as was the case in 1996. A free-phone helpline is also operating in the area aid unit to assist farmers who may have difficulties and the Department's local offices and Teagasc have been briefed on responses to possible problems arising with the 1997 area aid applications.In addition arrangements are in place to issue receipts to applicants within two to three weeks of receipt of area aid forms in the Department.</P>
    <P>While the LPIS, as with any mapping system, will be subject to on-going amendment, I am satisfied that the additional development of the LPIS over the past year will eliminate many of the problems experienced by farmers when it was first introduced.</P>

      <P>The Deputy seems to be referring to the apparent addition of dates of shipment on some Bureau Veritas certificates.  These dates <Col N="383" /> were cross-checked and verified against certification provided directly to the Department by Irish customs officials present at the ports.  Furthermore the commercial transport documentation was examined for each shipment. None of the export details was misrepresented.</P>
      <P>Second, there is no evidence to suggest that the beef concerned did not enter Iraq.  No disallowance of refund has been imposed by the European Commission on foot of these particular certificates.I have no basis for a complaint to the Garda Síochána.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The determination of producer price is essentially a commercial matter between the farmer and the milk purchaser and is a function of a number of factors including the products into which the milk is processed and the market on which those products are sold.  The price for butter and SMP is supported under the EU common organisation of the market for milk and milk products and managed in consultation with member states on the ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in producer prices during the first quarter of this year is a delayed reaction to the <Col N="384" /> drop in world market price levels from the unprecedently high levels achieved in 1995 and maintained through 1996.  In addition, the revaluation of the green £ during the first quarter of this year has had some negative impact on producer returns this year.  However, the compensation package of £21.7 million for milk producers, which I announced recently will go some way towards offsetting the negative impact of reduced support levels.</P>
    <P>On the question of the super levy, the relatively high EU support price for milk is a function of the existing quota system.  When a member state exceeds its reference quantity, a super levy becomes automatically payable.  The quota system is operated in Ireland in such a way that small scale producers are given priority under the various schemes for the distribution of unused quota.  I have recently announced the terms of these schemes as they will apply for the coming year and have ensured not only that this will continue, but that the more deserving cases will be more accurately targeted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSO has estimated that of all farmers surveyed in its household budget survey approximately 13 per cent have a household income of under £5,000 while 24 per cent have a household income of between £5,000 and £10,000. Data on household income is not recorded for recipients of direct payments, and therefore it is not possible to say what proportion of direct payments goes to farmers in these income categories.</P>
      <P>However, data from Teagasc's national farm survey shows that such payments constitute a much larger share of farming income on farms with relatively low farm income than on farms with relatively high farm incomes, as is indicated in the following table.</P>
      <P>In the Community Support Framework, under both the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry and the human resources heading, a number of measures are targeted at farms in disadvantaged areas and at people at risk of social exclusion.  Low income farm households also benefit from national social welfare provisions and from the early retirement, forestry and agri-environment programmes under the CAP reform accompanying measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>This week marks the second anniversary of the launch of the Charter of Rights for Farmers.  Its publication was an important milestone on the road to the highest standards of customer care in the Department.  Since its publication, farmers have explicit commitments in <Col N="387" /> relation to the levels of service they can expect from the Department.</P>
      <P>The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services to customers across the range of operations conducted by my staff. The measures built in to the charter are focused on two main areas &mdash; meeting payment targets for schemes and improving the quality of service provided by local offices.</P>
      <P>The payment targets set for 1995 and 1996 have been largely met.  Thus, under the 1996 special beef premium scheme and the May 1996 suckler cow scheme, two of the principal schemes, where the charter provides that in most cases the balancing payment will be completed by the end of March and the remainder by the end of June in line with EU requirements, some 92 per cent of applicants have received their balancing payment. The payment schedule for these schemes generally involves an advance payment in the year of application and a second balancing payment the following year.</P>
      <P>Full payments under the October 1996 suckler cow premium scheme will commence at the beginning of May 1997 when the six-month retention period applicable to the scheme has expired. This is in accordance with the charter and EU deadlines, as will be the payment of the 1996 extensification premium which is scheduled to commence in early May and be completed in all cases by the end of June.  To date some £683 million has been paid to farmers under the various 1996 headage and premia schemes.</P>
      <P>This level of timely payment is a considerable achievement given the increased level of checks and controls associated with the land parcel identification system which was introduced in 1996.  This system requires the digitisation of all land parcels on maps submitted by farmers; its purpose is to provide my Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified, and have area values and land use attributed.  Furthermore, the system ensures that parcels of land are not overclaimed by farmers and that the same parcel is not claimed by more than one farmer in a given year.  In a minority of cases, problems have arisen in identifying all of the land parcels being claimed.  In some cases there are apparent overlaps between parcels being claimed by two or more farmers, and in other cases the area aid application form was not fully completed, which led to difficulties in validating parcels being claimed against maps supplied.</P>
      <P>My Department is making every effort to have the outstanding problems sorted out with a view to issuing balancing payments at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While performance in 1996 was satisfactory, there were some shortcomings.  In relation to some schemes, arable aid and compensatory <Col N="388" /> headage payments in particular, all the payment deadlines could not be met in 1996.  This delay arose from two factors, the introduction, as already mentioned, of the LPIS, and industrial action in the Department, which delayed the commencement of processing of area aid applications by a number of weeks.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my Department can meet the various targets set out in the charter in respect of the 1997 schemes, thereby improving on the 1996 performance.</P>
    <P>As regards the quality of service provided by the local offices, all of the initiatives proposed in the charter have been at least partially implemented.  Significant progress has been made on improving accommodation in all our offices in line with the commitment to providing confidential office consultations for farmers and better accommodation for staff.  The offices are open for longer periods, although it is intended to extend these opening hours further.  Initiatives have been taken to facilitate effective and efficient processing of claims.</P>
    <P>The commitment to establish an appeals unit was met on target, and I am pleased to say that this is working well.  The review group to monitor the implementation of the charter is meeting quarterly.  The farm organisations are represented on this group which provides a very useful forum to monitor progress on all commitments given in the charter.</P>

      <Quest>whether the deseasonalisation slaughter premium levels will be maintained at the higher rate to help farmers currently experiencing severe difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates):</NameTxt>
      <P>The deseasonalisation premium was introduced under the CAP reform agreement of 1992 to assist in overcoming the seasonal pattern of steer slaughterings in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As originally adopted, the EU regulation provided for a flat-rate payment on steers slaughtered between 1 January and 30 April.  However, in order to avoid the bulking of slaughterings at the end of April the European Union amended the regulation from 1995 to provide for a gradual reduction in the premium over a longer period. For the first 15 weeks of the year a payment of £60.09 is made and this falls in steps of £15 each before ending on 10 June.  Any postponement in the rate of reduction in the premium would require an amendment to the Council regulation and, in view of the procedure involved, such an amendment could not be achieved, certainly in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I wish to point out that when this scheme was agreed in 1992, its continuation was subject to the condition that steer slaughterings in the period 1 September to 30 November were at least 40 per cent of total steer slaughterings for the reference year.  I succeeded in having this trigger level reduced from 40 per cent to 35 per cent to allow for the continuation of the scheme this year and subsequent years.  This was a very important concession which is worth some £20 million to Irish producers, particularly winter finishers who slaughter cattle this spring.</P>

      <P>We are at present at the planning stages of a computerised bovine animal traceability system.  It will be some time yet before all the elements of the system have been determined and the detailed costs worked out.  When this has been completed and following consultation with those involved in the livestock industry, decisions will be taken on the extent of Exchequer involvement in meeting the costs.  The Deputy will however be aware that a sum of £4 million has been included in my Department's vote for 1997 for the development of a computerised bovine traceability system.</P>

      <P>From the limited details provided by the Deputy, it has not been possible to trace a passport application from the person named.

      <P>In general terms, I assure the Deputy that the efficient and speedy processing of passports is a priority in my Department.  The introduction in 1995 of the &ldquo;Passport Express&rdquo; service made it possible to issue passports more quickly and conveniently through the post office network.  As a result, waiting times and queues at the passport offices in Dublin and Cork have been reduced substantially and more than 85 per cent of correct applications received are now processed within ten working days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 to 66, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to problems with definition, the exact prevalence of autism in Ireland is still open to <Col N="392" /> debate.  Depending on the diagnostic criteria being applied, up to five per 10,000 children manifest autism to a marked degree.  A greater number may show lesser symptoms and it has been suggested that there is an &ldquo;autistic continuum&rdquo; which stretches from those severely affected to those with only a mild disability.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be publishing an assessment of need for services identified from the new intellectual disability database.  Information on the service needs of persons with autism is included on the database.  Specific medical conditions are not recorded as the focus of the database is on identifying the need for services rather that the specific condition of individuals.  However, under a special initiative, the health boards have been obtaining additional information on the specific needs of this group in their regions as part of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Department's policy document on Services to Persons with Autism.  Information on the number of persons with autism in psychiatric hospitals is not available.  However, my Department is committed to the transfer of persons inappropriately accommodated in psychiatric hospitals into more appropriate care settings.</P>
    <P>The policy document on services to persons with autism was published in 1994.  Additional funding amounting to £225,000 in 1994 and £300,000 in 1995 was made available for the development of services to persons with autism in line with my Department's policy document.  The majority of persons with autism are in receipt of services within the mental handicap services including multi-disciplinary support services, residential, respite and day services and home support services.  However, a minority do require specialised facilities.  Specific services for persons with autism are available in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards which provide between 128 and 130 residential places overall.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities as outlined in the policy document is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.</P>
    <P>Some of the additional funding provided in 1997 for the overall development of services to persons with a mental handicap is also being used to further enhance services to persons with autism in line with the recommendations outlined in my Department's policy document.</P>
    <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place in each health board region are agreed by the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees in line with the priority needs which have been identified for each region.  The committees are representative of the health boards, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap in each health board area.  Both the statutory and voluntary <Col N="393" /> agencies involved in the provision of services to persons with a mental handicap and autism welcome the involvement of parents and families of persons with autism as part of the care plan process which is in operation within the services.</P>
    <P>With reference to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the policy document, work is ongoing on the enhancement of the overall level of support and diagnostic services which are available to persons with autism, and the provision of specialist residential and day services.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has put in place two pilot initiatives, in Dublin and Limerick for children with autism.  Funding has been made available by my Department to the Irish Society for Autism for research into the mortality rate and causes of mortality in persons with autism.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, health boards have been obtaining additional information on the specific needs of persons with autism and the cost of providing for those needs.  A number of initiatives have also been taken in relation to the provision of training for staff caring for persons with autism.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's query concerning the Gheel and Dunfirth Community, £826,624 is being provided to Gheel and £724,002 to Dunfirth by the Eastern Health Board in 1997.  The board also provides transport to some of the people attending services in Gheel and Dunfirth.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is the day-to-day responsibility of the RTE Authority and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, in accordance with long-standing custom.  I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTE in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of national broadcasting services.</P>
      <P>In this regard RTE has advised that it is aware that television coverage in Monaghan town and north Monaghan is variable and that good quality reception is difficult in certain instances.  This is due to the undulating nature of the terrain and the lack of good transmission sites.</P>
      <P>RTE has upgraded the existing transmitter at Lugad Hill by increasing its power.  This has improved the picture quality and extended the service area, particularly in Monaghan town and beyond in a northerly direction.</P>
      <P>A new UHF transmitter is being planned for north Monaghan to serve Emyvale.  This is subject to site acquisition, planning permission and frequency allocation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins):</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in the Burren National Park Study, the provision of a visitor facility confined to parking, toilets and staff accommodation in the form of an entry point to the Burren National Park at Gortlecka is seen as an integral component of a broad strategy which envisages the provision of presentation and interpretative facilities at Corofin and Kilfenora as well as at Ballyvaughan.</P>
      <P>The entry point, being such an integral part of this strategy, is deemed necessary to its overall implementation.  Therefore, upon receipt of planning permission I will be in a position to formally confirm the strategy outlined in the plan. However, it is clear that failure to obtain planning permission would impact significantly on the integrity of the holistic approach of the strategy as currently envisaged and, should this prove to be the case, would require having to ask the steering committee to propose amendments to the management plan before its adoption.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, discussions on the nature and extent of the presentations at Corofin and Kilfenora are being progressed with representatives of both communities.</P>

      <Quest>whether the contract for the proposed interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, County Clare was signed by a former Minister on the same date that Justice O'Hanlon granted a judicial review to the plaintiffs of the Burren Action Group on 3 December 1992 in view of the fact that the Justice had agreed that valid legal points had been raised regarding the statutory authority of the Office of Public Works to construct interpretative centres; and the reason State and EU funding was committed to a development which was potentially illegal and was subsequently proved to be so in view of the recent EU decision to clawback EU funding granted for the developments carried out to date on the proposed interpretative centre.</Quest>

      <P>The council's proposals for refurbishment works to this estate were approved in principle under my Department's remedial works scheme (RWS) in March 1997. These proposals included certain works to purchased houses and the approval was subject to the normal requirement that 50 per cent funding is the maximum which may be provided by my <Col N="403" /> Department towards the cost of eligible works to such houses.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the RWS, purchased dwellings may be included in a project where the local authority considers that the works are necessary to avoid an unacceptable or incongruous result to the refurbishment of the estate as a whole.  In the case of purchased houses, the maximum contribution under the scheme is 50 per cent of the cost of eligible works.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of tenant purchase schemes since 1988, houses are required to be sold at open market value in their existing state of repair and condition which would reflect any refurbishment works carried out.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 84, 86 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Details of the public water and sewerage schemes to be advanced in 1997 are included in my Department's water and sewerage capital work programme 1997, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.  Block grant allocations under the small public schemes programme and the group water and sewerage grants programme for approved schemes were notified to local authorities on 26 March 1997.  Details are given in the following table.  In the case of small public schemes, grants may not exceed 75 per cent of the cost.  It is a matter for the local authorities to decide appropriate arrangements for meeting the balance of the cost.</P>
      <P>As already announced, an annual subsidy of up to £75 and £35 per house towards the operational costs of supplying water for domestic use will be paid to groups with private and public sources, respectively.  To assist in the financial management of schemes, interim instalments of £45 and £20 will be paid this year.  Full details of the subsidy scheme, together with block grant allocations for 1997 under the new multi-annual programme of works for the upgrading and takeover of group schemes, will be notified to local authorities shortly.</P>

      <P>Some 5,545 group water schemes have been completed since the inception of the programme over 30 years ago; the numbers in each county are given in the following table.  Rationalisation and amalgamation of schemes has resulted in fewer schemes continuing to operate as independent group schemes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>I take it that the questions arise from my recent announcement on the payment of an annual subsidy towards the operational costs of private group water schemes in supplying water for domestic use.  Group schemes applying for the subsidy will be required to meet certain standards in relation to the effective management and organisation of schemes and the verification of expenditure.Full details of these requirements will be set out in a document on the terms and conditions of the scheme which is now being finalised in my Department and which will be sent to local authorities shortly.  It is not possible at this stage to say how many schemes will meet the requirements.</P>

      <P>It will be a condition of the new subsidy towards the operating costs of group water schemes that the trustees of schemes where the supply is quality-deficient will have to prepare an improvement plan, in agreement with the local authority, with a view to bringing water quality up to standard. The upgrading of group water schemes under the new multi-annual programme for the upgrading and takeover of schemes, with the agreement of the groups concerned, will be planned in the context of strategic five year plans for rural water supplies which will be drawn up by local authorities in partnership with the group scheme sector.Guidelines on the preparation of rural water plans are being drafted in my Department in consultation with local authority managers and will be sent to local authorities as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A revised programme for basic pre-registration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis.  The programme is operated by the Western Health Board and University College, Galway, at the University Hospital, Galway.  It consists of a three year course which leads to a diploma in nursing studies and to registration with An Bord Altranais.  The new programme has been extended to a number of other colleges of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.  The programmes are being funded by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>In the current academic year, Dublin City University is operating a one year course which enables holders of the three year diploma obtain a degree of Bachelor of Nursing Studies.  Access modules are available for registered nurses who qualified before the introduction of the diploma and who wish to pursue the one year course.  The courses are provided on a part-time basis and are self-financing.  The removal of undergraduate fees does not apply to part-time courses.</P>
      <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that his Department is currently engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions, including University College Galway, in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which will be open both to nurses who successfully complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualify under the traditional model of education and training.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 108, 109 and 110 together.</P>
      <P>My Department recognises that sport plays an important part in the lives of people with a disability whether as participants or as spectators.  It is fully committed to integrating these people in sporting activities and to breaking down barriers to participation in such activities.</P>
      <P>The sports strategy group's report, Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland, addressed the question of sport and people with a disability.  A special committee of the Irish Sports Council is being established to develop the action plan as set out in the strategy report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department provides annual funding to <Col N="414" /> sports organisations catering for people with a disability for the promotion and development of sport within their organisations.</P>
    <P>As regards sports facilities my Department provides funding under the Sports Capital Programme to voluntary community organisations.  It is open to any group, including groups representing people with disabilities, to apply for funding under the programme.</P>
    <P>Arising from the sports strategy report a national inventory on sports facilities will be undertaken.  The code of practice for safety at sports grounds published in 1996 set out guidelines for facilitating spectators with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The National Coaching and Training Centre in Limerick, which is grant aided by my Department, provides access to medical, sports psychology, and physiological testing for athletes including those with a disability.  There is also special provision in the National Coaching Development Programme for the development of coaching of athletes with a disability.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to financial support provided by my Department for sporting events to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>My Department allocated a grant of £165,000 to the Irish Paralympic Council towards the preparation and participation of the Irish team in the 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta.  Grant aid is also provided on an annual basis to organisations catering for people with disabilities, and the level of funding provided in 1996 to these organisations is set out below.  The Government is also supporting Special Olympics Ireland in its bid to host Special Olympics 2003 in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Details of grant aid allocated for the years prior to 1996 may be found in the relevant annual report <i>Sport in Ireland</i> published by my Department.</P>

      <P>In the case of Carlow regional technical college, my Department recently approved the award of a contract by the college authorities for phase one of infrastructure and enabling works for a major extension to the college.

      <P>The transcripts in question were transcripts of recordings of telephone conversations which were intercepted under warrants authorised by previous Ministers for Justice.  The transcripts were destroyed in November 1995 as part of an agreed legal settlement arrived at with the journalist in question and his lawyers which included provision for the transcripts to be read by the journalist and, thereafter, destroyed in his presence.</P>
      <P>The transcripts were destroyed consistent with section 12 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act, 1993 which makes provision for safeguards in respect of intercepted communications and obliges the Minister for Justice to ensure that such arrangements as she considers necessary exist for the destruction of transcripts of such communications.  No order or authority was sought or made under the National Archives Act in respect of the destruction of the transcripts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference to pending litigation in the question is unclear.  However, the only litigation of which I am aware which might fit the Deputy's <Col N="420" /> description, was initiated five months after the transcripts were destroyed i.e. in April 1996.</P>

      <P>I am naturally disappointed that Atlantic Mills has decided to cease cotton yarn spinning in Tullamore.  I am aware, from my discussions with the joint Dutch and French owners that the decision was dictated by economic considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Atlantic Mills have signified that it has been experiencing significant losses over the past two years, due to strong global competition from lower cost producers, and falling prices on world markets for denim, the company's end product.  It was against this background that Atlantic Mills decided to dispose of its Tullamore spinning <Col N="421" /> facility and source its cotton yarn requirements from competitive world market producers.</P>
    <P>The owners of Atlantic Mills are keen that the Tullamore plant could be sold as a going concern. I have asked IDA Ireland to liaise closely with the company with a view to finding a suitable take-over client.  These efforts are being actively pursued and I understand that a number of contacts have already been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>While the IDA is placing emphasis on finding a buyer for the Tullamore operation, it also plans, as a fall-back position, to work with the other development agencies towards finding an alternative industry which would best match the skills of the Tullamore workforce.</P>

      <P>In recent years Ireland has emerged as the undisputed leader in the field of pan-European call centres.  In that time, over 40 overseas companies employing approximately 3,600 people have chosen Ireland as the base for their new European call centres.  Dublin, Dundalk, Galway and Limerick have benefited from these investments to date.</P>
      <P>However, only one of these projects has located in the Border countries so far.  That scenario is mainly due to the requirement for large numbers of people with linguistic skills, who are mainly located in university cities.</P>
      <P>Among the criteria for site selection for telemarketing projects are the availability of linguistics skills, telecommunications infrastructure and suitable office accommodation.</P>
      <P>The telecommunications infrastructure has now become available in all but the most remote locations in the State.  Regarding the office accommodation, IDA Ireland is working with private developers to ensure the availability of suitable office accommodation on a national spread.  Also, various initiatives are under way to increase the availability of language skills.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland's regional policy for employment growth in locations outside the larger urban centres is currently being implemented vigorously.It is expected that in line with other locations, the Border region will benefit from the recent development whereby financial incentives are biased in favour of regional locations.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is hopeful that many more pan-European call centres will come on stream in the near future and the regional spread of these projects is being pursued in line with the criteria outlined above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the indigenous sector, Forbairt, <Col N="422" /> in co-operation with Telecom Éireann, sponsored a detailed study on teleworking &ldquo;Telefutures&rdquo; in 1996, to promote teleworking throughout the country including the Border region.</P>
    <P>Forbarit organised a series of 12 seminars throughout the country with the objective of creating awareness and promoting new teleservice opportunities for Irish businesses.  Three of these seminars were held in Letterkenny, Sligo and Monaghan respectively in October-November 1996 and in excess of 100 people attended the three seminars.  The seminars were published through radio and local advertising.</P>
    <P>Forbairt will continue to promote new teleservice enterprises in Border regions in 1997, through promotional events, studies, promotional literature and partnership programmes.</P>

      <P>In my address to the recent agri-food conference &mdash; Farming 2000 and beyond &mdash; I gave a wide-ranging assessment of the unfolding developments at EU and international level which will have a major bearing on the future policy framework under which our farming and food industry will operate into the new century.  The enlargement of the Union to the East, the creation of a single currency and the next round of the world trade negotiations are some of the most important issues which will drive this policy.</P>
      <P>Emphasis will have to be placed on the cost of production and in this regard the efficient utilisation of grass gives Irish farmers a competitive advantage.  The maximisation of this advantage does not necessarily imply a move to seasonal production as winter feeding of silage is very much part of a grass based system.</P>
      <P>The comment attributed to me, therefore, in a media article that I saw seasonal beef production off grass as the way forward for the beef industry is a misrepresentation of what I said at the conference.It is clear that a high value added, market led approach is vital for the beef industry and this is the kernel of current Government policy in this area.  This can only be achieved by all year round production; not seasonal production.</P>

I am in touch with my opposite number in Libya about securing a favourable outcome to the recent visit of a veterinary delegation from that country.  As regards Iran, technical discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing a mutually acceptable veterinary Protocol.

      <P>Traces of either avian or mammalian meat and bone meal were found in nine samples of animal feed taken at mills and stores since 1 January 1997 to date.  Of these, two were found in animal feeds manufactured in and imported from Northern Ireland.  The microscopic test is extremely sensitive and detects the presence of bone fragments.  In all the 1997 cases, the level of bone found has been extremely low and confirms that no deliberate contamination has taken place. However, these cases are currently being investigated by my Department and appropriate action will be taken if it is established that mammalian meat and bone meal is involved.</P>

      <P>Every effort has been made to ensure prompt and sufficient delivery of tags to all herdowners, while at the same time ensuring that supply is under strict control.  All herdowners should at this stage have received a supply of tags for 1997, the allocation of which was based on the breeding female numbers in the herd, and the extent of tag supplies and birth registrations in 1996.</P>
      <P>Where a herdowner has insufficient tags for calves born in the herd in 1997 a request for extra tags must be made to the local district veterinary office using the appropriate application form. Herdowners have been advised to allow three to four weeks for an application to be processed, and in any event to make an application three to four weeks in advance of anticipated time of need.  Where a herdowner wishes to avail of the calf processing scheme, but has insufficient plastic tags, application may be made to the district veterinary office for approval to allow the calves to be identified using a metal scheme tag to be applied by the herdowner's private veterinary practitioner.  Herdowners have been advised to contact their district veterinary office in regard to any problem which they may have in regard to tagging and registration.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the reply to the Deputy's question in 1994, my Department has continued to monitor research developments in the area of non-ionising radiation emissions.</P>
      <P>In 1996 a major review of the health issues raised by non-ionising radiation emitted by telecommunications masts was carried out by the International Commission on Non-ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), which is the adviser to the World Health Organisation in this area. The report concluded that there is no substantive evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to levels of non-ionising radiation at levels at or below those set in 1988 by the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA).  The IRPA guidelines are made compulsory limits in Ireland. A number of tests carried out by Forbairt confirm that actual emissions from masts in Ireland are well below the limits.  Further research in the area has been proposed recently in a report commissioned by the European Commission and I can confirm that this Department will be monitoring developments to ensure that the most up-to-date standards are applied to emissions in this country.  Independent research in Ireland is not therefore considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Compliance with international non-ionising radiation emission stardards is a condition attached to all telecommunications licences for mobile telephony services issued by my Department.The Director of Telecommunications Regulation, who is to be appointed shortly pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996, will be responsible for ensuring compliance with licence conditions and will arrange for monitoring of non-ionising radiation emissions.  It is, therefore, not necessary to give the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland additional statutory functions in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes):</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1996, my predecessor gave approval in principle for a development <Col N="429" /> programme costing £28.5 million at Shannon airport over the period 1996-2001.  Of this figure, £23.5 million relates to a major rationalisation and expansion of the passenger terminal.</P>
      <P>The main element of the programme is the refurbishment of the existing arrivals concourse and a major extension to the arrivals building which will house departures and provide an enlarged arrivals concourse.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the development relates mainly to new approach road works and relocation of coach, taxi and car hire parking.</P>
      <P>On Monday, 21 April 1997, I had the pleasure of performing the sod turning ceremony to commence the development and was pleased to note that the Deputy himself was in attendance.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's capital development programme at the three State airports is subject to regular formal reviews in order to establish whether the programmes should be accelerated, decelerated or modified in the light of traffic and other developments.</P>
      <P>In the case of Shannon, while there are no specific conditions relating to terminal or transit traffic, achievement of projected traffic levels is clearly a critical element of any review.  In that regard, I am pleased to say that traffic growth at Shannon to date has surpassed original expectations. Aer Rianta has advised my Department that it expects traffic projections up to the year 2001, on which the development plan has been based, to be achieved.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the terminal project forms part of a total investment package, including a new wide bodied aircraft parking stand, extension of the pier building and upgrading of the main runway lighting system to category II status, all of which have just been completed at a cost of £8 million.</P>

      <P>For a fishing vessel over 65 feet in registered length to be eligible for a herring licence, the registered tonnage capacity removed to enable its entry to the Irish fishing fleet must have previously fished actively for herring.  As this condition was not fulfilled in relation to the vessel in question and as the registered length of the vessel is in excess of 65 feet, the fishing licence which issued to the applicant contains a general preclusion from fishing for herring or mackerel.</P>
