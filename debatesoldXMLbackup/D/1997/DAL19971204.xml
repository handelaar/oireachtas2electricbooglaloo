      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8c, motion re leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates [Votes 10, 15, 17, 25, 30, 32, 35, 36 and 45]; and No. 8b, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 8c shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith; and No. 8b shall not be considered in Committee and the following arrangements shall apply in relation to the resumed debate: (i) The speech of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and of the Taoiseach, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 40 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; and (iii) Members may share time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to a debate next week on the situation where Irish exporters to and through Britain are being denied the opportunity to exercise their trade by a mob, with the police standing by and the rule of law not being enforced in Britain in a way that is disadvantageous to this island?  Will the Taoiseach take up this matter in the strongest possible terms with the British Prime Minister who was extremely vocal when this happened to British truckers in French ports but who now allows the police to stand by while Irish truckers are victimised by a mob who interviews them and decides who shall and shall not pass?  Will the Taoiseach call in the British Ambassador this morning to express his concern and that of the House about this matter?  Will he seek a personal discussion with the British Prime Minister about the matter today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Bruton and add my concern.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House if, at any stage since <Col N="258" /> this matter arose, he has personally contacted the British Prime Minister?  Has he spoken to him about what is a flagrant breach of international law which offends every principle the British are supposed to support?  Will he indicate to the House that he will take the necessary measures without waiting, with all due respect to the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, for a debate next week?  We are seeing unprecedented events occurring in the United Kingdom with the UK police facilitating what Deputy Bruton rightly described as a mob deciding which trucks can and cannot be let through?  With all due respect, it is not good enough for the Taoiseach to wait until next week.  What action did the Taoiseach take yesterday, what action will he take today and tomorrow to ensure that the rule of law in the European Union and the treaty obligations to which the British have committed themselves are properly upheld?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by the Leaders of the Fine Gael and Labour parties in this matter.  The scenes we have witnessed in relation to the way Irish truckers are being treated as they arrive at British ports are unacceptable.  We must do business with the rest of Europe and the world and this is the only way we can export our goods.  It is essential that the British authorities ensure that our trucks are enabled to travel through their territory unhindered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I ask the Taoiseach to take a direct personal stand in this matter.  This is more than an Irish agricultural matter.  We depend on access from this island to other markets to sustain and build on the confidence that exist in this economy. If that is undermined, this and other sectors of Irish business will suffer.  Will the Taoiseach take that on board and make a personal appeal to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of having a debate next week can be considered.  I take the strongest possible view on this matter.  From the outset, we made our views known to the British authorities at the highest levels.  During the course of the day I hope to talk to the British Prime Minister.  Last night, the Minister for Agriculture and Food spoke to his UK counterpart whom he will meet at 3.30 p.m. today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been stated, it is the duty of the British Government under the treaties to uphold the free movement of goods.  That is not happening. Movement is being impeded.  While I am pleased to hear the good words of Dr. Jack Cunningham, the Agriculture Minister, and others, I will ask today that those words be turned into action and that the movement of goods be allowed.  In answer to Deputy Quinn, it has been reported to me in the past few days that the laws will be upheld, but communications I have received indicate that four of our trucks were turned back.  We <Col N="259" /> have had these protests at Holyhead, Stranraer and a third port, Fishguard.  Apparently what happened is that the police have stood back and allowed the protesters&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They have facilitated them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the first time this has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;to interview the truckers and take action.  They have not become involved. I appreciate the points made by the party leaders and I will make known their concerns, my own and those of all the parties in this House.  I indicated also that the traders will be seeking compensation for breach of the principles which the British are duty bound to uphold.  As far as I am concerned, if this action was taken by us, we would be castigated from every quarter.  It is clearly not good enough.  This has gone on for days.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food will convey the views of the Government and of this House on this matter and I hope to do so as soon as I speak to the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a debate at this stage.  I will confine this matter to party leaders and allow them ask short supplementary questions.  There should be opportunities during the course of the budget debate to relate this matter to fiscal and budgetary policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the relevant Minister, the Minister for Public Enterprise, to make immediate contact with the British Commissioner for Transport in Brussels, Mr. Neil Kinnock, who has specific responsibility for maintaining transport links within the internal market and ask him to put pressure on his party colleagues in London to enforce the rule of law in Britain?  The Minister for Agriculture and Food should arrange with the farming organisations here to meet the Welsh Farmers Union and the National Farmers Union in Britain to protest in the strongest fashion about this matter.  Will the Taoiseach bear in mind that if Irish trade unionists or farmers blocked British exports, if the geographic positions of Ireland and Britain were reversed, the cacophony of protest from the yellow press in Britain would be deafening?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that a strong united front is presented by this country in defence of the rule of law, something which we had expected would be enforced in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Taoiseach said and I understood him to say he intends to try to contact the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair today.  Why has he not done so already?  Will he state which Minister is directly responsible to ensure that Irish producers are compensated?  Is it the Minister for Public Enterprise or is it, as I suspect, the Minister for Agriculture and Food?  Will he ensure <Col N="260" /> that a claim for compensation is lodged by the Irish Government and not by the vulnerable traders suffering as a consequence of the failure of British authorities to maintain civil order?  Will he demand that this item be raised at the summit in Luxembourg next week and dealt with before any other business, and convey that demand immediately to the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, so that there is no doubt as to the intent of the Irish Government on this matter.  If this precedent sticks it will do irreparable damage to Irish exports.  With the exception of Belgium we export more than any other country and 94 per cent of our exports are transported by roll-on/roll-off vehicles.  The Taoiseach has an obligation to this House and nation to ensure that every step is taken, including calling in the British Ambassador this afternoon, to make our views clear in no uncertain terms.  I want Irish producers compensated by the British authorities immediately through the action not of individual civil suits but by an action taken by the Irish Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome what the Taoiseach indicated about talking directly to Mr. Blair. It is also important to draw attention to the fact that the ports concerned were funded by the European Union, they were developed with the assistance of European funds and the European Union has a role to play in resolving this matter. It seems those funds would have been provided only on the basis that there would be free movement of traffic through those ports.  The European Union has an obligation to guarantee that our trucks and goods can pass freely through those ports.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to Mr. Blair that is our view?  Will he indicate to the European Council and the European Commission that action should be taken by them also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the resolve of the Taoiseach and I hope it will have an early effect.  In communicating the anger of the Irish people on this matter to the British Ambassador and to the higher echelons in the European Union, will he set on the agenda the prospect of calling for an inquiry into the ineffectiveness of British policing of the Welsh ports?  Without some investigation into what happened the effects of this will continue to cast a cloud on the ability of the British police to effect an open port policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputies stated.  Contacting the Commissioner for Transport, is a good suggestion and I will do that. Regarding our contact, the Minister, Dr. Jack Cunningham, has endeavoured to be helpful over the past few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The police have not been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>His good words are appreciated, but we are calling for them to be implemented.  I have made arrangements this <Col N="261" /> morning and I will convey the strong views of the Irish Government and the Dáil to the British Government.</P>
      <P>The traders will seek compensation.  There has been a clear breach of principles and whatever we can do to assist them in that regard will be done.  I know from a meeting I had with the Minister for Agriculture and Food this morning that the process of the traders making applications in regard to what happened to them on Sunday night is under way.</P>
      <P>Regarding meetings with farmers, I know the farm leaders have talked to members of the Government and they have communicated with their colleagues.  All these matters have been progressing since the early hours of Monday morning, but it is now Thursday morning and there has not been any action.  What we need to see happen and what is at issue is not whether to have an inquiry into the effectiveness of the Welsh police, it is a question of the British Government accepting its obligation and duty under the EU Treaties to uphold the laws and regulations that govern the free movement of goods in the Community. It is its duty to implement them, but they have not been implemented.  That will be put in the strongest possible terms in the conversation I will have with the Prime Minister and in the conversation the Minister, Deputy Walsh, will have with Dr. Jack Cunningham.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That subject is now closed.  Is there any other matter on the Order of Business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing that short discussion which will serve the national interest.  On a slightly related matter but not breaching the Chair's ruling, will the Taoiseach indicate the present status of preparation of the food safety and quality authority Bill in view of the relevance of having objective decisions about acceptable standards in food quality in light of decisions taken in Britain in regard to beef in recent days?  Will the Taoiseach ensure in the drafting of that legislation the suggestion will be taken up of working in concert with other countries including Britain so that there are objectively accepted standards of food quality applying in all EU countries rather than national standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The heads of the Bill will be ready in January and it is expected the Bill will be ready in February or March.  I will indicate to the Department the urgency of proceeding with the drafting of this Bill and its preparation for presentation to the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it is rather optimistic to suggest the draft Bill will be ready in March if the heads of it will not be ready until February?  Surely the drafting will take longer than that?  Will he not ask the Department of Health and Children to ensure that the <Col N="262" /> heads of the Bill are presented before Christmas so that the drafting can start earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of this Bill effectively consolidates existing legislation and regulation &mdash; it is composite legislation.  It will not take long after the heads are prepared to draft the Bill.  As much of the legislation exists, it is a matter of consolidating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify a matter with the Taoiseach.  I understood the White Paper on the Amsterdam Treaty would be completed and published before Christmas.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday or the day before that it was not likely to happen until the end of January.  If that is the case, what is the delay and has the draft of the White Paper been prepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered this question already.  The White Paper is ready but from the point of view of its presentation and putting it to the people in a way which will get their interest and attention, we will launch it shortly after Christmas.  It would be better to do that rather than introduce it during the Christmas period.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I thank the Taoiseach for allowing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to again bypass the Dáil in relation to his legislative intentions.  He told the media last night and again this morning that the Government proposes to introduce a transfer of sentenced persons Bill to enable more IRA prisoners to be returned to this jurisdiction.  When will the Bill be published and taken in the House?  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance that it will not be debated without consultation with the Whips, which has not happened so far?</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I am talking about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who told the media last night and again this morning that a new Bill concerning the transfer of sentenced persons would be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House several times this Bill would be published.  The Bill will deal with the 20 year rule and after consultation with the Attorney General and Departments, it was felt necessary to avoid any impression that prisoners returned here could find themselves in an improved situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the transfer of prisoners under the European convention and that perhaps they would be released earlier.  To avoid that impression being given, I said we would introduce a Bill before Christmas.  I asked several <Col N="263" /> weeks ago that the Whips facilitate this Bill before Christmas and I got a positive answer.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the 800 year rule.  The Government promised in its programme for legislation to abolish ground rents, which has been Fianna Fáil policy and that of all parties in the House for many years, yet the legislation is not before the House.  When may we expect that legislation?</P>
      <P>I would also like to ask the Taoiseach about another historic relic and the comments he made on the GAA's rule 21, which was described by the President as sectarian.  Will the Taoiseach make the granting of £20 million to the GAA contingent on dropping that sectarian rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the ongoing discussions with representative bodies of the Defence Forces and the proposals on rationalisation or reorganisation of the forces, does the Taoiseach intend to introduce amending legislation as promised? Given the substantial claims for injury against the Department of Defence, does the Government intend to introduce amending legislation or regulations to deal with the abnormal number of claims relating to injury to the hearing of members and former members of the Defence Forces?  Does the Taoiseach intend to allow these substantial claims to continue to be made through the normal due process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps are being taken to reopen some of the third country markets which <Col N="264" /> would be very valuable?  Is the Taoiseach aware there has been a reduction of more than 250,000 in the number of cattle being exported in the past five months than in the same period the previous year?  Even without the Welsh problem, we face a glut.</P>

      <P>On Tuesday I asked the Taoiseach about the date of the next local elections and I thank him for replying by letter in which he stated that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will make a statement shortly in connection with the decision on holding local elections next year.  Will that statement be made in the House and will Members have an opportunity to respond?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the food Bill about which the Taoiseach spoke and which is supposed to be ready next spring.  Given what the UK authorities did yesterday with our boned beef being sent to Britain, will the Taoiseach ensure the Department of Health and Children and Bord Bia make a definitive statement that we have the best beef in the world.  The worst thing which could happen would be a drop in domestic consumption because there is enough trouble in agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made his point and it is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  Perhaps the Deputy will avail of an opportunity during the debate on the budget to make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have scientific evidence in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relevant issue.  The Department of Agriculture and Food and scientific evidence suggest the incidence of BSE is extremely low in this country.  The Deputy will know the number of herds affected in November last year was 18, while this November four herds have been affected.  In three of those herds one beast only was affected and in the fourth herd, two beasts were affected.</P>
      <P>Some 90,000 tonnes of beef are exported to the United Kingdom and it is a £200 million trade. Some 95 per cent of that trade is in boneless beef. We have no difficulty dealing with the other 5 per cent if we have to.  We do not necessarily accept the research in Britain on the risk elements &mdash; the spinal cord and the brain &mdash; that tissue attached to the bone is high risk.  That is not our position.  Our beef, boneless and otherwise, is as close to perfect as one will get in the modern world.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask about two Bills and refer to a statement I made in the House earlier this week concerning the sale of fisheries. I thank the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources for his swift action to prevent the sales to which I refer.  Ireland is now in breach of the EU regulations on the transport of dangerous substances.  I understand the Bill dealing with this is ready and it is simply a matter of introducing it and getting it passed.  Also, what is the position of the road transport Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The people had two great expectations of yesterday's budget.  First, they expected there would be a fair sharing of the wealth generated by an economy which has been growing very quickly in recent years.  Second, they wanted a budget which would tackle some of the underlying structural problems we face so that the rate of growth would continue.  They wanted to ensure that the growth we experienced over the past three to four years will continue for a similar period. I believe the budget has failed to meet these underlying expectations.</P>
      <P>The best way of judging this budget is not in terms of how much money the Minister gave away, or had to give away, but the choices he made about dividing the money he proposed to distribute and the values underlying those choices.  The budget represents a bad choice by the Minister in the way in which the money available was used.  Over £500 million of income tax and PRSI changes were announced but they are not being distributed fairly.  Those on high incomes will benefit significantly more than people on low and middle incomes.  The Minister's budget tables show a worker on the average industrial wage gained only £7.50 per week.  This is less than the amount gained by a similar worker in the budget introduced by the rainbow coalition. So, although the Minister has more money to give away, the person on the average income or below receives less per week in tax cuts than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> The reason for this is that this budget is skewed disproportionately in favour of those with above average incomes.  The Government chose to invest £100 million in cutting the top rate of tax rather than widening the standard rate band and increasing the basic personal allowances, a fundamentally mistaken and unfair decision.  I give the Government credit in that it promised before the general election to deliver an unfair budget which would give disproportionately more to those on higher incomes than on lower ones.  To be fair to the Government, it has kept that promise. However, it was wrong in the first place to have a tax policy that concentrated on reducing tax rates and, therefore, gave disproportionately more to those on higher incomes than those on lower ones.</P>
    <P>Why would any grouping of political parties set out to do something which was manifestly unfair and which gave more to those on higher incomes? Everyone agrees that all parties, including those in Government, have a sense of social concern, or they at least seek to demonstrate it in words.  The reason was that this budget was driven not by a desire to achieve social justice but by the needs of marketing.  It is easier to market the concept of a reduction in tax rates because little has to be explained.  Two pence in the pound speaks for itself.  On the other hand, it requires an effort to explain that an increase in personal allowances and a widening of the tax band benefits those on lower incomes more than a reduction in the top rate of tax.  The Government was not prepared to make the effort of explaining that a better tax policy would be to increase tax free allowances and widen tax bands.  It was a form of intellectual and political laziness on the part of the Government, a willingness to pursue the easy marketing approach of concentrating on tax rates rather than the more difficult, in marketing terms but much fairer in political terms, approach of increasing tax free allowances and widening tax bands.</P>
    <P>The Government concentrated £100 million on reducing the top tax rate but the problem in tax policy is not the top rate, it is that too many people reach the top rate of tax at too low an income.  Before the budget was introduced a single person earning just £13,700 per annum started paying tax at the top rate and, despite the hype prior to it and the fact that the Minister had £517 million available for tax cuts, a single person will now reach the top tax rate at £14,050, a tiny change in the income level at which one reaches the top rate.  The choices the Government made mean the average earner gains £7.50 per week while an individual earning £50,000 per year gains £20 per week.  It was not necessary and some will ask what difference does it make &mdash; it is only a matter of pounds here or there; it is only one budget and if there is unfairness, it can be rectified in the next one.</P>
    <P>We must not look at one budget but the impact of the pursuit of the Government's policy over a five year period as against what would be the <Col N="269" /> outcome of the pursuit of the rainbow Government's tax policy over the same period.  If one takes the Government's policy of reducing tax rates and leaving tax free bands and allowances more or less alone over a five year period and compare that with the impact of increasing allowances and widening bands which would have been our policy, the difference between both over five years is radical.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party's policy of concentrating on reducing rates of tax is fundamentally and radically more unfair than that of the rainbow Government.  Over a series of budgets the effect of the Government's tax policy, if it were to survive, would be to radically widen the difference between rich and poor.  That is an extremely wrong option for the country to choose.</P>
    <P>I give Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party credit for fulfilling their tax promises. Before the election they promised an unfair tax policy and they are delivering it.  They deserve credit for that degree of consistency but that does not make the policy right.</P>

      <P>The policy is wrong and the minority of people who voted for both parties and their policy will realise it is wrong.</P>
      <P>It is not consistent with the proclaimed values of Fianna Fáil.  It is a party going back to the 1930s and before which prided itself in looking after the small man and it criticised the comfortable attitudes that perhaps were demonstrated by its political opponents at that time, among whom would be ranked some of my political forebears. Fianna Fáil made much of the fact it was speaking for the small man.  The roles have been reversed now as Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party stand for the big man and woman in terms of their importance and big incomes because they are the ones who will benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is a man with good political antennae and he should not be confused by the fact that he will receive a great deal of praise from commentators.  He should remember that they consciously or unconsciously have a sense of what is in their interest and most of them are comparatively better off than the average person in society.  Those who get themselves into the position of being called upon to comment on a budget as experts earn above average incomes, generally speaking.  They earn more than £13,500 per year and, therefore, comment over the next three or four days will not necessarily represent what people think.  If the Taoiseach's policy of reducing tax rates was such a good one, why is it that Fianna Fáil had its second worst result in history at the last general election and why is it that the Progressive Democrats Party, which was particularly associated with the policy of reducing tax rates, virtually disappeared after it?  The public did not endorse the taxation policies, which do <Col N="270" /> not represent the core traditional values of Fianna Fáil, being introduced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State with special responsibility for people with disabilities, Deputy Wallace, is doing a good job in regard to looking after a particularly important section of the comparatively underprivileged in society.  Her activities are consistent with the values of her party, values which my party espouses also.  They are consistent with social justice but the tax policy of her party is not.  It does not sit easily with the priorities her Department seeks to promote because it gives more to those who have and less to those who have not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice I have given is good.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and his party failed to take it before the general election when they did not have to choose this mistaken policy which benefits the rich, but they did so in order to guarantee the support of the Progressive Democrats Party. They got into Government on the strength of that and delivered on it, but it is wrong and is a political mistake.  It is also an economic mistake.</P>
      <P>The second objective of the budget is to ensure the boom we are enjoying is maintained, the first one being that the fruits of the boom are distributed fairly and they have not been as I demonstrated.  There are a number of aspects of the budget which are unwise from the point of view of sustaining the economic boom.  The big threat is a growth in inflation and the choices made by the Government in this respect are unwise.  A 6 to 7 per cent increase in public spending at a time when private spending is increasing at 14 per cent per year and interest rates reducing will increase demand in the economy. One might say there is nothing wrong with that, that the more people have to spend the better, but that very much depends on how they spend it.  More spending in the shops is not inflationary, because if there is an increased demand for goods, those goods can be supplied. The fact that more people want to buy toys for their children, or more food or any of the other consumer goods does not increase the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Government had reduced the tax burden on the lower paid, that would have had the effect of fuelling consumer demand which would not be particularly inflationary.  Instead the Government has specifically reduced the tax burden on those who are highly paid.  However, people in that category, <Col N="271" /> when they get extra money, do not need to buy more toys for their children, and they can only eat three meals a day, so they do not spend more in the shops.  They buy a bigger house or, if they are particularly well off, a farm in the country, and become country gentlemen rather than city gentlemen.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace will be aware that this is happening in our constituency where most land is not being bought by farmers to farm but by people who want the status of owning land.  More power to them, but that only increases the price of an asset, the supply of which is not being increased. In other words, it adds to inflation.  Likewise many people who are well off will think of trading up in terms of housing when they get the tax cuts. They will buy a bigger house in a more salubrious neighbourhood.  As there is a pretty fixed supply of salubrious neighbourhoods in which to buy houses the effect of skewing the tax policy towards the better off is to artificially ensure that there will be extra spending on increases in asset prices rather than an increase in the supply of goods.</P>
    <P>The fact that house prices double does not create an extra job, but a 50 per cent increase in consumer spending would create extra jobs.  By reducing the tax burden on the better off rather than on the low-paid the Government is going for an artificially inflationary tax policy, because the better off will spend on assets which will contribute to inflation, whereas the less well off would spend on goods which would not contribute to inflation.  That is a fundamental economic mistake underlying this tax policy, leaving aside social and political considerations to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>The effect of this tax policy will be to drive house prices further upwards and to price those on average incomes out of the housing market. That is a growing social concern, and the biggest danger to social partnership at present.  Trade union leaders, more than anyone else, have been responsible for the prosperity we now enjoy.  The people responsible for the prosperity are not in this House, or even among the former Members of this House.  I give credit, as I have done privately and publicly, to Ray MacSharry for being an excellent Minister for Finance, but I would not give him the first rank of credit for the achievements of the boom; nor would I attribute it to myself as the person who drafted Ray MacSharry's first budget.  The person concerned is the Secretary General of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr. Peter Cassells.  It was his vision that pay restraint by employees would pay off in the long run, and that helping the Government of the 1980s to overcome its problem with debt would ultimately lead to a big increase in confidence and demand in our economy when the debt problem was overcome.  It was the vision of Peter Cassells and other trade union leaders who pioneered the concept of social partnership with the Government that kept wage increases well below the <Col N="272" /> average in other countries &mdash; wage increases were half those applying in continental Europe for most of the period from 1987 onwards.  That policy of wage restraint delivered all the extra jobs we have today.  It was an inspired and inspiring decision by people who were looking to the long-term rather than the short-term interests of their members.</P>
    <P>Social partnership will be under strain in the next two years.  One of the things that will put it under strain will be increased house prices.  That inflation in house prices is being contributed to by the tax policy of the Government which puts so much emphasis on reductions in income tax for those on higher incomes who are the people bidding up the price of houses.  It is also being contributed to by the failure of the Government to take adequate measures to increase the supply of land for housing and of housing generally and to free up the second-hand housing market by reductions in stamp duty on the sale of second-hand houses.  Decisions like that would have had the effect of turning over our housing stock more quickly and of getting people living in houses bigger than they need to sell them.</P>
    <P>A long-term policy of increasing the supply of housing would have been one of the most effective things the Government could have done to reduce the risk of the bubble bursting as a result of inflation in house prices and the trade unions no longer being willing to accept wage restraint. I can see a situation where trade union shop stewards will have extreme difficulty in persuading their members not to look for disproportionate increases.  Many of their members will be saying, for example, that they are getting married, that they want to buy a house but cannot get a mortgage for the sort of house they need at their present level of income because the Central Bank, quite prudently, says that building societies must maintain a certain relationship between incomes and loans.  The effect of that will be demands for pay increases far beyond the rate of increase of prosperity in the country.  The failure to tackle the underlying problem of house prices in this budget is probably the most important vulnerability in the budget as far as the long-term sustenance of the boom is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have given credit to the Government for keeping its mistaken and unfair promises on tax. Sometimes it is said it would be better if, after elections, politicians forgot the promises they made beforehand.  That is true on this occasion. If the Government had forgotten its tax promises and adopted the tax policy of the previous Government, the country would be a lot better off.  From a narrow political point of view, I am glad the Government did not take over our tax policy, but from a national point of view it is a mistake that it did not.</P>
    <P>The Government promised in its programme that it would limit net current spending to 4 per cent each year which is equivalent to 2 per cent growth in real terms.  The Minister for Finance proposes an increase in public spending of 7.5 per <Col N="273" /> cent which is well above that stated in the Government's programme.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out here yesterday, it was difficult to discern from his contributions his underlying political philosophy other than that he believed spending should be kept under control.  He has not succeeded in doing that.  The only area where there was any reduction was in the Estimates in agriculture, and he had to reverse himself on that in the budget.  Every other spending Minister succeeded in influencing the Minister for Finance. From the point of view of Government Deputies, it will make their life a little bit easier for the next few months.</P>
    <P>It is almost an election budget.  It is the sort of budget one would expect from a Government that did not think its life was going to be particularly long, that was not thinking of the following years but just of the next 12 months, and went for easy presentation.  It is incongruous that a Government should introduce an election budget after an election.  An election budget is usually introduced before an election.  However, in this case it has been introduced after the election.  The budget has all the mistakes and inequities of short-term thinking inherent in it.</P>
    <P>I will focus on the aspects on the social side of the budget which show lack of wisdom on the part of the Government.  The first is the mean increase of 35p per week in child benefit.  This increase will enable a parent to buy one extra bar of chocolate per week for his or her child.  I do not necessarily recommend that money should be spent in buying chocolate for children but it illustrates what this increase amounts to.  How mean can one get?  All the studies show that the greatest concentration of poverty is in families with a significant number of children.  Yet there is no increase in the child dependant allowance.  The only increase given to children is 35p per week. Parents will have to wait until September to receive this increase, while single and married people earning good incomes will receive their benefits almost immediately.  This is a mistake and a reversal of the policy of the Rainbow Government which concentrated on increasing child benefit by one-third.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste said the Government has given the biggest increase ever in old age pensions.  In case the Leas-Cheann Comhairle repeats this at a meeting in Carrickmacross I point out that this is not the case.  The biggest increase ever in old age pensions, 25 per cent, was given by me in 1982.  This was done against the background of an inflation rate of 14 per cent.  The 11 per cent increase given by me was the biggest increase ever in old age pensions and I am surprised the Tánaiste, who voted against that budget, forgot this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This sort of inaccuracy should not be repeated.  When Ray MacSharry took over from me as Minister he basically introduced my budget which gave a similar increase.</P>
      <P>This increase is also inequitable.  While a single old age pensioner is being given an increase of £5, the spouse of an old age pensioner will only receive an increase of £1.50 per week.  Is there that much difference between what it costs to keep a 64 year old person who is married to an old age pensioner and what it costs to keep a 66 year old person?  Why is an old age pensioner being given an increase of £5 while his or her spouse is only being given an increase of £1.50? The reason for this is the same as the reason the Government reduced tax rates instead of increasing allowances.</P>
      <P>An increase of £5 per week sounds good, in the same way as a 2p reduction in the top rate of tax sounds good.  However, the budget was designed from a marketing point of view rather than a long-term planning point of view.  This is why I suspect it is either consciously or unconsciously an election budget.  If the Government believes it has to take out insurance against an election in every budget the sooner it calls the election the better.  The country cannot afford election budgets every year.  It is a great tribute to the political strength of Deputy Blaney and others that they made the Government so afraid of a general election that it introduced this budget.  Alternatively, it is a great tribute to the importance of the electorate of East Limerick and North Dublin that the Government felt it had to introduce an election budget for a by-election.  In any event unwise decisions have been taken by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance decided to adopt a careful approach to the introduction of tax relief on child care.  While this will be criticised by many, the Minister is correct.  It is not right to discriminate between child care given by a parent on an unpaid basis at home and child care which is paid for and provided by a third party.  There should be tax equity between all forms of child care.  It is not correct that paid child care should benefit from tax relief if unpaid child care does not also benefit from it.  The tax code should not interfere to the extent that it is more attractive for a parent to go out to work so that he or she qualifies for tax relief on child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying the Government should artificially introduce a tax allowance to make it more attractive for a parent to stay at home than go out to work, but the tax code should at least be neutral.  It should be a matter for a couple to decide whether one of them will stay at home to look after their children.  There should not be an intervention in the tax code which says that people who go out to work and pay someone to look after their children will receive tax relief while those who stay at home to look after their children will not receive tax relief.  If the Government proposes giving tax relief for child care it will have to be designed in such a way that a value is put on the unpaid child care provided by the <Col N="275" /> mother or father at home.  Otherwise, it will do something which is not in the long-term interests of society.</P>
    <P>This is the trend in other European countries. The European Commission proposed that a target should be set to increase the rate of participation in the workforce to 70 per cent.  However, it completely ignored the unpaid work done by people at home: because it is not paid for it is not work and, therefore, should not be measured or taken into account.  The unpaid care provided by a spouse or partner at home is probably more important than that done by people who go out to work in terms of its effect on the next generation. Many people do not have this choice for financial reasons.  I am not making a value judgment which is critical of any choice made by a person. However, the Government should not artificially weigh the choice against people who choose to stay at home so that we discriminate in favour of paid child care and against unpaid child care by family members.  I hope the Taoiseach takes this point into account in tax policy.  We should not forget the unpaid work carried out in any area of life, particularly unpaid child care.</P>
    <P>I will return to the topic on which I crossed swords with the Taoiseach last night.  It is a busy day for him and I thank him for staying to listen to my contribution.  I am also glad the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is present.  I said last night I could not understand why virtually all the counties which surround my county will receive tax relief for hotel building while counties Meath, Louth and Westmeath will not receive tax relief for this purpose.  One might say it does not matter that Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Donegal, Mayo and Sligo will get relief, that it will make no difference to other counties, but it will, particularly to neighbouring counties.  In the case of Meath there is great need for hotel building to cope with tourist demands, for example, visitors to some of the attractions into which the Government has put money, such as Trim Castle, the interpretative centre on the Boyne and so on.  Much money has been spent in that area, but there will be a full return only if hotels are built in the county to accommodate bus tours and so on.</P>
    <P>If a hotelier has money to spend and realises that if he builds in county A he will get tax relief whereas if he builds in county B he will not, the likelihood is that where previously he might have been willing to build in county B on commercial grounds, the tax relief will encourage him to build in county A. People will look at the bottom line, and if a tax allowance is given to one county, investment will not be made in the other.  Rather than selecting counties, the Government should have established certain criteria for qualification for tax relief.  An assessment should have been carried out of the number of hotel beds per 100,000 people in a given area and the number of tourists to that area to establish areas where there is a lack of symmetry between availability of hotel beds and demand.  An analysis should be made to <Col N="276" /> establish whether demand will be met by normal commercial investment or whether an extra boost is needed.</P>
    <P>If such an assessment had been carried out people could accept the decision to exclude some counties.  In deciding which counties to include, the Government looked at the Border counties, which already receive assistance for hotel building that is not available in other counties, and provided an extra relief for them.  The problem is that a hotel will be built in Kingscourt instead of Navan, for example.  I have no objection to the building of a hotel in Kingscourt rather than Navan if that is the right thing to do, but if the demand is in Navan, Slane, or elsewhere in Meath, why should relief not be granted for that? Why should a person have to go ten or 15 miles up the road to build a hotel simply because the Government decided to provide tax relief for that county?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of a diminishing number of Deputies remaining in the House who sat through the budget speech of the late George Colley as Minister for Finance in January 1978. To a rapturous reception, the contents of the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 were implemented. As has often been remarked since, that was a great party, and we spent about 15 years paying for it.  It is extraordinary the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, spent most of their subsequent political careers denouncing the profligate nature of that manifesto, only to come back to the House and repeat that economic madness.</P>
      <P>The circumstances today are uncannily similar to those in 1977.  This year, as in 1977, a good and prudent Government handed over office with an economy in excellent shape and starting to boom &mdash; in the recent case the boom was well under way.  Instead of nurturing the economy, the Lynch Government felt impelled to deliver on its extraordinary promises, and the rest is history.  Within a short time the economy overheated and crashed viciously, with the weak, poor and most vulnerable bearing the burden of recovery.</P>
      <P>The 1998 budget threatens to repeat that serious tragedy.  I support the comments made by Deputy Bruton, particularly his reference to the bubble in the housing market.  Let us consider the facts.  The legacy bequeathed in June 1997, by the Government of which Deputy Bruton was Taoiseach, to my successor, Deputy McCreevy, gave him many choices.  The prudent management of the national finances by the rainbow coalition meant that Deputy McCreevy found himself with a windfall of approximately £1 billion in tax revenue this year over and above the projected target at budget time last January.  Instead of a deficit of 1.6 per cent, the national finances were heading into surplus and all the economic and social indicators were positive.  The Minister faced a term of office with a new national programme, Partnership 2000, where the social partners had agreed with the Government a broad strategy for a form of economic development which would share the benefits among all sections of society.  Instead of having to implement the commitments of Partnership 2000 over three years or more, the Government could have made substantial progress this year and still have room for a large surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a complete change of direction. The fruits of the boom are given out selectively. The more you make, the more you get. That is the message.  The result will please the best off in our community, but as reality gradually dawns on the majority of people, I sadly predict, <Col N="278" /> deep disillusionment will set in.  I will not repeat the figures for different earners, they have been well documented and presented in the past 24 hours, but one does not need a calculator to quickly figure out that payback time has arrived for the rich while the low paid, at best, simply mark time.  A golden opportunity to create equity and equality within the tax code has been lost. The chance to help the low paid feel they are rewarded for work rather than staying on welfare has been spurned.  I think it was the late Donogh O'Malley who referred to the Fianna Fáil Party as the party that represented people with open neck shirts.  We are now in Louis Copeland's time and we have a different type of constituency that can afford to dress comfortably with the unnecessary largesse which has been showered on the wealthy backers of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The budget is a disgrace, a serious socially divisive instrument that will divide society in ways we have yet to measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It gets worse.  Unearned income &mdash; a capital gain &mdash; is to be specially rewarded.  So much for the work ethic.  Disposal of property or shares is to be taxed at half the current rate, a mere 20 per cent.  Capital gains tax should work hand in hand with income tax.  In any other European country the marginal rate of capital gains tax reflects closely the marginal rate of income tax.  This will no longer be the position here.  The budget sends out a message that people should switch from work and enterprise, for which they will pay 46 per cent at the margin, to trading and dealing in property, for which they will pay a mere 20 per cent in tax and no PRSI or levies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to change this philosophy if Ireland is to become a country of full employment and enterprise.  In contrast, this dealing, trading Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats Government has put the clock back and is sending us in the direction of traders and hucksters instead of promoting wealth, enterprise or employment.  It is a scandalous anti-labour budget, the full philosophical tenets of which will slowly but surely become apparent to the public.</P>
      <P>The budget is also crazy in the short term.  The 20 per cent capital gains tax rate sends a signal to investors to intensify the purchase of property where the greatest gain can be maximised.  This will cause further asset fluctuation and drive out the ordinary house buyer.  In turn, we are storing up trouble for ourselves at a later stage by preventing the owner occupation of housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's action in this area is astounding.  Five months after coming into office it appointed a group of consultants to advise it on the problems associated with the housing market. What are the experts in the Custom House doing?  Is there such a lack of expertise in the <Col N="279" /> Department of Finance, the local authorities and the construction section of the Department of the Environment that after five months the Government must hire a group of consultants who will simply tell it what its professional civil servants could tell it today.  In the meantime, as a result of the budget, the constituents of the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will not be able to buy houses in the townlands in which they grew up because of rich people from Dublin buying up land and property around them.  This will be repeated in every so-called rural county on the periphery of a large urban area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is scandalous, stupid, brazen and unnecessary.</P>
      <P>The trend in public spending is also deeply worrying.  We have already exposed what I am sure parliamentary language will allow me to describe as a fiddle in current expenditure, resulting from the massive switching of moneys from next year to this year which helped the Minister pretend he has kept his election promises. Neither I, as the former Minister for Finance, nor Deputy Bruton, as Taoiseach, were responsible for the outrageous outturn in the l997 figures.  When examining our performance last year in terms of the estimate for public expenditure and the final outturn, future historians will conclude that the incoming Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats minority Government were left a legacy of massive overspend.  That is not so.  Massive amounts of money due to be spent next year were brought forward to this year's figures.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister of State is aware of one particularly outrageous fiddle.  It is conventional that school teachers are paid by the Department on the fifth day of the month following the month which they worked.  Therefore, on 5 January this year a pay bill of approximately £33 million would have been paid to teachers by the Department of Education.  That pay date for this year alone has been brought forward to the end of December, l997 and, hey presto, the magical accountant, the Minister Deputy McCreevy claims he has made a saving of £33 million for l998 and that there was an increase in expenditure for l997 of the same figure.  He claims he has lowered his rates for l998 and can tell accountancy lies which would have him debarred from practising as a professional accountant if he were to publish such accounts on behalf of clients.  He certainly would be severely sanctioned by his institute and the accounts in question would have to be so qualified that the Revenue Commissioners or stock investors would examine them seriously.  That is only one fiddle.  There has been a symphony of fiddles in the expenditure figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we attempted last year to make provision for £60 million for hepatitis C payments before the end of l996 to show good faith to the <Col N="280" /> women who had been damaged by the negligence of the Blood Transfusion Services Board, the former Deputy McDowell and the now Minister, Deputy McCreevy, were apoplectic and incensed. I accept it helped our figures.  Deputy McDowell suggested that on mature reflection, I would be obliged to resign.  Yet, a symphony of fiddles characterises this Book of Estimates.  If Members do not consider my word as being objective, they should read Moore McDowell's &mdash; the older and perhaps wiser brother of Michael &mdash; analysis on this matter in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>Public spending must be examined seriously. The Labour Party is not against increased public spending or against providing resources for necessary services.  However, we are certainly against the loss of control in public finances so that massive increases in public spending do not result in improved services.  It is obvious that every additional penny going into the health service will fund the pay roll and not reduce waiting lists or improve the quality of service for patients. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is a professional medic in his own right and knows, perhaps more acutely than most, that virtually 80 per cent of moneys that go into the health services go towards salaries and not on the improvement of services.  We are told that more money is being spent, but services are not being improved.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that after less than five months the Taoiseach, who is a former Minister for Finance and Labour and prides himself as an expert in human resource management &mdash; the new and more fancy title for industrial relations &mdash; and the Minister Deputy McCreevy have given up on the strategic management initiative.  They have walked away from the only way we can reconcile improved quality of services, pay and conditions for people in the public service and efficiency for the public at large.  We simply must reform the way we run our public administration, both in the civil service and in the wider public service.</P>
    <P>We did not hear much from the Minister about anything because of his much vaunted button lip policy.  The Minister for Finance is also responsible for the public service. There is a division within his Department responsible for that sector.  I have not heard a word from him or the Taoiseach to try to persuade over 250,000 people working in the public service of the need to improve, develop and modernise the manner in which that service operates.  These workers would be the beneficiaries of such an improvement.  If this reform was taken seriously by the Government, their job satisfaction, personal fulfilment, working relations with colleagues and relationship with the wider public would be transformed for the better as would their pay and working conditions. However, there is no evidence that the Government is willing to do so.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to reform the public service and implement the SMI will come back to haunt him in 1999.  The no policy change position shows another 6 per cent growth in public current <Col N="281" /> spending that year, largely driven by the pay bill. The Government will have no room for any initiatives or new developments if it is to stick to its spending limits.  It is obvious that it will not be able to stick to those limits because they are in excess of what they were proclaimed to be in the Fianna Fáil manifesto and the Estimates.</P>
    <P>On the capital spending side, I was glad to see the Minister abandon his ridiculous target of a 5 per cent limit.  There is a need for infrastructural development to remove the congestion described by the ESRI and others.  We have to tackle the problems of prosperity.  The traffic chaos in Dublin and other urban areas needs action, not more inquiries.  The Minister is budgeting for a drop of £40 million in capital spend in 1999.  Much of this is attributable to the way information technology capital is being spent in education.  However, this leaves no room for Luas.</P>
    <P>Somebody in the Government will have to come clean very soon and proclaim the death of Luas.  Someone will have to say it is over, we will not get the money from the EU as we cannot get the project together in time.  Someone will have to admit that instructions were given to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which, in turn, telephoned South Dublin County Council and asked it to have the tender documents ready for the Dundrum bypass because the money is not going to be spent on Luas.  Someone will have to tell commuters that an opportunity to introduce a light rail system in Dublin, where approximately one-third of the population lives, has been deliberately and wilfully sabotaged by Deputy O'Rourke's further inquiry into the underground option.  It is spurious and misleading to suggest that the underground option was not looked at.  Ray Byrne or any of those associated with Luas will confirm that it was looked at in the early stages.  The six month delay is the death-knell of Luas.  The Minister and the Government know this and it is buried in these figures.  Luas is over because of the decision of this Government and the death notice is submerged in the myriad detail in the budget and the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Ireland is about to embark on the important but hazardous entry into economic and monetary union.  The Government has signed up for the stability and growth pact.  In a worse case scenario, under that pact we can run a budget deficit of no more than 3 per cent.  This dictates that, at this high point in the cycle, we should be generating substantial surpluses.  The discipline associated with the stability and growth pact has not been properly analysed or debated.  We should be generating substantial surpluses.  The Government could do so with the money available. However, it has chosen not to do so.  Instead it is unashamedly rewarding the rich.  If one does not believe my words then look at the headline on the front page of the budget supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Better-paid benefit most from £517m.  &lsquo;tax give-away&rsquo; Budget&rdquo;.  This is criminal irresponsibility reminiscent of 1977.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="282" /> has learnt nothing in 20 years.  It is outrageous because it is the poor and the weak who will have to pay when the party comes to an end.</P>
    <P>We are in a different situation from that in 1977.  We are entering monetary union within the next 12 months.  By May 1998 we will know which other countries will join us on this new and hazardous journey.  It is a necessary journey but it involves uncertainty because it has never been tried before.  Therefore, like any prudent traveller, we should take precautions.  We should make sure that we understand the nature of the hazard and that we have additional resources to provide for the unforeseen.  There will be unforeseen problems.  Are we doing so?  Is there a debate taking place?  Citizens are getting a buttoned lip instead of a serious dialogue for fear that a wrong word might send a tremor through the markets and cause some difficulty.  There is an obligation on the Government to inform and involve the citizens, be they elected representatives or the wider public.  No such debate has been initiated, notwithstanding the excellent preparatory work undertaken within the Department of Finance and the social partners.</P>
    <P>EMU is not the only potential hazard on the horizon.  The so called Asian tiger success has begun to unravel.  Today's newspapers carry a story that £37 billion has been made available to bail out Korea.  The Japanese banks are technically insolvent.  Japan has the resources to restore their solvency but at an enormous cost.  However, we do not know the economic impact of such a correction on the rest of the world.  Therefore, having regard to the discipline of the growth and stability pact and the possibility of our fortunes suffering an external shock over which we have no control, we should be able to respond with a budget surplus.  Are we doing so?  Not at all.  The Government seems to think we can ignore the rest of the world as George Colley did in 1977 because no one predicted that the Iranian oil crisis would cause an economic catastrophe two years later which hammered our economy.</P>
    <P>This budget is dangerously reckless.  The goalposts have shifted.  It is no longer good enough to balance the books.  Financial markets expect more as will the European fora where Ireland will be judged in the single currency.  Why are we gambling?  We are testing our public finances with a further stimulus at a time of huge congestion and signs of overheating.  This stimulus would be justifiable if it went to the weakest &mdash; the low paid and those caught between welfare and work. Effectively, these people are getting nothing.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Fianna Fáil backbenchers have analysed this budget.  It is the most socially divisive budget in recent times.  It is so anti-worker it is not true, yet a gloss has been put on it by self-interested commentators.  No one should be fooled by its short-term popularity and favourable comments over the next few weeks.  It is more than an anti-worker budget; it is an antifamily budget.  There is nothing in it to compare with the child benefit increases introduced by the <Col N="283" /> Rainbow Coalition.  Every objective study shows that child benefit is a unique way of helping families to move in a work-friendly direction.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, will know this.  A gimmick that proposes helping families with multiple births by giving extra child benefit only exposes the paucity of the resources being given to the family in this budget.  The amount, 35p next September, is unbelievable given that lawyers in the Four Courts cannot agree fees with Mr. Justice Flood.  They are having their tax rate of 48 per cent reduced significantly. This unbelievable provision comes from the party that represents the men with open neck shirts.</P>
    <P>We may never again get the opportunities presented in these years to assist social cohesion. The end of the debt crisis and years of economic growth will not always be with us.  Sooner rather than later this extraordinary period of economic growth will abate and we will return to harder choices.  This opportunity is now being missed. We are about to lose our Objective 1 status for Structural Funds if Monday's <i>Financial Times</i> is to be believed.  There is no sign in this budget of preparation for the period of weaning off those funds and the CAP.  We need a national debate on how we will plan our development without these moneys.  We face a possible bubble in the short term, with tax cuts for the rich and sharp interest rate deductions in April which will rev up the economy.  Later, if we survive, we face a sharp fall in incoming funds and the fiscal instruments we were used to, such as the ability to have a significant deficit to combat the recession.</P>
    <P>This requires a well thought out, planned response, and there is no evidence of that anywhere in the budget.  The Taoiseach is walking blindly into a future that has been well charted and signposted by previous administrations, some of which he participated in.  It is an extraordinary capitulation to four Deputies who represent a greedy philosophy that is so alien to the traditional views of Fianna Fáil that it is astounding the Taoiseach has embraced it.</P>

      <P>However, there will be no smiles in Tallaght for her party leader.  Those people are not in work, cannot get into work and this budget's measures will not facilitate them getting work.  When the boom finally comes to an end, as all booms must, there will be no resources to deal with problems because of the constraints we have signed up for.  The White Paper on the Amsterdam <Col N="284" /> Treaty is not being published until after Christmas because the Taoiseach feels it might get lost in the Christmas rush.  We are not having a debate about where the country is going, the difficulties we will face or the unique opportunities now before us, which could have been consolidated in the budget.  They are being frittered away instead.</P>
      <P>Let us look at tax changes in relation to going to work and staying at work.  Every time the Government has to choose between the rich and the poor, it chooses the rich.  Every time it is a choice between helping someone get work or rewarding those already at work, particularly if they are better off, the Government chooses the better off.  There was a choice between helping small companies to retain more of their profits because they are starved of capital by definition, and the big companies: the Government chose the big companies.  Approximately 25,000 companies are reported as trading in the economy, and 13,000 report profits of under £100,000.  Lorraine Sweeney and others have lobbied for the 28 per cent threshold to be moved to £100,000 or £200,000; instead, the level has been taken down from 36 per cent to 32 per cent.  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies realise what they have done?  They have given the biggest lottery prize in the history of the State to approximately 20 major companies. Banks, building societies if they are paying tax and large insurance companies will get the bulk of that tax reduction, and small companies, which need to retain as much of their profits as possible for reinvestment and capital acquisition, will get nothing like the same benefit.  The rate has come down from 28 per cent to 25 per cent, but the amount has stayed fixed at £50,000.</P>
      <P>There were two ways of reaching a figure of 12.5 per cent for integrated corporation tax by 2006.  The thresholds could have been moved up and the rates brought down.  However, a choice has been made in relation to bringing down the rates that will not enhance the capacity of Irish companies to hire more people or to retain their profits for investment.  This Government has been faced with unprecedented wealth in its first budget, and at every turn it has chosen the rich over the poor and the greedy over the needy.  It has spurned one large constituency which yields substantial votes and which, as Deputy Bruton said, is one of the key architects of our economy's success in the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions brought in the concept of social partnership based on the 1986 National Economic and Social Council report.  Those were difficult times, but this was done with the courage and commitment of the two employers' organisations, the farming bodies and the then Government.  Foreign commentators have beaten a path to Ireland to find out how we have turned the financial crisis of the 1980s into the unparalleled economic success of the past five years.  Each has been told that it was the discipline of the social partnership that brought about pay restraint.  This lead to modest increases <Col N="285" /> in labour costs that improved competitiveness and productivity.  That brought about real increases in take-home pay because of matching tax reductions and an increase of 200,000 people at work in over four years.</P>
    <P>That is now being put at risk.  The maverick vote received by a factory worker in SIPTU should not be dismissed as targeting the Liberty Hall leadership.  There is an unease in the workforce that they are not sharing in the benefits of the Celtic tiger.  For two thirds of those people who pay tax at the standard rate, the Government's cosmetic reduction of rates without increasing bands and allowances means they will not hear the roar of the Celtic tiger when they are paid in April and May.</P>
    <P>What will they do then?  They will look for increases.  Mr. William Attley of SIPTU's threat of a special delegate conference should not be easily dismissed.  I have disagreed with him on many occasions, but he has been uncannily close to the centre of political gravity when reading the mood of his own members.  This Government prizes its special antennae for and sensitivity to the labour movement, and it should listen carefully to the architects of the Celtic tiger's success. The trade unions are now being copied by their colleagues in Britain and Europe.  We could have done far more.  We could have had more people back at work and rewarded the workhorses of the economy by concentrating tax reductions on the lower and middle paid.</P>
    <P>The Government had a clear choice and was not devoid of advice or consultation.  However, four Deputies held out until the last minute for cosmetic changes and got them, and the rich are richer at the end of this budget in a way they did not dream of.  The last time Fianna Fáil implemented this kind of crazy nonsense the Taoiseach and Deputy Harney were members of the same party.  It appears the homecoming has been completed and that to all intents and purposes Fianna Fáil has rejoined the ideology of 1977, which combines economic madness with political selfishness.  When properly analysed, this will be seen as a time in our history when social justice was within our grasp, where the possibility of eliminating poverty for certain key sectors of our society was attainable and where we could consolidate the foundations of an economy that could take us safely into the next century in a socially cohesive way where we would not have ghettos of poverty leading to crime and lawless-ness. Instead we got an extraordinary budget.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10 million is being allocated for people with disability and £20 million for Croke Park.  I enjoy sport.  Sport is wonderful for the country at large and I want to see a state of the art stadium here sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I will tell the House something that is not known publicly.  I made informal inquiries to the GAA a couple of years ago, having regard to the balance of the surplus moneys in the lottery, of which there is about £60 million.  The deal was simple.  Let us complete the Croke Park stadium, <Col N="286" /> that wonderful edifice, with lottery money on condition that the park would be open to all sporting codes.  The word that came back was that it was not possible to do that.  It was unable to bring about a change in its rules.  It might be possible some time in the future but not now.  Has any undertaking been given by the Gaelic Athletic Association to revisit, consider or change its internal rules to allow other codes to be played in that wonderful stadium, the restoration of which we fully support?  If not, I put it to the Taoiseach &mdash; through the Chair &mdash; that in that little vignette of a policy decision he has illustrated the social division and the unfair way in which the Government approached its first budget.  This is a sad day and given that we are no longer a poor nation, an impoverished people, very poor people in our midst no longer need to be poor, hungry or abused, because for the first time we have the resources to address those needs.  Instead the party of the men of the open neck shirts has chosen to reward the rich.</P>
    <P>It is criminal and I am deeply and passionately angry at the way in which these decisions have been made, the con in the accountancy of the figures in the Estimates and the detailed choices that have been made which reveal a division, an attitude and a philosophy that should have no place in society.  I commit myself to combating it at every twist and turn.</P>

      <P>This is probably the most remarkable budget of modern times.  The amount we have been able to do is a reflection of the huge economic progress we have achieved in the past ten years.  It is a tribute to social partnership and to the collective restraint responsibly exercised by the people over many years, that this budget is possible.  It is a recognition and a reward for effort, including the efforts of those now retired. It is also an incentive to continue along the same path.  The budget underpins the sharply rising trend in employment and continuing high economic growth.</P>
      <P>The budget is historic for many reasons.  Its timing in late autumn is an important reform in budget procedures.  For the first time in 50 years we will have returned to broad budget balance and we will no longer be adding more borrowing to the national debt.  In my time in the House I did not believe I would ever see that.  We are exercising the promised control of current expenditure by keeping its increase under 4 per cent. Greater generosity is shown to the elderly than in any recent budget.  The broad tax and social commitments of Partnership 2000 over three years will have been delivered upon by the second year, thus keeping faith with the social partners.</P>

      <P>We have also kept faith with the electorate by delivering one third of the tax <Col N="287" /> reliefs promised over five years.  For the first time in a long time, these reliefs can be paid for without resort to additional borrowing, as defined by the EU.  That is why the reliefs are larger this time.  Tax on the business sector is being reduced so that we can maintain our competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Both parties in Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; are proud of their shared sponsorship of the budget, which is a balanced reflection of both our philosophies.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has also put his stamp of authority on the budget and deserves our warm congratulations on its overall shape and detail.</P>
      <P>We have not been able to do all we would like. However, we have fulfilled at least half the items from the agreed list of priorities for our first budget issued on 4 June 1997.  They were priorities, not absolute or immediate commitments. The important thing is that we have made a flying start.  We need to continue on the path set out, so that over five years we can fulfil most of our commitments and more.</P>
      <P>Next year we can look forward to economic growth of 7 per cent, following on nearly 8 per cent in 1997, for the fifth year in succession.  The current phase of exceptionally high growth began in 1993-4 following a successful devaluation.  Over the long term, growth since the dramatic and decisive economic turnaround in 1987 has been running at an average of 5 per cent per annum.</P>
      <P>The current phase of strong growth started under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition.  I acknowledge the service of the Rainbow Coalition and especially the Minister for Finance who succeeded me, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in sustaining high growth over the following two and a half years.  It is the Government's job to sustain the winning run as long as possible, recognising it will not continue forever.</P>
      <P>While there used to be a worry about jobless growth, since 1987 we have created 250,000 jobs, which is an enormous number.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important not to mislead people.  The economic policies we are pursuing continue to generate jobs.  I look forward, at a time when employers in practically all sectors are calling for labour, to incentives such as the £3,000 extra relief, the £1,000 per child and, perhaps, £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 for a relatively small family being available.  It is an imaginative announcement taken straight from one of our manifesto documents.  I hope it will work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of April this year, total numbers at work were equivalent to the highest previous recorded level in 1936, and by now we have certainly exceeded that figure.  In 1997 and 1998, net numbers at work are expected to increase by an average of 50,000 a year, a remarkable figure by previous standards.  The increase in employment <Col N="288" /> reflects particular credit on the social partners. There has also been a significant improvement in living standards delivered through the tax reductions implemented since 1989 and in increased income support for welfare recipients from the same time.</P>
    <P>The basic requirement to sustain high growth is to keep inflation down and to exercise fiscal prudence.  The indirect tax increases in the budget make only a modest 0.2 per cent contribution to inflation, the same as the effect of last January's budget.  Low inflation not only makes growth sustainable but allows everyone to improve their standard of living.</P>
    <P>With such high growth rates and to avoid overheating, I have continuously argued since 1994 that we should be moving swiftly to overall budget balance while we have the opportunity. The current budget surplus has moved into four figures while we also have a modest general Government surplus.  Our projections are always prudent and if we do better than anticipated we will soon be able to start reducing our £30 billion national debt, not only as a percentage of GNP but also in cash terms.  We will achieve the European target of a sustainable general government debt-GDP ratio below 60 per cent by the end of the century, a remarkable achievement if we consider it was roughly double that level ten years ago.  In the first budget of 1997 the previous Minister, Deputy Quinn, projected extra borrowing of £2.2 billion by 1999.  The Government does not have a philosophy of spending all the money we can lay our hands on but rather spending only what we need and handing the rest back to the taxpayer to whom it belongs.  By running a budget surplus now we will create the leeway to prevent a serious decline in public capital investment as a result of the eventual scaling back of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds allocations to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Starting in 1998, the first year for which we have full responsibility, we are adhering strictly to the spending targets set out in our election manifesto.  Most of the extra spending incurred by the Government in the latter half of this year was for the purpose of reducing long-term liabilities, an entirely prudent thing to do.  The Opposition parties gave commentators a rough time this morning for praising the budget.  There are people who suggest it is not such a great idea to deal with long-term liabilities in good times.  If one does not deal with long-term liabilities in good times when should one deal with them? Should one wait until they jump up and bite or until the tiger turns vicious?  We have adopted a sensible approach in building up pension funds in An Post and Telecom Eireann.  Deputy Quinn knows from experience the extent of the liabilities in that area.  The Minister for Finance has made money available to deal with the issue.  I would like to hear others outline their solutions and indicate how we should deal with long-term liabilities if we do not deal with them in good times.  Should we continue to run up huge surpluses?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> In an ingenuous commentary one stockbroker stated that the markets might be slightly disappointed with the projected borrowing figure of £89 million given the surplus widely expected.  He referred to the fiscal stance but ignored the fact that the figures could have been massaged. Instead workers have been looked after.  My colleagues in the Labour Party and on the far left fully support this approach.  It was his concern for workers that led the Minister for Finance to make these excellent decisions.</P>
    <P>Next year, taking account of debt servicing, we intend to keep within the 4 per cent limit we set ourselves for current expenditure.  Within that limit we will address priority social and infrastructural needs.</P>
    <P>It was erroneously suggested that the increase in capital expenditure by 17 per cent next year was a breach of the Fianna Fáil manifesto commitment to hold it to 5 per cent but commentators failed to read the qualifying clause.  This stated that: &ldquo;We will limit growth in Exchequer capital spending to 5% a year, until the current budget surplus is equal to and can offset Exchequer borrowing for capital purposes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The current budget surplus is £1,100 million. The capital budget deficit is £1,200 million.  By the European general government deficit definition there is not even a small gap but a small surplus. There is no doubt that a rapidly growing economy needs increased capital investment to prevent bottlenecks from developing in terms of availability of people with the right educational skills and transport capacity in particular.  Post-budget we have an Exchequer capital programme of £2 billion and a total public capital programme of £4.4 billion.</P>
    <P>I am particularly proud of the social provisions of this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Overall, we have provided as much money for social welfare increases as the <Col N="290" /> rainbow coalition Government earlier this year, marginally more.  Personal rates are being increased by £3 per week or over 4 per cent in most categories.  The increases are being brought forward by two weeks.  These increases are significantly more generous than the 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent increases in the 1995 and 1996 budgets. We are at last making serious inroads into long-term unemployment.  The budget provides specific measures to accelerate this trend.  The number of places on the back to work allowance and direct employment programmes is being increased by 7,000.  This reflects the importance the social partners attach to targeted support for the long-term unemployed.  The incentive of the area based allowance is being extended nationally.</P>
      <P>A real incentive for the long-term unemployed to re-enter the workforce is the special tax allowance to be tapered over three years of £3,000 plus £1,000 per child for the long-term unemployed with retention of secondary benefits as well as a double tax deduction incentive for the employer. I have debated and answered questions about the tax wedge.  It has long been argued that the disincentive for the long-term unemployed, particularly those with children, should be removed. This incentive was developed by my good colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, with the assistance of the task force which conducted the necessary research, and included in our programme.  On top of their existing allowances a long-term unemployed person with three or four children will receive in the first year a special tax allowance of £3,000 plus £1,000 per child.  There will also be an incentive for the employer.  If there was ever a time to introduce such an incentive this is it, particularly when we are being told by employers that things are so bad they cannot recruit Irish people to fill the many vacancies available.  I have no problem with them recruiting people from other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but a significant number of Irish people are unemployed and they should now be given their chance.  As a result of this measure those entering the workforce, having been on the live register for more than 12 months, will pay little or no tax in most cases to start with. This removes inequalities in the system for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important break with the recent past is the provision of a £5 per week increase for old age pensioners giving increases of 6 per cent to 7.5 per cent.  In the programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats stated we &ldquo;recognise that our older people have helped to build up the country into what it is today.  It was their sacrifices, their taxes and their efforts which have helped to create the economic prosperity which we now enjoy&rdquo;.  I am particularly <Col N="291" /> glad that we have been able not only to deliver a more substantial pension increase than has been seen for many years but have also raised the tax exemption limit, which has always been a sore point, by £400 and £800 for single and married people between the ages of 65 and 74 and by £300 and £600 for those over 75, these increases being the highest in recent years.  We have addressed the inheritance tax worries between elderly and other relatives not married to each other who are living under the same roof, known traditionally as the brother and sister clause.  This measure will be of great help to them.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to his 1982 proposals which were part of a budget that fell.  Fianna Fáil in its three budgets of 1980, 1981 and 1982, in keeping with the principle espoused by its then leader, Charles Haughey, increased the pension rate by 25 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">

      <P>When the inflation rate was high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was but Deputy John Bruton claimed it was a practice we had followed over those years.  Inflation was in high double figures throughout that period but there were also real increases granted which took most old people out of the poverty net.</P>
      <P>We have continued the policy of recent years of increased child benefit.  The increase of £1.50 for the first and second child given in this budget compares favourably with the £1 increase given in the January 1997 budget.  Therefore, I am very surprised at Deputy Bruton's criticism of it this morning.  If his criticism is based on the fact that our giving £1.50 for the first and second child is that awful, why did he grant a mere £1 some nine months ago?  Perhaps it is that he forgets.  There is also an additional £3 a month for a third and subsequent child in addition to the £5 given earlier this year and £2 last year.</P>
      <P>In response to many representations, we are paying child benefit for twins at 150 per cent of the normal rate.  There are also important improvements in the family income supplement so that, relatively speaking, the low income family is among the biggest beneficiaries of this budget. The one-parent family payment, which was frozen by the British Labour Government this year, also the object of some controversy here in the earlier part of the year, has been increased by £3 in this budget.</P>
      <P>Significant additional resources have been provided for health on which spending is due to increase by 11 per cent.  In 1996, in particular, the health budget was maintained within very tight margins which perhaps contributed to some of the difficulties we are now experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, the major focus of attention at budget time is on changes in taxation.  That is appropriate not only because of the significance of the amount involved but also because of the vital role tax policy can play in underpinning <Col N="292" /> economic performance and living standards, which has been at the heart of our successful social partnership arrangements for the past ten years.  Moderate wage increases, backed up by appropriate tax reduction policies, generate high living standards and put dramatically more people at work.  This budget deepens that strategy, reflecting the expectations of working people that they should share fully in the benefits of the economic performance they have produced.  This is very much the point at issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn was right in the last point he made, that people at work feel they should be getting a return on their taxes and share in these benefits, which is precisely what occurred yesterday. The two parties in Government were elected because we showed a more serious commitment to reducing the burden of personal taxation.  In general, Labour and Democratic Left do not like cutting taxes more than they can possibly help. Their philosophy always has been that an extra £1 spent by the State is more beneficial than £1 given back, with which we fundamentally disagree. We won an unequivocal mandate from the electorate to reduce the tax burden.</P>
    <P>There has been much argument on whether cutting tax rates or increasing bands and allowances is the better approach.  Our view is that there is much to be said for combining elements of both &mdash; that it is not an argument that falls down on one side or the other &mdash; recognising that it is not possible to do everything simultaneously. Members will note that we have increased the personal tax-free allowance by the same amount as our immediate predecessors in their budget of January last, that is £250 for a single person and £500 for a married couple, an increase of 8.6 per cent.  Moreover, unlike the January budget, we have increased the PRSI threshold by £20 to £100.  Some people missed that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about Members of the House but those outside who appear to miss its significance for the lower paid. It will cost £38 million and any of the relevant tables will show clearly its beneficial effect for the low paid.  Ironically, our immediate predecessors in Government reduced the PRSI rate by 1 per cent while we have increased the allowance, putting each of us on the opposite side of where we are on taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time since the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, we have reduced each of the income tax rates by 2 per cent.  While adhering to our 20 per cent standard rate goal &mdash; we want to get the standard rate here down to 20 per cent as soon as we possibly can &mdash; we decided it would be better to achieve this by a general across-the-board reduction, together with the preservation of a two-rate system, rather than by establishing a somewhat token introductory rate, as appears to be the intention of the <Col N="293" /> British Labour Party Government at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>There has been some adverse criticism of reductions in the top tax rate.  Since the mid-1980s, in every tax document we have prepared my party has argued that nobody should have to pay more than 50 per cent in combined tax and PRSI deductions to the State.  That is fair and equitable.  While we are some way off that point, we are getting closer.  Even before the good times began, and we started to deal with these issues, our yardstick was that somebody working should not have to pay over 50 per cent.  While that is not terribly generous on the part of the State, I recollect that in previous budgets, which we all tend to forget, for example in 1975, the taxpayer was subjected to a super tax rate of 77 per cent. Only ten years ago, we were abolishing what was the then super tax rate of 65 per cent.  Of course, people forget that, at that time the prevailing rates were 65 per cent, 58 per cent and 35 per cent.  Therefore, it will clearly be seen that we have effected dramatic reductions in those rates along with considerable increases in tax-free allowances, bands and thresholds over that period, allocating moneys for different purposes.</P>
    <P>Whatever tax rate or type of tax we talk about, there is much evidence that high, nominal tax rates are both ineffective and economically inefficient. Western countries have long since abandoned surtax rates of up to 98 per cent, or even the 58 per cent or 65 per cent rate that obtained here because they do not work and, in the final analysis, have proved to be detrimental.  Therefore, it is no accident that those sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing, where we can afford to or where we have to apply a lower rate, are flourishing.  In addition, we should learn from the economic policy failures of post-war Europe. Lowering high tax rates benefits everybody, not just the rich but the economy overall, jobs and employment opportunities.  I want to make one other comment about the rich.  There is always the view taken here on budget day that the rich are perceived as those in receipt of an annual income of £11,000 or £12,000.  First of all, proportionately, people at that level of annual income are poor.  Yet, when one talks to people in receipt of annual incomes of approximately £25,000, they do not perceive themselves as being rich when account is taken of repayments on their mortgages, car, children's education, health expenses and others.  The perception that they are rich is a misguided one.  In fact, Members of this House who earn just under £35,000 feel they are paupers.  Therefore, let us cease to use labels, misguided definitions or be forced into looking at comparative tables.  Of course those on annual incomes of £10,000 are poor and should be out of the tax net.  That is why we resort to PRSI exemptions, the family income supplement, and give them extra incentives in an endeavour to take them out of that net.  In my tenure in office I would like to take them out of the tax net altogether or at least subject them to a rate of 20 per <Col N="294" /> cent only.  That is what we are endeavouring to do but do not let us fool ourselves that the poor are those in receipt of annual incomes of under £12,000 and everybody else above that mark is rich.  That is a hypocritical argument that does not stand up.</P>

      <P>We are part-funding reductions in the top rate of tax by limiting tax breaks, mainly to the benefit of the most wealthy in our society, reducing the net full-year cost by approximately one-third.  For example, the net cost of reducing the 48 per cent income tax rate accounts for a relatively small proportion only of the total cost of the personal tax package.  The ordinary 48 per cent taxpayers, comprising approximately 400,000 people, should not be penalised for the lavish lifestyles of the relatively few.  By placing limits on the availability on the business expansion scheme and capital allowances for a number of purposes, our aim is to have investors pay more tax at a reduced higher rate with less ability to avail of write-offs.  I see nothing contrary to equity in all of that.</P>
      <P>There are few new tax reliefs in this budget with the exception of those for domestic charities, donations to disadvantaged schools and nursing homes, unrestricted capital allowances for hotels in less advantaged counties and an allowance for wind energy.  Another point to be made is that headline rates do matter, particularly at a time when we need to attract skilled Irish people home from abroad to fill well-paid jobs.</P>
      <P>While the highest absolute gains always will be to the better paid, as any recent budget will show, I am quite satisfied that, viewing it as a whole and not selectively, there is equity in this budget and that the needs of the less-well-off and low paid are being well attended to.</P>
      <P>The total of £517 million in a full year available for the reduction of personal taxation far exceeds anything given in the past.  For example, Deputy Quinn's package earlier this year amounted to merely £400 million which, while substantial, compares with £200 million given in 1996.  Therefore, by any standard, the commitment of resources in Partnership 2000 has been fulfilled in full, well ahead of time, with the announcements made in the calendar year in which that programme came into force.</P>
      <P>While not taking any credit for this, if my recollection is correct, Deputy Quinn completed negotiations on Partnership 2000 in or around 20 December 1996.  While we have not quite reached that stage yet, over a three-year programme, this House will have delivered on those commitments, which is the message which should go forth because there are those who believe that politicians make promises and sign up to agreements, but never honour them.</P>

      <P>This is in line with the examination of options under Partnership 2000.  We will carefully consider the analysis both of the tax credit and the basic income proposals, which are currently being examined.  We have not closed our minds to any of those issues, but other commitments in our joint programme are under examination also.

      <P>The indirect tax changes will not adversely affect most people.  If people do not smoke or use leaded or super unleaded petrol, which they should not do, they will escape altogether.  There is a welcome small reduction in vehicle registration tax to help the motorist and the motor industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our ambition is to make Ireland one of the most favourable countries in which to do business. The 4 per cent reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax as well as a reduction of the lower rate will be a real incentive to expand and increase employment.  We would have preferred it if the outgoing Government, in its last weeks of office, had not effectively pre-empted the decision on the level of the new standard rate at or close to the lower rate but, having made that decision public, the incoming Government was <Col N="296" /> left with little room for manoeuvre.  Adjustments to the corporate tax regime will reduce the overall net cost of the reduction which will be mainly of benefit to the large service sector where most new jobs are created.</P>
    <P>On the question of the £50,000 raised by Deputy Quinn, we did exactly what the Deputy said we did not do.  We reduced the rate for small businesses from 28 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>The reality is that only 20 per cent of the total number of companies trading in the State have taxable profits in excess of £50,000, and 94 per cent of small businesses are in that category.  Reducing the rate from 28 per cent to 25 per cent was of direct benefit to almost every small business.  If we had moved the figure to £100,000, as suggested by the Deputy, it would be of no benefit to 94 per cent of those businesses.</P>

The two criticisms they have made are that the budget will overheat the economy and that it is directed towards the rich.  The elimination of general Government borrowing and tighter control of expenditure is an antidote towards overheating.</P>
      <P>I will refer to the real rich, the people who earn £200,000 and £300,000 on the back of the PAYE system.  If one examines what the Minister did yesterday in limiting capital allowances, and the way he ringfenced that, the way people were progressively able to invest money in Temple Bar, film projects eligible for tax relief, urban renewal areas and other tax driven schemes, it meant that a person with an income of £250,000 or £300,000 could get away without paying any tax.  Under this arrangement they will be substantially hit. They will still have benefits of up to £25,000 and will get rental income if they purchase an apartment or a house.  However, they will not be able to take their large salaries, spirit them away and not pay anything in respect of equity.  The Minister for Finance has ensured that.</P>

      <P>The reduction in personal taxation will moderate pay demands and help to keep employment high.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about the budget primarily as it affects agriculture, but I will make a few broad comments on it, particularly as I had the privilege of serving with Deputy Quinn in the Department of Finance.  We should claim some credit that we handed over a set of books the like of which no Government has ever inherited. Given that, it is reasonable we should constructively criticise the steps taken by the Government to avail of the opportunities presented by what it inherited from the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be churlish of people not to welcome many of the excellent features of the budget.  On the taxation side, the overall package is one that will bring satisfaction to many people and I do not want to take from that.  We lost the argument about rates versus bands, but I find it difficult to comprehend that a person who will pay tax at 46 per cent does not realise how much better off he or she would be if there was a greater concentration on widening the bands.  That would give a benefit of 22 per cent and not 2 per cent.  Our strategy in Government, which we presented to the people, and would use if we were in Government now, would be to place greater emphasis on <Col N="300" /> personal allowances, to widen the tax bands and to reduce rates including the top rate.  However, the Government has made a decision on this and it is for the people to judge it.</P>
    <P>Another serious concern I have about the budget is the way in which the Government dealt with public expenditure.  It is continuing to delude itself and the nation that it is sticking rigidly to a 4 per cent increase, but that depends on what that 4 per cent is applied to.  Our view would be that taking the outturn for 1997 without adding in the money brought forward out of 1998 and without including the rate support grant which does not arise in 1998, there would be a much lower base on which to apply the 4 per cent.  However, by what has been described as different ways of playing around with the figures, the Minister has managed to create the impression that he is sticking to a 4 per cent increase.  Some, although not many, commentators have seen through that, but there are dangers in that for the future.  The proper addition for a realistic and correct 4 per cent increase would have been slightly more than a £500 million increase in expenditure while the real increase is in excess of £1 billion post-budget. That is a significant difference.  While most Governments try to present their figures in the best possible light to suit themselves, this year's shenanigans with public expenditure has gone further than ever before and we are stacking up some difficulties for the future by dealing with public expenditure in that manner.</P>
    <P>If the hoped for reductions in interest rates arise from our entry into EMU, it is projected that over the next 12 months or so interest rates will fall by 2 per cent.  That may not happen, but the likelihood is that it will.  The combination of reducing interest rates, rapidly increasing public expenditure and giving a good deal in tax cuts, which nobody denies were due, will result in increased pressure and will tend to overheat the economy.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, might well finish up like Nigel Lawson by producing an attractive tax reducing budget, but the Minister's approach is dangerous because he has resisted the temptation to keep public expenditure tight.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate on the budget as it affects the agricultural community.  The Taoiseach stated this is a good budget for the farming community. He talked about providing an increase of £23 million for headage payments, but that is not the truth.  For reasons I do not understand, the Minister for Agriculture and Food seems to have been unsuccessful in convincing the Minister for Finance about the treatment of his Estimate. Although I was broadly critical of the excesses of this year's Estimates, it was extraordinary that, in such a climate, the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Food dropped by about £22 million in real terms, that is, taking last year's base and adding 2 per cent for inflation.  There were significant cuts, including a cut of £34 million in real terms in headage, £30 million on farm investment &mdash; the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes, in particular &mdash; £5 <Col N="301" /> million in structural improvements &mdash; installation aid for young farmers &mdash; and £5 million in the TB and brucellosis eradications schemes.  Some people may not know we are on the brink of losing our brucellosis free status so it is a strange time to cut back expenditure in this area.  Those cuts totalled about £75 million in real terms in 1998 as against 1997.  There were some increases but cuts under these specific headings seem especially inappropriate in the present climate.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said he put back £23 million into headage.  He did not, however, read out the postscript which said that £13 million of the £23 million will have to be found from other savings in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In fact, he gave back an extra £10 million and nobody has explained where the £13 million in savings will be found, although the Minister may do so in his speech next week.  When those savings are found, will the £23 million be sufficient to fund the vital headage scheme for next year?  To a large extent, we are speaking about the less well off sectors of the farming community who depend so much on headage.  There are dangers ahead and for the Minister to say he gave back £23 million without mentioning that £13 million of it had to be found from savings in the Department was a bit of a sleight of hand.</P>
    <P>The failure to provide funding for the reintroduction of the control of farmyard pollution and the dairy hygiene schemes both of which, to a large extent, are mandatory on farmers at a time when farm incomes are dropping <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the community and in real terms, was an unfortunate failure by the Minister, perhaps more on Estimate day than on budget day.  In some respects, the budget dealt with installation aid for young farmers and £3.5 million was provided for that purpose.  It was, however, stated emphatically that it was to deal with applications in the pipeline without any commitment to the maintenance of the scheme after 1998.  Young farmers are particularly cynical about this Government because of this issue which is small in relative terms.</P>
    <P>During the general election last June Macra na Feirme wrote to parties and asked them a specific question about installation aid.  The main Government party, Fianna Fáil, replied in writing and stated unequivocally that not only would it maintain this scheme, but it would improve it. However, by 7 August it had eliminated the scheme.  It is now half-heartedly reinstating it to deal with applications already in the pipeline.  I spoke to young farmers last night and there is grave cynicism and disappointment about this. When one looks at overall budget figures, the mean way in which this issue was tackled by the Government is surprising and uncharacteristic of a party which has its ear to the ground in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the control of farmyard pollution scheme, there is a tax measure in the capital allowances area which will help a little.  Most farmers with <Col N="302" /> small and medium sized farms, who need to invest in the control of farmyard pollution scheme, cannot do so without some financial assistance from the State.  A totally inadequate response was given in the agriculture Estimate to the request for funding to encourage this valuable scheme.  The same is true of the dairy hygiene scheme which is mandatory on dairy farmers. Small dairy farmers cannot afford to undertake this scheme themselves.  Small producers are living on the edge with falling incomes.  The 1996 Teagasc survey on farm incomes indicated that 63 per cent of all farmers earn less than £10,000 per annum.  People living in cities, who are generally critical of farmers and farm leaders who they believe constantly bellyache about issues do not appreciate the low incomes farmers earn.  Offering capital allowances to small farmers, who are not in the tax net because of low incomes, will not allow them to invest in the control of farmyard pollution scheme, which they need to do.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of stock relief for young farmers from two to four years.  I was disappointed by the response to the widespread demand from rural Ireland for some form of a rural renewal incentive scheme.  I know from my time in the Department of Finance that such schemes are extremely difficult to design in a way which will target them at those who need them. Many schemes, including the urban renewal scheme, have been seized upon by smart accountants and have been abused.  I welcome some of the steps taken on BES and capital allowances to redress that.  However, we should not be discouraged from considering a scheme which would encourage investment in rural communities because there is no doubt that in the coming decade Irish and European farming will face the greatest threat to its existence.  There is considerable pressure not so much from Brussels but from the World Trade Organisation in Geneva to force European farming into a market price related situation with minimum and temporary supports from the EU.  That is a matter for another day, although we debated it last week.</P>
    <P>In such a climate and if we are serious about redressing the flight from the land which is causing chaos in our cities in terms of traffic and so on and protecting small to medium sized farm families, we will have to look at innovative ways outside mainline agriculture to encourage investment and job creation in rural areas because farmers will only survive as part-time farmers and will look for alternative work.  A type of rural renewal scheme, rather than the lip-service paid in the budget to designing a pilot scheme in the upper reaches of the Shannon, will be required. One possible measure could be the renewal scheme embracing the idea of advanced factories in specified rural towns providing alternative jobs, part-time or wholetime, for farm families, although I can see the difficulty in ringfencing it to ensure it is not abused as some of these schemes have been in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="303" /> As far as farming is concerned, the budget attempted to redress the deficiencies of the Estimates in a minimal way.  I referred earlier to cuts in the Estimates of about £75 million in real terms.  Yesterday, the Minister gave back £13.5 million, £10 million in headage payments and £3.5 million in installation aid, having accepted cuts in real terms of £75 million in schemes essential to agriculture.  It is not true, as the Taoiseach said, that the farming community has done well out of this budget.</P>
    <P>There are other interrelated difficulties facing agriculture.  The Minister must do more than he proposed for grain farmers who have suffered serious losses in the south and south east.  The Minister, having raised many expectations, devised a £1.2 million package which excluded all tillage farmers who managed to salvage or harvest any of their crops and confined it only to those who could not harvest anything.  Many farmers believed that if they did not make an attempt to harvest what in some cases were partially unharvestable crops, they would not qualify. Having done that, they are now disqualified.  That is unfair and unreasonable.  The Minister also attached a set of conditions at the eleventh hour stating that any other on or off farm income of any significance disqualifies farmers.  The combination of both these factors has excluded the vast majority of farmers who suffered catastrophic losses as a result of weather in August, the likes of which none of us in the south can remember having seen before.  Rain and high winds throughout the month wrecked tillage crops, especially the grain crops, in south Cork, south Waterford and Wexford.  The Minister's response is inadequate.</P>
    <P>Given the problems in the UK which again highlight the problems of beef producers, the Government's failure to make any worthwhile progress on the export of live cattle, especially to the Middle East, has been extremely disappointing. It was an issue the current Administration made much of during the election.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach gave a clear signal to farmers in letters they issued and in interviews that they would raise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government and its Leader gave clear indications that they would be on air-planes, that they would send faxes and that they would go to every capital in the Middle East to reopen this trade, as they believed it was essential for the maintenance of a competitive beef market in terms of giving producers an alternative market <Col N="304" /> in which to sell their product.  To date, their efforts and results have been inadequate and the Middle East market is still shut.  Given what is happening at the moment in the UK, the Government may well rue that it was not more energetic in this area.</P>
      <P>The issue of beef quality assurance, which is also related to what is happening in the UK, is one about which we have been speaking for too long.  It cannot and will not happen until the computerised cattle movement monitoring system is in place.  It is a tracking system without which this famous traceability back to the farm from where the cow came cannot be achieved.  The system is not mysterious; it exists in Northern Ireland. However, for some reason which escapes me, it has defied the bureaucracy in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It is something which the Minister needs to force his Department to put in place so the beef quality assurance scheme supported by traceability back to the farm can be delivered to every marketplace in the world, thus ending any speculation about quality.  We know we have the best quality beef but we have not always been able to sell that concept, especially in terms of the prices achieved on overseas markets.</P>
      <P>I am glad the two issues which arose suddenly in the UK were discussed on the Order of Business by the party leaders.  The blockade of UK ports by Welsh and Scottish farmers is a pernicious development for a small island country which exports a huge percentage of its products. It is a follow on from what happened in France and it is now being used as an instrument of protest by groups of people over whom we have no control and who seem to be out of control in their jurisdiction.  The activities at the British ports are outrageous.  That the British police stand back and facilitate unruly protesters to examine the contents of Irish trucks and decide arbitrarily whether they will let it through is at variance with the rule of law, with all the principles of the Common Market and with the free movement of goods.  The British have been one of the foremost advocates of free trade and constantly call for the breaking down of barriers and the opening up of markets.  With honeyed words from their Minister for Agriculture and their Prime Minister, they have given tacit approval to what is going on.  An unruly mob of unrepresentative farmers is being allowed to act as customs inspectors and to decide what will be let in and out of the UK.  Worse still, they decide what will pass through the UK to Europe.  The situation has now escalated not only to an increasing number of ports but to an increasing number of Irish products.  It is no longer confined to beef as all refrigerated Irish foodstuffs are now at risk, butter, cheese, poultry or pig meat.  Furthermore, products destined for Europe which are transported through the UK are also prevented from entering.  That is intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food is going to London today to discuss this issue and I wish him well.  He has our support in whatever <Col N="305" /> measures he takes to end this.  However, it is the UK authorities who must put an end to it.  I understand the Taoiseach will contact Prime Minister Blair as will my leader.  We must use everything, including the European Union, to end this anarchy.  If it is not ended, it will do untold damage not only to the price of beef and other products but also to the confidence of our customers in the UK and Europe at a critical time of the year for the food industry, coming up to Christmas.  If we do not insist that the British put an end to this quickly, untold damage will be done.  The Minister and the Government must also be extremely active in the area of compensation for producers as it is not good enough to let exporters carry that burden on their own.  The Government is conscious of this, but a unified message will go out from the House and I hope I have aided that.</P>
    <P>There was a further development yesterday on the sale of beef on the bone.  Anything which affects beef exports adversely is to be deplored. On the other hand, we must be conscious of the primacy of the consumer and if there is a scientific basis for this ban, we must be aware of it and take the necessary steps but serious doubt has already been cast on the basis for it.  Will the Government &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will also deal with that issue in London today &mdash; obtain the evidence, have it examined here independently by scientific people who do not have a vested interest, and make a statement on it quickly?</P>
    <P>The trouble is that if the consumer believes there may conceivably be a problem the damage is done.  Sales of beef on the bone in the UK are probably so seriously damaged that anything one does about it will not redress it.  Fortunately, beef on the bone sales of Irish products in the UK amount to slightly more than 5 per cent of exports.  I hope that will not be terminally damaging but it has come at a time when confidence in beef and its sales has been rising steadily and the incidence of BSE has been dramatically falling. The worst months for BSE are October, November and December and the figures to which the Taoiseach referred for November are especially heartening at a time when one might have expected them to increase.  With the beginning of a restoration of confidence in beef, it is unfortunate this should have happened but we can recover from it.</P>
    <P>Last week, Teagasc published a survey on farm incomes in 1996.  I do not know whether the 1997 position is worse but I am sure it is.  The fact that 63 per cent of farmers live on incomes of less than £10,000 is a shocking indictment of the state of agriculture.  It is not an indictment of any Government but there is no doubt there are three broad categories of farmer.  There are big commercial farmers who are efficient by international standards and with reasonable support they will continue and grow.  There is a middle group of farmers who are under threat and there are small farmers who are on the edge.  It will be very <Col N="306" /> important in future budgets and policy formation that support will be directed to maximising the number of people on the land.  It is a big subject but one about which we must be vigilant.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread view in the rest of the community that farmers are getting millions, creaming off everything and not paying taxes.  That is patently untrue and it is up to farm leaders and politicians to get that message across because there needs to be greater support for agriculture from non-agricultural sources if the industry is to be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo Deputy Coveney's remarks in regard to the sudden death of a relative of the Minister for Finance.  It has been a difficult day for him in that respect and I thank the Deputy for his remarks which will be appreciated.</P>
      <P>The social, community and family affairs budget which the Government has brought before the House is a radical one.  It is one of the most substantial social affairs budgets ever presented.  At a time of unprecedented economic growth, there is a grave onus on Government to ensure this prosperity is shared and that those who are less well off are afforded every opportunity to participate in the workplace.  This first budget is a substantial response by the Government to the challenges that face society.  One of the key objectives of the Government is a commitment to fight social exclusion, tooth and nail and this is no mere rhetoric.  This budget is putting it into action.</P>
      <P>It must be set firmly in the context of the broader agenda, the fact that Ireland is at a moment of historical importance in its development. The advent of the Celtic tiger, the achievement of peace in Northern Ireland, the initiation of all-party talks, and moves towards closer European integration are just some of the key developments which are currently reshaping Ireland. The economic outlook is extremely favourable with projected economic growth of 7 per cent of GNP in 1998 and nearly 5.5 per cent in 1999 and 2000.  Employment is projected to grow by 120,000 over the next three years while inflation is expected to remain at 2 per cent per annum.  It is vital that this opportunity is seized to redefine society in a way which makes it more inclusive and which shares the benefits of growth among all our citizens.</P>
      <P>The budgetary process must play a key role in that redefinition of society.  The budget delivers on the commitments made in An Action Programme for the New Millennium.  It provides the clearest evidence of its determination to ensure current record levels of economic growth are sustained; the economy is managed in a responsible and prudent manner in the interest of all citizens; the benefits of economic growth and social solidarity are maximised, and problems of social exclusion and marginalisation are tackled effectively at source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> The national anti-poverty strategy framework put in place by the Government, and, in particular, by my Department, will ensure key objectives on social inclusion are delivered across all Departments and public bodies.  In this, the first budget to be prepared by the Government, we will set out the first steps of the redefinition I referred to earlier &mdash; to highlight the priority areas for future development of our system of social, community and family support as we move into the new millennium.  Unlike Deputy de Rossa who spoke endlessly about the need for a strategic approach and yet chopped and changed from one year to the next, I will provide a coherent and focused approach to welfare reform.</P>
    <P>In the 1980s and early 1990s we were faced with particular economic difficulties, including very high unemployment, to which the social welfare system had to respond.  That situation has now changed dramatically and thanks to the macroeconomic benefits of social partnership and prudent financial management of the economy, Ireland is going through a period of intense economic and employment growth.  Live register unemployment has dropped to levels unknown since 1990.</P>
    <P>At the same time we are faced by new priorities. The number of older people is growing and will continue to increase significantly in coming years.  The needs of people with disabilities and carers are achieving the recognition which they deserve.  Furthermore, the addition of new responsibilities in regard to the community and family has raised new challenges for my Department.</P>
    <P>In formulating the social, community and family affairs budget package, we have, drawing on the key objectives set out in the An Action Programme for the New Millennium, responded to these priorities by identifying five key themes which are securing the future for our older people; improving the real value of social welfare payments; supporting people with disabilities and carers; investing in employability and developing family and community supports.  In formulating the detailed measures set out in the budget, we have drawn not only on An Action Programme for the New Millennium, but on the election documents of both parties in Government and the guidance of colleagues in this House and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The social, community and family affairs improvements in this budget package deliver on these key objectives.  Costing an additional £125 million in 1998 and £225 million in a full year, this package represents a substantial first step in implementing our action programme.  It also delivers on key commitments made in Partnership 2000.  Above all, it reflects our belief that there is a need for a multifaceted approach to social welfare reform, an approach which will provide a secure income for those who rely on social welfare for some or all of their income, a real improvement in the position of our elderly <Col N="308" /> citizens, real incentives to the unemployed to take up education, training and work opportunities, and which will support people and communities in their efforts to improve the quality of their lives.</P>
    <P>One of the true marks of a progressive society is the regard in which its older citizens are held. As a nation we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the elderly.  They have helped build the modern Ireland of today.  They have ensured that their sons and daughters were afforded the best in life, often by making great sacrifices themselves. Older people should know that their country holds them in the highest esteem and that their contribution to the building of this nation is never taken for granted.  However, research carried out by the ESRI and funded by my Department has shown that the relative position of older people has declined in recent years.</P>
    <P>In response to this, the Action Programme for the New Millennium provides that contributory old age pensions will be increased to £100 over a five year period.  In recognition of the fact that our older people have helped to build up the country into what it is today, we have decided to go beyond what is strictly required by that commitment in the first year and to give a special catch-up increase of £5 per week in the maximum personal rates of payments for pensioners aged 66 and over, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for people on reduced rate contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>This increase will apply not only to people receiving contributory and non-contributory old age pensions and retirement pensions, but also to other people over 66 such as those in receipt of widow's and widower's pensions, blind person's pension, carer's allowance and a number of other payments and to people over 65 in receipt of invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>In percentage terms, the £5 rise represents increases ranging between 6.4 per cent and 7.4 per cent.  With an expected inflation rate of 2 per cent for 1998, the new payments represents real increases of between 4.3 per cent and 5.3 per cent for those receiving £5 per week.  For example, a couple both of whom are entitled to get an old age contributory pension in their own right will now receive £166 per week &mdash; an increase of £10 per week.  A couple, one of whom is entitled to a retirement pension with an increase in respect of a qualified adult over the age of 66, will receive £139.90 per week &mdash; an increase of £6.50 per week.</P>
    <P>The real increases this year of between 4.3 and 5.3 per cent compare to the situation under the so-called rainbow Government of no real increase in 1995 &mdash; remember Deputy De Rossa's miserly 2.5 per cent increase at a time when inflation was 2.5 per cent, a real increase of 0.7 per cent in 1996 and only 2.5 per cent in the so-called election budget of 1997.  Even the Deputies opposite must admit that this is the best real increase for pensioners in a long time and delivers, in one fell swoop, a higher percentage increase than Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic <Col N="309" /> Left provided over the lifetime of their Government. This increase will benefit some 324,000 claimants, about 36 per cent of all social welfare claimants.  It will mean that social welfare payments to older people will be above the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that the budget this year comes earlier in the year, we have decided to bring social welfare increases into effect from the first week in June 1998, providing an additional two weeks increase in 1998 compared to this year.  I am pleased that increases in all weekly social welfare payments will be brought forward to the first week in June 1998.</P>
    <P>In addition to the rates increase for older people, I am also introducing an important improvement to the free travel scheme.  With effect from October, 1998, the free travel companion pass will be extended to cover all pensioners, aged 75 and over, who are unable to travel alone.  This measure will address one of the features of the free travel scheme which has been the subject of some criticism, that is, where a person who is entitled to the free travel pass is unable to avail of it because he or she cannot use public transport without the assistance of another person.  The free travel companion pass will enable someone to accompany the pass holder at no additional cost.  It is estimated that as many as 17,000 people will benefit from this measure.</P>
    <P>Revised capital assessment provisions which improve the position of the vast majority of pensioners affected will be extended from June 1998 to include the rent allowance which covers former controlled tenancies.</P>
    <P>In the means test for the widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, I am introducing provisions with effect from April 1998 to exempt rental income from the assessment of means where the income is in respect of a person who lives with and pays rent to the pensioner.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the extremely beneficial tax changes announced yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in relation to the elderly, these measures, and in particular the £5 increase, enormously improve the position of pensioners.</P>
    <P>Partnership 2000 guarantees that the real income position of those dependent on social welfare will be protected and enhanced and that the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare will be implemented before the end of the Partnership 2000 in 1999.  In this budget I am delighted that we are able to provide a general increase of £3 for all those claimants not already benefiting from the higher increases for older people, with <i>pro rata</i> increases for people on reduced rate contributory payments, together with a 3 per cent increase, in general, in the rates of qualified adult allowance.  This increase will be paid from the first week in June 1998.  The £3 increase means that payments will rise by between 4.2 and 4.6 per cent, that is, a full 2.2 to 2.5 percentage points above expected <Col N="310" /> inflation in 1998.  Apart from the 324,000 people who will gain from the £5 increase, a further 566,000 people will benefit from this £3 rise.</P>
    <P>As a result of these substantial increases, the two lowest payment rates &mdash; short-term unemployment assistance and the supplementary welfare allowance involving 57,000 people &mdash; will now have risen from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  All other social welfare payment rates will have exceeded the CSW rate.</P>
    <P>Among those currently on rates of payment below the Commission's recommended rate, £70.10 in 1998 terms, and who will move over that rate as a result of this budget are recipients of the old age non-contributory pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory pension, one parent family payment, deserted wife's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance, blind person's pension, disability allowance, injury benefit, disability benefit and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the scale of these changes, the House will be interested to learn that 93 per cent of people who rely on social welfare payments will now receive more than the CSW recommended rate.  Unlike the previous Government which talked a lot about it but did not match rhetoric with performance, this Government, in its first budget, has more than achieved the recommended CSW rates for the vast majority of those who rely on social welfare payments.  The full cost of these increases will amount to almost £108 million in 1998 and £181 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that this budget was being presented by a Government which is delivering on its commitments.  The increases in rates represent real and tangible progress towards meeting the commitment we made in our action programme to provide substantial social welfare increases, as well as the commitment contained in Partnership 2000 to reach the minimum rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare over the lifetime of the partnership.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the action programme to implement the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, I am delighted to announce that we are meeting one of the key recommendations of the commission in my area by bringing all disability payments to over 100 per cent of the minimum rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. The general £3 increase will bring the current lowest disability payments &mdash; disability allowance and blind person's pension &mdash; to £70.50 per week, which is over the commission's recommended rate.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has highlighted the importance of independence for people with disabilities.  I have already announced a package of £5 million which will help people with disabilities to live independent lives.  In order to facilitate people with disabilities in taking up rehabilitative work, I am announcing a significant increase in the amount which people in receipt of disability allowance <Col N="311" /> and blind person's pension can earn without affecting their payment, from the existing £36.30 up to £50 per week.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that incentives to take up employment should be available to people on disability payments.  I am committed to ensuring that this recommendation is implemented by providing access to the back-to-work scheme operated by my Department and measures such as the income disregard announced today.  I will look at this issue in the coming months to see what further measures can be implemented to support people with disabilities in gaining access to employment.</P>
    <P>I am also introducing a change in the free scheme rules which will be of benefit to invalidity pensioners and recipients of disability allowance and blind person's pension.  In future, people who transfer from one of these payments to another social welfare pension, for example, the widow's contributory pension, will be allowed to retain their existing entitlement to the free schemes. This change recognises that, in the great majority of cases, such people will continue to be disabled and they should not lose out on transferring to a different type of pension payment.</P>
    <P>Carers play a crucial and often invisible role in communities.  Many of them feel isolated as they go about their work, while some may feel a lack of appreciation.  Governments should care for the carers and acknowledge the value of their contribution in a practical manner.  The action programme provides that the value of the carer's allowance will be increased in real terms.  As announced, this year we are increasing the allowance for carers over the age of 66 by £5 per week, with a £3 increase for carers under 66 years.</P>
    <P>We are also providing, with effect from October 1998, that all recipients of a carer's allowance will be entitled to a free travel pass in their own right.  At present, a carer can only travel for free when accompanying the person for whom they are caring.  This measure will provide them with a degree of independence and will facilitate them in getting out and about and keeping in contact with family and friends.  I am also introducing provisions which, in the case of the carer's allowance, will allow for the disregard of non-national disability pensions up to the level of the maximum rate of old age contributory pension.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance is currently under review in my Department.  This review is considering the purpose and development of the scheme and its future potential both in terms of its operation and in the wider context of care provision in the home generally.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provisions for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  In the light of that review, I will bring forward a range of measures in next year's budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> I want to refer to employment support and the measures being introduced in the budget.  Unemployment is falling, while strong economic growth is leading to massive job growth.  This is in stark contrast to the position a few years ago when we were faced with a stagnant job pool and high levels of unemployment.  Unemployed people often found themselves in a hopeless cul-de-sac.  Fortunately, the position has changed dramatically for the better and we must refocus our policies radically in order to get the best from the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>This refocusing is being undertaken against the background of a sustained reduction in the numbers signing on the live register.  It is worth pointing out that the live register includes people who are working part-time and others who are signing for credited insurance contributions.  The downward trend in unemployment is forecast to continue. The latest analysis produced by FÁS and the ESRI suggests that job creation will continue to increase in the coming years.  It is notable that the most rapid growth is predicted to be in the high skill occupations which require third level qualifications.  It is also predicted that there will be high growth in sectors which require second level education and vocational training.  It is crucial that the dramatic changes in the nature of the unemployment problem are mirrored by a radical change in our unemployment and social welfare policies.  I am determined to ensure that my Department will be to the forefront in achieving that radical change.  In line with EU guidelines, we must move from paying income support as a response to unemployment to investing in employability so that the unemployed can share in the benefits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>The measures adopted in the budget reflect this changing approach.  While the financial position of the unemployed has been improved substantially by the general £3 rate increase, we are targeting additional expenditure at those areas which will help to develop people's skills and support them in making the transition to work.</P>
    <P>We are implementing the commitment in Partnership 2000 to calculate family income supplement on a net income basis.  FIS is designed to ensure that we give unemployed people an incentive to take up work and employees an incentive to stay in work by providing an income supplement to low income families in employment. FIS currently supports the income of some 12,000 workers with families.</P>
    <P>A drawback of the scheme was that entitlement was calculated on the basis of gross income and as such failed to take account of the effect of taxation on income.  This meant that a FIS recipient's disposable income could be reduced as a result of entering the tax net because the person could also experience a decrease in the amount of FIS paid. Partnership 2000 contained a commitment to change the calculation of FIS from its present gross income basis to a net income basis and I am pleased that we are meeting that commitment in the budget.  This move, which will take effect from next October, will strengthen the link <Col N="313" /> between FIS and employment while overcoming the poverty trap associated with the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>In examining the cost of this change, we were able to use more up-to-date data than was previously available.  It was found that the cost was lower than previous estimates had indicated. Those estimates were based on 1987 survey data, updated to current terms.  More recent data, based on the ESRI 1994 &ldquo;Living in Ireland&rdquo; survey, which was partly funded by my Department, has now become available.  The estimates based on this data indicate that the cost is now considerably lower.  The full year cost of the FIS changes in the budget is approximately £10 million.</P>
    <P>We are also increasing the weekly income thresholds for FIS by £7 at each point with effect from June 1998.  This will have the effect of making existing FIS recipients some £4 better off each week.  These measures will significantly increase the level of FIS payable and the rewards from taking up employment.  The combined effect of FIS, the back to work allowance scheme and the special tax allowances for the long-term unemployed announced yesterday by the Minister for Finance will ensure that people are always better off at work than on welfare.</P>
    <P>We are also providing an extra 5,000 places on the back-to-work scheme, an additional year's payment for self-employed people on this scheme, bringing it to four years in total, and a new back to education programme.  I recently launched independent evaluations of the back to work allowance and the area based allowance enterprise schemes.  The main thrust of the evaluation shows that these schemes have been very successful in motivating unemployed people to get back to work.  They have been particularly successful in motivating so-called &ldquo;discouraged&rdquo; workers to get back into the labour force by providing them with a link into employment.  The Pacsort company in Dundalk in my constituency is an excellent example of the contribution these schemes can make in getting long-term unemployed people back to work.</P>
    <P>The forecasts of survival rates look promising and already there are thousands of success stories involving people who were previously long-term unemployed and who were encouraged to start a business with the support of these schemes.  Many of these entrepreneurs are now employing people and the benefits of these initiatives are reaching beyond their targeted sectors.  As a result of these evaluations, we are providing for those who are long-term unemployed a further 5,000 places on the back to work allowance scheme from January 1998, bringing the total number of places up to 27,000.</P>
    <P>We are also integrating the area based allowance more fully into this scheme.  Up to now the area based allowance, which is equivalent to a full unemployment payment for the first year, has been available to those taking up self-employment only in areas covered by the area partnerships. The operation of the area based allowance <Col N="314" /> in certain areas has, however, led to the creation of a two-tier system of financial support for those long-term unemployed who take up self-employment opportunities.  To counter this, I am in effect introducing a four year back to work allowance in all remaining areas for unemployed people who take up self-employment.  This will provide transitional support amounting to 100 per cent, 75 per cent, 50 per cent and 25 per cent of their unemployment payments over the four years. This measure will encourage a greater number of long-term unemployed people to seek to establish their own businesses.</P>
    <P>There is a need for much greater emphasis on developing the skills and qualifications of people out of work.  I have decided to bring together the existing second chance education schemes operated under my Department as part of a single back to education programme embracing both second and third level.  The existing book allowance of £100 is being increased to become a cost of education allowance of £150 per year.  I am delighted to announce that, for the first time, students with disabilities in receipt of disability allowance and blind person's pension will be able to qualify for the scheme.  I will be making a further announcement in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>In 1992, only 1 per cent of the Department's budget on unemployment was spent on active measures to get people back to work and support employment.  By 1997 this proportion had risen to 12 per cent and, as a result of the measures we have introduced in this budget, that proportion will increase to 15 per cent in 1998.  I aim to achieve a target of 20 per cent by 1999.</P>
    <P>A further way in which people can be encouraged to get back to work is through increasing their take-home pay.  One of the objectives of the Government's action programme is the reduction of PRSI, with particular emphasis on the low paid.  The £20 per week increase in the PRSI free allowance, announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance yesterday, benefits more than one million employees.  The measure will be particularly effective in improving the return from work for the nearly 60,000 employees who earn between £80 and £100 per week who will now be exempted from making an employee PRSI contribution.  In addition, the earnings limit for the lower rate of PRSI is being increased to £270 per week.  This extends the application of the lower rate to a further 27,800 employments. Almost two-thirds of all industrial, commercial and service sector employments, a total of more than 725,000 jobs, will now attract PRSI at the lower rate.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered, however, that the incentives arguments in favour of PRSI reductions must be balanced by the equally important objective of preserving the social insurance fund.  Social insurance plays a key role in the provision of social protection in society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the social insurance fund according <Col N="315" /> to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered.  These contributions will amount to approximately £1.92 billion in 1997, they fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and pay benefits to persons who are not working because of unemployment or illness.  Social insurance contributory pensions and other benefits are paid to more than 414,000 people and this number will increase as the age profile of the population grows.  The implications of this increase have been highlighted in the actuarial review which I published recently and will be considered further in the light of the report of the national pensions policy which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>The social insurance system represents a long-term contract between employers, employees, the self-employed and the Government.  It achieves solidarity between generations by funding the payment of contributory pensions to an earlier generation of contributors and between those at work and those currently not at work.  It is vital, therefore, that the social insurance fund is protected in the future so that it can meet its short and long-term commitments.</P>
    <P>All the pro-employment measures I have described, in conjunction with the substantial beneficial tax changes announced yesterday by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will provide a real incentive to unemployed people to avail of work opportunities, and effectively nail the myth that people can be better off on welfare.</P>
    <P>In the area of family supports, there is general agreement that child benefit provides the best form of child income support.  Child benefit provides support directly to the carers of children and, unlike other forms of child support, such as child dependant increases, it does not act as a disincentive to take up employment.  There is widespread agreement that child income support policy should focus on improving child benefit and this will be the approach which I will take in this and coming years.  In this year's budget I am introducing a range of measures to improve child benefit.</P>
    <P>Across the board increases of child benefit are, however, very expensive but proposals by various commentators to target increases, for example, by making child benefit taxable, have their own difficulties. There is, however, another way to target child benefit.  When the payment was introduced by Sean Lemass in the 1940s it was originally provided only to large families on the basis that such families were most affected by poverty.</P>
    <P>Research carried out by the ESRI indicates that this is still true.  For example, a two adult household with one or two children has a risk of poverty of 14 per cent.  In contrast, a two adult household with three children has a risk of poverty of 22 per cent and this rises to 38 per cent for families with four or more children.  Thus, by concentrating increases on the larger families, <Col N="316" /> resources will be better targeted at those most in need.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, as part of a long-term programme to improve child benefit significantly, particularly for larger families, we are providing for increases in child benefit of £1.50 for the first two children and £3 for all subsequent children to bring the monthly rates to £31.50 and £42 respectively.  A family with four children, for example, will now receive monthly payments of £147 or almost £34 per week, an increase of more than £2 per week.</P>
    <P>In line with election commitments, we are providing for a new payment of 150 per cent of the normal child benefit rate for twins.  In other words, where there are twins in a family, each child will receive one and a half times the appropriate rate of child benefit.  An estimated 12,500 sets of twins will benefit from this measure.  We are also increasing the grants payable on the birth of three or more children to bring them into line with the existing arrangements for twins.  This will mean that families with triplets, quadruplets and other multiple births will receive a grant of £500 on birth, at the age of four and at the age of 12. The improvements to child benefit which I have outlined will cost £28.5 million in a full year. Those improvements will take effect from September and will mean that more than 500,000 families and more than one million children will benefit.  Taken with the significant improvements to the family income supplement scheme, the position of families with low incomes will be particularly enhanced.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that we are giving less money by way of child benefit than the outgoing Government proposed in its so-called election budget, but the figures speak for themselves.  The rainbow Government proposed an increase in child benefit totalling £8.33 million in the budget year and £25 million in a full year.  Taking normal rates of child benefit and rates for twins, we are giving in this budget £9.46 million, nearly £1.2 million more in the budget year and £28.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Under this Government, the remit of my Department has been substantially increased.  In this context, my Department has been assigned additional responsibilities which it will shortly take over.  In line with the commitments set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium and informed by an interim communication from the Commission on the Family, I am pleased we have been able to make provisions in respect of a number of important new pro-family measures.  In particular, I am moving to establish a national mediation service as provided for in the action programme through the provision of very significant additional funding to the Family Mediation Service in 1998.</P>
    <P>We are also providing for a range of additional measures including the establishment of 25 new community and family centres; increased support for marriage and child counselling; the establishment of a family affairs unit in my Department and pilot programmes on parenting and family <Col N="317" /> services.  I will announce further details on these items in the near future.</P>
    <P>Communities provide an essential support to the fabric of our society, a support which enriches and enhances all our lives and without which public services could not succeed.  I am determined to ensure that community and voluntary organisations can grow and develop in a supportive and enabling environment.  In 1998, I will bring forward a White Paper on the Community and Voluntary Sector.  In addition, I will establish a community trust to bring business funding and know-how to support community development; in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000, I am providing additional funding to the Community Development Programme; I will establish a new community and family fund with additional funding for voluntary organisations.  I am enhancing the capacity of the National Social Services Board to support volunteering and information provision by voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>In this first budget to be introduced by the Government, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver on the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium and in Partnership 2000.  The spending increases provided for my Department's areas of responsibility are well targeted.  The measures we are introducing will have the effect of improving the quality of life of the elderly, improving the living standards of the unemployed and those in low paid employment and enhancing the prospects of securing employment, removing disincentives to employment and increasing the return from work, improving the position of all families, particularly larger families who are at greatest risk of poverty, achieving greater social inclusion and enhancing the role of the community and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>This budget delivers on Partnership 2000 by increasing the real value of social welfare rates, meeting the Commission on Social Welfare recommended rates for the vast majority of people on social welfare, putting family income supplement on a net income basis and extending the community development programme.  It also delivers on the action programme by moving very significantly towards pensions of £100 per week, by improving the real value of the carer's allowance and disability payments and by moving to establish a national mediation service.</P>

      <P>Before commenting on the provisions of the budget I will refer briefly to its background.  It is regrettable that to date Government commentators have not acknowledged the major contribution of the previous Government to the prevailing favourable economic conditions. This is the type of budget any Government would like to be able to introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At least the Deputy is admitting it is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the strongest economic environment in the history of the State.  Sustained <Col N="318" /> growth, record levels in job creation and revenue buoyancy were evident long before the current Government took up office even though it convinced the people that things could have been better.  We now realise the Government is continuing to implement the policies of the previous Government, giving a little here, taking a little there and basically heading in the same economic direction.</P>
      <P>The use of budgets merely to adjust and shift the edges of economic policy is no longer sufficient. That is more or less what this budget set out to do.  A budget must fulfil a strategic function, it must enhance our competitiveness which is at the centre of our capacity to produce and sell on the domestic and world markets.  In turn, our ability to compete will determine living standards, employment levels, tax rates, social welfare benefits and the amount of revenue we can invest in infrastructure.</P>
      <P>As already stated by Deputy Noonan, the Minister should have taken account of two imminent changes in our macroeconomic environment, the advent of EMU and the expected reduction in EU support in the form of Structural Funds and under CAP.  Public finances must be sufficiently robust to accommodate the loss of revenue from reduced EU Structural Funds.  It is worth noting that in 1997 net transfers from the EU are expected to amount to approximately 3.8 per cent of GDP, equivalent to approximately £1.7 billion or almost 10 per cent of Government expenditure.  These changes in the macroeconomic environment require firm control of current expenditure as the single most vital element of a strategy to develop a competitive economy.  The Minister is committed to more than £1 billion of spending above his target, some of which he achieved through creative accounting by bringing forward expenditure to 1997, no doubt blemishing the record of the previous Minister for Finance as well as making commitments to spending in 1998 which will weaken our competitive position when we enter EMU and receive less structural funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan also referred to our infrastructure, particularly our roads structure.  People are becoming increasingly frustrated with the high density of traffic on our roads.  It is affecting investment, particularly in rural areas.  An Italian company considered taking over a business in Listowel that had gone into liquidation, but decided against it because of the length of time it took to travel from Dublin to Listowel, mainly because of the density of traffic on the roads.  This bears out the necessity to invest in infrastructure in a growing economy.  The latest ESRI medium-term review highlights that high growth requires high levels of investment merely to keep pace with the volume of activity.  Higher than anticipated growth since 1994 already suggests that the current tranche of Structural Funds would have been insufficient to match our recent economic performance.  This is a strong argument for tighter control on current expenditure to make resources <Col N="319" /> available for capital expenditure on roads, research, development and information technology.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed the Minister did not refer in more detail to the national debt when he has so much money at his disposal.  The current debt rate of £30 million is more than eight times the 1976 level.  Debt repayments in 1997 are estimated to be approximately £2.5 billion, equivalent to about one-sixth of our tax revenue.  A reduction in debt service costs would have a rat-chet effect, permitting greater tax reform, higher capital expenditure and stronger growth.  Growth would ensure revenue buoyancy to facilitate additional debt reduction.  Our national debt should be examined carefully over the next three budgets.  We have addressed to some extent the issues of personal taxation and corporation tax, but the national debt or the cost of servicing it have not been addressed.  Economies move in curves and if we run into financial difficulties in the future our debt burden could strangle our economy.  The higher our debt the more we will have to pay if international interest rates get out of control again.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made of the concessions in personal taxation.  While I welcome them, they should have been directed more at the lower to middle income tax groups than at the higher income tax groups.  Members of the House stand to benefit more than those on low or middle incomes.  A number of sectors benefited to a greater extent from the tax give in last year's budget.  For example, single people earning £10,000 per annum benefited to the tune of £414 last year, but this year they will benefit to the tune of £223.  People on the average industrial wage of approximately £15,000 benefited to the tune of £432 last year, whereas this year they will benefit to the tune of £410.  When one considers that this will not be paid until next April it will have little effect on the living standards of workers.  It is unfair and inaccurate for the Government to give the impression that working class people have been given a Santa Claus budget.  The Government should not be raising expectations.  The majority of people will be disappointed when they realise how much they have to spend.</P>
    <P>The previous two budgets gave considerable tax breaks to this sector.  For example, a married couple with two children earning £20,000 gained £841 in last year's budget, this year they only gain £487.  Those earning £50,000 will gain over £1,000 this year.  These are selective examples.  We should target concessions at lower and middle income earners who are hardest pressed.</P>
    <P>This budget does not create the tax wedge to which we have referred.  The Minister has not taken the opportunity to provide an incentive to work.  I welcome the reduction in the rates of corporation tax from 36 per cent to 32 per cent and 28 per cent to 25 per cent.  We have to proceed towards a single rate of, approximately, 15 per <Col N="320" /> cent, depending on what we can negotiate in Europe.  However, this budget is a move in the right direction.  A lower standard rate of corporation tax will allow for increased reinvestment in small businesses and provide an important boost to the employment intensive service sector.  In addition to tax incentives, this will give businesses an incentive to employ more people.</P>
    <P>A significant reduction in the rates of corporation tax was needed.  The rates in the UK have been reduced from 33 per cent to 31 per cent, backdated to April.  The rate for small businesses was reduced from 23 per cent to 21 per cent. People doing business in the UK and Ireland state that it is more competitive to pursue their business interests in the UK.  It is more advantageous for them to base their headquarters in the UK because of the social costs and competitiveness of the British economy.  This is why the reduction in our corporation tax rates was important.</P>
    <P>The increase of £5 in social welfare payments may seem a big concession.  The previous Government made no substantial increase in the old age pension.  However, a £5 increase is not adequate. The financial position of pensioners must be looked at carefully.  They are poverty stricken. They are the people who built this country and they deserve better treatment.  This increase is more than they got last year.  However, when one looks at general inflation, the cost of vital necessities, such as fuel, has increased.  Pensioners are less well off than they were five to ten years ago.</P>
    <P>This is the first budget since the Government introduced its national anti-poverty strategy.  The agency suggests that the budget should be audited to ensure that it is consistent with the principles set out in the strategy and that budget proposals should be independently analysed with regard to their income distribution effects.  The Government should accede to this suggestion as it is important to know how budgetary provisions will affect vulnerable sectors of society.</P>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency made a strong case for increasing child benefit by £7.  However, we have an increase of £1.50 per month for the first two children and £3 for subsequent children. Deputy Ahern was selective in his figures.  The rainbow Government increased child benefit by 60 per cent.  This year's increase goes nowhere near that figure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision made for investment in Croke Park.  It is right that the headquarters of the GAA should be of international standard. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance are strong supporters of the GAA and this is reflected in the £20 million contribution.  There is need for additional funding for clubs and pitches throughout the country and the grassroots of the organisation should not be ignored.  It is right that the GAA should have a better stadium than other codes such as soccer and rugby.  I am sure this funding will be appreciated.</P>
    <P>The previous Government was often accused of being anti-farmer by the Opposition.  This <Col N="321" /> Government must go down as the most anti-farmer Government ever.  It has been lethargic as far as our foreign markets are concerned and has cut the contributions to farmers in the Estimates. There is nothing in the budget apart from a small increase in headage grants to suggest that the crisis in farming is being taken seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present year, following an additional allocation which I have provided by way of a Supplementary Estimate, the provision for in-service training is equivalent to approximately 0.7 per cent of the total payroll for first and second level teachers.  This compares to 0.6 per cent in 1996.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Deputy will be aware I have recently announced a major investment in information and communications technology &mdash;&ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo;.  This will include a very substantial training and support element, additional to the present in-service initiatives.  This will bring the total in-service provision in 1998 to approximately 0.8 per cent of payroll.</P>
      <P>I have provided a total of £10.4 million for in-service training for 1998.  This includes £3 million in respect of targeted information technology training.  This total represents a 21 per cent increase over the projected outturn of £8.6 million for 1997 and a 58 per cent increase over the £6.6 million which was allocated for in-service training in the 1997 Estimates.  I consider that these figures represent a substantial increase in the level of funding being provided for in-service training since I became Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>It is important to highlight that a very extensive programme of in-service training is supported by my Department across a wide range of subjects and activities involving large numbers of first and second level teachers every year.</P>
      <P>In 1996, the last full year for which data are available, a total of over 190,000 participant training days were provided at first and second levels. The introduction of all new or revised curricula and programmes is accompanied by appropriate in-service training.  In addition, specialised programmes are provided in a number of areas, including, for example, in-school management, special education and relationships and sexuality education.  An extensive programme of summer courses is also supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> I assure the Deputy that I will be doing everything possible to secure additional funding, as necessary, for in-service training, to ensure that all curricular reform and appropriate professional development programmes for teachers are adequately resourced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not ashamed to tell the House that the provision for in-service training is 0.7 per cent?  Less than 1 per cent of the payroll is devoted to training the teachers who are to resource the next generation of young people.  Is he not ashamed given that he, among other Ministers, never ceases to lecture industry on the need to achieve not 1 per cent but 5 per cent of payroll as the standard amount industry should invest in training its staff to meet the challenges of a modern economy?  Surely it is more important to resource our teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate is 0.8 per cent for 1998, not 0.7 per cent.  The Deputy asked if I am ashamed.  I have been in office for six months.  If anyone should feel ashamed, it is the Deputy and his party, who were in Government for the last three years.  The figures presented to me in July are that Government's figures.  I have increased the amount to 0.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's general point.  In-service training is essential for teachers in the changing world of education.  I am committed to teacher development, and we are providing over £10 million in 1998 for it.  The value for money is very positive in education when compared to industry. The cost is estimated at £38 per person per day for teachers while the estimate is £150 to £200 per person in the private sector.</P>
      <P>Teachers are extremely committed to professional development, which is very important. All Members must acknowledge that without the support of the EU and the community support framework, this area would be at a very low ebb. Under the operational programme for 1994 to 1999, over £40 million will have been provided by the EU for in-service training.  The significant element in the Estimates regarding in-service training is £3 million under a new subhead for &ldquo;Schools IT 2000&rdquo;.  That is Exchequer money that does not come from Europe and is a significant development.</P>
      <P>I am committed to ongoing in-service training for teachers and to meet new needs in changing curricula and programmes.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the Estimates he published recently indicate a cut of 14 per cent in the provision of mainstream in-service training?  That cut has been imposed when it is proposed to radically reform the primary curriculum. Was it an oversight that the Minister <Col N="323" /> failed to indicate targets for beyond 1998, when the core EU funding the Minister mentioned could come under threat?

I reject the approach which holds that in-service training in information and communications technology is marginal to the education process or to the learning environment.  The Deputy referred to 14 per cent; if one removes the £3 million for IT training, it relates to outturn.  I brought in a significant Supplementary Estimate to cover that last week. It dealt with the relationships and sexuality programme area.  We will continue work in that and other areas such as new subjects for leaving certificate and primary level curriculum changes also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending post leaving certificate courses.  This commitment reflects one aspect of the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of maintenance grants for students attending PLC courses involves the <Col N="324" /> development of significant new administrative arrangements.  It is very important to realise that it is not simply a case of replicating arrangements already used for the third-level maintenance grants scheme.  However, it is our intention to introduce grants, which will be at the same level as the third level maintenance grant, as soon as possible for students who are registered on PLC courses as of September 1998.  While the method and timing of these payments may take some time to finalise, they will be made and they will fully meet our commitments.</P>
    <P>A crucial point to realise is that the Government's commitment to the PLC sector includes its determination to ensure that it is properly resourced in general terms.  To this end it has already made a number of important moves.  My Department is providing over £39 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses which play a key role in preparing young people for employment and further education-training. These courses are a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skills needs in the economy and business leaders have identified PLC courses as an important means of meeting this need.</P>
    <P>In the international teleservices area, I have already approved the provision of 690 places in 20 selected centres under which a two year NCVA certified PLC course is provided as part of the national response to emerging skills needs of the industry.  This has been accompanied by an investment of £1.5 million in the selected centres to enable them to provide a quality programme consistent with industrial needs.  As this new initiative involves intensive placement abroad, a new student support scheme is being introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement.  This is an exciting and innovative development which has been warmly applauded by industry and the development agencies and is proceeding well. Both industry and providers were closely involved in the design and development of the programme.  I am actively considering a similar initiative in relation to electronics, to further enhance the Government response to meeting skills needs.</P>
    <P>The new Education Technology Investment Fund, under which £250 million will be provided in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership with industry, includes specific provision for the PLC programme.  Some £20 million will be available for PLCs and apprenticeships.  This did not happen under any other Government.  It is the first time since the initiation of PLCs that serious capital investment has been devoted to the sector. There has been a crying need for such investment which will contribute significantly to underlining its importance.</P>
    <P>Through action to properly resource different aspects of their work, I am confident we have demonstrated &mdash; and will continue to demonstrate &mdash; our unequalled commitment to recognising and promoting the role of the PLC sector.</P>

They will not be administered in the same way as the third level higher education grant scheme.  The level of grant to be awarded will be equal to that for third level students.  In the context of the overall budget I am confident, when the methodology and the mechanisms have been worked out, we will be in a position to meet this particular commitment.</P>

      <P>A recent survey conducted by the TUI indicated there are 17,000 students in the sector, maintenance grants for whom would cost about £13 million.  Will the Minister give an undertaking that next September he will have £13 million to apply to maintenance grants for PLC students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>From an internal estimate it is not clear what exactly will be required because much will depend on first year enrolments in September. The vast majority of PLC courses are two years.  Up to 50 per cent of the enrolment will not be known until the middle of September.  Given leaving certificate numbers one will be in a position to estimate the numbers likely to be on the PLC role.  The full year cost has been estimated to be of the order of £11 million to £13 million. It is our intention to introduce maintenance grants for students who will be registering in September l998 for the school year l998-99.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's inference is incorrect. There is no question of first year PLC students getting a grant and second year PLC students not getting one.  In terms of the operation of the scheme, I was simply making the point that in devising and estimating the cost, one would have to know the specific numbers of students who will attend in September.  To a certain extent we can guess the percentage of leaving certificate students who may go on to PLCs given the track record and so on.  For third level grant schemes, the forms are issued in June and July. We will not be in a position to issue 50 per cent of the forms until the students are <i>in situ</i> since others may take up different courses.  We will be in touch with the vocational education committees in relation to the administration of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A report prepared by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction &mdash; EMCDDA &mdash; has indicated that up to 37 per cent of 15 and 16 year olds, among the school-going population in this State, reported that, at some stage they had tried cannabis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures are on a par with those for the United Kingdom but seem higher than those for other European countries.  The figures include <Col N="327" /> both once-off, single, experimentation as well as more frequent use.  The preparation of cross-national data on drug use is at a very early stage and results need to be treated with caution.  The results from the survey referred to and from other sources indicate that illegal drugs are relatively widely available and that young people seem increasingly prepared to experiment with their use.  Cannabis, in particular, seems to be used fairly widely, as is ecstasy.  The use of heroin remains a serious problem in urban disadvantaged areas, especially in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The results of the survey referred to and other surveys tend to confirm certain worrying trends which have been known to those concerned with drug misuse by young people for some time past, including my Department.  It is because of the concern about the trends that my Department, in co-operation with the Department of Health and Children, has introduced a programme of substance misuse prevention for post-primary schools and has begun the development of a similar programme for primary schools.  We have also expanded the network of health promoting schools and introduced extensive and intensive training programmes for teachers on implementing substance misuse prevention education for primary schools.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been requested to prepare guidelines for schools, at primary and second levels, to ensure that social personal and health education &mdash; to include education about use of substances &mdash; will become an identified part of the curricula of schools at both levels.</P>
    <P>Youthwork is recognised as a particularly successful intervention in terms of demand reduction among young people.  In the youth services area, the Department of Education and Science co-operates with the Department of Health and Children in introducing education about use of drugs, especially as part of the national youth health programme, and in support of the development of resource materials and training for youth workers.</P>
    <P>My Department participates actively in the work of the national drugs strategy team, which supports the development of plans by local drugs task forces.  The aim of many of the proposals contained in these plans is to strengthen local youth services in providing healthy alternatives to drug use for young people and to support school programmes of substance misuse prevention education.</P>
    <P>All these initiatives which have begun, or have been developed recently, will be expanded.  By their nature, drugs education programmes take time to show the extent to which they influence attitudes and behaviour.  All programmes are evaluated on an ongoing basis.  The earlier indications from the evaluation of the post-primary programme are that it is having an impact on those participating.  It is important that the programmes are modified and adopted in the light of evaluation <Col N="328" /> findings and of trends in drugs use as shown in surveys.  It is my intention that such modification and adaptation should occur in respect of the programmes already in place and that we will be engaged in ongoing developments in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that the survey to which the Minister referred shows that illicit drug use among the student population in Ireland is 2.5 times the average in the other European countries surveyed and three times the average in the case of heroin.  Will the Minister agree it is worrying that the survey also shows that the perception of danger from substance abuse, including smoking, is among the lowest, 63 per cent lower than the average in the case of use of alcohol to excess and 32 per cent lower in the case of use of cannabis?  Will the Minister agree that this is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the education programmes are not getting through?  Was it an oversight on the Minister's part that he did not refer to the manifesto commitment to appoint national and regional drugs education co-ordinators and to ensure the activities of his Department would be looked at and assessed independently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not an oversight.  We will meet school management bodies to discuss various issues, including the appointment of national and regional co-ordinators to co-ordinate activities under the schools' programme on substance misuse as well as posts of responsibility.  Shortly after taking office I met the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment when I impressed upon it the urgent need to develop and complete programmes on substance misuse at primary and second level.  The primary school programme has been completed and we will be in a position to publish and introduce it early in the new year. The post-primary programme is at drafting stage. A key part of my election manifesto was a commitment to ensure a comprehensive substance misuse programme would be a core part of the curriculum under the heading of social and personal health.</P>
      <P>The issue of posts of responsibility falls to be considered as part of the PCW negotiations which are taking a long time to complete.  We are not yet in a position to discuss the utilisation of new posts and new middle management structures in so far as they relate to the substance misuse programme. Funding will be available in the in-service training budget for the ongoing training of teachers in the area of substance misuse.  Considerable work will be done in 1998 under this heading to ensure there are comprehensive programmes on substance misuse at primary and second level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should always be aware that alcohol abuse is often the gateway to drug abuse.  I will work with my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Fahey, in developing awareness programmes <Col N="329" /> at primary and post-primary level.  I agree with the Deputy it is worrying that the perception of harm from alcohol and drugs among young people is among the lowest in the countries surveyed.  Yesterday £1.25 million was allocated in the budget under the heading of youth development services.  This will help us to introduce new and additional programmes in tandem with youth organisations and youth services in schools to heighten the level of awareness of the dangers associated with alcohol and substance abuse.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>the Government's commitment, if any, to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources; and the indicators, if any, of the progress in this strategy which he will publish.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's commitment to give primary education a clear priority in the allocation of resources is set out in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  This commitment is clearly reflected in the 1998 Estimates where I have provided for an overall increase of 9 per cent in expenditure on primary education for 1998.</P>
      <P>In particular, I have provided a total of £32,630,000 for capitation grants towards the operating costs of primary schools. This represents an 8 per cent increase over the projected outturn for capitation for 1997 and a 9.6 per cent increase over the £29,773,000 allocated for capitation in the 1997 Estimates.  These figures represent a substantial increase in the level of funding being provided for capitation, especially when viewed against a background of declining enrolments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> The action programme also makes special reference to one-teacher schools.  In this regard, following my appointment as Minister for Education and Science, I made special arrangements in the case of 24 two-teacher schools which, because of reduced enrolments, were due to become one-teacher units in September 1997, to permit them to retain their second teacher.  I am at present examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one-teacher schools with ten or more pupils from next September onwards.  The programme also gives a commitment to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for special learning difficulties. I assure Members that I am committed to honouring this commitment in the months and years ahead.  As part of that process, I am at present reviewing provision across the entire special needs area to ensure that all resources which become available are utilised to maximum effect.</P>
    <P>In relation to the programme's commitment to renew sub-standard accommodation, the Government has agreed to provide capital funding in excess of £39 million for primary schools in 1998. This represents a 42 per cent increase over the £27.5 million allocated for capital funding in the 1997 Estimates.  This significant increase in the allocation will enable my Department to make further progress in eliminating sub-standard school buildings.</P>
    <P>A further indication of the Government's intent to deliver on its commitment to primary education is evident in the substantial additional resources made available to primary schools under the IT 2000 initiative I launched recently. Furthermore, arising from the mid-term review of European Union funding, significant resources have been made available for the years 1998 and 1999 to focus on children in the eight to 15 year old age group who are at risk of early school leaving or who are already outside the mainstream school system.  I intend to announce an initiative in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>I shall be making available an extra £0.5 million for the provision of primary school books in 1998 in addition to the existing provision for school and library books announced in the Estimates.  I will be making a detailed announcement on this matter very shortly.  As Members will be aware, also contained in the Minister's Budget Statement yesterday was a specific tax relief programme being introduced in the forthcoming Finance Bill to facilitate private or company donations to disadvantaged primary schools and designated disadvantaged post-primary schools which will be of significant benefit to many such schools in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of these measures at such an early stage in the Government's term in office is indicative of the high priority it attaches to primary education, clearly <Col N="332" /> demonstrating its intent to honour its commitments to that sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that yesterday's announcement to the effect that the only measure being taken to support disadvantaged schools was to inform them that they could raise their own funding, is indicative of the sort of thinking on the other side of the House? Would he agree also that the commitment in the programme for Government to give priority to primary education is not consistent with Estimates that provide an increase of 22 per cent at third level and just 9 per cent at primary level? Furthermore, would he agree that a commitment he entered into to end the differentiation between capitation grants at primary and second level is hardly being significantly addressed by an increase of £5 in the capitation grant when that grant is £45 as against the £177 target the Minister set himself?  Is it not a major disappointment that the Minister, in informing the House of the indicators by which he would judge progress in this area, made no reference to key initiatives addressing disadvantage, such as breaking the cycle, early-start or other key programmes at present reaching 3 per cent only of the disadvantaged population which we know to be five or six times that amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, yesterday's budget was not the only response to educational provisions for 1998.  Prior to the budget, there were significant announcements made in relation to education, not least of which was the historic £250 million Education Technology Investment Fund which will involve huge, unprecedented investment in primary education in terms of information and communications technology, an area which had been totally ignored and left without any funding over the preceding four years. Clearly, our commitment to transform primary schools under the schools IT 2000 programme is a major commitment to the primary schools system. This will permit children attending primary schools today and those who will attend them in the future, who deserve to have available to them the equipment, facilities and teachers trained in those new technologies to enable them become computer literate on leaving primary school, to be at the cutting edge of new technological change and to participate in the information society and the Europe of knowledge now emerging which will continue throughout the forthcoming millennium.  Since assuming office, that is one of the most significant contributions on the part of this Government to primary education and, in my view, will represent its lasting legacy in terms of our primary education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we have done much more than that. For example, our commitment to eliminate sub-standard school buildings, in terms of the capital provision in the 1998 Estimates, is very significant, way ahead of what was provided last year for primary school building.  The provision in the <Col N="333" /> 1998 Estimates is 42 per cent more than the 1997 Estimate provided by our immediate predecessors, who opted for a £27.5 million provision whereas we have allocated close to £40 million this year.  We had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate the week before last to ensure the continuation of some projects that had run out of funds prior to the end of this calendar year.  Our record speaks for itself in that, within six months, we have achieved an enormous amount.</P>
    <P>In addition, the initiative being funded by Europe in relation to eight to 15 year olds, the first of its kind, is a significant one in terms of disadvantage.  It endeavours to intervene earlier in children's life cycle than the Youthreach programme. The recent Clondalkin partnership report was interesting in that it suggested that children in fifth class primary level and those in first year at second level were at a critical stage of their development and were most likely to leave school.  I assure the Deputy that we have not finished on the matter of disadvantage: the Estimates include a provision for measures which will be announced following consultation with the INTO and the other partners in education in terms of the staffing schedule for 1998.  Indeed, the scheme announced by our immediate predecessors dealt with the preceding year's allocation of demographic dividends granted by previous Ministers in terms of breaking the cycle and early-start.</P>
    <P>There are 3,000 primary schools, with much disadvantage, much of it not yet included in schemes such as breaking the cycle or early-start. Therefore, we need a more comprehensive programme in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the figures show in Clondalkin where a quarter of the students do not turn up for school indicate a deep problem in the area of disadvantage? While I applaud the Minister's decision to initiate IT 2000 and upgrade school buildings, would he agree that we are actually talking about basic support for children at present seriously alienated from the education system?  Moreover, does he agree that he cannot allow that to be provided perhaps from demographic windfalls but must seriously resource it?  Furthermore, would he not agree that the additional £6 million non-pay element being allocated to the primary schools system this year is not the basis from which to mount a serious assault on the problem of educational disadvantage which begins in primary schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be careful how we interpret the figures contained in the Clondalkin report.  It would be wrong to suggest that a quarter of the children in that area are not turning up for school.  What would be more accurate would be to deduce that a percentage of those surveyed were absent from school.  We have to be extremely careful how we present those figures.  I am not in any way under-estimating the reality <Col N="334" /> that there is very serious educational disadvantage out there, particularly in the partnership areas defined under the various national programmes. There is also very serious disadvantage in rural areas, identified in the report prepared jointly about two years ago by the Combat Poverty Agency and my Department.</P>
      <P>The difference between this and the last Government is that part of the funds provided for in the Supplementary Estimate introduced the week before last were necessary to pay for the retention of 300 teachers under last year's demographic dividend, not provided for in the 1997 Estimate.  It appears that the philosophy over the past four to five years has been one which Deputy Bruton now condemns.  While not ruling out what he says, I must place on the record that the philosophy has been that the demographic dividend arising from falling enrolments has been redistributed within the education system; that has been the way it has been since 1987 under the various national programmes for partnership. Last year there was an attempt by my predecessor to stop that, when in the 1997 Estimates provision was made for 100 teachers only.</P>
      <P>It took the onset of a general election and the teacher conferences to force a climb down on that.  The result was that a Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced two weeks ago to pay for those extra 300 teachers.</P>
      <P>We are taking a comprehensive approach to disadvantage and tremendous progress has been made is the home-school links programme.  When I visit schools in various counties I am heartened by the successful impact of that programme, which I will be looking to expand because of its effectiveness in many schools.  Other issues such as remedial teachers, teacher-counsellors, etc., also need attention.  I am conscious of the issue of disadvantage, as is the Government, and I take on board the points the Deputy made.</P>

      <P>In relation to the demographic dividend at first level, what is the estimated number of teachers that will be released this summer and employed in other areas?  Specifically, does the Minister intend to extend disadvantaged status to schools that do not have such status in the coming year, either in respect of funding or staffing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not yet made definitive decisions on that matter. I do not have the exact figure that will be made available as a result of declining enrolments; it will obviously be similar to what was available last year.  We will discuss that matter with the partners, the INTO and the parents and put forward our ideas on tackling disadvantage. This is not simply a question of allocating a set number of teachers to a school.  That is not the only approach.  Aspects such as psychological, remedial and home-school inputs should be considered in terms of tackling disadvantage. In addition, we are currently evaluating the Early Start programme and that report should be available <Col N="335" /> before the end of the year; we are also evaluating the impact of Breaking the Cycle.</P>
      <P>The whole school approach to disadvantage in terms of the school plan and so on has been identified by the Breaking the Cycle co-ordinator as an important dimension of the success of that initiative in given areas.  Deputy Bruton referred to the 3 per cent these schemes include, but there are 3,000 primary schools and one cannot advance the viewpoint that there is not one school which does not have some cohort of pupils who are not disadvantaged, either socioeconomically or otherwise, to some degree or another. We will deal with this issue comprehensively in the context of the available resources and we will meet the social partners in that regard.</P>

      <P>In terms of the demographic dividend and where a school is just one or two pupils short of the retention number, will the Minister indicate his view on whether schools can be seriously disadvantaged when a teacher leaves and the number of pupils is divided among fewer teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about that.  This goes back to the policy that has been in place for some time &mdash; and I do not say that in a critical way &mdash; but comprehensive research must be carried out on the impact of demographic trends on education.  If enrolments decline in rural areas, for example, particularly along the western sea-board, more multi-class type schools will develop. That has been the trend.  On the other hand, population trends in areas of Dublin, Meath and Kildare are booming with enormous pressures on schools in those areas in terms of maximum class guidelines, etc.  There are population explosions in certain areas of Limerick, Cork and Galway. We are initiating a demographic study of the impact of population decline and shift because the emphasis to date has been on population decline.  The conventional wisdom is that population decline results in the freeing up of resources for redistribution, but we need to examine in a more sophisticated way the demographic shift from one part of the country to another to determine its impact on rural areas suffering population decline as well as urban areas where schools are overcrowded.  New ways of resourcing rural primary schools, other than staffing, may have to be considered.  The £500,000 announced yesterday, which is additional to the library scheme, will give resources directly to schools. That will be useful for schools in rural areas which can build up resource materials to assist them in multi-classes.  This needs to be examined in a more profound way and I have set that in train in the Department.  I received numerous letters from Deputies during the summer concerning a shortage of teachers.</P>

      <P>The junior primary school in Clones does not have disadvantaged status <Col N="336" /> despite the fact that the senior primary school does.  Since then, a gaelscoil opened in the area which means that the junior primary school has lost a teacher.  Will the Minister give a commitment to examine this matter?  Clones has been adversely affected by the problems on the Border and it is a serious anomaly not to designate the junior primary school as disadvantaged when the senior primary school and the gaelscoil have a better status.  Unfortunately, this case is not covered by the recent report because the teacher numbers are too high.  The Minister's predecessor initiated a study which highlighted the fact that only schools with fewer than five teachers can be classified as disadvantaged.  That is the case with the Clones school and I ask the Minister to examine it as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a specific commitment on that school today but he has articulated a difficulty that is replicated throughout the country.  The report of the school accommodation committee is nearing completion.  With a decline in population, new types of schools are emerging and that affects enrolments in existing schools.  Unfortunately, that has occurred in an <i>ad hoc</i> way over the past ten to 15 years with the result that we now have a range of gaelscoileanna operating in poor accommodation, which is another difficulty.  Approximately 39 gaelscoileanna are not in permanent buildings, and another 14 or 15 are due to open.  Many of these schools have been in existence for a significant length of time and it is unfair to the children attending those schools that they are operating in such physically unacceptable conditions.  On the other hand, we must look at the emergence of new schools in the context of the existing school provision. This problem is affecting staff morale in schools which lose teachers, and I must accept that.  The school accommodation committee will put forward firm proposals in regard to this whole area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put two questions to the Minister, one specific and one more general.  The first is in relation to a commitment given prior to the election that St. Teresa's national school in Balbriggan would be designated as a disadvantaged school.  What progress has been made on that issue?  More generally, will the Minister agree that the resourcing of in-service education will be critical to the initiative he announced in the IT and other areas?  Will he agree also that teachers in many smaller schools are reluctant to go on in-service courses because the only remuneration they receive, if one can call it that, is a day off which they can ill afford because of the tight staffing levels in their schools.  These teachers are expected to go on these courses without getting anything in return because what is offered to them is not workable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to come back to the Deputy on the matter of St. Teresa's national <Col N="337" /> school in Balbriggan.  In conjunction with St. Patrick's Research Centre in Drumcondra, we are considering the whole area of disadvantage. There will be a comprehensive in-service programme for IT.  International experience shows that if proper in-service programmes do not accompany the provision of computers and so on, such programmes will fail.  One cannot throw computers in boxes into classrooms without providing adequate inservice training on their use. A total of £3 million has been provided in the Estimates for in-service training in 1998.</P>
      <P>Regarding smaller schools, the nature of in-service training is changing.  It should not involve teachers travelling to Dublin by train or car to undertake courses in certain centres.  The aim is to hold future in-service courses in the locality of schools.  Regional education centres will play a specific and significant role in providing in-service courses and the ICT programme.  In rural areas a number of small schools could combine to form arrangements which would facilitate group training programmes in given areas.  The ideal position would be to design programmes to suit the customer, the teacher, which are regionally located and ultimately lead to accreditation in a given area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would need to make a few announcements before the conferences, but I believe that matter will be resolved before then. The issue of the staffing schedule for 1998-9 will be resolved before the teacher conferences, but whether it is resolved to the satisfaction of everybody is another question.  That matter will have to be resolved before then because the earlier the staffing schedules are issued to the schools the better that will be for future planning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate precisely his policy on the demographic dividend?  It was clear in his manifesto that he believed teachers should stay where they are but we hear he will conduct another study on this issue to add to his stable of studies.  If 400 teachers were to become available what proportion of them would the Minister like assigned to programmes for the disadvantaged?  Currently 650 teachers are providing such programmes.  Would the Minister like the bulk or all of those extra teachers to be assigned to such programmes and added to the 650 teachers who provide such programmes? What is his opening position on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read my manifesto carefully he would know that my opening position is that there are a number of clear issues. Ultimately, we must tackle urban and rural disadvantage. <Col N="338" /> To tackle it comprehensively we will require a range of targeted inputs ranging from educational, psychological and remedial inputs, a straight teaching input in terms of the PTR and teacher counsellors.  Tackling that problem may require a combination of those inputs or the application of one or two of them in particular areas.  The approach to this problem should be that of a comprehensive range of inputs rather than going in one direction and allocating so many teachers to a school.  We have had preliminary discussions with the partners on this and we will engage in more substantive ones early in the new year, but this problem will not be resolved in year one.  The demographic dividend will be an issue for a number of years and a programme will be required to deal with it.  There are still 900 schools that do not have a remedial teacher and needs in that area are still very significant.  The special needs area, which has significant demands, has not been mentioned to date.  Since I took office in July we have endeavoured to make up for past omissions in the area of special needs education in the context of classroom assistance and special schools.  Very little provision was made for that area in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the School Transport Review Committee has recently completed an extensive review of the school transport system.  The committee's report was received by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and is currently being examined by my Department.</P>
      <P>It is intended to publish the report in early 1998 and to ensure that it receives the widest possible dissemination.  My aim is to stimulate an extensive debate on the contents of the report before making final decisions on any future changes to the school transport scheme.  I want to make it clear that I will not take any decisions until I have reflected on that debate and there has been an opportunity for all concerned to become involved in it.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has responsibility for school transport and youth services, will initiate that debate in early or mid-January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that the Minister tells us that report will be published in 1998 when the Taoiseach told us it would be published this month.  Somebody should communicate with the Taoiseach on that.  Has the Minister discussed school bus safety standards with the Minister for the Environment who is drawing up plans on the issue of safety belts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, and I am concerned about the safety issue.  The school transport issue is not <Col N="339" /> one that will be easily resolved and Deputies opposite know that because it is not so long ago since they were in Government and had access to the reports on this.  It has taken since 1996 for the report to be prepared and it has not been completed yet.  We discussed this matter with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey. We are concerned about safety elements and the report deals with that matter.  With Christmas approaching it makes sense to defer the debate until January.</P>
      <P>We need to fundamentally examine the school transport system.  Significant State money is expended on it.  This important system in education was introduced by the late Donough O'Malley and gave effect to free second level schools.  It enabled pupils to be brought to schools in a way that was not possible 30 years ago.  Since then anomalies have arisen and not a day passes when there is not a parliamentary question seeking a rearrangement of routes or a review of catchment areas.  As a result a complex system has emerged and it will not be easily resolved.  I do not want to give the impression that the mere publication of the report will usher in an immediate radical change.  We need to study it carefully and deliberate on its recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any plans following the publication of the report?  He said he would consider suggestions and review the matter. Has the Department any plans to lift the embargo on the termination of some school services and has the Minister any plans to change the catchment area boundaries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no immediate plans to change the catchment area boundaries and there are no plans to terminate certain school services. When the report is published we will study it as I have no doubt will the Deputy and we will debate it.</P>
      <P>It would be too much to hope for political consensus on the way forward but we cannot stand still.  Following the publication of the report, we will decide in which direction to go.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, intends to give this matter considerable attention.  He has secured a 100 per cent increase in the provision for adult literacy programmes, which were a key concern of his. School transport is also an issue with which he intends to deal effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what the Minister said, I have not been on that side of the House nor have I seen the reports to which he refers.  I am aware of overcrowding on school buses.  What advice would the Minister give in such a situation? Who would be responsible if there was an accident involving a school bus, something to which we come extremely close?  Who is responsible for overcrowding on school buses?  Drivers are put in an impossible situation.  In his review, will the Minister consider safe cycling routes to <Col N="340" /> schools to offset, in some way, the demands put on motorised school transport and in light of the fact that more parents are insisting that their children do not walk or cycle to school because of increasing traffic hazards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's last point, I will work with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, on cycling routes.  Local authorities could do more to provide safe cycling routes, particularly to schools. Traditionally, civil engineering has concerned itself with building roads and many roads were built when EU Structural Funds were provided.  I worked on a cycling committee in Cork Corporation before I became Minister.  At that stage we had the guts of a plan for routes to schools and colleges.  The Deputy made a good suggestion.</P>
      <P>On the safety issue, I am not a lawyer so I do not know who would decide who was ultimately responsible if an accident occurred.  Safety issues are a major concern and the report highlights them in its deliberations.  Recommendations will emanate from the report and the Minister responsible will take steps with the providers and contractors to see how we can alleviate overcrowding on a number of school buses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Regional Technical College Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, it is a function of a college or institute to provide such courses of study as its governing body considers appropriate, subject to the annual programme and budget approval process laid down in the Acts.  The question of introducing, modifying or terminating a specific course in a regional technical college or institute of technology arises in the context of academic planning and review in higher education institutions.  Any proposals for change or new developments are submitted through the academic council to the governing body of the institution concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed that a letter has been circulated recently by the RIAI which claims there are proposals to dismantle courses in architectural technology in third level colleges and, in particular, in Limerick Regional Technical College. However, my Department has discussed the matter with the management of the colleges concerned and has been assured there are no such proposals before the colleges' academic councils or governing bodies.  I have a body of correspondence from the colleges to the Royal Institute of <Col N="341" /> Architects.  The Deputy may be aware how this emerged.  Apparently, a letter was circulated and the college authorities have denied there was merit in it so it will not happen.</P>

      <P>They should be consulted but I do not run the regional technical colleges.  The Act gives autonomy to the governing body.  We would be extremely concerned if such courses were cancelled without consultation with the partners. Obviously, we interact with the colleges on these courses which are important in terms of the need for skills in this sector of the economy.  I was alarmed when I saw the question, but I began to relax when I read the correspondence.  The colleges were concerned that the good relationship which existed between them and the RIAI would be harmed by the correspondence circulated. They assured my officials and me that all parties would be consulted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my policy that where possible education should be provided on islands for both primary and post primary pupils.  The issue of educational provision for residents of offshore islands was considered by an interdepartmental committee which reported in February 1996. While the committee recognised that good educational facilities can be a key factor in island development, it accepted that it would not be feasible to provide post primary schools on each island.</P>
      <P>Where there is no second level school on an island, island families are eligible for financial assistance under the remote area boarding grant scheme to facilitate a child's attendance at school on the mainland.  This scheme provides for the payment of grants up to £1,800 in each case towards the costs of boarding or lodgings.  In August I took the decision which has meant that with effect from 1 September 1997 this grant is not means tested.  This will directly benefit island dwellers who may have had difficulties due to their ineligibility for this grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Action Programme for the Millennium gave a specific commitment to one teacher primary schools.  I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments in this regard.  A number of one-teacher schools are located on islands.  One of the 24 schools which I Iooked after on coming into office and for which I made arrangements in July and August was on Oileán Cléire in Deputy Jim <Col N="342" /> O'Keeffe's constituency.  We are considering increasing the provision for island schools from September next.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a special arrangement was made to improve communication facilities for island schools.  Under this arrangement, primary schools located on islands were supplied with telecommunications facilities, including telephones, fax facilities, modems, computers and printers.  I assure Deputies that, with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, I am committed to ensuring that all persons living on our offshore islands have reasonable access to quality education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to withdraw the means test used to provide support to second level island students who were obliged to attend secondary schools on the mainland.  It is a considerable advantage to many island families who must send children to the mainland.  Does the Minister agree it would be better if children were educated in their own environment on the islands?  On Arranmore Island, 70 to 80 children left the island each Sunday evening and returned the following Friday. However, a secondary school was provided by Donegal vocational education committee so children on Arranmore Island now stay at home with their parents until they have completed at least their leaving certificates.  For how many children would the Department provide a viable secondary school on an island?  Are there guidelines in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairly lethal question. People would argue that if we want to provide a full curricular choice, we would need a minimum of 250 students for a post primary school.  The Deputy's question was more specific to islands. Obviously, a school with 80 pupils is surviving well on Arranmore Island.  On my travels over the past six months I have come across post primary schools with 120 and 200 pupils which are doing well and providing an acceptable curriculum to the parents and students.  The balance which must be weighed up is the issue of the geographic logistics, the distance involved in travelling and the curriculum and resources which can be provided.  Vocational education committees may have some latitude in the number of hours they get globally from the Department.  It is something I will examine and if the Deputy has any suggestions in terms of a number of islands in his locality, I will gladly take them on board.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree to an immediate review of the information technology, hardware and software, available in all island schools and on islands generally?  As he knows, there are interesting innovations in parts of the country, particularly in west Cork, which have the potential to telematically deliver considerable educational opportunity.  That can only be successfully <Col N="343" /> drawn down if there is proper hardware which is supported.  Will he agree to undertake an urgent review of island schools to identify weaknesses and perhaps give them priority in his programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We want the island schools well looked after in the context of the School IT 2000 programme.  Given their situation, the new technologies have special relevance for islands in terms of education provision and the development of telematics.  I met people from a group of schools in west Cork, which included the island schools in Oileán Cléire as well as other primary schools on the mainland, who were developing a joint approach to technology in the schools.  I would be very proactive in that regard and I will examine all the islands as the Deputy suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another difficulty arises occasionally with island children attending secondary schools on the mainland and who stay with local families.  Sometimes 15 or 16 children from Tory Island attending school on the mainland forego the advantage of going home for the mid-term break in the winter months because they are dependent on a ferry to get them across and they cannot get home.  When this happens we rely on the Aer Corps to provide an emergency service to get them to the island.  It always responds positively.  This is something the Minister should at least be familiar with and perhaps he may be able to do something definite for children who cannot get home for their mid-term break.</P>

Recognising the desirability for children to be close to their parents during their formative years, is the Minister supportive of the &ldquo;sa bhaile&rdquo; movement and in what way?  It provides a number of examples to show that the option of schooling at home has been preferable to the often long distances which people on islands and in other areas where schooling might be awkward or difficult to find often have to travel.</P>

      <P>I am open to different forms of education provision and people invariably come <Col N="344" /> up with new ideas and approaches.  We should be very careful to ensure there is healthy social interaction between children.  I am not convinced that children educated on their own in the home or with one or two others is necessarily a good thing in terms of their broader educational and personal development.</P>
      <P>When I met people from a number of one teacher schools in Mayo last year when I was in Opposition, one issue they raised was the social isolation in a remote rural area.  There might be 17 or 18 children in a school and this is a completely different social context compared to a school with 300 or 400, especially where the age levels range from four to 12.  I am concerned about that.</P>
      <P>The area of home-school links, for example, and the home-school liaison approach, which involves parents with the school, is the way to go, especially in the context of the islands.  This means the school on the island would be used as a resource for adult learning, parenting courses and involving parents with students.  There tends to be a community approach to all things on offshore islands.  They are very proactive and self-reliant in that regard and probably achieve much more than by using the conventional methodology employed on the mainland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of some students to drop out of their courses certainly concerns me. The Deputy will appreciate that the reasons for dropout are complex.  There is no simple explanation. Factors such as motivation, capabilities and suitability are all involved.  There must also be a balance between completion rates on programmes and maintaining the necessary objective standards.  The challenge of maximising completion rates, consistent with maintaining appropriate standards, is a matter in the first instance for individual colleges and the National Council for Educational Awards.  As the Deputy is aware, a range of new structures have been developed in the colleges on foot of the enactment of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, designed to support their effectiveness and efficiency as third level educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of initiatives have been taken by the colleges and the NCEA in relation to the monitoring of departures before students have completed their courses.  A system has been developed for a statistical monitoring of uncertified departures from certificate and diploma programmes and has been applied on a pilot basis in some colleges.  Other studies, in both individual colleges and groups of colleges, have also been carried out with a view to developing actions to <Col N="345" /> minimise uncertified departures.  A comprehensive study on the guidance services in regional technical colleges was carried out with assistance from the National Centre for Guidance in Education. A further study began in October 1996 aimed at providing a comprehensive examination of the reasons underlying uncertified departures. The study covers the 1996-7 session and encompasses background research, case studies, surveys and questionnaires.  In December 1996, the NCEA initiated a study into admission requirements, academic standards for transfer from national certificate to national diploma to degree and into attrition rates within courses in NCEA designated institutions.  An interim report from the study was presented to the council's academic committee last April.  I understand, however, that presentation of the final report has been deferred to take account of other ongoing studies on attrition rates with a view to providing a more comprehensive analysis of the problem.</P>
    <P>In July I established a joint industry-education task force to identify a range of proposals and measures to enhance the throughput of students in particular engineering disciplines to address the strong demand for technicians in the new technological industries.  As part of the immediate follow up to the task force, I have already announced a major initiative whereby industry and colleges will jointly recruit, educate and train technicians.  A new course, the national certificate in technology, for which up to 300 students are being recruited, will commence in January 1998 in nine regional technical colleges.  The courses will involve structured work placement with a number of firms who are co-operating in this programme. As applicants will have a clear understanding of their future role in industry, I am confident that the majority of the participating students will complete their courses successfully.</P>
    <P>The findings of the task force will be of direct assistance in developing strategies to improve retention rates generally.  I will shortly announce my response to the further recommendations of this group.  I will also meet the colleges collectively and this issue will be an important item on the agenda.  I am very happy to consider further, in consultation with the colleges and the NCEA, putting in place an appropriate database if this can make a significant contribution to reducing drop out rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that, in January this year when he was in Opposition, he stated it was scandalous that we did not have a national database?  He said we had no idea how many students proceed from first to second year, how many complete their courses and that transfer rates from first to second year in some courses are as low as 39 per cent, 37 per cent, 35 per cent and 32 per cent.  Against that background, is it not a disgrace that the National Council for Educational Awards, which was to produce this study before the start of the academic year has deferred its production?  I believe that is a serious error. <Col N="346" /> Even if that information is not full, we need to get access to it.  We are investing heavily in these courses.  Does the Minister agree that the number of people who drop out is a key issue?  Will he revert to his eloquent words in January and give a commitment to remedy this matter without any &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;, &ldquo;ands&rdquo; or, &ldquo;buts&ldquo;?</P>

      <P>One of the motivating factors behind the joint industrial task force was to examine why students were dropping out of certain courses.  The points commission that has been established could have a significant bearing on this also.  This initiative will have significant implications for the attrition issue and the points system in terms of how people identify courses they wish to attend as certain students end up on courses for which they were not suitable originally. It is a key issue because with the skills issue, population decline, etc., it is essential that resources are maximised in terms of those who go through the system so that we do not have high attrition rates, particularly in colleges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the fact that the information was not available for reply to a recent parliamentary question which I tabled in regard to fall out rates from college of students undertaking national certificate courses is a sad reflection on his Department?  In terms of the interim report which the Department received last April, does it indicate whether admission standards to national certificate courses in many instances are probably too low and students who qualify for admission with Ds in five pass subjects do not have the wherewithal to see their courses through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that and that is why the points commission must look at this area.  The issue comes down to suitability for courses and the key to completion is that people are suited to the discipline they take on.  Sometimes people are attending courses they did not originally apply for as their first choice and some find themselves taking up courses that were their fourth or fifth choice. After three or four months they realise the course is not for them or the disciplines and subjects which form part of it are not suitable to their orientation or intelligence.</P>
      <P>I have seen students in the PLC sector, who did not perform to the peak of their abilities at leaving certificate level and secured an average result, who have gone on to significant achievement afterwards.  We should be wary of forever judging people's educational standards on their leaving certificate performance.  I met a student recently who had just completed a master's degree in topography and had won an award in Brussels.  He started out on a PLC foundation course in Colaiste Stiofáin Naofa, Cork.  Progression is important and suitability to the course is the primary issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This needs to be analysed very carefully as it is not as simplistic as gathering figures and publishing <Col N="348" /> them.  We are working on it and the joint industrial task group is one such initiative.  An interesting aspect is the type of people who are applying to return to education and who would have been excluded by the CAO system.  Many of them like the nature of the course starting in January because it involves significant, structured placement and they see guaranteed employment at the end of it.  I am open to any suggestions from others on the issue.</P>

      <P>The Deputy put his foot in it. Farmers were delighted with what they received yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware whether the Progressive Democrats have a policy on agriculture, but let us look at Fianna Fáil's election promises in that regard.  Fianna Fáil guaranteed to continue the installation aid scheme, but as soon as it got into office it did away with it.  It was expected that provision would be made in the budget but it was not.  There was only enough provision to ensure that farmers who have already qualified will be paid.  As a result young farmers are totally disillusioned with the Government.</P>
      <P>Some months ago when I was on that side of the House, I answered questions about the control of farmyard pollution scheme. Fianna Fáil gave a firm commitment that the necessary financial resources would be provided but, again, there was no mention of it in the budget.  The same is true of the dairy hygiene scheme.  There is little in the budget for farmers.  They know it, and I am sure it will not be long before we see them protesting on the streets again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuation of the resort renewal scheme is a positive move because a number of resorts have not fully capitalised on the scheme.  Initially there was a slow take up because it was not properly advertised and, therefore, not understood. There were also problems getting planning permission. I am delighted the scheme has been extended.  Now it can reach its full potential in those resorts that have not capitalised on it. However, some of the restrictions relating to capital allowances could affect the scheme. <Col N="350" /> Changes were made last year which tightened it up, and further changes were made this year. Such schemes are sometimes abused.  However, if this scheme is to be successful, every incentive must be given to encourage people to invest.  Yesterday the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, promised to carry out a review of the scheme.  Either he was not aware at that stage that the scheme would continue or the Minister for Finance kept his cards very close to his chest.  Perhaps he would look again at the effects on the scheme of last year's and this year's budgets.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions relating to the rural renewal scheme.  A few weeks ago in a priority question to the Minister for Finance I called for just such a departure.  It is the start of what I see as targeted incentives for rural areas.  I am personally aware of people living in rural Ireland who have invested in apartments in areas designated for urban renewal in Dublin, Limerick, Cork, etc.  The result has been a major outflow of funds from rural areas.  If we are serious about preserving rural areas and a rural economy, it is important to provide incentives for people to invest their money in those areas.  The Minister did not expand on his proposals and they have yet to be confirmed by the EU Commission. Nevertheless it is a welcome departure and something we on this side of the House fully support.</P>
    <P>Apart from indicating the upper Shannon area and how many counties and communities would be involved, the Minister did not say whether the scheme would be area based or project driven. No doubt we will receive the details in due time. I understand it is being run on a pilot basis and I hope it will be extended to other parts of the country, especially where the economy is under pressure because of the closure of small businesses resulting in local villages and towns being denuded of population.  This is an initiative I certainly welcome.  It was strongly recommended by an expert group which, as junior Minister at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I set up to examine the whole area of rural development.  I am glad that it is now being tried at least on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>Another promise made by Fianna Fáil before the election related to post-leaving certificate students.  The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, was quoted regularly in the papers promising that if Fianna Fáil was returned to office it would grant aid post-leaving certificate students.  We have seen no evidence that this is going to happen.  This is another large section of the young population of Ireland who are very disillusioned because of this empty promise.  I hope the Ministers of State on the other side of the House will relay what I said to their respective Ministers because this is something that will become very contentious in the near future.</P>
    <P>To recapitulate on the budget, it was obviously going to be a good one.  Never was a Minister for Finance in a better position to deliver right across the spectrum.  However, the taxation provisions in <Col N="351" /> this budget are very much weighted in favour of the upper end of the spectrum rather than the most vulnerable, the unemployed, the low paid and people on medium incomes.  People earning £50,000 and over will gain over £1,000 whereas people earning £15,000 will gain up to perhaps £400.  That is not good enough.  It should be the other way around.  The individual on £15,000 should be gaining the £1,000 and the people earning £50,000 &mdash; and most of us here are in or near that bracket &mdash; should be getting a lot less.  Whoever is Minister for Finance next year should right that injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget introduced yesterday by the Minister for Finance.  Everyone is aware at this stage of the principal elements of the budget so I will not repeat what the Minister said.  However, it is important to point out the economic background to it.</P>
      <P>The budget has been presented against the background of a period of unequalled buoyancy in the domestic economy.  The outlook for next year remains favourable.  This will be reflected in employment with the number of people at work projected to increase by 48,000.  Unemployment is expected to fall by about 15,000 as continued high rates of labour force growth take up a significant proportion of the new jobs created.</P>
      <P>The reasons for our continued success story are the subject of considerable interest and discussion at home and abroad.  It must be acknowledged that these reasons are complex and interrelated, but that the principal elements include the following: prudent management of the economy, the consensus approach in successive agreements with the social partners, the reduction in the debt burden, an increasing labour force, investment in education and training over a number of decades, strong foreign direct investment, the contribution of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and reform of tax regimes for individuals and business.  The unifying theme of these elements is clear, a focus on policies which deliver long-term benefits.  Contrary to criticism in the House, the budget has maintained this longer term focus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic progress to date has been welcome but we need to consolidate and build upon it.  The Minister outlined yesterday what we must do to achieve this.  We must ensure we create the right conditions to sustain strong economic growth so that more people get jobs, take steps to ensure that any inflationary pressures are contained and prepare for the problems we face in the decades ahead.  The Government's main fiscal aims for the next five years, which have already <Col N="352" /> been outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium, are undoubtedly focused on these objectives.</P>
    <P>We are, by any estimate, at the high point of the economic cycle.  It is, therefore, not only appropriate but necessary that we avail of this opportunity to run surpluses and reduce the debt burden.  Our debt remains high.  Running a budget surplus when the economy is doing well as at present is the key to reducing the debt.  This will put the economy in the best position to meet the challenges of the future.</P>
    <P>It is worth considering the key factors which have influenced the budgetary strategy and the main budgetary provisions announced yesterday. The Government's commitment to Partnership 2000 is clear from this budget.  The measures announced yesterday, together with last year's budget, mean that the overall resource commitment to reduce personal taxation by £900 million on a full year basis over three years and to spend £525 million on social inclusion and equality measures over three years will have been largely delivered in the first two years of the three year programme.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, we also face longer term challenges in relation to economic and social developments and these are addressed in this budget.  It sets out to create the right conditions to sustain strong economic growth so that more people get jobs and to ensure that inflationary pressures are contained.  It also aims to position the public finances to address the investment needs of the economy, the post-2000 Structural Funds situation, long-term demographic changes, the reduction of the national debt, preparation for economic and monetary union, the reduction in the tax burden and social inclusion.  I will expand on some of these themes.</P>
    <P>The economy has benefited in recent years from substantial EU Structural and Cohesion Funding which has boosted investment and added to the capacity of the economy.  The economy still has a major infrastructural deficit and further significant investments must be made to correct it and to provide for the needs of a rapidly growing economy.</P>
    <P>Against this background, there are compelling reasons to justify continued Structural Funding in the years beyond 1999, despite the narrowing of the gap in Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EU average on account of recent progress. However, the prospective enlargement of the EU will make other demands on the EU budget and there are also demands for restraint in EU spending. While it is envisaged that EU funds will continue to play a substantial role in financing our investment needs, it is unwise to assume that transfers to this country will remain indefinitely on the scale of the 1990s.  We must plan for this eventuality now so that we will ultimately be able to meet more of our investment requirements from our own resources while maintaining the fiscal disciplines of economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is now less than <Col N="353" /> 13 months away.  Ireland is well placed to be among the founder members in January 1999. EMU will present enormous challenges and great opportunities.  In the run up to monetary union, policy must be geared to continuing to meet all the Maastricht convergence criteria.  Under the stability and growth pact member states will be expected to keep their budgetary position close to balance or in surplus in normal economic conditions so as to avoid excessive deficits in periods of low growth or recession.  Our current economic conditions are better than normal and the case for running a budget surplus in these circumstances is compelling.</P>
    <P>The disciplines of EMU are not a matter for public policy alone.  All the social partners and all sectors of the economy must play their part in preparing the ground for Ireland's successful participation in EMU.  This will primarily require the maintenance of competitiveness and the flexibility needed to underpin strong sustainable economic and employment growth in an increasingly competitive international business climate.</P>
    <P>The budget does not seek to put all the additional resources generated by higher growth into rapid debt reduction.  While making substantial further progress on this front, it also allocates resources to the investment needs of the economy, the continued reform of the tax system and the improvement of social services.  The clear conclusions to be drawn from consideration of our longer term needs are that it is now appropriate to adopt more ambitious budgetary targets than have been achieved over the last decade.</P>
    <P>The targets for the 1998 budget are clearly framed to enable us to address longer term needs from a position of financial strength.  They are a current budget surplus of £1.1 billion, a capital deficit of £1.2 billion, an Exchequer borrowing requirement of less than £100 million and a general Government surplus of 0.3 per cent of GDP. Control of public spending will be central to the achievement of the budgetary targets.  The Government is committed to ensuring during its lifetime that the growth in net current expenditure will be limited to an annual average increase of 4 per cent.  Controlling current expenditure is a key element of our budgetary and economic policy.</P>
    <P>The budget adopts a balanced approach which takes account of the need to improve social inclusion measures while, at the same time, keeping control of public spending and creating an environment which encourages business and investment.  This is not an end in itself but a means to an end to provide the resources and the employment necessary for the achievement of our social objectives.  It is clear from the debate that all sides are agreed that gaining a job is the greatest anti-poverty weapon of all.</P>
    <P>I wish to address the approach in this budget to employment and unemployment.  The south-east region, which includes my constituency of Waterford, has one of the highest rates of unemployment in the State.  The budget does much for <Col N="354" /> the unemployed and as such will benefit those areas of high unemployment.  In the first instance, personal payments to the unemployed, in line with other social welfare payments, are to increase by £3 per week, with the payments for qualified adults increasing by 3 per cent.  These increases are well in excess of the forecast rate of inflation of 2 per cent.  However, the Government is not satisfied with merely improving the lot of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>A very unusual situation has developed in the labour market where a scenario of employers who are unable to fill vacancies is juxtaposed with a level of unemployment which is still very high. The Government is aware that the labour shortages which are now evident in certain areas could very quickly lead to major problems and bring our economic success to a premature end.  At the same time the Government realises that the unemployed would prefer to return to work and be able to contribute to and benefit from the current buoyancy of the economy.</P>
    <P>In order to tackle these two interrelated problems, the Government has put forward a package which will speed up the task of getting the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, into the jobs which are now waiting for them.  The back to work allowance scheme, which has been very successful in assisting the long-term unemployed to re-enter the workforce, will be expanded by 5,000 places in 1998, bringing the total on the scheme to 27,000.  The community employment scheme is being reviewed in the light of recent labour market developments but, as an interim measure, 1,000 additional places will be provided on the part-time jobs option and a further 1,000 places will be provided on the jobs initiative.</P>
    <P>A new two pronged initiative aimed at the long-term unemployed is being introduced as part of the tax package.  The first prong will provide a direct benefit to the long-term unemployed person who returns to work in that he or she will receive an additional tax free allowance of £3,000 plus £1,000 for each dependent child.  This allowance will continue for three years, being phased out over that period, so long as the person remains in employment.  The participant will also retain his or her secondary benefits.  This is a very imaginative approach.</P>
    <P>The second prong is intended to make it more attractive for employers to hire the long-term unemployed.  This allows employers a double tax deduction for a three year period in respect of the wages paid to the former long-term unemployed person.  In line with these measures the Government has tackled the poverty trap and the unemployment trap by reducing tax and PRSI at the lower end of the scale and also by the completion of the process of calculating family income supplement on a net basis.  This will make lower paid employment more attractive than remaining on the dole.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the other department under my responsibility, the Office of Public Works.  I <Col N="355" /> am pleased to inform the House I have been carrying out a re-evaluation of Office of Public Works' scope of operation in the context of the office's strategic plan.  At the core of this process is the establishment of six new business units covering the architectural services, engineering services, project management, property management, property maintenance and procurement. Each business unit will operate independently and will be accountable for its individual range of customers, budgets, costs, targets and performance evaluation.  The plan envisages the establishment of commercial management systems to measure the performance of each business unit in comparison with the best practice in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The measurement of added value which Office of Public Works delivers in its services over and above the strictly commercial criteria will form part of such a system, as will the redefinition of some of the individual business units with a view to improving efficiency and customer value, the development of customer care and a quality management approach and the development of the office's staff and organisational systems.  I am pleased to inform the House substantial progress has been made in this regard.  A practice management system has been established for the architectural service and its first accounts are due in 1998.  A project management plan for the engineering services division has been completed and a practice management plan is due for completion in 1998.  A project management plan for the project management business unit is due to come into operation next year.  A review of the procurement operation is due for completion in early 1998.  I am fully committed to ensuring these innovative and essential measures will be delivered.</P>
    <P>I look forward to keeping the House fully informed of further major developments in 1998 which will reflect the transformation of the Office of Public Works into a customer focused and commercially minded operation.  The year 1998 will be a very exciting one for my office in the context of major upcoming projects.  As I announced recently, Government approval has been given to proceed with the Leinster House 2000 project which will provide new accommodation for the Oireachtas on the former College of Art site.  Other project works for 1998 include the National Library, phase II of the National Museum at Collins Barracks and the redevelopment of the Department of Education site at Marlborough Street as a millennium project.</P>
    <P>This budget places us firmly on the road to EMU membership.  The emerging budgetary outturn for 1997 is comfortably within the targets contained in the convergence programme 1997 to 1999.  The budget is based on a clear strategy which aims to consolidate and build on our current economic success.  It will achieve this through a policy of personal tax reductions linked to wage moderation designed to encourage investment <Col N="356" /> and job creation.  The budget rewards effort and provides for our key investment needs while also promoting social inclusion.  It provides in particular for specific measures to facilitate the return of the long-term unemployed to employment, which has particular relevance in the high unemployment area in Waterford in my constituency.  The improving economy will generate more jobs and additional resources for investment and will allow us to make progress in taking care of those who are dependent on the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the best budget I have seen in my 32 years of membership of this House.  I am very proud the partnership Government, my party, the Progressive Democrats, and Fianna Fáil, has proposed this budget to the House.  It is a good budget for PAYE workers, pensioners, people with disabilities and the unemployed who are trying to get back into the workforce.  For the working people, yesterday's budget provides a real reduction in the burden of income tax.  The figures speak for themselves.  A married couple with two children and one earner on £11,000 per year will be better off by £10 per week.  A married couple with two children and one earner on £13,000 per year will be better off by £12 per week.  A single person on the average industrial wage of £15,000 per year will be better off by £8 per week.  The two parties in this partnership Government promised real tax reform and we have delivered on that promise.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's budget was the best budget ever for pensioners.  The increase of £5 per week is the most generous ever and the Government is well on course to achieve its target of £100 per week for non-contributory old age pensioners during the lifetime of this Administration.  We substantially increased the special tax relief available to pensioners by raising the exemption limits.  We promised a new deal for pensioners and we have delivered on that promise.</P>
      <P>The budget recognises the special needs of those with disabilities.  An extra £7 million is provided for those with mental handicap and an extra £3 million for those with physical and sensory disabilities.  Taking into account the extra money already allocated in the Book of Estimates, total funding for disability will increase substantially in 1998.  In addition, the Government is committed to implementing the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  We promised a better life for people with disabilities and we are delivering on that promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No budget has done more to help unemployed people get back into the workforce.  Apart from reducing income tax, we have introduced a whole range of measures, all targeted to benefit the unemployed.  There are 5,000 extra places on the back to work scheme, 2,000 extra places on the community employment programme, a special tax allowance for long-term unemployed people <Col N="357" /> who take a job and a special tax break for employers who hire long-term unemployed people.  We promised to tackle the issue of unemployment and we are delivering on that promise.</P>
    <P>Budget 1998 is a budget for an enterprise society, a budget for an inclusive society.  We must promote enterprise if we are to create new jobs, prosperity and opportunities.  If we do not promote enterprise we will not have the resources to tackle the problems of social exclusion and marginalisation.  This budget will reward work and encourage enterprise.  It will underpin Partnership 2000 and ensure the economy maintains its current growth levels for years to come.  This is a balanced, fair budget, a budget that seeks to distribute the fruits of economic growth across all sections of society.</P>
    <P>In the case of a married couple with two children and one earner on £12,000 per year, the net gain in take home pay, when family income supplement is taken into account, is 5.6 per cent.  For a similar couple on £50,000 per year, the net gain in take home pay is 3.6 per cent.  The reduction in the higher rate has been part funded by closing off some of the tax shelters which enabled those on very high incomes to reduce their effective tax rate well below 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Opposition must oppose measures, that is its role in a democracy.  It should, however, take up some of the criticisms of the budget which it has voiced inside and outside the House in the past 24 hours.  Deputy Rabbitte of Democratic Left described the £250 increase in personal tax free allowance as paltry, but that is the same amount by which the Rainbow Government, of which he was a member, increased the allowance in last year's budget.  On tax rates, the Government is committed to reducing both rates of income tax.  Impressive progress has been made on this front in our first budget, but that approach has been strongly criticised by the Opposition parties.  Does that mean the parties of the former Rainbow Coalition are committed to reversing the changes made yesterday? Will they increase the tax rates back to 26 per cent and 48 per cent?  If they have the courage of their apparent convictions, that is what they should say they will do.  If they think the top rate of tax should be increased to 48 per cent, they should campaign publicly on that platform.</P>
    <P>Both Labour and Democratic Left have traditionally taken a principled position on tax issues.  I do not agree with their views but I accept their integrity on this subject.  In contrast, Fine Gael no longer appears to have a coherent view on tax policy.  In September 1996, the party chairman, Deputy Hogan, announced that Fine Gael wanted to cut the basic rate of tax by 2 per cent and the top rate by 3 per cent.  Eight months later, during the general election campaign in May, Fine Gael wanted to leave the basic rate unchanged but to cut 3 per cent off the top rate. Six months later, their party spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, stated last Saturday that the party did not want a reduction in either tax <Col N="358" /> rate.  It takes some political neck to criticise the Government for cutting tax rates when it campaigned on the same policy six months previously.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has also been highly critical of Government policy on public spending.  It claims we are spending too much, but when we give pensioners £5 per week it claims that is not enough. We have given more to pensioners in one year than the Rainbow Government gave them in the three budgets it introduced.  Are we spending too much or too little?  Fine Gael cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>Is Fine Gael claiming we should not honour the public service pay commitments it entered into while in Government?  Is it saying we should not look after social welfare recipients and give them increases well above the rate of inflation?  Is it saying we should not allocate an extra £37 million to health services or spend £10 million on new places on the community employment programme for those who cannot find jobs?  If that party really believes public spending is too high, it should have the courage to say where it would make the cutbacks.  Otherwise, it lacks political credibility.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Fine Gael would like to make those cutbacks in the Department of the Environment. The provision of £453 million for housing in 1998 represents an increase of almost 14 per cent on the estimated expenditure this year and, in particular, reflects the Government's key priority in An Action Programme for the Millennium to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups.  The provision of more than £214 million for the local authority housing programme represents an increase of £40 million, or nearly 23 per cent, on the estimated expenditure for 1997.  That will enable local authorities meet commitments on ongoing programmes and fund a programme of 3,900 new starts or acquisitions in 1998 compared with an outturn of about 3,500 in 1997 under the Rainbow Government.</P>
    <P>The 1998 provision for local authority housing also includes £20 million for the redevelopment of Ballymun, for which the Rainbow Government provided no funding.  That project, including the provision of replacement housing, is estimated to cost £180 million at 1996 prices and to span an eight year period.  New housing to replace the existing flat complexes will be the key element in an integrated strategic plan for the social and economic regeneration of Ballymun.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector is now a key element of the social housing system, bringing with it many unique and positive features and a more diverse and sophisticated approach to meeting housing needs.  I was delighted, therefore, to announce recently significant increases in the level of financial support for a range of social housing measures, including voluntary housing, the shared housing ownership scheme and so on and to secure adequate funding for those improved schemes in 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> The main elements in the social housing package include increases ranging from £5,000 to £15,000 per unit in the maximum levels of assistance to voluntary housing bodies under the capital assistance scheme, wider income limits, lower rents, higher unit cost limits and a higher level of ongoing support for voluntary housing under the rental subsidy scheme, increases of up to £15,000 per unit of accommodation in the level of assistance available for voluntary housing schemes on offshore islands and for special grants in major county boroughs, a 50 per cent increase in funding for communal facilities in voluntary housing projects, an increased income limit for the shared ownership scheme, with an increased level of subsidy which will assist shared owners to meet higher house prices, a £5,000 increase in the maximum local authority house purchase loan and an increased income limit.  These measures are being implemented in addition to the major increase in funding for the local authority housing programme to which I referred.  These changes are significant and I hope they will restore the positive growth momentum which has faltered in the past year or two.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the lessons of the past, I will do my utmost to ensure the level of assistance available under the schemes remain at a realistic level and are not ignored, as happened since 1995 under the previous Government.  I am confident the package will restore reality to the social housing schemes, ensure their expanded use and provide an opportunity for social housing in locations where it had not previously been tempted.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased an additional £750,000 was provided in the budget for the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly, bringing the 1998 provision for the task force to £5 million, an increase of 21 per cent on the 1997 provision under the rainbow Government.  The task force is targeted at meeting the housing needs of elderly persons living alone.  Assistance is provided for any works considered necessary to improve their living conditions, which include repairs and improvements to doors, windows and roofs and the provision of water, sewerage and food storage facilities.  The scheme is funded by my Department but operated by the health boards, the primary agencies concerned with the well-being of the elderly.  They have been able to use the scheme in conjunction with the other services they provide for the elderly, with a minimum of formality and to good effect.</P>
    <P>The past 12 months have also seen a number of significant developments in urban renewal, an area for which I have special responsibility.  Earlier this year the Government approved the framework for a new scheme along a number of lines.  The scheme will come into operation in August next when the qualified extension of the current scheme expires.  Under the new scheme, designations will be considered on the basis of integrated area plans prepared for the areas most in need of renewal.  Prioritising the areas for <Col N="360" /> which plans should be prepared will be the responsibility of the local authorities at county level.  They will also lead the process of preparing plans and consultations with local partners and communities.  Integrated area plans will be broadly based and, while they will obviously address issues of physical renewal, they will do so within a broad socio-economic context.  As part of those plans local authorities will be required to make a case for the designation of strategic sub-areas. Obviously, this approach to the new scheme will require a significant amount of planning, which is well under way.</P>
    <P>Last month I finalised comprehensive guidelines for the new scheme that will assist local authorities in identifying priority areas and in preparing plans for the areas selected.  Next week I will hold a seminar for relevant local authority staff to discuss the guidelines and to ensure all those involved are fully briefed on the important differences between the new scheme and previous ones.  In the next few weeks I will also discuss incentives for the new scheme with the Minister for Finance in the context of next year's Finance Bill.  When the incentives are in place local authorities will be in a position to complete their integrated area plans and submit them for consideration. Once the assessment process has been concluded and decisions on designations have been made, the final pieces of the preparatory jig-saw for the new scheme will have been put in place.</P>
    <P>Completing this extensive preparatory process will stand to the new scheme in the long term. It will ensure clarity on the role which physical renewal can play in the wider social and economic renewal of the areas designated.  In that way we can secure a better quality of life for those living and working in the areas concerned.</P>

      <P>The budget is the first real test of the Government's economic and social priorities.  While some of its provisions are welcome, the overall response of most people will be one of disappointment.  The Minister has been depicted in various newspapers this morning as a kind of Santa Claus.  We all know that in time presents from Santa Claus do not always seem as impressive as on the day they were received and that, even presents from Santa Claus, must be paid for.</P>
      <P>I could quote a number of comments in today's newspapers from politicians, trade unionists, economists, poverty activists, religious figures critical of the Minister's approach, but I will pick one from an unlikely source, which honestly and accurately sums up the budget.  Mr. Patrick Campbell, group chairman of the Campbell Bewley Group, stated:</P>
      <P>In many ways it was a capital-friendly budget and business people will be happy.  But there is one thing it has seriously failed to do and that is improve the position of low earners.  I think it is a shame for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> The budget was produced in unique circumstances and must be judged against that unique background.  Never before has a Minister for Finance in his first budget inherited such a favourable financial position from the previous Government. Never before had a Minister to prepare a budget when the Exchequer was literally awash with money and never before has a Minister had so many easy decisions to make.</P>
    <P>There is no point in comparing this budget with one five or even one year ago.  The economic picture has changed significantly since then.  People, especially those at the bottom of the ladder, were entitled to expect that, as a result of the unprecedented economic growth to which they had contributed so much, this budget would have been used to begin the process of redistribution of wealth.  Having waited so long they were entitled to believe that the available resources would be directed towards relieving the tax burden on low and middle income earners and significantly improving the position of those dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Instead, the Minister has scattered his resources with as much, if not more, going to the well off as to those in need.  The top rate of income tax has been cut, corporation tax reduced and capital gains tax slashed, yet more concessions have been introduced for farmers &mdash; all measures which, primarily, benefit the relatively well off.  It has certainly been pay back time for those who write and dictate the editorial policy of the <i>Irish Independent</i> but for the majority of workers it will be a case of pay as you were.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months there has been an important debate on the direction that taxation policy should take.  The two alternative strategies advanced were to increase the allowances and widen the bands, as advocated by Democratic Left, or to cut the tax rates as proposed by the Progressive Democrats.  It is interesting that Deputy Molloy praised the budget.  Of course he would do that because, as far as taxation is concerned, it represents the policy of the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>As the debate progressed a substantial consensus has emerged supporting the approach advocated by Democratic Left.  This not only includes the parties in the Rainbow Government but also the trade union movement, the Combat Poverty Agency, INOU, CORI, NESF and even employer organisations such as IBEC and the Small Firms Association.  Deputy Molloy suggested that if one is serious about taxation reform why not propose the reintroduction of the higher tax rates.  He knows that this is unrealistic politically.  It is not a question of seeking to restore those rates but of seeking to restore the balance between the well off and the less well off.  The manner in which tax reforms have been introduced in this budget benefits those who are better off and on higher incomes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy produced figures which indicated that, in addition to family income supplement, those on the average industrial wage will <Col N="362" /> gain in the region of 5 per cent.  Those on higher incomes of £50,000 would gain about 3 per cent. Of course this is the case.  The increase would be less as a percentage of £50,000 than of £15,000.  It is misleading to use percentages in this way.  The reality is the pound in the pocket.  A single person on £9,000 will gain, approximately, £100 per year whereas someone on £50,000 will gain, approximately, £1,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has chosen to ignore the consensus and has instead gone for the narrow, sectional approach of cutting the rates.  During the election campaign we said that, at least, 60 per cent of the available resources should be applied to increasing the personal allowances. Instead, according to my calculations, the Minister has allocated about 26 per cent of the resources available to him for this purpose. Increasing the personal allowances benefits all taxpayers, not just the low paid.  However, it delivers the greatest benefit to those on low and middle incomes.  It is only when the allowances have been increased and the bands widened that the possibility of reducing the upper rate should be even contemplated.</P>
    <P>People argue that the approach proposed by Democratic Left is complicated and that the public can more easily understand a cut in the rate.</P>

      <P>Unemployment is a matter of grave concern to those in the Border region, particularly in Cavan-Monaghan.  The Border region has been excluded from the thousands of jobs announced by the Tánaiste since this Government came into office.  It is the area of the least decline in unemployment.  I could make a strong case for the entire Border region but I wish to make a particular case for Cavan and Monaghan.  There is an unprecedented opportunity for job creation in this region.  We are not holding out a begging bowl but simply claiming our right to some of the jobs created in all of the regions here except the Border region.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Finance spoke about the strength of the economy.  It is only fair that every region should benefit from that prosperity. It would be worrying if the Tánaiste was excluding the Border because her party does not have representation in the region or that she was only targeting areas in which she could hope to gain seats.  That would be wrong, unacceptable and undemocratic and it should not be supported by Government.</P>

      <P>I am talking about the jobs announced during the past six months.  The Deputy, and other Government spokespersons, told us our time would come.  The Celtic tiger has not appeared in Cavan-Monaghan or the Border region.  The violence in Northern Ireland and its spillover into the Republic has created problems for those endeavouring to attract industry and tourism.  I am focusing on job creation through industrial development.  Good sites for the development of industry can be purchased in the region at a cost of from £5,000 to £15,000 per acre.  Today I read that £60,000 per acre is the going price for land in the industrial development areas of the south and south east.</P>
      <P>There is an international focus on the Border region as a result of the peace process which we hope will succeed.  However, part of its success is ensuring that young people have jobs.  The motivation and opportunities which this offers will prevent further crime and allow people to make a constructive contribution to their area.</P>
      <P>I recognise the great work which has been done in the computer industry in the greater Dublin area and Leixlip.  However, it is sad to see hundreds of young people in Cavan-Monaghan taking public and private transport to Dublin every Sunday evening.  These people are willing to work locally.  Our young people have the skills.  The Minister owes us the opportunity to give them employment in their own area.</P>

      <P>Since this Government came to office in June, 73 new jobs have been announced for the Border region: 30 in Letterkenny and 43 in Ballymote, County Sligo.  In addition, there are a number of small indigenous company expansions in the area which will be announced before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland, for its part, has been responding to the challenge of attracting new inward investment to the region through investment in land to enhance the region's marketability.  While, in line with Government policy, factory space will in future be provided by the private as opposed to the public sector, IDA Ireland will retain its role in the promotion of such space for industrial projects. In Dundalk, for example, a new advance factory has recently been completed and, in response to the agency's marketing efforts, keen interest has been expressed by a number of potential clients.  Land acquisitions are also being made elsewhere throughout the region.  For example IDA Ireland has arranged an advance factory of 23,000 square feet to be constructed by private investors on a site in Cavan town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its efforts to attract new investors to the regions, IDA Ireland is favouring locations outside the larger urban centres in every way possible.  That includes offering higher grant levels, as appropriate; stimulating and supporting, with the involvement of private sector investors, a major programme of modern advance building construction at key locations; and working closely with local authorities to have quality sites available <Col N="364" /> at key locations for new industrial investment.</P>
    <P>Forbairt works closely with Irish companies in all regions, helping them to build up their capability and competitiveness and so increase growth and employment.  The agency has been strength-ened at regional level through its network of nine regional offices, two of which are located in the Border region.  Forbairt's northeast office in Dundalk and northwest office in Sligo recorded more than 1,000 first-time jobs in 1996, the latest year for which figures are available.  Under its Community Enterprise Development Programme, Forbairt has assisted and funded community groups in all areas, including the Border region, to provide enterprise centres in areas where suitable work space is in short supply.  In the Border region, for example, enterprise centres have been funded in locations in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal and Leitrim.  As part of its function for promoting companies in the natural resources sector, both Irish and international, Forbairt has successfully attracted overseas investment to a variety of regional locations.  The major investment in the timber processing sector by Masonite in Leitrim and in the food sector by Heinz in Dundalk are two such examples.  Forbairt co-operates with Northern Ireland's Local Economic Development Unit, LEDU, and its Industrial Development Board, IDB, on a number of specific cross-Border initiatives designed to accelerate growth in particular sectors.  These initiatives are funded by the International Fund for Ireland.  The agency is also involved, in tandem with Dundalk regional technical college and the Northern Ireland Small Business Institute, in the management of another cross-Border co-operative initiative designed to aid very small hi-tech start-ups.</P>
    <P>Additionally, cross-Border programmes such as the North American Partnership Programme and AMBIT, which are internationally funded, create opportunities for companies along the Border and in Northern Ireland to make strategic alliances with North American companies, thereby opening up product and process improvement possibilities as well as potential markets and alliances.  Several Irish companies in the Border region have signed technology transfer deals with US corporations in the last two years under the auspices of the programme.  Another programme specifically geared towards the Border region is the INTERREG initiative, and £140 million has been made available under this programme for the six year period from 1994 to 1999.  The aim is to develop human resources, infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and forestry in the Border counties over the life of the programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Sport, Deputy McDaid, announced the provision of a 50 metre pool for Ireland last week.  Roscommon is surrounded by rivers and lakes yet there <Col N="365" /> is no proper swimming pool in the county.  Sports facilities generally are inadequate and there is no cinema in the county.  People are travelling up to 60 miles to swim.</P>
      <P>The Roscommon town pool has been closed for the past month due to lack of funding, although an application for funding is on the Minister's desk.  The pool is in a very poor condition.  There is mould on the walls, the sewage is washing back up through the pipes and the changing facilities are very poor.  Funding is immediately needed. The local sub-aqua club, who do tremendous search and rescue work, use the pool for training. That work is important as the rivers Shannon and Suck run through Roscommon.  They now have to train in Ballinasloe, over 30 miles away, because the pool is closed.  This is a voluntary organisation which is poorly funded, and it is very costly for its members to travel to train.</P>
      <P>Immediate funding is also required for a new pool to be built in Ballaghaderreen, which is ideally suited for tourism.  There are several tourist attractions nearby and it is on the main road to Castlebar.  However, there is no confidence in the north Roscommon area; there is not even a hotel in Ballaghaderreen.  There is a large hinterland around the town, and it is equidistant from Boyle and Castlerea, the other major towns in the area. There are no facilities for this region of Roscommon, which borders Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim.  Over 800 second level students attend the local school and there is a great need for a pool in the area.</P>
      <P>It is a disgrace that a county surrounded by water does not have a swimming pool.  It is also a disgrace that the Government is to fund a 50 metre pool without funding 25 metre pools adequately.  The Minister should approve these applications urgently and ensure that this work is done as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in these projects and I thank him for this opportunity to set out the position.  The Department pays grants of up to 100 per cent of the approved cost of refurbishing existing pools and up to 80 per cent of the approved cost of new swimming pools, with the remainder of the cost being funded by local contribution.  To qualify for a grant, a pool must be built to the Department's specification.  The commitment of funds to a particular project can only be considered when the project design has been approved, and the local authority is in a position to accept a tender.  The overall allocation for the swimming pool programme and the competing demands of other swimming pool projects for the available funds must, of course, be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for the swimming pool programme in 1997 is £3.5 million and the provision for 1998 will be £4 million, which are up 75 per cent and 100 per cent respectively on the 1996 provision.  The cost of swimming pool projects has risen considerably over the last few years because of the general increases in construction costs and <Col N="366" /> the higher standard of facilities being provided. Commitments in respect of approved projects under construction, or on which construction is expected to commence shortly, amount to £7.5 million.  In addition, further applications for funding, including the Roscommon and Ballaghaderreen proposals, amount to over £48 million.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Roscommon pool, detailed preliminary proposals for refurbishment at an estimated cost of £1.5 million were approved, in principle, by the Department in August 1995. Roscommon County Council was allowed to proceed with the preparation of contract documents for the work involved.  Copies of these documents were submitted to the Department in October 1996.  Having regard to the high level of demand for swimming pool funding generally, it is not possible to indicate when funding will be available for the pool in Roscommon town.  The new pool proposal for Ballaghaderreen is also estimated to cost £1.5 million.  It will not be possible to simultaneously fund both projects and it will, therefore, be some considerable time before any commitment can be given to provide funding for the latter pool.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: This matter dates from June 1997, not January, which may be a misprint on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Members of Carlow Urban Council approved the building of 26 houses in Shaw Park, Athy Road, Carlow after all necessary conditions were fulfilled.  This was local democracy at work.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, swept aside local democracy in the callous and uncaring way he overruled their decisions.  There are 500 people on the housing list and many others are willing to build their own.  Ten people form the Carlow Friendly Housing Co-operative Society and received permission from Carlow Urban District Council to build in Shaw Park.  The Minister has now said they cannot.</P>
      <P>The 26 houses, ten co-op and 16 local authority houses, are badly needed.  The procedures were followed and people were given an opportunity to make submissions.  Eventually departmental approval was given in June 1997.  The co-operative society has accepted the tender of a local contractor, acquired the sites and drawn lots for houses one to ten.  The 16 local authority houses would be under way were it not for the questions posed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The people waiting for houses are absolutely shattered by the Minister's refusal to allow their plans proceed.  The question that must be answered is why the Minister has a special interest in Carlow.  He will spend much time explaining that he is &ldquo;against the loss of public space for new housing&rdquo; as stated in the letter of refusal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shaw Park consists of 5.27 acres, half of which will be used for housing and the other half will be landscaped with amenity facilities.  For many <Col N="367" /> years Shaw Park has been derelict and unsuitable because of its hidden position.  The housing development, as proposed on part of the park, would provide the social control which will ensure that the remainder of the park, which would be developed to a high standard, has the prospect of being enjoyed by the new residents and Carlow people in general.</P>
    <P>There are two other parks owned by the local authority &mdash; Graiguecullen Park which consists of 12.5 acres and Hanover Park which consists of 13.15 acres.  The ongoing improvement in Hanover Park, under the urban renewal scheme, will provide much needed facilities.  Why has permission been refused?  I suggest the reason is far less noble than loss of open spaces.  Among the submissions made to the urban district council in 1996 was one from Jim Gibbons, Athy Road, Carlow who objected to the building of houses.  He said:</P>
    <P>Naturally our objections are different from those of the general public as we, the under-signed, [there were three] have our residences adjacent to the park and have little doubt but that we will suffer an invasion of our privacy in terms of being overlooked, greater noise and probable trespass.</P>
    <P>A further comment was:</P>
    <P>At this stage we would like to know what measures are proposed by Carlow Urban District Council to protect our interests and our property?  We are conscious of this because in the past we have suffered much damage by way of theft, trespass and vandalism from the public because of the council's failure to secure their boundaries.</P>
    <P>This Jim Gibbons is now Senator Jim Gibbons and chairman of the PD parliamentary party.  I suggest it is because of his influence the Minister has banned the housing development in Shaw Park.  The Minister looked after his own.  This matter is serious for local democracy, for the people who looked forward to being housed and the Minister of State who has preached high standards. We now have low standards in high places with the &ldquo;pals act&rdquo; alive and well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I utterly reject the contemptible allegations and insinuations made by Deputy Browne about my motivations in the stance I have taken on this issue which I consider to be very important.  I did not expect the Deputy would descend to such depths.  I had no knowledge of what was contained in any of the letters he has read.  I will explain the situation and the reason I have suggested the local authority should have a rethink and find an alternative site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing development to which Deputy Browne refers consists of two separate proposals, one for the construction of ten houses by the Carlow Friendly Co-operative Society on a site in Shaw Park made available by Carlow Urban District <Col N="368" /> Council and the second for the construction of 16 local authority houses on another part of the same site.</P>
    <P>The development of the housing by the co-operative society was to be facilitated by the disposal of sites at a subsidised cost to the society by the urban district council under the sale of housing sites scheme.  The plans for the local authority housing were discussed and agreed at local level between the local authority and the Department's technical inspectorate and design approval issued in June 1997.  However, because of my concern with the choice of an existing public park as a site for housing, I am not disposed to make public funds available to provide housing at this location.  Schemes of this nature are worthwhile and I have no hesitation in commending Carlow Urban District Council for promoting the development of voluntary and local authority housing in close proximity on the same site.</P>
    <P>The selection of the site is, arguably, the single most important consideration in the process of providing housing.  New housing development will have a significant contribution to make to the area in which it is located.  Substantial public funds are invested in the provision of social housing and the range of options now open to housing authorities affords them a measure of flexibility that was not available in former years.  It is essential that authorities avail of the opportunities provided by the social housing programme to ensure that their housing schemes will not only provide good living environments but will contribute to the integrated development of the areas in which they are located.</P>
    <P>Decisions at local level about social housing have to be taken with a view to their impact on the availability of public amenities for the area as a whole.  It should not be necessary to sacrifice a public park or other designated recreational areas to housing.  Carlow is a significant town with a bright economic future and it should not be beyond the capacity of the local authority to find an alternative location to enable the housing schemes to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I appreciate it is imperative for the housing authority to meet housing need within the framework of the programmes and their capital allocations. They must also weigh carefully the balance of advantage and disadvantage in losing a public recreational resource.  It has been suggested to me that parks and other similar recreational areas often become the venue for anti-social behaviour and consequently become unusable. This is a reflection on the management by local authorities of such important local resources.  Denying the public as a whole is not the answer.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that every effort be made to overcome the difficulties that have arisen.  I am arranging for an official from my Department to meet the county manager, the town clerk and representatives of the co-operative society with a view to resolving the matter to everyone's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> I know this park and had the privilege of opening a swimming pool there on a beautiful sunny day in 1971.  My recollection of the park on that occasion is one of vivid colour and beauty and a happy local community assembled in this open space.</P>

    <P>Baineann an cheist seo le Sórd Colm Cille, an baile is mó i mo Dháilcheantar féin.  Tá cabhairá lorg agam do na daltaí is laige atá ag freastal ar scoileanna sa cheantar, agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil <Col N="370" /> fadhbanna eile ag na daltaí san ag cur isteach orthu.  Is mór an fhadhb é nach bhfuil freastal ceart acu, áfach.</P>
    <P>According to the 1996 census Swords is the fourth largest town in the country after Dundalk, Bray and Drogheda and it is regarded as the fastest growing town in Europe.  It is amazing that in the four post-primary schools in the town which cater for 2,200 pupils there is only one special class which caters for 17 pupils.  Others have applied for places but have been informed that they cannot be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Special education is organised in different ways.  In some schools children with special needs are catered for in the mainstream with the help of a remedial teacher while in others there is a special class dedicated to meeting their needs.  All schools should be adequately resourced to allow them offer appropriate special education facilities. What is happening in Swords is that schools are able to claim they are not in a position to provide a special education service because they are grossly under-resourced and consequently are able to refuse pupils who apply for places.</P>
    <P>This places parents in an impossible position &mdash; between a rock and a hard place.  They have to make a decision whether to send their child with special needs to a school which they know cannot cater for their further needs.  There are families in Swords one member of which attends one school while the member with special needs has to attend a separate school.  This is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It is not just a question of resources which must be provided.  Will the Minister indicate whether each school in the Swords area is in a position to cater for children with special needs on a fair and equitable basis?  If not, there is a danger they will be concentrated in one or two schools.  There is not an even spread.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the budget it is clear that there is a two tier economic system, the origins of which can be traced back to the education system.  While some schools are expected to cater for pupils with special needs, others earn a name for themselves as schools which cater for pupils of much higher ability intellectually without equipping them, because of their narrow focus, to live in an egalitarian society which caters for the needs of all, not just those who are able to survive in the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Thar cheann an Aire, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuilim buíoch don Teachta a chur an cheist seo faoina Dáilcheantar féin.  Tugann sé seans dúinn an cheist a mhíniú.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter as it affords me an opportunity to inform the House of the provision which is being made to address the needs of special needs pupils at second level generally and in the Swords area particularly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Children with special needs have access to a wide range of special support services which are tailored to meet the variety of special needs which can be present.  In many instances children with special needs are capable of being catered <Col N="371" /> for in the ordinary school setting with the help, where necessary, of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.  In more serious cases the needs of the child may be such that placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school is the most appropriate response.  The Department of Education and Science makes every effort to ensure no child with special needs is denied access to an adequate education service.</P>
    <P>In May 1990 a resolution on the education of children with special educational needs was adopted unanimously at the EU Council of Education Ministers.  The salient points are as follows: member states agreed to intensify, where necessary, their efforts to integrate or encourage integration of children with disabilities into mainstream schools in all appropriate cases. Integration into the mainstream should be considered as a first option in all appropriate cases. The work of special schools should be seen as complementary to the work of ordinary schools. References to integration &ldquo;in all appropriate cases&rdquo; and &ldquo;the work of special schools being seen as complementary to the work of ordinary schools&rdquo; clearly indicate that, while integration is the preferred option, it should not be pursued to the exclusion of arrangements in more specialised settings.</P>
    <P>The Special Education Review Committee was established in 1991 to report and to make recommendations on the educational provision for children with special educational needs.  The terms of the EU resolution accord with the views of the Special Education Review Committee whose report was published in 1993.  The report stated that the committee held &ldquo;no entrenched doctrinaire position regarding the integration into the ordinary school system of pupils with disabilities and-or special needs.  Our philosophy could best be summed up by saying that we favour as much integration as is appropriate and feasible with as little segregation as is necessary.  We therefore envisage a system in which there will be a place for both ordinary and special schools&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The committee was of the view that &ldquo;it will be <Col N="372" /> necessary to establish a continuum of services to match the continuum of special needs.  Decisions on the placement of pupils along this continuum must be based on the assessed needs of the pupil, the range of services available, professional advice and the preference of parents&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to cater for the needs of special needs pupils in recent years.  Additional <i>ex-quota</i> remedial posts were allocated to second level schools.  There are now 350 such posts at second level.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision which has been made in the remedial area, additional resource posts have been allocated to cater for the needs of special needs pupils attending second level schools.  A total of 56 resource posts were allocated to second level schools in 1995.  Schools were invited to apply for the posts on a specially designed application form.  Selection of the schools for the allocation of posts was done on the basis of the information contained on those forms and having regard to the recommendations of the inspectorate.  There are more than 140 resource posts allocated to second level schools in the current school year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area referred to by the Deputy, a special class has been established in a school within the area of administration of County Dublin Vocational Education Committee and two resource posts have been allocated to the school to cater for the needs of the pupils concerned. A further resource post has been allocated to another vocational education committee school in the area to cater for the needs of special needs pupils attending that school.</P>
    <P>The Minister is fully committed to improving the provision in the education area and in particular for children with special needs.  There are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education.  These demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints. The position will be kept under review with a view to allocating additional resource posts when resources permit.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 9 December 1997.</P>

      <P>My Department operates a number of strategies to provide opportunities for second chance education.  These include funding for adult literacy and community education.  The recent OECD report on adult literacy in Ireland gave some cause for concern.  My Department will consider the issues raised in this report, but, as an immediate response, I am increasing the provision for adult literacy by £2 million for 1998.  I will continue to increase funding in this area as resources become available.</P>
      <P>New initiatives have been agreed for 1998 and 1999 in respect of Youthreach, a programme targeted at 15-18 year olds who left school without any qualifications.  These initiatives involve increasing the numbers by over 1,000 for Youthreach and traveller training programmes, the strengthening of counselling, guidance and psychological services and a redirection of FÁS participants to places on Youthreach.  Under these measures, the provision for Youthreach will be increased by £22.69 million in 1998 and 1999 and will bring the number of places for participants from 4,525 places to a minimum of 6,250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To attract to the Youthreach and vocational training opportunities schemes people who cannot join them at present because of childcare responsibilities, £2.7 million will be provided between now and 1999 for childcare services for <Col N="374" /> these schemes.  In addition, grants totalling £600,000 will be awarded to women's voluntary education groups between now and 1999.</P>
    <P>In the area of student support, the position is that students who attended but did not successfully complete courses, and who return to courses at the same level following a break of at least five years, are eligible for funding under the student support schemes and the free fees initiative.</P>
    <P>General issues relating to the expansion of the provision of second chance education will be explored in the forthcoming Green Paper on Adult Education.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 41 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>Rerouting of primary and post-primary school transport services is carried out each year by Bus Éireann, as part of a routine reorganisation and monitoring of services to take account of demographic changes.  The school transport review committee has recently completed an extensive review of the school transport system.  The effects of declining enrolments on school transport in rural areas was one of the issues specifically highlighted in the committee's terms of reference and I understand that it has been comprehensively addressed in the committee's report.</P>
      <P>The report of the school transport review committee was received by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in September 1997, and is currently being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>It is intended to publish the report early in 1998 and to ensure that it receives the widest possible dissemination.  My aim is to stimulate an extensive debate on the contents of the report before making final decisions on any future changes to the school transport scheme.  I want to make it quite clear that I will not take any decisions until I have reflected on the debate.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the reported remarks referred to by the Deputy.  However, I can confirm that all national schools, including multi-denominational schools, are eligible for capital grants when they have been granted permanent recognition by my Department.  The actual choice of projects for funding depends on the resources available and the relative priority of individual cases.</P>
      <P>To establish whether a multi-denominational school has a viable future, it is normal practice to grant provisional recognition to the school for a period.  Because of the provisional nature of the school's recognition at this stage, no capital grants are paid to it.  However, if the school is being conducted in rented premises, the Department contributes 50 per cent of the cost of the rent.</P>
      <P>If, over a period of a few years, the school proves its viability through developing its enrolment it is then granted permanent recognition and, as stated, becomes eligible for capital grants in the normal way.  The same arrangements apply to gaelscoileanna and to any school whose future enrolment needs to be established.</P>
      <P>The criteria for the recognition of all categories of national school, and related matters such as capital grants, are the subject of a major review being undertaken at present by the commission on school accommodation needs.  Educate Together, the umbrella body for multi-denominational schools, is represented on the commission's steering group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The results reported in the survey quoted in the Deputy's question are a cause for concern.  They indicate, as do the results of other surveys, a continuing increase in the consumption of alcohol by young people and at earlier age levels. This is not only an issue for schools but must also cause everybody to question general attitudes to drinking and the place of alcohol in the life of the community.  A programme of substance misuse prevention education for second level schools, On My Own Two Feet, was introduced in the autumn of 1994.  This programme has a particular focus on education about the use of alcohol and includes substantial associated in-service training.  A similar programme for primary <Col N="376" /> schools is in the course of development at present.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has been preparing school curricula and guidelines for teachers, at primary and second level, on the introduction of social, personal and health education which will include education about the use of alcohol.  The curricula and teacher guidelines at primary level have been completed by the NCCA and will be available very shortly.</P>
      <P>The NCCA guidelines, for the junior cycle of post-primary level, have been drafted and will be available later in 1998.  I understand that the NCCA will be advising that an identified place on the timetable of schools be allocated for social, personal and health education, including education about alcohol use.  I intend to act on that advice.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ground has been well prepared through the introduction of the programmes of substance misuse education at both levels. Approximately 1,300 post-primary teachers have participated in training programmes to date.  Over 200 primary teachers have participated in training programmes on substance misuse education since the beginning of this school year.  This training is ongoing at both levels.</P>
      <P>The general approach and the continuing initiatives of my Department should be seen in the context of overall national policy on alcohol, the misuse of which is a major issue for everybody. My Department will support the introduction and development of programmes in schools and will continue to co-operate with the Department of Health and Children in the matter. However, parents have a primary responsibility in helping children and young people to adopt sensible and responsible attitudes and behaviour in relation to alcohol.  In particular, the drinks industry needs to adopt a responsible attitude to the promotion of alcoholic drinks, especially in relation to targeting young people; and retailers should ensure that the law on the sale of alcoholic drink, to those under the legal age limit, is carefully observed.  In general, the community, as a whole, needs to reflect on the general attitude to alcohol use, where such use seems to be regarded now as a necessary element of all occasions of celebration and enjoyment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>Maximum class size guidelines do exist throughout the primary school system.  The existing maximum class size guidelines are as follows: 35 pupils in the case of a single class unit; 34 pupils in the case of two consecutive classes; 31 pupils in the case of a multi-class unit; and 29 pupils in any unit in schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>The maximum class size guideline for one-teacher schools with more than four standards is 28.  In addition, there are lower class sizes for schools participating in pilot programmes.  While the allocation of teachers to classes is, of course, the responsibility of the school principal and board of management, maximum class size guidelines aim to ensure that schools do not have excessively large classes.</P>
      <P>Information available for statistical returns submitted to my Department by schools suggests that there are classes in breach of these guidelines.  I should also point out to the Deputy that very many schools have classes which are much smaller than the maxima.  It is important to emphasise, however, that, where maximum class size guidelines are breached in a particular class or classes in a school, this decision is often taken within the school to facilitate much smaller classes elsewhere in the same school.  Where schools are unable to organise their classes within the recommended maxima, they may apply to my Department for the appointment of an additional teacher.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The education technology investment fund is central to my strategy for upgrading regional technical colleges.  This is a £250 million investment programme, over a three year period. About £100 million will be invested in the technological sector.  This is an historic level of investment in the sector and will underpin the sector's role in the promotion of economic and social well-being.  These funds will be additional to the existing investment programmes of support for the sector.  This is real upgrading.  It addresses a core issue for the colleges &mdash; resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> I will also move on the legislative front.  My objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
    <P>Following necessary consultation I hope to publish legislation as early as possible next year which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development.</P>
    <P>Institutions in the technological sector have a distinctive and unique mission which this Government wishes to maintain and develop.  As the Deputy is aware, the Universities Act, 1997, sets out a specific process to be followed where an institution seeks university status.  This process is, as it should be, independent of political influence. I agree with the need to change the title of regional technical colleges to incorporate the common feature institute of technology, as recommended in the report of the high level group on the technological sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>A new ten classroom junior school is planned for Cherry Orchard, Dublin 10, under the patron-age of the Archbishop of Dublin.  The archdiocese identified a site for the proposed school and my Department's building unit has prepared sketch scheme drawings.</P>
      <P>These drawings have been referred to the patron's local representative who is currently consulting widely in respect of the plans.  The patron's representative has recently indicated that this process involved issuing a mailshot to each house in the parish and that he will then be in touch with my Department.  As soon as the plans are agreed my Department will assist the archdiocese with an application for planning permission for the project.  On receipt of planning permission the archdiocese will proceed with the acquisition of the site and my Department will undertake detailed design work and the preparation of the tender documentation for the scheme.</P>
      <P>The timescales for planning stages of major building projects vary in each individual case and, therefore, I am not in a position to give an accurate timescale for each stage of this project. However, I assure the Deputy that my Department will give this project priority.</P>
      <P>When all the necessary planning work is completed a decision will be taken on the timing of the tender and contract process in the light of existing contractual commitments and available funding at the time.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputies that I share the concerns which they have highlighted in relation to the problem of non-school attendance.  I am aware of the findings of the study in west Dublin to which a number of Deputies referred.  These findings give sharp focus to the extent of the problem and the need for firm corrective action.  My Department is currently working on draft legislation to deal with the complex issues involved in non-school attendance.

      <P>I should mention that significant measures are already in place to address the issues of truancy and early school leaving.  These include: pre-school services, including early start, remedial services; the home-school-community liaison service; the teaching counsellor scheme; youth encounter projects; the breaking the cycle project and the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I am currently reviewing provision in all these areas to ensure that available resources are targeted to maximum effect.</P>

    <P>Arising from the mid-term review of EU funding, significant resources have been made available for 1998 and 1999 to focus on children in the eight-15 year age range who are at risk of early school leaving or who are already outside the mainstream school system.  I intend to announce <Col N="382" /> an initiative in this regard shortly.  The initiatives will involve partnerships of local agencies, in urban and rural areas, with schools collaborating with voluntary and statutory bodies in the delivery of preventative and support services for young people in the age range.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures outlined above, coupled with the proposed new school attendance legislation, will have a major impact on the problems which the Deputies have highlighted.</P>

      <P>I fully support the creation of meaningful links between the regional technical colleges with new technological parks and industry.  A number of initiatives in this area are at present being undertaken by the private sector, the IDA and others, including the development of technological parks adjacent to the colleges.  In addition, the proposed site for the new third level institution in Blanchardstown forms part of a new scientific, industrial and business park which is being developed by Fingal County Council and the IDA.  I strongly welcome these initiatives.  My plans in this regard are to support both the research and innovative capabilities of the third <Col N="384" /> level institutions to a level where the service park concept can be realised in a realistic way.</P>
      <P>The development of technological parks on the campuses of the regional technical colleges themselves is restricted due mainly to the limited size of the existing sites and the extent to which they are required to accommodate new buildings which are urgently needed to provide additional student places.</P>
      <P>The most pressing need with respect to the regional technical colleges is to maintain the relevance and quality of their programmes to the needs of students and the economy.  The £250 million scientific and technological education (investment) fund which I launched last month constitutes a comprehensive and co-ordinated strategy of investment in education, with particular emphasis on the development of technology education at all levels, including areas such as improved infrastructure development, equipment upgrading and enhanced research and development activities.</P>

      <P>Primary schools are inspected every five to six years by my Department's inspectorate.  Reports on these inspections are furnished to my Department and copies are sent to the principal of the school and the chairperson of the board of management.

      <P>This country also participates in international surveys of curricular attainment in primary and second level schools conducted by international organisations.  Such surveys have been carried out in recent years in literacy, mathematics and science. It is intended to expand our participation in such surveys to include other areas of the curriculum where appropriate.</P>
      <P>Consultations are taking place at present between my Department and the teachers' unions and other partners on the introduction of a new system of inspection in all schools at both primary and second level.  The assessment of the quality of education in school will be an important objective of this inspection.  It is intended to pilot the use of agreed indicators of quality in consultation with the partners in a small number of schools in 1998.</P>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that a recent speech on the occasion of the launch of the education technology investment fund highlights the commitment of the present Government to addressing the future needs of our education system. The fund will help to protect and to promote job creation and it will also ensure that a clear medium-term framework is in place for financing the development of scientific and technological education in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to ensure that current inequalities of skill and income are not increased or reinforced.  I will ensure that appropriate structures are in place to facilitate access to education, training and skill development for those who are disadvantaged or excluded at present.  At the recent launch of Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium, I clearly stated that I will target assistance at disadvantaged schools, both rural and urban, in order to ensure that all schools are operating on a level playing pitch with regard to access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) for education.</P>
      <P>In particular, I am putting in place the infrastructure to ensure that all schools have sufficient computers and Internet access and that teachers have the requisite training and skill development to integrate ICTs effectively into first and second level curricula.  Arrangements for the provision of ICTs will be applied in such a way as will ensure that schools in disadvantaged areas, urban and rural, will not fall behind schools with access to greater resources.</P>

Curriculum guidelines were issued to all teachers in the context of the training programmes and a policy development pack on RSE for use by schools in preparing their policy in this area has also been issued.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, following completion of all necessary consultation, I will be in a position to publish draft legislation which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector while also acknowledging and recognising the contribution which each institution can make within that sector.</P>
      <P>My objective is to facilitate individual colleges in fulfilling their particular missions in meeting the social and economic development needs of their regions while maintaining the empowering coherence of a national technological sector.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I agree with the need to change the title of regional technical colleges to incorporate the common feature institute of technology, as recommended in the report of the high level group on the technological sector.</P>
      <P>However, the single most important issue which will underpin the future of colleges is resources.  Through the education technology investment fund, I have secured a major investment programme for the colleges which will re-inforce their role as key components of the economic development of their regions.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a well-defined process is in place to evaluate whether institutions should award their own qualifications. This involves rigorous evaluation by national and international experts.  Waterford and Cork are currently going through this process.</P>

      <P>Physical education is a compulsory part of the primary school curriculum and schools are required to teach the subject to all pupils for a recommended time of one hour per week.  The purpose of the physical education programme in primary schools is to develop a healthy lifestyle in the pupils and to assist them in acquiring skills and attitudes which will enable them to achieve physical fitness and maintain a healthy way of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The curriculum in physical education in primary schools is being reviewed at present by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment as part of the general review of the primary school curriculum.  The implementation of the revised curriculum in physical education will be <Col N="391" /> supported by a programme of in-career development for teachers.</P>
    <P>Many schools have a general purposes room and my Department has provided grants for the acquisition of large physical education equipment for use in such rooms.  Practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are utilised for teaching different aspects of the physical education programme. Many schools also use adjacent local facilities such as public parks and playing fields and swimming pools.  This has enabled schools to involve their children in a variety of physical games and activities. It is also open to boards of management to use the devolved grants scheme to improve facilities for physical education in schools.</P>
    <P>I have engaged the educational research centre to review all the planning data relating to primary school facilities.  In particular I have drawn the attention of the educational research centre to the question of general purposes rooms and other indoor facilities as it is my intention to improve accommodation in schools for the teaching of physical education.  While awaiting the report of the educational research centre I have decided to increase the floor area and height of general purposes rooms currently being planned.</P>

      <P>I would like to clarify that I have removed examination fees from all students who are covered by the medical card scheme either directly or as the dependants of medical card holders.  The new provision is possible because I have secured extra funding of £1.6 million for the alleviation of examination fees in 1998 bringing the total amount available for that purpose to £2.1 million.</P>
      <P>My priority was to target those most in need of assistance and that is why I have concentrated the available funding on the removal of fees for those covered by the medical card scheme.</P>

      <P>The emergence of skills shortages in the tourism sector has become a matter of great concern to the Government, given the significance of the industry to the economy.  The present capacity of the education system to respond to the problem was constrained by the infrastructural inadequacies of the regional technical colleges, many of which were established more than 25 years ago.  In addition, much of the existing infrastructure is unsuitable and is in need of replacement.</P>
      <P>Significant capital investment is, therefore, required to facilitate the enhancement of existing facilities and the provision of the additional places.  A provision of £20 million from the scientific and technological education (investment) fund is being set aside to support appropriate tourism related capital developments in the colleges. These funds will be additional to the existing investment programmes of support for the sector.</P>
      <P>Decisions concerning the level and timing of support for the additional places at the various colleges will be made early in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 48 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium gives particular priority to special needs children through its commitment to equal opportunity and the priority it attaches to the provision of remedial teachers and resources for children with special learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that it is my intention to honour this commitment in the years ahead. As part of this process, I am currently reviewing provision across the entire special needs area to ensure that all resources which become available are utilised to maximum effect.  Decisions on any additional resource allocations in 1998 to special needs areas, including the remedial and resource teacher areas, will be taken following completion of this review.</P>
      <P>The information requested by Deputy Spring in relation to remedial and resource teacher allocations over the period 1990 to date is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Where special needs children are concerned, it is necessary to view each case on an individual basis.  For some children, the nature of the special need may be such that the child can function quite successfully in an integrated setting with the support, where necessary, of a remedial, resource or visiting teacher.  Significant numbers of these special support teachers are already in place.  However, there will continue to be cases where the nature or severity of the special need is such as to require placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary school.  A wide range of such facilities are provided and each receives a special level of staffing and funding which reflects the severity of the needs being catered for.  If Deputy Callely is aware of specific instances in which children with special needs have been denied access to support services, he may wish to bring these cases to the attention of my Department so that they can be investigated.</P>

      <Col N="395" /> The provision under the Youthreach programme for unqualified early school leavers within the vocational education committee sector has expanded progressively since its introduction, and has increased from 500 places at the end of 1989 to 2,450 places approved in 1997.  The increase in 1998 includes the carry-over costs of the 450 extra places approved during 1997, along with provision for a further 375 additional places in 1998, and a new guidance, counselling and psychological service for the programme.  This investment will be complemented by the provision of 250 extra places for Traveller early school leavers within the senior traveller training centres, and a substantial increase within the FAS system.  Overall, provision of places for early school leavers in 1998 by FAS and the vocational education committees will increase from 4,525 places to a minimum of 6,250 places.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the rapid rate of change in the economy and the labour market has important implications for career guidance.  There <Col N="396" /> is a need for current information on career options to be readily available to guidance counsellors. This information must be updated frequently.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) has been established by my Department in order to provide the support needed by guidance practitioners.  Its functions include the preparation, publication and dissemination of careers materials.  The NCGE regularly issues newsletters to all guidance counsellors which include information about the latest trends and resources.</P>
      <P>In early 1997, the national centre published the report on the survey, Careers Information Materials in Irish Schools.  The recommendations in this report have led to the formulation of a detailed action plan by the management committee of NCGE.  This plan is currently being implemented.</P>
      <P>I recognise the potential of information and communications technology to enable speedy updating and dissemination of information on careers.  Following the EU conference, Guidance in the Information Society, which was held in Dublin in 1996, the NCGE has produced a hand-book Supporting Career Guidance in the Information Society.  This includes comprehensive lists of the existing computer assisted software and relevant Internet websites for guidance.  This handbook has been published and made available to all guidance counsellors.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years' duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the intiative in 1995-96 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  The free fees initiative does not extend to students pursuing part-time or evening courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest available figures in relation to part-time students are those in respect of the 1995-96 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third level.  Data is not readily available in relation to fee levels.  However, using an average estimated fee of £1,200 for 22,000 students the cost of extending the free fees initiative <Col N="397" /> to part-time students would be in the region of £26 million.  Any decision on extending eligibility for free fees would have to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
    <P>In its report, the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education, referred to the profile of part-time students and noted that almost 90 per cent were in employment. In this context, tax relief is available, at the standard rate under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, for tuition fees paid by eligible students attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that under the third level allowance scheme adminstered by the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs unemployed people can pursue third level education on a full-time basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The report of Sir Don Dearing on the future of higher education in the UK was published in July 1997.  Arising from this report, Mr. David Blunkett, the UK Secretary of State for Education and Employment, announced that he planned to introduce an annual tuition fee of up to £1,000 depending on parental income, that tuition would continue to be free for students from lower income families and that maintenance grants would be replaced by student loans.  He further advised that a White Paper, which has yet to be published, will detail the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, it is not possible, in advance of the publication of the White Paper, to fully assess <Col N="398" /> the implications of the Dearing recommendations on the number of places in the higher education system or on students from the Republic who are attending college in Britain.  My officials have had preliminary discussions with their counterparts in the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and I have arranged to meet with the Secretary of State later this month to discuss this and other matters.</P>
    <P>In the 1995-96 academic year, the last year for which statistics are available, there were 1,400 students from Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in Exchequer funded third level institutions in the Republic of Ireland.  The combined figures for students from the Republic who are studying in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland for 1994-95 indicate that there were almost 10,000 students pursuing higher education courses.  I understand that the number of third level students from the Republic studying in Northern Ireland was some 4,000 in 1995-96 which would suggest that there were some 6,000 students studying in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Assistance from the EU Structural Funds for the period 1994-99 is provided to my Department in respect of specific measures in support of the human resources development priorities identified in the Community Support Framework 1994-99.</P>
      <P>These measures are implemented nationally across the first, second and third levels of education through schools, vocational education committees, the technological sector, and the universities and include support for curricular reform in the senior cycle as well as programmes such as the vocational preparation and training (VPT) programme and vocational training opportunities scheme (VTOS) and certificate and diploma courses in the regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technology and the WIT.</P>
      <P>The Agenda 2000 communication from the EU Commission deals with the financing priorities of the Union for the years 2000 to 2006, in the context of the enlargement of the Union.  In the context of Structural Funds, proposals contained in Agenda 2000 recognise the need for transitional arrangements for those regions currently eligible under Objective 1, but where living standards (measured in GDP <i>per capita</i>) have increased beyond the level of 75 per cent of the Community average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> There is a strong recognition in Agenda 2000 of the crucial role of education which it states is &ldquo;a powerful tool for social equity and inclusion&rdquo;. It proposes, in this context, that a new objective should be created which would pursue a strategy to &ldquo;help the member states to adapt and modernise their systems of education, training and employment&rdquo;.  The Commission's proposals will of course be the subject of detailed negotiations at Council.</P>
    <P>Any reduction in the overall level of transfers to Ireland in the next programme period would have implications across the whole range of Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>The level of transfers to the education sector from the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Free Trade Association are very substantial (an average 180.5 mecu at 1994 prices) in the current Community Support Framework.</P>
    <P>Therefore we need to examine carefully the potential implications of any reduction in such transfers in terms of the existing range of measures supported by the EU Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>To this end, I immediately established a working group in my Department to examine the implications for the education sector of Agenda 2000 proposals.  My Department's consideration of these matters will feed into the overall consideration by the Government of the issues arising in the post-1999 situation.</P>
    <P>I have already had a meeting with the EU Commissioner responsible for employment and industrial relations and social affairs, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, to discuss matters relevant to the European Social Fund, with a view to ensuring that there is a recognition within the Commission of the importance of continued European Social Fund support, in the post-1999 period, for the vital role of education and training in the enhancing of employment prospects and in our continued economic development.</P>

      <P>I have acted on the report of the CIRCA group, A Comparative International Assessment of the Organisation, Management and Funding of University Research in Ireland and Europe, which was published in 1997.  The report identified the need for a significant increase in the level of public funding available for university research and the need for reforms in research management in the university sector.  The report made a range of recommendations, including the <Col N="400" /> establishment of two research councils under the Higher Education Authority, one for science and technology and one for humanities and social science. It also recommended the introduction of a student support scheme for postgraduate and post-doctoral research.  The Higher Education Authority which commissioned the CIRCA report has supported the broad thrust of the report and its recommendations.</P>
      <P>I do accept the need for additional investment in university research and indeed, in this regard, provision has been included in the 1998 Estimates for a major fund of £5 million for research and development projects.  The administrative arrangements for this fund are currently under consideration in my Department.</P>
      <P>This funding is in addition to the £30 million investment announced as part of the education technology investment fund for a equipment renewal programme and the £15 million which will be provided from that fund to meet the capital needs of promoting research and development and technology transfer.</P>
      <P>These additional funding provisions represent a significant response by this Government to the priorities contained in the CIRCA report and the earlier recommendations of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council and complement the range of existing measures in place to support research and development activity taking place in our third level institutions.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the guidelines is to ensure that good practice obtains in the way in which discipline matters are dealt with by schools generally.

In reaching decisions in individual cases, school authorities have to balance carefully the needs of individual students with their responsibility to the general body of their students.

      <P>The draft legislation to establish the fund, which I have presented to the Seanad, provides that private sector donations may be made subject to any conditions as may be specified by donors, provided that such conditions are not inconsistent with the functions of the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Finance under the Bill.  This will enable private sector donors, if they so wish, to specify how their contributions to the fund should be spent.</P>

      <P>The question of providing a means-tested maintenance grants support scheme for PLC students along the lines of the higher education grants scheme has been examined fully by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment <Col N="404" /> to the introduction of equitable support for students attending PLC courses.  This commitment reflects the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector, and a maintenance grants scheme will be introduced. The administrative arrangements for this are complex and timings will depend on the completion of this planning.</P>
    <P>My Department is providing over £39 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses which are playing a key role in preparing young people for employment and further education/training.  These courses are a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>In the international teleservices area, I have approved the provision of 690 places in 20 selected centres under which a two year NCVA certified PLC course is being provided as part of the national response to emerging skill needs of the industry.  This has been accompanied by an investment of £1.5 million in the selected centres to enable them to provide a quality programme consistent with industry needs.  As this new initiative involves extensive placement abroad, a new student support scheme is being introduced towards the cost of the overseas placement.</P>
    <P>In addition, the new education technology investment fund, will provide £250 million in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership with industry. Twenty million pounds of this will be available for PLC courses and apprenticeships.  This is the first time since the initiation of PLCs that substantial capital investment has been devoted to the sector.</P>
    <P>Through action to properly resource different aspects of their work, I am confident that, over the lifetime of this Government, we will consistently demonstrate our commitment to recognising and promoting the role of the PLC sector.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 63, 71, 100 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates which were published recently do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure.  It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up-to-date outturn figures.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.  This process will extend over the next number of months and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputies, I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants, including the eligiblity rules.  In the 1995-96 academic year, almost 26,000 students received grants under the higher education grants scheme at a cost in 1996 of over £51 million.  Maintenance grants have been increased in recent years in line with changes in the consumer price index.  Similarly, the reckonable income limits for grant eligibility have been increased in line with movements in the average industrial wage.  The maintenance grants rates for 1997-98 are:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The net provision in the 1997 Estimates for first level education amounted to £668,883,000.  This provision included a sum of £17,222,000 targeted specifically at primary schools in disadvantaged areas to support the following services: the early start pre-school programme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home-school community laison service, the breaking the cycle pilot programme, the teaching counsellor scheme, and the school books schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above provision, schools in disadvantaged areas also have access to the remedial and resource teacher services.  The total cost of these services in 1997 is estimated at £28,000,000.  It is not possible to estimate accurately the proportion of this expenditure which applies to schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including supports for disadvantaged areas, to ensure that all available resources are deployed to maximum effect.</P>
      <P>The abridged Estimates which have been published recently do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure.  It is normal practice for Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up-to-date outturn figures.</P>

      <P>The report of the advisory committee on third level student support, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, was published in February 1995.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumber-some and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
      <P>The advisory committee recommended that the three existing schemes, which have the same means test, the same rate of grant and cover virtually the same courses, should have a single application form.  It also recommended significant changes in the processing of grant applications and payments.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  I expect to receive a preliminary report from this working group shortly which will outline the issues that will require detailed examination before any recommendations can be finalised.</P>
      <P>I would like to emphasise that no irrevocable decisions will be taken in relation to any future arrangements without appropriate consultation with all interested parties.</P>
      <P>I accept that the current administration of the student support schemes needs to be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  My priority is to ensure that the system properly addresses the concerns of students and parents.</P>

      <P>Ireland currently lags behind its European partners in the integration of information and communications technologies (ICTs) into first and second level schools.  It is a major challenge to meet the need to integrate technology into teaching and learning right across the curriculum. It is vital, in the interests of our future national welfare, that we succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the launch of the education technology investment fund, I announced a capital investment of £25 million to fund the provision of computer systems to first and second level schools over the next three years.  Telecom Éireann has also announced a £10 million initiative which includes the provision of computer systems.  More recently at the launch of Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium, I announced a target of having at least 60,000 multimedia computer systems in first and second <Col N="409" /> level schools by the year 2000.  I also stressed the need to build on existing partnerships between public and private sector organisations at both national and local level to enhance this provision.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to invest in equipment and hardware if we are to effectively integrate ICTs into first and second level curricula.  I am determined that the Schools IT 2000 programme will be an integrated one, with the installation of equipment in schools being closely linked to actions on curriculum development, teacher training and the provision of support services.  It is, therefore, inappropriate to focus solely on targets for the installation of ICT equipment in addressing the need to develop the integration of ICTs in the classroom.</P>
    <P>At the launch of Schools IT 2000 &mdash; A Policy Framework for the New Millennium, the Taoiseach stated that the Government investment in the Schools IT 2000 initiative is one of the largest of its kind in the EU, relative to the size of our country.  I am confident that, with this in mind, Schools IT 2000 will propel the Irish education system into a leadership position in the use of technology in education and will make substantial progress towards the achievement of Council of Europe targets.</P>

    <P>While, in practice, schools and other educational institutions already take their duties with regard to students with a disability very seriously and the State provides substantial public resources for that purpose, I believe that it is appropriate that the right of students with disabilities <Col N="411" /> to equality of access to education be supported by legislation and regulation.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish an Education Bill before the end of the year which, among other things, will seek to underpin equality of access to education in our first and second level schools.  The Bill will make particular provision for students with special educational needs.  The Minister for Education and Science will be given the power to make regulations in respect of this and other aspects of the operation of the Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>At third level, universities have statutory duties in respect of equality of access for people with disabilities.  The Universities Act, 1997, imposes a requirement on the universities to develop equality policies and to implement those policies. The Higher Education Authority is given a role in reviewing this aspect of the universities' activities.</P>
    <P>The issue of access to education for people with disabilities will also be addressed in legislation relating to equal status which will be published next year by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>The report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education <Col N="412" /> recommended that a number of measures be introduced to enhance the participation of those from lower socio-economic groups in higher education.</P>
      <P>In 1997 my Department provided £77,000 in direct financing for three access initiatives involving Dublin City University, University of Limerick and Trinity College to improve participation of pupils from disadvantaged areas at third level. The initiatives involve linkages between the colleges and local second level schools and incorporate supervised study facilities, extra tuition for pupils, information and advice for parents and pupils, including seminars, mentoring and support teaching in key subject areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Higher Education Authority has provided £260,000 in 1996 and £475,000 in 1997 for initiatives in a number of colleges specifically relating to disadvantaged students.  These initiatives build on existing programmes and involve links with second level schools and local communities.  For this reason it will take some time for the effect of the programmes to be reflected in the actual numbers going on to higher education.  The programmes will assist some students to meet the points requirement for courses, enabling them to obtain a college place through the standard CAO entry procedure.  The other aspect of the programmes is the special entry arrangements through which more flexible entry criteria are applied and various supports put in place for students entering by this method. In 1997-98 it is estimated that there is an additional intake of about 80 students through the non-CAO route in the universities and it is expected that this level will increase in line with the targets set by the steering committee on the future development of higher education.  Support for the university proposals is very firmly based on the intention of meeting these targets and annual progress reports will be submitted to the Higher Education Authority on each of the programmes funded.</P>
      <P>In the technological sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology has a comprehensive set of activities in which the college is interacting with different disadvantaged groups in Dublin city.  There are currently a number of courses in place for mature students from disadvantaged backgrounds. In addition, a policy decision has been taken by the Dublin Institute of Technology authorities that direct entry should occur in relation to second level students from disadvantaged backgrounds who do not meet the normal admission criteria.  The recruitment and admissions committee of Dublin Institute of Technology is discussing details of this decision, including the mechanism for its implementation and the quota of students involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, I established a joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for high-technology industries.  A new national <Col N="413" /> certificate in technology course, for which up to 300 students are being recruited, has been developed by the task force to commence in January 1998 in nine regional technical colleges.  In seeking applicants for the courses, the aim is to attract the kind of applicant who might not previously have considered a technician career. These applicants might include, for example, mature applicants, who may have been out of the work-force for a while and under-employed or unemployed persons including those from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This initiative is in line with the commitment in Partnership 2000 to give priority to a strategy to enable non-standard applicants to participate in third level education.</P>
    <P>The regional technical college equality network project which arose out of the EU programme New Opportunities for Women, is operational in six regional technical colleges.  Programmes under the project are specifically aimed at encouraging more participation by women in third level education, with specific focus on women who have been disadvantaged by a lack of educational opportunities.  In addition, Dublin Institute of Technology and Waterford Institute of Technology offer specific courses for second chance education for mature and disadvantaged women.</P>
    <P>In 1995, approval was given for a pilot scheme which enables holders of NCVA Level 2 awards to progress to designated certificate and diploma courses in all regional technical colleges throughout the country.  The scheme was extended to cover additional courses in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology in 1996.  This pilot scheme is an important development in establishing alternative progression pathways for students to higher levels of education and training.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the article referred to by the Deputy which is entitled &ldquo;What Do Teachers Do With Child Protection And Child Welfare Concerns Which They Encounter In Their Classrooms?&rdquo; Its purpose was to examine how teachers in national schools dealt with allegations and suspicions of physical, sexual and emotional abuse of children.  The study was based on interviews with ten teachers in two national schools. The author acknowledges that &ldquo;no attempt was made to find a sample which would be representative of Irish teachers as a whole&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I agree that it is extremely important that teachers are aware of the procedures to be followed in dealing with suspicions or allegations of child abuse.  In this respect my Department issued guidelines to all national schools in 1991 which outlined the procedures to be followed in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.</P>
      <P>A working party, representative of the partners in education, is currently examining those guidelines with a view to ensuring that they remain relevant to the situations faced by teachers in their classrooms.  In conducting this review, the working party is taking into consideration the recommendations contained in the reports referred to in the article.</P>
      <P>Representatives of a number of health boards have been invited to join the working party at future meetings.  I am satisfied that this type of close co-operation between the health boards, the partners in education and my Department will assist in addressing the issues raised in the article. In addition, the Stay Safe Programme introduced in 1992 has an important role to play in further raising teacher and parent awareness of child abuse and its prevention.  Children are taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced with discussions with their parents.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department's main involvement in pre-school education services relates to the early start pre-school programme. This programme was first introduced in 1994. Expenditure on this programe has been as follows: 1994 &mdash; £396,686; 1995 &mdash; £1,923,008; 1996 &mdash; £2,025,251 and 1997 &mdash; £2,106,542.</P>
      <P>My Department also provides financial support to the Rutland Street Special Education Project which caters for pre-school children.  Expenditure on this project for the years in question was as follows: 1990 &mdash; £80,000; 1991 &mdash; £75,000; 1992 &mdash;£79,000; 1993 &mdash; £75,000; 1994 &mdash; £88,000; 1995 &mdash;£103,000; 1996 &mdash; £108,888 and 1997 &mdash; £92,000 to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a total of 56 pre-schools for traveller children have been established and are managed <Col N="420" /> by voluntary bodies.  My Department grant aids 98 per cent of the approved tuition up to a maximum of three hours per day for the duration of the normal school year.  A similar level of support is provided for transport to the pre-school if required.  My Department also provides grants towards the cost of equipping these pre-schools. Precise details of the level of funding involved in supportimg the traveller pre-schools are not readily available and will be forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I recently announced my intention of holding a national forum on early childhood education.  My objective is to allow all groups with an interest in the area to put forward their views as to how best to co-ordinate and support the development of early childhood education services.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the forum will provide an important input into policy decisions on the future development of pre-school education services.</P>

      <P>Yesterday's budget announced a major innovation in the tax treatment of donations to disadvantaged schools.  This initiative is aimed at significantly improving the capacity of disadvantaged schools to secure funding, thus putting them on a level playing pitch with schools for whom, traditionally, fund raising has not posed a problem.  The details of this scheme will be set out in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy regarding the 1997 allocation for the adult literacy and community education scheme (ALCES) is set out in tabular form.  In Dublin grants were given only to City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Particulars of allocations within local authority areas are not available.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need to address the issue of adult literacy I have obtained an increase in the provision for adult literacy of £2 million for 1998, which represents an increase of 75 per cent on the overall 1997 ALCES provision.  I will continue to increase funding in this area as resources become avaiable.</P>

      <P>The abridged Estimates which have been published recently do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure.  It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up to date outturn figures.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Estimates provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education.  This process will extend over the next number of months and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 urban and 123 rural schools are currently included in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  These schools were selected on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic criteria.</P>
      <P>The operation of the project is being closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate and the project is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of the evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school to which he refers will be considered in the context of any additional resource allocations which may be undertaken in the area of educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>The skills group, which was established by Forfás, identified skills needs in the areas of software engineering, engineering technicians and teleservices up to the end of the century.  In relation to software engineering, an annual additional output of some 1,000 computing graduates was identified.  In the area of engineering technicians, the skills group recommended the provision of an additional 750 technician places each year and in the area of languages for the teleservices sector, an additional 1,000 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to these identified needs, a steering committee, chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority, was asked to identify the most cost effective way of providing the additional software and technician graduates.  The committee recommended a capital investment of some £50 million, over the period 1997-2000, in this regard.  The committee further recommended <Col N="423" /> that the Higher Education Authority and my Department be empowered to negotiate with the institutions, so as to maximise the output of graduates within this capital investment framework. The committee also recognised the need for current investment to facilitate the provision of these computer software graduates and engineering technicians.</P>
    <P>On receipt of the steering committee's report, I obtained Government approval for an immediate additional £5 million capital investment to fund an expansion in places on these high-technology courses in the 1997-98 academic year.  No financial provision had previously been earmarked to meet these critical needs.  An additional 650 places in software engineering and 500 places in engineering technician programmes have been approved for the 1997-98 academic year.</P>
    <P>Arising from the work of the joint education/industry task force to improve the supply of technicians for the high technology sector, I have already announced the setting up of a new industry/college initiative to jointly recruit and educate and train technicians.  The objective is that over 150 students will commence new courses in January 1998.  These students will be recruited on a joint basis by institutions in the third level technological sector and by industry. The courses will involve structured work-placement. Students undertaking these courses are expected to enter the workforce about 18 months after the courses begin.</P>
    <P>In the teleservices area, I have introduced a national initiative to provide training to meet the skills needs of the international teleservices industry.  Some 690 training places have been allocated in 20 PLC colleges throughout the country which will offer full-time two year post leaving certificate courses in international teleservices.</P>
    <P>One of the three objectives underpinning the Education Technology Investment Fund is that of developing new areas of activities within our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs have already been identified.  Within the fund, £60 million has been set aside to meet the investment requirements relating to skills needs in the computer software area and a further £20 million is being provided to develop the post-leaving certificate programmes and to support apprenticeship places.  This investment will facilitate the provision of the additional places which the skills group identified.  However, the precise student number targets will be negotiated by my Department with the institutions involved.</P>
    <P>The success of our education system is crucial to the economic development of our country both in terms of our ability to attract inward investment and in the development of our indigenous enterprises.  The availability of a highly educated workforce is of critical importance in this regard. <Col N="424" /> One of my priorities is to ensure that our third level education system responds to the specific needs of the economy and the specific measures which I have outlined are concrete evidence of my commitment to this priority.</P>

      <P>I do not have power to issue directives to local authorities or health boards.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 117 together.</P>
      <P>It is unclear what the Deputy has in mind in relation to the invoking of the provision for derogations laid down in Article 8.4 of Council Directive 92/81/EEC.  I cannot extend derogations agreed for one purpose to other products, or for other purposes.  Neither is the EU Commission likely to recommend further derogations from the general principle that energy products should be taxed.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a Council Decision of 30 June 1997, the longstanding derogation granted under that Article, in respect of the use of mineral oils by CIE has been authorised to continue to apply until 31 December 1999, at least.  There is provision in the decision to continue to apply that derogation and others automatically for subsequent periods of two years, unless the Council decides unanimously before that date, on a proosal from the Commission, whether any or all of the derogations should be abolished or modified. It should be noted that the exemption from the payment of excise duty in the case of mineral oils used by CIE was provided for in national law, prior to the adoption of the above Council Directive.</P>
      <P>CIE does not, to my knowledge, use liquid petroleum gas in its fleet.  The current EU draft directive on the taxation of energy products proposes the application of a substantial increase in the level of excise duty on liquid petroleum gas. Negotiations in this area are ongoing.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding VAT rates is governed by EU VAT law.  Under the EU Sixth VAT Directive, member states may retain the zero rates that they <Col N="429" /> had in place on 1 January 1991, but they are prohibited from introducing new zero rates.  As research periodicals were not zero rated at that time, it is not now open to the Government to apply such a rate.  Indeed, the introduction of new zero rates has been forbidden for many years.</P>
      <P>As regards reduced rating, it would be legally possible under EU VAT law to apply such a rate to research periodicals and I will bear this in mind when the rating structure is next up for review.</P>
      <P>However, it should be noted that Irish institutions purchasing these periodicals have the benefit of the zero rating of books which is not generally available in other EU countries.  In addition, the level of Exchequer grants to universities and other educational institutions takes into account the fact that, while such bodies are exempt from charging the tax, they must bear VAT on the goods and services which they purchase in the course of their activities.</P>

      <P>The Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment that the Government would invite the private sector to design and build new prisons which would be leased and managed by the proposed new prison authority.

      <P>Since the State can borrow capital at lower interest rates than the private sector, funding costs tend to be lower when the State undertakes the financing of such projects directly.  When considering the possibility of private sector involvement in the construction of such facilities other factors also need to be taken into account.  These include the level of expertise in the private sector, the possible speed with which projects can be designed by specialised firms and how quickly the project can be constructed on a design, build and finance basis by the private sector.  The Government takes decisions on the basis of the totality of these considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which has been signed and ratified by Ireland, has implications for a wide range of Departments, including the Department of Health and Children.  Article 22 of the convention provides that &ldquo;State parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure that a child who is seeking refugee status or who is considered a refugee in accordance with applicable international or domestic law and procedures shall, whether unaccompanied or accompanied by his or her parents or by any other person, receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance .&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Refugee Act, 1996, has not yet been fully implemented.  I understand from the Department of Justice that sections 1, 2, 5, 22 and 25 of the Act came into effect on 29 August last.  However, as a result of a High Court injunction, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is not in a position to appoint a refugee applications commissioner, an appointment central to the introduction of the remaining sections of the Act.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (5) (a) of the Act provides for procedures to safeguard the interests of unaccompanied children who arrive in Ireland and who may or may not be asylum seekers.  I understand from the Department of Justice that, although this section of the Act has not yet been commenced, the State seeks to operate to the principles of the section where possible.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Eastern Health Board that refugee children, accompanied by one or more parent(s) who approach its asylum seekers unit are provided with immediate income support and emergency accommodation.  Apart from basic income, payments towards clothing needs are made on first arrival where required.  Subsequently the child, as part of their family, will receive the same health and community welfare services as Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> Unaccompanied children are also provided with income support, including special payments for clothing needs and accommodation selected to suit their unaccompanied status.  The community welfare service co-operates with agencies such as the Garda and the Refugee Council in assisting to reunite families though this co-operation has not often been sought.  The social work service is alerted to cases where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in the circumstances, Ireland is honouring its obligations under this convention.</P>

      <P>Air quality in Ireland is generally good and according to the most recent monitoring results available meets all mandatory national and EU ambient standards.  I have no plans to introduce a national air quality strategy; management planning in this area is a local authority function under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  I also refer to the reply to Question No. 126 of 27 November 1997 in which I outlined current and prospective developments at EU level, supported by Ireland, in regard to new air quality standards, and indicated that the EPA is preparing a national air quality monitoring programme.</P>

      <P>Tallaght unmarried fathers group submitted an application for funding under the scheme of grants for lone parents administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to assist lone parents to return to work or to take up second chance education and training opportunities.</P>
      <P>The emphasis of the scheme is on making relatively small grants to a large number of local groups and the maximum grant available under the scheme is 90 per cent of the initiative.</P>
      <P>A very large number of applications for funding under the scheme of grants for lone parents were received in the Dublin west region but, it was not possible to meet all the demands within the resources available including that from the Tallaght Unmarried Fathers Group which submitted an application for £12,500.</P>
      <P>Grants ranging from £500 to £3,500 and averaging £1,350 each were paid to a number of groups in the Dublin west region.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last September 9,930 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £36.4 million.</P>
      <P>In its Action Programme for the Millenium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
      <P>In line with these commitments, I will consider the potential for the further development of the scheme, including the proposal raised by the Deputy, in the context of an overall view of the provisions for carers, which is being carried out by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Child dependant allowances are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years.  Where a claimant is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment, child dependant allowances are payable where children in full-time education up to the age of 22 years, or up to the end of the academic year after the 22nd birthday.  This is in recognition of the fact that families with children on long-term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the thrust of child income support policy in recent years has been to target resources towards providing substantial increases in child benefit, as part of a strategy aimed at ensuring that child income support is more neutral <i>vis-a -vis</i> the employment status of the parents.  Child benefit remains one of our most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families most in need.  It is of particular importance to families on low income.  As it is not taxable, and is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment or assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc., it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment or improving wages.</P>
      <P>In the 1998 budget, which was announced yesterday, this policy direction has been contained through further enhancement of the child benefit scheme.  Child benefit will be increased by £1.50 per child per month for the first two children and by £3 per child for the third and subsequent children, thus bringing the lower rate up to £31.50 and the higher rate up to £42.  In addition a special supplementary payment in respect of twins will be introduced.  These measures will take effect from next September.</P>

      <P>The number of solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board on 1 December 1997 was 81, comprising nine grade C, principal, solicitors, 32 grade B, senior assistant, solicitors and 40 grade A, assistant, solicitors.</P>
      <P>Details of the approximate expenditure for 1995 and 1996 in respect of each law centre operated by the Legal Aid Board and the salaries applicable to each grade of solicitor employed by the board, together with the staffing details of the board's law centres for each of the years from 1994 to 1996 are set out in the following tabular statements which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different salary scales are applicable to solicitor staff appointed on or after 6 April 1995.  The salary rates applicable to solicitor staff appointed on or after that date are higher than those applicable to solicitor staff appointed at an earlier date. <Col N="436" /> This differential is related to the requirement that the former pay the class A rate of PRSI contribution and make an employee contribution in respect of personal superannuation benefits, whereas the latter pay a reduced rate of PRSI contribution and make no employee contribution in respect of personal superannuation benefits.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the law centres at Navan and Cavan opened in the latter part of 1996 and the law centres at Newbridge and Tullamore opened in 1997.</P>

      <P>The tourism potential of a national conference centre in this country has long been recognised and the first Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-93, contained provision for such a development but no progress was made at that stage.  The current Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates to be built in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Europe as a whole caters for over 350 major conventions each year, and it is estimated that a minimum of a further 15 such conferences, representing an extra 30,000 delegates, can be secured by developing the proposed centre. When account is taken of the fact that international conference delegates to Ireland typically spend slightly in excess of £1,000 per head the proposed centre would, therefore, have the capacity to generate additional tourism revenue of £30 million and support over 1,500 extra jobs in Irish tourism.  It would also help to improve the seasonality of Irish tourism.</P>

      <P>The programme for Government An Action Programme for the Millennium provides a commitment to the introduction of equitable support of students attending PLC courses.  This commitment reflects the importance which the Government attaches to students in the PLC sector. I have taken a number of important steps to ensure the planning and resourcing of developments in the PLC sector including: the ongoing investment in the work of the National Council for Vocational Awards and TEASTAS in providing national certification and assessment for the programme, streamlining and regulating standards in line with industry needs; the provision of £39 million this year towards the running costs of these courses as a significant element of the Government's response to meeting the skill needs of the Irish economy; the involvement of the sector in the International Teleservices Initiative, accompanied by an investment of £1.5 million in equipment in the selected centres to enable them to provide a quality programme consistent with industry needs, and by the introduction of a new student support scheme towards the cost of overseas placement for participants on the programme; and the inclusion of specific provision for the PLC sector under the new Education Technology Investment Fund, under which £250 million will be provided in the next three years for technology investment at all levels of education in partnership with industry.  Twenty million of this will be available for PLC courses and apprenticeships.  This is a first.  It is the first time since the initiation of PLCs that serious capital investment has been devoted to the sector.  This much needed investment underlines the importance which the Government attaches to the sector.</P>
      <P>The view I get from industry is that PLC courses are an important and flexible means of meeting skill needs.  My objective is to build on these strengths.</P>
      <P>I am confident that, over the lifetime of this Government, we will consistently demonstrate our continuing commitment to this very important area of education.  I will keep the structures through which this might best be done under review.</P>

With the additional investment of Telecom Éireann, this goal will be realised substantially earlier i.e., before the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>My Department has an overall target of installing at least 60,000 multimedia computers in all first and second level schools by 2001 with the assistance of public and private sector partnership. Schools IT 2000 involves a Government investment of £40 million.  At least 60 per cent of this will be invested in assisting the development of an equipment infrastructure for schools.</P>
      <P>The National Centre for Technology in Education will be established shortly in Dublin City University.  This centre will have a particular role to play in developing and implementing arrangements and procedures for building up a schools' ICT equipment infrastructure in accordance with individual school needs and priorities.

      <P>The scheme for the early retirement of teachers, negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, was agreed with the INTO in autumn 1996 and with the other teachers' unions in spring 1997.  Following agreement with the INTO, the scheme was introduced in the case of primary teachers in October 1996. The number of applications received for early retirement in 1996 was 64 which was well within the provision made.</P>
      <P>In 1997, when the scheme was extended to teachers generally, the scheme provided for up to 400 retirements.  Following notification of the scheme to schools in June 1997, applications were received from 185 teachers.</P>
      <P>As this number was below the annual quota provided for, and at the request of the teacher unions, my Department invited further applications for early retirement in October 1997. Sixty-three further applications have been received and these are being processed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 147 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy I am acutely aware of the importance of early educational intervention to support children in disadvantaged areas.  While <Col N="446" /> significant advances have been made in this area in recent years, I have no doubt that much still needs to be done.</P>
    <P>At present, a comprehensive range of special support services are targeted at children in disadvantaged areas.  At primary level, these include the early start pre-school programme; the disadvantaged areas scheme; the breaking the cycle pilot programme; the home-school-community liaison scheme; and the teaching counsellor scheme.  Expenditure on these schemes in 1997 amounted to in excess of £17 million.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's budget announced a major innovation in the tax treatment of donations to disadvantaged schools.  This initiative is aimed at significantly improving the capacity of disadvantaged schools to secure funding thus putting them on a level playing pitch with schools for whom, traditionally, fund raising has not posed a problem.  The details of this scheme will be set out in the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>At post-primary level, measures include curricular reforms such as the junior certificate elementary programmes and alternative leaving certificate programmes; second chance education and training through the provision of Youthreach for qualified early school leavers; and the provision of additional educational services to second level schools to cater for the needs of disadvantaged pupils, such as the allocation of disadvantaged, remedial, guidance, home-school links and resource posts.</P>
    <P>Most recently, under the mid-term review of EU funding, I have obtained significant funding for projects which will focus on children in the eight to 15 age range who are at risk of early school leaving or who are already outside the mainstream school system.  New initiatives in urban and rural areas of disadvantage will be supported over the next two years to establish models of effective practice.  The initiatives will involve parterships of local agencies, with schools collaborating with voluntary and statutory bodies in the delivery of preventative and support services for young people in the age range.</P>
    <P>I am also reviewing provision across the special needs area, including the area of educational disadvantage, to ensure that all resources which become available will be utilised to maximum effect.</P>

      <P>Under a new devolved grant scheme introduced this year each national school is paid a basic grant of £2,000, plus £9 per pupil, to carry <Col N="447" /> out improvement work to building, grounds, services and furnishing.  Schools are not required to communicate with my Department in respect of works being undertaken.</P>
      <P>In devising the new scheme, consideration was given to a payment based solely on enrolments but this was rejected on the grounds that it would be unfair to small and special schools.  The basic grant of £2,000 was introduced to overcome this difficulty.</P>
      <P>It is also open to schools to apply for grant-aid for works outside the scope of the devolved grant scheme.  These applications are considered in the context of available capital resources.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the school transport review committee has recently completed an extensive review of the school transport system. The committee's report was reviewed by my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, Minister of State, in September 1997, and is currently being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>It is intended to publish the report early in 1998 and to ensure that it receives the widest possible dissemination.  My aim is to stimulate an extensive debate on the contents of the report before making final decisions on any future changes to the school transport scheme.  I want to make it quite clear that I will not take any decisions until I have reflected on the debate.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school, to which the Deputy refers, on 30 September 1996 was 15 pupils.  That enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal teacher only in the current school year. The current enrolment in the school is 14.</P>
      <P>As yet, no decisions have been made regarding the staffing allocations for primary schools for the 1998-99 school year.</P>
      <P>The former principal teacher at the school recently resigned.  Pending negotiations at local level regarding the future of the school, my Department has sanctioned the appointment of a temporary teacher to replace the former principal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning section of my Department considered that the educational interests of the pupils would be best served by closing the school and <Col N="450" /> transferring the pupils to another school in the parish.  This proposal was put to the chairperson of the board of management of the school, in mid-November.  Responses received this week indicate that the patron, board and parents, are agreeable to the proposal provided that suitable transport arrangements can be put in place.  This question is now being examined in my Department.</P>
