      <P>It is proposed to take the report from the Select Committee on Social Affairs on the Social Welfare Bill, 1997; No. 25 &mdash; Education Bill, 1997 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed); and No.12 &mdash; motion concerning special areas of conservation.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 25, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. today; and (2) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 12: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>There are some two matters to put before the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with No.25 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Taoiseach a happy and fruitful journey to the USA.  It is traditional to wish Taoisigh well when they travel to represent the nation.  Go n-éirí an bóthar leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We spent the week dealing with education but there has been no debate.  Some 550 students are locked out but the Minister has made no commitment to meet or talk to them or to resolve the issue.  Debate on the Universities Bill was truncated and only 40 of the 120 amendments were taken.  Second Stage of the Education Bill will be shortened after only two days debate.  The Taoiseach's party has a long tradition of interest in education.  Many of us have arranged meetings this weekend with constituency groups who wish to talk to us about the matter.  I challenge him to allow this Bill to proceed to discussion next week and, if possible, the week after so that we can <Col N="718" /> meet at constituency level with parents, teachers' representatives and the churches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for her good wishes on my visit to the United States when I will avail of the privilege of meeting President Clinton.  A substantial Second Stage debate has already taken place on the Education Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated her wish to move forward to Committee Stage so that Opposition amendments and suggestions from outside interests who are concerned to improve this Bill can be taken into consideration.  Specific changes to the Bill can only be made if we reach Committee Stage.  If we persist in discussing general principles we will not reach the point when we discuss individual changes and improvements. The Government wishes to move on to Committee Stage where all the points made on the different sides of the issue by the parents' councils, patrons, etc.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not very convincing.  We have not had a major debate on this issue.  We have merely had a debate for four hours and my party has not even had an opportunity to have a second speaker.  The Taoiseach must realise this is fundamental legislation that will have a detrimental effect on our education system and we should have a full debate.  The Taoiseach is smiling.  I am surprised he does not realise the implications of this legislation.  We want to have an open democratic debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Discourtesy to the Opposition has become a trademark of the Taoiseach when asked a question.  Is it the Government's intention to amend the Tribunal of Inquiry Act, given that the Taoiseach failed to send the report to the Garda Commissioner?  He has a copy now as I undertook to send it to him.  Did the Taoiseach set a timescale for the Attorney General to consider the report from Mr. Justice Finlay?  When will the Attorney General advise the Government on whether changes will be made in the compensation tribunal for the purposes of paying aggravated damages to victims?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> When I concluded last Tuesday there was no rush by Members on the opposite side of the House to contribute to the debate.  I ask the Minister to ensure that, with the introduction of regional education boards, proper methods of local consultation are put in place so that the problem of lack of communication experienced by people in their dealings with health boards does not arise with the proposed education boards.  In the case of health boards the only form of local consultation, local health committees, was abolished by the main Opposition party when in Government. Suggestions have been put to the Minister by various <Col N="731" /> educational interests about consultation and input to policy-making at sub-regional level and I am sure she will take those suggestions on board.</P>
      <P>I am glad that for the first time in the history of the State we are enacting legislation on governing our education system and that the roles, functions and responsibilities of boards of management are clearly outlined.  Those of us who have dealings with boards of management, particularly of national schools, are aware that those boards operate very effectively, but unfortunately in many cases they meet seldom if at all, and those participating on them are unclear about their roles and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>That is particularly true in respect of parents' representatives.  From my discussions with parents' representatives at local level, they are very happy with the proposals on boards of management.  The functions of the board of management and the role of parents in the operation of the board of management are clearly outlined.  More importantly, parents' councils are given statutory rights to function at school level, to be represented on regional education boards and to be recognised through the National Parents' Council as national partners in the education system.  It is clear from parents' comments that they very much support the Bill in that regard.  It will be to the Minister's credit when the Bill becomes law that parents, for the first time, will have a statutory role in the education system.  The Bill gives legal effect to the aspiration in the Constitution that parents are the primary educators of children.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with some of the remarks made, particularly in the past week, about the Bill.  Where have many of those commentators been for the past four or five years?  There was very good consultation at the National Education Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Many of those expressing opinions on this matter, whether in national or local newspapers, have not read the Bill.  The Long Title of the Bill sets out clearly what is proposed in the legislation, which is totally at variance with the allegations made, particularly in some local newspapers.  The Bill is entitled &ldquo;An Act to make provision in the interests of the common good for the education of every child in the State, including any child with a disability or special educational needs, and to provide generally for primary, post-primary, adult and continuing education and vocational education and training; to ensure that the educational system is accountable to students, their parents and the State for the education provided, respects the diversity of values, beliefs and traditions in Irish society and is conducted in a spirit of partnership between schools, patrons, students, <Col N="732" /> parents, staff and the State&rdquo;.  It also states other objectives.</P>
      <P>I commend the Long Title to Deputy Harney who, in recent days, tried to manufacture a political bandwagon on this issue.  Her comments are ill-informed, ill-judged, inaccurate and are not credible coming from the leader of a party which, in its early days, tried to banish God from the Constitution.  It is regrettable she is not in the House to comment on this because her new found conversion does not tally with the aim of her party in its early days.  We want genuine pluralism and partnership in our education system and I thought Deputy Harney's party was committed to those principles.  This Bill seeks to put those principles into practice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision for an appeals procedure.  Those who have dealt with complaints from parents, teachers and others at local level know the current grievance procedure is unfair and unsatisfactory.  While I expect amendments will be made to the detail of this on Committee Stage, I support the objectives in this regard.  Parents to whom I have spoken also support this provision.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of requests to amend the Bill, particularly from the second level sector, and I have brought them to the Minister's attention.  Changes can be made.  However, I am disappointed some parties still imply that their continued support for the process is contingent on the abolition of the vocational education committees.  I thought we had passed that stage a long time ago.  That subject should not be revisited now.  We are talking about genuine pluralism and choice.  As chairman of a vocational education committee I would not claim our continued participation in the debate was contingent on the abolition of the rights of another patron or party. I am disappointed some parties still seek the abolition of the vocational education committee as a statutory agency.</P>
      <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs carried out a review of the vocational education committee system last year, which will be the subject of a debate in the House at a later stage.  I caution the Minister to adopt a slow and considered approach to the rationalisation of vocational education committees.  I welcome her aim to bring about a revitalised and strengthened vocational education committee system, but it should be done in full consultation with the vocational education committees.  If the matter is handled in a proper manner, co-operation can be strengthened.</P>
      <P>I would like clarification on the relationship between the vocational education committees and the education boards, particularly regarding their involvement in the appeals procedure.  The vocational education committee is already a statutory committee, but the Bill does not refer to its involvement in the appeals procedure.  It would be wise to examine how the statutory committee could be included in the appeals procedure and other patrons might also want to be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I would also like clarification on the appointment of principals.  My reading of the Bill indicates that the appointment of staff and teachers in the vocational education committee will remain a matter for the vocational education committee, but the appointment of principals will become a matter for the board of management.  The vocational education committees need to be to be responsible for its staff appointments. Vocational education committees need to be assured they will continue to play a primary role in the provision of adult and community education, particularly in the VTOS and other schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and compliment the Minister on the wide ranging and consultative manner in which she introduced it. This is the most important legislation on education introduced since the last century.  For the first time, a legislative, accountable and participatory framework is being provided in the education system.  I pay tribute to all who contributed to our education system in the past, particularly the religious bodies which since the last century have given sterling service to it with very few resources.  We must introduce wide ranging legislation that covers the entire education system from primary to second level.  We must provide a framework in this area for the next millennium.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at Fianna Fáil's attempt to filibuster the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister and this so-called open Government did not allow a longer debate on this matter.  It raises a question about their intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Education is the cornerstone on which society depends for development and growth.  Changes in the education system deserve and demand <Col N="734" /> detailed consideration.  Interested parties must be given sufficient time to study and digest the proposed changes and to formulate their policy decisions on them.  The manner in which the Bill is being rushed through the Oireachtas is the antithesis of the democratic process and utterly unsatisfactory.  It is patently clear it is being rushed through because of the impending general election.  The Minister and her party want their philosophy enshrined in law before the general election and will use the guillotine today to stifle the views of the many democratically elected Members who wish to speak on the Bill because of its importance for their constituents and the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Openness, transparency and accountability were the catch words of the new Taoiseach and his rainbow Government in 1994.  They implied greater involvement of the people and greater devolution from the centre.  However, like many other matters, this Bill flies in the face of those high flying principles mooted in the forgotten days of November and December 1994.</P>
    <P>The Bill reinforces and strengthens ministerial control over education and does not devolve authority from the top.  Resources available to the Department should be put into the classroom and used to provide for children with special needs, to provide science equipment in classrooms, adequate classroom and recreational space, more remedial teachers and to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.  However, the Minister is setting up regional education boards which could cost up to £50 million a year.  The Minister has admitted she does not know how much these boards will cost.  This is an admission of failure and a dereliction of her duties.  This Minister has held herself up as the saviour of Irish education.  However, the establishment of regional education boards will not be regarded as one of her finest hours.  Instead of giving individual schools greater independence and autonomy, she is bringing everything into the centre.  Totalitarianism is creeping back in under the Minister and the Government, which does not surprise me given the make-up of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about the objectivity and independence of the boards if their members are chosen and sanctioned by the Minister.  All boards appointed by the Government have been excessively weighted with political followers of the three Government parties.  Fianna Fáil believes in devolving as much authority as possible to local school boards of management and we are totally opposed to the establishment of regional education boards, which we will abolish when we return to office.</P>
    <P>The interaction between children, teachers and parents is fundamental to the education system. Resources must be made available and inequality must be eliminated before the establishment of regional education boards.  This Bill flies in the face of what is needed and it is a waste of valuable resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> Voluntary and secondary schools of any denomination are being treated unfairly in terms of grant aid compared to vocational schools.  They are not getting the resources they deserve and the students are suffering.  These students are the children of taxpayers who are entitled to the same level of grant aid as those in other schools.  It is time to stamp out this form of discrimination so that all children are treated equally.  The president of the Catholic School Parents Association, Mr. John Whyte, has described the Bill as repugnant to voluntary education, especially voluntary Catholic education.  It is not only repugnant to voluntary Catholic education but to voluntary education of any denomination, whether Protestant, Jewish or Muslim.  This was agreed by all denominations at their recent unprecedented meeting.  Any Minister and Government which ignores such a consensus is digging a deep grave for themselves.</P>
    <P>Section 43 has been described as the greatest intrusion by the State into the management of schools not established by the State.  While we must acknowledge that the Minister and the Government have a duty and responsibility in terms of the education system, there is no need for such intrusion.  It is a type of dictatorship from the centre which is outrageous.  Fianna Fáil has made it clear it will repeal this and other odious aspects of the Bill when it returns to Government.</P>
    <P>In recent years multi-denominational schools and gaelscoileanna have been established.  Under section 9(2)(g) the regional education board is the only body with the statutory right to recognise a new school and to lease land or buildings to any person or groups of persons establishing a school. Does this mean that if a group can provide a building or land to establish a school, it will not be accepted?  This is short-sighted economics which points towards complete control by the centre.</P>
    <P>There is no demand to radically change the system of denominational education.  Parents have the right to send their children to denominational schools to be educated.  Many aspects of this Bill fly in the face of the ethos of a particular denominational school.  Section 57 gives widespread power to the Minister in almost all matters of education administration.  Such unbridled powers could be used to undermine the ethos of denominational schools.  This section is unwise and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I understand the deeds of trust, which have been negotiated with the primary schools partners, are subject to examination by the Attorney General to determine their legality and constitutionality.  It is high-handed of the Minister to publish the Bill without knowing if the deeds of trust, which are essential for the establishment of school boards of management and the continuing agreement of all school partners, are constitutional.  Under normal circumstances the Bill would not be published without knowing if the <Col N="736" /> agreement, which would underpin the Bill, is legal.  However, we do not know if the deeds of trust negotiated between the Department of Education and the primary school partners are constitutional or legal.  It is unwise for the Minister to proceed while these matters are still in a state of limbo.  This shows the arrogance of this Administration.</P>
    <P>The manner in which patrons have been treated in this Bill is a cause of great concern to denominational school interests.  The Bill ignores the patrons who have ultimate responsibility for the school and who must play a significant role in its development.  It pushes the role of patrons into the background by establishing regional education boards.  CORI, in its analysis of the Bill, is critical of this provision.  It states:</P>
    <P>The Bill's misrepresentation of the role of patron and its failure to take account of the consultation process leading to the White Paper are fundamental flaws.  These flaws mean that the harmonisation of existing rights which the Bill was meant to enshrine has not been achieved.  They also undermine the Bill's stated commitment to diversity of school types and they threaten the Bill's constitutionality.</P>
    <P>CORI has also strongly criticised section 37(7) which will freeze the funds of schools which fail to comply with the ministerial order on boards of management.  It has argued that there is a strong body of legal opinion which suggests that any legislation which gives the Minister for Education the power to require a school to be managed by a particular type of board will be unconstitutional.  The legal advice available to CORI and to Fianna Fáil indicates that section 37(7) would not pass a constitutional test.</P>
    <P>This Bill is putting patrons in a consultative role; it misunderstands the role and duties of the patron in the operation of schools.  The patrons are the owners of the schools and they are ultimately responsible for decisions on all capital and current expenditure and on changes to future status, such as amalgamations and closures.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that we have been forced to limit our contributions by the Government's decision to guillotine this important debate. When we get back into power, we will make changes to the odious sections of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I had only two and a half minutes to speak on the Universities Bill, 1996.  Every education debate in this House is a complete disappointment in that Members have less and less <Col N="737" /> time to speak.  This is making the House more irrelevant and insignificant.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the Taoiseach asked us this morning if we wanted an education system like the one in Great Britain. I am afraid that the passage of this Bill will bring us more into the realms of a British system.  I can say, as a teacher, that the Irish system of education has been very successful.  There has been a delicate balance between the role of denominations and the State in education and I do not see why we should slavishly follow any other system.  I agree, however, with the Taoiseach's comments about the role of parents, which is most important.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot say that by introducing this Bill she is reforming the education system. Far from it.  It is very illiberal to say there will be State control in this sector.  The Minister for Finance said recently that Ireland was a mature post-Christian society.  I do not know if he has ever explained what he meant even though he was questioned about it.</P>

      <P>People hold dear the denominational system of education.  I heard somebody say recently that Irish people possess great spirituality.  Certain people believe in supporting the &ldquo;Faith of our Fathers&rdquo; album, which has been the source of amusement to some people, but it has been a best seller in the charts.  I only refer to that because there was a reference earlier to the fact that one party in this House wanted to abolish God from the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Other parties may have different views on this.  This Bill does not deal with the delicate balance between the two systems.  People are concerned about the introduction of a secular State education system and I hope the Minister will address that.</P>
      <P>The powers which this Bill confers on the Minister are a matter of greatest concern to primary and post-primary schools.  The Minister can now appoint boards of management to schools in addition to deciding on their composition and their powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister can dictate the core <Col N="738" /> curriculum of schools is also a concern.  Bishop Thomas Flynn was quoted recently as saying that the system of second level education grew in Ireland in spite of opposition from Irish and, indeed, British Governments before 1922 and that there was little support from the State in the early years, although he welcomed the present level of support.</P>
    <P>The bishop asked what indication the Minister has received from the public that it wants the current system changed.  The White Paper promised consultation and the education conference which the Minister organised was most successful but there is no demand for this change.  Regarding an educational monopoly in the State, Bishop Flynn asked if it is just to change from one monopoly to another if, in fact, churches want to run the schools.  To transfer a system, lock, stock and barrel, from one monopoly to another is not a positive development.  It is not a question of the bishops trying to protect themselves or their turf.</P>
    <P>There is no indication where the money will come from for the ten education boards or how much they will cost to run.  A figure of £50 million has been mentioned and this question should be addressed.  I would like to see resources channelled to the classroom, not to an undemocratic bureaucracy.  If this Bill is enacted, there will be a need to address the issues of disadvantage and poverty.  As of now, the Bill warrants amendment.</P>
    <P>There has been no consultation on the core curriculum.  The primary school curriculum was changed in 1970 and now there is talk of changing it again.  Buzz words, such as &ldquo;integration&rdquo;, are in use but there is no talk of funding and there is little in the Bill about adult education.</P>
    <P>The area of psychological services and remedial and resource teachers, to which the Minister referred, must be addressed.  She spoke about the increase in the number of remedial teachers and stated that the service now covers 87 per cent of schools.  That service is only provided for a few hours one day per week in many schools and the Minister must address this immediately.</P>
    <P>No Government has addressed the question of school transport since the regulations were first introduced.  With the falling school population, one cannot maintain for much longer rules which state that an area must contain ten school children between the ages of four and ten to be eligible for transport.  The Minister should forget about the ideology and tell us what she will do about that.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave a reprieve to some of the two teacher schools last year.  She must let us know what she intends to do next September when at least 16 schools will lose a teacher.  She knows Deputy Martin has said that two teacher schools would be allowed to retain their second teacher under Fianna Fáil's education policy.  I hope the Minister will address that.</P>
    <P>The powers of the Minister under the Bill are not specified.  There are major questions about <Col N="739" /> the financing and cost of the boards.  It is confusing that the role of the patron or the boards of management is not identified.</P>

      <P>I thought this morning that some of the Fianna Fáil Members who disrupted the House for one hour had not looked at the history of education in Ireland.  They are talking about the Minister taking on powers whereas the reality is, of course, that the Minister and all Ministers since the foundation of this State have always had unregulated powers in education.  The education reforms we are proposing are long overdue.  I must also remind the Fianna Fáil Deputies that the Minister for Education had the full support of the Fianna Fáil Ministers in Cabinet between 1993 and 1994 when she set out on this track.  That is a fact.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Viewed on a world basis our education system has served us extremely well by any standards, but the highly centralised way we administer it has not changed for more than 100 years.  The rights of citizens to education and within the education system have never been stated in statute. The roles, rights and responsibilities of the partners <Col N="740" /> in education are to say the least ill-defined. The partnership which must underpin the education system is not clarified in statutory form. Nowhere is the right balance spelled out.  Parents, who are recognised in our Constitution as the primary educators, have always been regarded by the providers of education as something akin to customers and often not even as people who are entitled to a high level of customer service.  The concept of parents as full and equal partners within the planning and delivery of education has been an alien concept.</P>
    <P>By the same token the power of Ministers for Education to determine the lives and futures of our children has been awesome.  It has been matched only by the lack of accountability. Members will have vivid memories of a time not so long ago when thousands of people were forced to take to the streets over rising class sizes. We said then in this House that one of the most scandalous aspects of that crisis was the fact that the circulars which decided that children should be educated in increasingly overcrowded schools owed nothing to the wishes of this House and were not based on an accountable framework of law because they dated back to the Stanley letter of 1831.</P>
    <P>From the moment the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, convened the National Education Convention in 1993 to the publication of the Education Bill on 7 January all that began to change. For the first time all the partners in education were invited to sit down and plan with the Department and the Minister.  The process of listening and genuine consultation which the Minister initiated has involved all the partners as they had never before been invited to be involved in the delivery of education services.  That four years of genuine dialogue is the basis on which this Bill has been built.</P>
    <P>The future of education is a future of partnership, of much greater equality, combating disadvantage and partnership between school patrons, parents, teachers and the students.  That is what this Bill is all about.  It is about giving education a statutory basis for the first time in which the rights, roles and responsibilities of all the partners are clearly spelled out.  It is about putting in place education boards so that the planning of education can be done in the regions by the citizens of the regions responding to the needs of the regions and encouraging regional decision-making, and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>This is the greatest decentralisation of power in recent times from a Government Department to the regions.  I find it difficult to understand why anybody objects to that concept.  It will transform the highly centralised bureaucracy commented on by the OECD report on education in Ireland, which states we have a highly centralised bureaucracy running education.  It will give parents, with the other partners, a real say in planning education in future.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that every parent in each school will have the right of access to their child's <Col N="741" /> records, the right to receive the school annual report and the right to appeal decisions which significantly affect their child's education.  It will also ensure the body of parents in each school will have the right to form a parents' association and to have members on the board of management.</P>
    <P>The Bill will further ensure that parents will be members of education boards and will be consulted when the board draws up its plans.  It contains statutory recognition of the National Parents' Council as the voice of parents at national level, but it does not confirm the rights of parents by denying the rights of the other partners, as is being suggested.  On the contrary, teachers too have firmly recognised in the Bill their rights to membership of boards and to be involved when schools and education boards draw up plans.  The rights of patrons of all school types, including denominational schools, both new and existing, to maintain, promote and hand on the characteristic spirit of the school will be enshrined in the Bill. Those who seem to regard the Bill as promoting a threat to ethos have not read it carefully enough.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the carping criticisms of the Opposition &mdash; I say this as a parent &mdash; this Bill is not about State control of education.  That is just a smear typical of the rather infantile approach which passes for analysis on the Opposition benches.  Those who wish to see the education system again in the hands of Fianna Fáil might care to reflect on the appalling history of neglect we inherited when we came into Government.  Those who wish to see the Progressive Democrats getting next, nigh or near the education system might equally reflect on the <i>laissez-faire</i> approach that party takes to virtually everything.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not about extending ministerial power, it is about creating a model of partnership in education in which the partners freely and openly plan for an increasingly complex future. It brings to education a social partnership model which is the norm in a Europe in which Ireland plays an increasing part.  Through regionalisation, we join the mainstream of education in Europe where devolution to the regions has long been the norm in, for example, Denmark, Belgium and the Netherlands and where centralised control of education in countries such as Sweden and Italy is now significantly devolved.</P>
    <P>The process of defining the rights, roles and responsibilities of all the partners in education is not easy and nobody ever expected it would be. There are concerns and reservations expressed by some of the partners.  The spirit of partnership may prove elusive when we try to encapsulate it in the cold letter of the legislation.  The complexity of the task is why the Opposition for all its carping, criticism, censure and condemnation never succeeded in bringing forward an Education Bill.  It is not an easy process, but it is necessary.  It is essential to have a statutory basis to plan education in a way appropriate to a modern democracy.  It is also essential to have a statutory basis to underpin each citizen's right to education <Col N="742" /> and it is necessary for real popular participation in education decisions.</P>
    <P>This Bill was built on consultation.  During its passage through the Oireachtas, the Minister has undertaken to address concerns and reservations with continued consultation.  That is not a sign of weakness.  It is a sign of real strength and confidence to ensure this Bill will achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>The last four years have seen a radical transformation of education.  The commitment and energy of my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, have paved the way for new and exciting opportunities for all involved in education &mdash; teachers, parents, school owners or students.  What has been done in the past four years by the first Labour Party Minister for Education adds up to a record, I suggest without parallel, of any Minister for Education in recent history.  Education is central to the Government's agenda for progress, change and development in society and in the economy.  Our approach in education over the past number of years has been to move decisively to tackle the problem of underfunding &mdash; a legacy of scandalous neglect by Fianna Fáil and its accomplices, the Progressive Democrats.  Since the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, took office the education budget has increased by more than £700 million, almost 45 per cent and that extra funding has gone straight into the classrooms.  The result is that day to day funding of primary schools has increased from £28 to £45 per pupil, an increase of more than 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The result is that we have been able to introduce a series of new initiatives to specifically target educational disadvantage, initiatives which will do far more than sloganising to reduce alienation in our society.  Our initiatives have protected the viability of small rural schools which Deputy Brennan, when Minister for Education, said he would close.  Our initiatives have substantially increased the number of remedial and resource teachers and teachers for pupils with special needs.  They have led to the introduction of the Early Start scheme, catering for a total of 1,800 children in pre-schools, helping to break through a cycle of disadvantage and neglect.  They have included the introduction of the Breaking the Cycle initiative, which caters for 14,500 pupils in targeted disadvantaged schools with a new pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 in urban schools and 25 rural clusters availing of a co-ordinator for each cluster.</P>
    <P>During the last four years funding spent on primary school buildings increased by 80 per cent. More than £120 million has been invested in the primary school building programme and over 7,000 minor works have been sanctioned by the Department of Education.  Four years ago the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, inherited a shameful legacy from the Fianna Fáil-PDs Government &mdash; almost 300 schools in appalling condition.  More than two-thirds of the backlog of Fianna Fáil neglect is now cleared, but it is <Col N="743" /> not enough.  The Government is determined to tackle the remaining 90 schools.  We cannot allow such lasting damage ever again to happen to the primary school building programme.  The past four years have seen more than a doubling in the numbers in adult and continuing education.  This Government has made it possible for every family to consider, in some cases for the first time in their family's history, the possibility of third level education without the very real barrier of thousands of pounds in fees.  We have sought to encourage people to go to college at night by introducing a tax relief for those who are studying and holding down a job at the same time.</P>

      <P>The past four years has seen a transformation in our education system.  We have treated the Department of Education system not as a spending but as an investment Department making the most important investment possible in the future of our community.  This Bill offers all the partners in education the way to build on this investment through dialogue and partnership, with rights and responsibilities spelled out.  As John Hume said in a different context, dialogue threatens nobody.  The future of our education system is an issue of crucial concern to every citizen and parliamentarian.  It is a fundamental right that every citizen should have an opportunity to have a full say in that future.  That above all is why I support this Bill and commend it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for sharing time.  I am aware that this issue is important to him and he would have been anxious to say more.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Education Bill.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, deserves credit for a wide range of initiatives in the education system which is about to be further improved. The decrease in the birth rate has provided an unprecedented opportunity to improve educational services without incurring significant increases in spending.  In prioritising education, the Government and the Minister have not only made modest improvements in pupil-teacher ratios but have also established new services and expanded existing ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the expansion of services for schools designated disadvantaged.  These include the development of the home-school-community liaison scheme, the introduction and development of the Early Start programme, the establishment of the teacher-counsellor pilot project and the innovative Breaking the Cycle programme.  These services target resources at areas of greatest need that were neglected in the past, including my constituency of Cork North Central where inadequate educational provisions, long-term <Col N="744" /> unemployment and social marginalisation form a continuing cycle of deprivation.  Many of the measures introduced by the Government will help to break the cycle but much more needs to be done.  I urge the Minister to target further educational resources at areas of real need such as the northside of Cork city.  I am aware that she will be reconsidering the Breaking the Cycle initiative and in this respect I ask her to look again, as she promised, at the cases of St. Mary's on the Hill and Churchfield national school.</P>
    <P>The Education Bill provides a comprehensive framework for the operation of primary and secondary schools.  It provides for the active involvement of parents in the education of their children and makes long overdue provision for the decentralisation of the education system.  The legislation is largely intended to give effect to the proposals in the White Paper which was widely welcomed.  The drafting of that paper included extensive consultation with teachers, parents and those responsible for managing our schools, whom we must never forget.</P>
    <P>Parents have the right to know not only that their children will receive schooling but that they will receive an education.  These are not always the same.  Pupils have the right to learn well with adequate support in an environment conducive to learning and without undue disruption.  Our education system should have a quality mark.  For some pupils and parents those rights remain aspirational.  Each year, approximately 3,200 pupils leave school before the junior certificate. This figure includes 1,000 who leave after primary school which is a shocking statistic.  Some of those remaining in the education system attempt to learn in substandard buildings with inadequate or no science, arts or sports facilities.  There are growing concerns that some of those who make it through the system are schooled but not educated.</P>
    <P>An unacceptable number of students continue to leave the education system with varying literacy and numeracy problems which adversely affect their functioning in the workplace and society in general.  There are numerous difficulties to be tackled but the Government has made much progress on many of them.  With so many students being denied access to first chance education it is vital that provision be made for second chance education.  I particularly welcome the explicit requirement in section 9(2) for education boards to plan and co-ordinate the provision, by schools and centres for education, of adult or continuing education or vocational education and training.  That is essential.</P>
    <P>The problems to which I referred earlier will not be directly addressed by the Education Bill but it provides a framework within which they can be addressed.  For example, the establishment of regional education boards means that schools will not be obliged to refer upgrading works and relatively minor decisions to the Minister for sanction.  This will enable her and the Department to concentrate on policy formulation rather <Col N="745" /> than administration detail.  The composition of education boards, outlined in section 8, ensures that all relevant interests such as patrons, parents, representatives of trade unions, local authority members and people who belong to minority religions will have an input into the administration of schools in general.</P>
    <P>The framework enshrined in the Bill is transparent and accountable.  Provision is made for the publication of reports by the new education boards which will fall under the remit of the Ombudsman.  This is a new, imaginative and worthwhile development.  In addition, parents who believe their children have been unfairly or adversely treated by teachers or other staff members will have the right of appeal under section 55.  This is particularly welcome.  Most parents resolve problems within the school system but there are some which are more difficult to resolve.  In this regard, I urge the Minister to examine section 55 further on Committee Stage with a view to providing representation for the parties involved at an appeal and developing a better balance on the appeals committee. However, these matters can be teased out on Committee Stage.  In enhancing the role of parents by making statutory provision for parents' associations, the Bill, for the first time, gives parents a stake in their children's education and makes them active partners rather than passive clients in the education process.</P>
    <P>Any debate about education in Ireland must invariably touch upon the role of the churches whose educational involvement has been historically determined and has benefited generations of Irish children and the State.  In devising a new educational partnership responsive to the needs of a changing society, the churches are not, in any sense, being sidelined.  They are being challenged to adapt and develop their role to meet the needs of a society which is no longer homogenous but is European as well as Irish, increasingly multi-cultural and in which the numbers of those professing minority faiths or no faith are increasing.</P>
    <P>The rights of school patrons are enshrined in the Bill, as are those of other partners in the education process.  In a statement yesterday the Minister reassured the Catholic Bishops' Conference that the intention behind the Education Bill is not to bring about a State takeover of Irish education but to achieve a balance between the rights and responsibilities of all the partners in a pluralist system.  The key words are &ldquo;partners&rdquo; and &ldquo;pluralist&rdquo;.  In making the regulations governing management board appointments, the Minister is required to consult with patrons, any national association of parents, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing students.  The boards will be appointed by the patrons, having regard to the regulations made according to the above criteria under section 43.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that, among their functions, boards of management shall support the characteristic spirit of schools as determined by the cultural, educational, moral, religious or social <Col N="746" /> values and traditions which inform and underpin the objectives of those schools.  I am sure that more time will be available on Committee Stage to tease out the other elements of the Bill in which I am interested.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I listened with interest to the Tánaiste's contribution which contained very little other than the usual cynical attack on Fianna Fáil and its record in Government. However, my party's record on education speaks for itself.  The Tánaiste would be better employed discussing the closures of Tralee and Wexford vocational education committees rather than attacking Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to engage in a debate on education structures.  However, it is a pity that so little time remains to debate this important Bill.  I question the Minister's wish to have this Bill hastily passed.  Surely she and her party are not that averse to criticism of its deficiencies.  Is it being rushed through because of an impending general election or to allow the Minister load the education boards with political hacks of the Fine Gael, Labour or Democratic Left parties?  We have already witnessed what has occurred in the new harbour boards.  The membership of one in New Ross is comprised of political hacks, most of whom would know as much about harbour operations as I would about flying aeroplanes.  The outgoing coalition Government appears to be grasping an opportunity to nominate party people to boards, ensuring the Minister's ideas are espoused nationwide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the widespread disgust at her proposed disgraceful, shameful abolition of the Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committee, especially when one remembers the many contributions to that committee of a former Tánaiste, the late Deputy Brendan Corish, Dick Corish, people like Tommy Byrne and many other prominent Labour Party members who served on it for many years.  It is amazing she has decided to abolish one of the most progressive, innovative town committees, which has been to the forefront in the development of vocational and general education in Wexford town for a considerable period. It is one of the few urban vocational education committee colleges that has experienced an enormous growth in its pupil numbers, and has been very innovative in its participation in VTOS, Youthreach, adult education and third level courses.  For many years the County Wexford <Col N="747" /> and Town of Wexford Vocational Education Committees have worked closely in the development of new courses for students in Wexford generally, resulting in ever increasing numbers of pupils.  The numbers are predicted to increase considerably next year.  The Minister's decision to abolish the vocational education committee will undermine parents' confidence in their long established excellent vocational education system.</P>
    <P>I question why the Minister proposes to abolish any town committees.  If her objective is to achieve savings, I predict she will achieve none. Since each meeting costs £14 per member, a town committee of some 20 members having 11 meetings annually would cost £3,300.  The Minister is out of touch with the happenings in major urban centres.  Wexford town is an expanding urban centre, in need of a town committee to cater for its vocational education system.</P>
    <P>The silence of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and that of the Labour members of that vocational education committee over the past six months amazes me.  This proposal is disgraceful and it is time they voiced their opposition to it.  In the interests of students, their parents and teachers, I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider the closure order in respect of the town of Wexford vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>I hear rumours the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is not very happy with occurrences in the town of Tralee.  I was surprised he did not refer to the proposed closure of Tralee town committee.  Even at this late stage I ask him to intervene and request the Minister to reconsider her decision in respect of that committee.</P>
    <P>The regional education boards will not be capable of operating practically.  The members of the various health boards have become far removed from locals in their respective regions and I foresee the same happening in the case of these regional education boards.  For example, where will the headquarters of the six counties comprising the south east be located?  Will students, parents and teachers have to travel from Wexford to, say, Tipperary, Waterford or Kilkenny to have their grievances heard or will the same nonsensical system apply here as in the case of the regional health boards?</P>
    <P>My greatest criticism of the Minister and Government today is their denying Members of this House an opportunity of contributing adequately to this debate on an important Bill which will change our education system.  That three Members must share a time slot of 15 minutes is a disgrace.  One can only conclude the Minister's endeavour is to silence democratically elected Members in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I realise how fortunate I am in being given an opportunity to say a few words in this debate on a Bill of enormous importance.  The manner in <Col N="748" /> which the role of democratically elected Members and the objectives of the Bill are being denigrated or diminished by the Government's conduct of business today is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's performance this morning was quite disgraceful.  Since my recent entry to this House I have not witnessed such a performance by the Leader of Government.  In suggesting Members on this side of the House oppose the establishment of a statutory framework within which our education system can function properly, either he is not aware of the facts or chooses to ignore them.  Clearly he knows nothing about the role of education or its provisions as specified in the Constitution, the Vocational Education Acts, 1930 to 1970 or generally how those provisions have been implemented.  The Government's guillotine appears to be based on the premise that it does not want an open debate on Second Stage of this Bill, which is a great pity. Many Members have been denied a proper opportunity to represent and voice the views of our constituents and those of the various partners in education.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not represent a radical devolution of authority and responsibility.  The Minister's proposed regional education boards &mdash; which my party opposes for a number of reasons &mdash; will not vest far-reaching powers in their members.  In so far as such powers are devolved at all, they are vested in the directors who will have an extraordinary amount of power, in some cases, surpassing that of a county manager within the present local authority structure.  I question that.  It is a fallacy to suggest the various members of those boards and the interests they represent will have any real power within the proposed new system.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged that the system, as currently constituted, has worked quite well.  He appeared to contradict what the Taoiseach had to say this morning about the fact that, to some extent, that structure had been based on the Stanley letter within the British system which, all his previous utterances on the subject, would have led one to believe warranted immense merit in the eyes of the Taoiseach rather than the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major funding issues also arise which, within the timescale proposed, will be very difficult to tease out fully and which are of enormous importance to the provision of education.  There will be the cost of the establishment of regional education boards, estimated to be in the region of £50 million.  Despite what the Tánaiste appears to believe, there remain huge numbers of substandard school buildings, six at primary level in County Clare, where no repairs have been done within the lifetime of the present Government although some were undertaken by the present Minister when her party was in coalition with Fianna Fáil.  There is a second level school in Kilrush the existence of which has been hanging in the balance for several years.  There are huge deficiencies to be addressed in the case of <Col N="749" /> remedial or resource teachers.  To some extent, this is acknowledged by the Minister in her anti-poverty initiative.  While I disagree with the manner in which she went about resolving that issue, at least she recognised its existence.</P>
    <P>Primary school education is underfunded.  The Minister has established a steering group at second level which will report, no doubt to the next Government, and which will highlight the deficiencies in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address the area of educational disadvantage in a real way.  It hinges on access, participation and benefit but I do not see that happening.  There are many other issues I would have liked to deal with and I hope I will have an opportunity to raise them on Committee Stage.  However, I do not consider that to be the appropriate mechanism for considing the Bill.  I regret the Government has decided to impose a guillotine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgrace that the debate on one of the most important Bills relative to education has been cut short in such a hamfisted way.  It does not reflect well on the Minister, the Department or the Government that Members have not been given an opportunity to represent the views of the people they represent on this important Bill.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Killeen's comments about the ecstatic performance of the Taoiseach this morning.  It was without precedent, was neither justified nor logical and was compounded by the Tánaiste entering the debate with his kango hammer mechanism to indicate all was well on the Government side.  We know how many Fine Gael Members were present.  On the ground these people are not happy with the way the Bill is being dealt with.</P>
      <P>Section 7(3) deals with the setting up of the education boards and subsection (4) deals with the Minister's role pending the appointment of a body to review the operation and effectiveness of the education boards.  Both subsections raise a number of important issues.  Following the enactment of the Bill, will the education boards &mdash; the foundation stone of this Bill &mdash; have to wait for finance to fund new buildings, salaries, services and redundancies in the vocational education committees before they come into existence? That appears to be the case in the Bill as drafted. Will education boards be established in some regions and not in others?  Under the Bill, as drafted, that will be the case.</P>
      <P>Why is there no time limit on the period within which the Minister can exercise the functions of education boards?  Those three points do not suggest a co-ordinated or an integrated approach to the whole issue of the education boards which are a disaster and should not be embarked on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the definition of &ldquo;parent&rdquo; there is no attempt to come to terms with the conflicting educational rights and duties of separated parents, whether separated judicially or otherwise, or a parent against whom a barring order has been <Col N="750" /> made.  The promised divorce legislation will further complicate this issue.  Support services are defined as the services which an education board provides to students or their parents, recognised schools or centres for education and includes legal services.  It follows from this that the education board is obliged to provide legal services to both sides in a dispute between, for example, the school or the parents.  Under that definition the Minister is putting in place a litigator's charter.</P>
    <P>The inspectorate of the education boards will be made up of inspectors seconded from the central inspectorate plus seconded teachers.  They will have the role of evaluating the management of the schools, the education standards of the school and assess the implementation of the regulations made by the Minister.  It is extraordinary that such powers should be conferred in law on temporary inspectors.  It does not add up.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to examine the appeals system because it is an absolute labyrinth.  A decision can be appealed by parents and students over the age of 16 years to the board of management which can refuse to enrol a student.  It then goes to the education board, is appealed to the Ombudsman and finally goes to the Minister.  I ask the Minister to get out of this labyrinth and ensure a logical approach to the appeals system and let us put a proper shape on what is a discredited Bill.</P>

      <P>This Bill was published on 7 January 1997, following the publication of a White Paper at Easter 1995 in which many of the provisions of the statutory framework planned for education were spelt out.  The White Paper followed two years of consultation which had commenced as far back as November 1993 in Dublin Castle.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann welcomes the publication of the Regulations for the designation of Special Areas of Conservation under the Statutory Instrument laid before the Oireachtas on the 26th February by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the purpose of transposing into Irish law the terms of the Habitats Directive of the European Union in accordance with the terms of the European Communities Act 1972; and notes with approval the success of the Minister in promoting a spirit of partnership between all those concerned for the conservation of the Irish countryside in advancing the objectives of the Directive.</P>
      <P>The recent signing and publication of the regulations allowing for the designation of special areas of conservation represent several significant achievements.  The regulations provide a sound basis for the long-term future of the conservation and protection of our native habitats for wildlife, acknowledge the critical role of farmers and farming practice in creating and maintaining areas of high conservation value and operate to channel very important income to many small farmers and landowners.  The process recognises the crucial elements of a partnership approach in nature conservation, a partnership of government, farming and other conservation interests. Tá i gceist agam cúpla focal a rá faoi na réimsí éagsúla sin, ceann ina cheann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the various occasions that these issues have been discussed in the House there has been consensus that the natural heritage has been seriously damaged.  Many habitat sites and species of fauna and flora have been destroyed, degraded or are seriously threatened.  We all know that this cannot continue, the responsibility to deal with the critical issues needs to be grasped and remedial action taken.  I have sought through the partnership approach referred to in the motion to <Col N="760" /> take that responsibility and to put in place the appropriate remedial action.  The Habitats Directive and the enabling regulations which I have signed, with the financial package being put in place, represent the most significant elements of that response.  This directive does not seek to apply conservation measures to all sites and wildlife habitats which are of significance for wildlife either in Ireland or the European Union as a whole; rather its purpose is to protect the very best of what we have left and, in particular, those sites and habitats that are important in a European context.  Specifically, it is designed to protect, through designation as special areas of conservation, natural habitats which are in danger of disappearance, are rare or represent outstanding examples of their type.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of these habitats in an Irish context.  We are all familiar with blanket bogs, which occur mainly in upland areas and are concentrated in the west, and raised bogs which were once typical of the midlands.  I want to be clear and frank about why intervention is needed urgently.  No less than 8 per cent of the world's blanket bog is found in Ireland, which is the most important country in Europe for blanket bog. Lowland blanket bog is found only in Ireland and Scotland. Ireland supports some of the best remaining examples of raised bogs in Europe and these are probably the most extensive of their type in the world.  However, there has been damage and loss on a huge and unacceptable scale. The sad reality is that a staggering 80-90 per cent of our blanket and raised bogs have been degraded or destroyed.  This not only represents significant destruction of the national and European but also constitutes significant destruction of the global natural resource.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another habitat type &mdash; turloughs &mdash; with which we are all familiar and of which we are justifiably proud.  These occur in limestone areas mainly in the centre part of the country west of the Shannon, most commonly in counties Galway, Clare, Mayo and Roscommon. These seasonal lakes are unique to Ireland, but once again destruction is widespread.  At least one third of all turloughs in Ireland &mdash; and, therefore, in Europe &mdash; have been destroyed by drainage and those that remain are under threat from drainage, pollution and other factors.</P>
    <P>I want to mention one further habitat type, that being limestone pavement.  The most important parts of the country in which this is found are the Burren and the Aran Islands.  This is a wildlife habitat and landscape of international importance.  This habitat is also vulnerable to damage, sometimes through clearance of the limestone pavement, reclamation or farming practices.</P>
    <P>While the directive and the regulations concentrate on the protection of habitats by designating the prime sites as special areas of conservation, or SACs as they have come to be known, a relatively small number of species are also identified as requiring protection.  These include, for example, the Killarney fern, Ireland having the largest <Col N="761" /> population in Europe outside of Spain and Portugal, and the lesser horseshoe bat, a species for which Ireland is the most important country in Europe.  Also included are species with which we may be even less familiar, such as a very rare and threatened species of fresh water pearl mussel which has only been recorded in this country, in the River Nore, and which currently faces extinction.</P>
    <P>I could continue in a similar vein, but Deputies will clearly see the backdrop against which the directive, and subsequently the regulations, were framed.  The habitats I have referred to, and the others covered by the regulations, are extremely important.  All have suffered significant and often drastic losses and all are virtually or completely irreplaceable.  The action taken in putting the regulations in place represents my commitment, as the Minister responsible for the heritage, and the commitment of the Government to turn back this tide for the benefit not just of the current generation but also as a worthy bequest to generations which will follow.  If nothing else were achieved in the heritage area in the life of the Government, this in itself would represent a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>Having set out the urgent rationale for the directive and the regulations, I will now set out what these regulations will mean in practice for land owners and users.  In signing the regulations on the 26 February and ensuring a fair financial package was put in place, I have not merely transposed the bones of the directive into Irish law. The regulations certainly incorporate the protective requirements contained in the directive, but they do much more than that.  They put in place a fair process with provision for objections, appeals, arbitration, independent input and fair and proper compensation.  I will briefly outline this process.</P>
    <P>At this stage, proposed candidate SAC sites have been identified as the result of comprehensive surveys undertaken by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department.  The areas involved cover about 550,000 hectares in some 400 sites.  Many of these valuable sites are contained in the western part of the country.  The most extensive areas involve blanket bog, heath and uplands covering approximately 200,000 hectares; lakes and rivers, approximately 100,000 hectares; estuaries, mudflats and cliffs, approximately 90,000 hectares; a further 40,000 hectares of shallow bays and 54,000 hectares of saltmarsh, machair and sand dunes.  Other habitats include 30,000 hectares of limestone pavement, 10,000 hectares of raised bogs, 15,000 hectares of fens and 3,000 hectares of turloughs.  That is the composition of the national map.</P>
    <P>Notification of the proposals to put forward sites as candidate SACs will be issued in three phases.  The first batch of notifications will issue this week and relate to approximately 200 sites containing priority habitats such as blanket bog and uplands, raised bogs, turloughs, machair and limestone pavement.  Every effort will be made to <Col N="762" /> contact landowners directly, with each landowner being supplied with a map of the area being proposed for designation, a description of the site indicating the reason it is being put forward, an outline of likely damaging activities, and information on the procedures for objections and appeals, as well as on compensation.</P>
    <P>In addition to making direct contact with known landowners, announcements and maps of the sites involved will be displayed in local Garda stations, local offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Teagasc offices, local offices of the Department of Social Welfare, planning offices of local authorities and local offices of my own Department.  Announcements will also be broadcast on local radio and placed in local newspapers.  Furthermore, public meetings are being organised to provide information on candidate SACs and a freefone service is in place to provide information and answer queries relating to SACs.  To complete this comprehensive package of information measures, local staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service will be available to deal with specific issues with individual landowners, users and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out on a number of occasions, the habitats directive is a conservation measure and only allows for objections to proposed designations on scientific grounds &mdash; that is in the directive.  I am, however, putting in place a board, representative of farming and other conservation interests, as well as an independent chairperson, which will advise me on such objections.  The procedure being put in place will allow landowners and others the opportunity to object to the proposal to put forward the site.  They can object to the inclusion of the site in the candidate list, the proposed boundaries or the conditions specified, but the objections may be on scientific grounds only, which are derived from the directive.  My Department is actively examining how best landowners or users who may have grounds to object can so do in the most effective and cheapest way possible.  Parties will be invited to contact the NPWS in the first instance, and only if issues cannot be dealt with in an informal fashion will the formal process come into play. When I speak about &ldquo;others&rdquo;, I mean anyone interested in any general conservation or leisure area.</P>
    <P>On the role of farmers and farming practices, bhí ról fíor-thábhachtach ag an bhfeirmeoireacht i múnlú na tuaithe agus na bithéagsúlachta atá againn in Éirinn inniu.  Tá béim leagtha agam go minic &mdash; sa Teach seo agus in áiteanna eile &mdash; ar an ról criticiúil a bhí ag feirmeoirí i gcruthú agus i gcothabháil na gceantar nádúrtha speisialta atá á bplé againn anseo inniu agus ar an ngá, dá réir, go leanfar leis an bhfeirrneoireacht ar bhealach inmharthana.  Measaim gur fiú a rá arís gurbh iad na feirmeoirí féin i mórán cásanna a chruthaigh, tríd a gcuid nósanna feirmeoireachta traidisiúnta féin, na gnáthóga sin agus a gcabhraíonn fós le hardluach caomhantais a choimeád sna ceantair atá i gceist.  Ar ndóigh, bheinn faillíoch mura ndé- <Col N="763" /> arfainn freisin gur de bharr nósanna áirithe feirmeoireachta nua-aimseartha a tharla meath i líon suntasach de na ceantair sin.  Ní gá dom ach tagairt a dhéanamh don droch-éifeacht a tháinig as barraíocht caorach a bheith curtha ar thailte áirithe in iarthar na tíre chun an pointe sin a fhírinniú.</P>
    <P>However, from an ecological perspective, if we are to maintain the high environmental value, it is essential that the sustainable farming practices which maintain the important and irreplaceable habitats continue.  Taking land out of agricultural production, or forcing farmers off the land, as I have been accused of, is not a viable option from a nature conservation perspective.  To say nature conservation wants to or must drive farmers off the land is arrant nonsense.  Both objectives can be achieved.  The opposite of the assertion of driving anybody off the land is true.  Support for the continuation of sustainable farming is needed for effective conservation, as well as for social, economic and practical reasons.  It is not and should not be an either/or situation, either we have agriculture or we have nature conservation.</P>
    <P>I want to firmly nail some of the wilder statements made in recent months and set out the actual position.  There is no change affecting the ownership of land; the regulations do not give compulsory purchase powers to my Department, nor was this ever contemplated; there is no question of increased public access to lands designated or proposed for designation.  There is provision for NPWS staff to monitor activity in a SAC, but they will always try to contact the landowner first. There is no question of a prohibition on farming in areas designated as SACs.  Such designation will not interfere with sustainable farming.  Only activities which are damaging will be restricted or required to be changed.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House recognises the benefits, and the necessity, of having an agriculture industry which respects and maintains a high quality environment.  The benefits to agriculture in general, to farmers, to the credibility attaching to our food production and to the perception of the country as having a good, clean and green environment are widespread.  It further benefits this generation as well as acknowledging our national heritage of which we are mere custodians and trustees.</P>
    <P>The third positive outcome from the regulations I referred to at the outset is that they channel very important income to many small farmers and landowners particularly in areas with marginal agricultural production.  This compensation package has been negotiated and agreed between myself and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farming organisations.  I recall being castigated by the Opposition on this issue even though there was a clear Government commitment in Partnership 2000 that a fair and proper level of compensation would be paid, having regard to the level and extent of restriction and all reasonable losses arising <Col N="764" /> as a result of SAC or SPA designations and to the difference between the value pre-designation for environmental purposes and subsequent value of the land consequent on SPA or SAC designation.</P>
    <P>Is léir ón toradh comhaontaithe atá faighte againn gur sheasamar go daingean leis an ngeallúint sin agus gur thug an Rialtas lán-tacaíocht dó. Ba mhaith liom an comhaontú a baineadh amach a chur ar thaifead an Tí seo.</P>
    <P>There are two options open to landowners or users whose land is designated.  Option 1 is the scheme administered by my Department.  This package is available to those who decide not to participate in the rural environment protection scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Under this scheme farmers will be required to farm their SAC land in accordance with an agri-environmental plan prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The farming conditions that will apply in the Burren, blanket bogs, heaths and upland grasslands in SACs have already been agreed by my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry as well as by Teagasc, private farm planners, farming organisations and relevant non-governmental organisations, and are in place.  These habitats account for over two thirds of the land area to be included in SACs. The same conditions that currently apply under REPS for NHAs will apply to SACs, and I thank those who co-operated in achieving this harmonious development.</P>
    <P>Farmers will be compensated for income loss, including headage or premia or its alternative. They will also be compensated for any additional costs or losses which arise as a result of complying with the farm plan.  All such costs, including capital costs, will be identified, quantified and agreed between my Department and the farmer concerned.  In exceptional cases, including hardship, <i>ex gratia</i> payments may be made.  Where agreement is not reached on the amount payable, independent arbitration will be available to determine the compensation.</P>
    <P>The second option available to land owners or users is through the rural environment protection scheme, administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Deputies will be aware that under this scheme there is a basic payment of approximately £50 per acre for the first 100 acres.  In the case of lands within proposed NHAs there is a further top-up payment of about £12 per acre.  Now with SACs, there is provision for another top-up of some £15 per acre for the first 100 acres.  For the next 100 acres, a further £7.50 per SAC acre will paid.  Finally, an additional £5 per SAC acre will be payable in the 200-300 acre range.  Funding for these additional payments, which are subject to EU approval, will be channelled through my Department.</P>
    <P>All of this compensation represents a large injection of income into agriculture and particularly <Col N="765" /> into the west.  The annual value of the package is approximately £20 million.  Equally, and perhaps more importantly in the longer term, the financial support that this package puts in place sets a precedent by recognising and acknowledging the importance of good farming practice in delivering wider benefits to the community, in particular through the protection and maintenance of our most important wildlife sites. In the longer term, such recognition and financial support for the wider environmental benefits that sustainable farming delivers will, I am sure, be increasingly important for agriculture and farmers.</P>
    <P>Over the past several months I have been criticised, often in a vitriolic and offensive fashion, by members of the Opposition in relation to the manner in which I have proceeded to put the regulations we are discussing here today in place. In this House in November last Deputy de Valera castigated me as &ldquo;some sort of new Cromwell trying to take over land without consultation or compensation&rdquo;.  This cheap jibe is indicative of the misinformation which has abounded.  I set the record straight in this House in November last in relation to the extent of consultation which had taken place.  Let me just give the House a brief update on what has taken place in recent months. Since January there have been some 15 meetings with farming and other conservation representatives, the outcome of which is reflected in the agreement reached within the past fortnight.  I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that these farming representatives, as well as negotiating tenaciously, as one might expect, on behalf of their members, also recognised from the outset the necessity and, indeed, virtue of the regulations.  In the course of these negotiations, I deferred signing the regulations on three separate occasions to allow for an agreed outcome leading to a signing which was attended by both farming and conservation interests.</P>
    <P>Members of my Department have attended and addressed several public meetings, the most recent at Belmullet, Crossmolina, Killarney and, last night, at Maam Cross, and I understand there is a further one today in Glencar in County Kerry and one tomorrow in Westport.</P>
    <P>Even this does not spell out the full extent of communication with farming and other conservation interests.  A programme of information is being put in place which will encompass local radio, newspapers, information material, local meetings and an information freephone operated by my Department.  All of this is being put in place to ensure that individual farmers and landowners are fully informed of exactly what proposed designation may mean for them.</P>
    <P>Lest it be construed that all contact, consultation and communication has been with farming representatives alone, I would like to emphasise once again that the benefits of the habitats directive and the regulations I have signed accrue to all.  Accordingly, I have been at pains to involve the various conservation groups in consultation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> These groups, together with farming interests, will play an active part in the ongoing implementation of the regulations, and both will be represented on the group I will be putting in place which will advise me on objections to proposed designations.  They will also be consulted on the ongoing implementation of the regulations.</P>
    <P>All the steps I have taken to date reflect my strong wish to have consensus across the entire community on the importance of the issues and the necessity to take action that recognises the critical role played by a range of parties.  It should also be clear to Deputies from all sides of the House that the extent of consultation with all parties has been unprecedented, and I am committed to continuing this communication.  To suggest that consultation only took place because of political pressure from members of the Opposition is quite clearly nonsensical and is not borne out by the facts.  I have always believed in openness and communication.  On no less than three occasions I deferred signing the regulations to allow negotiations to continue on the assurance that progress was being made in the negotiations and not wishing to put anything which might be perceived to be an obstacle in the way of an outcome which would be beneficial to all.  The logic of this should be obvious.  If there was an absence of agreement considerable difficulty would be encountered in meeting the objectives we have all espoused. Partnership between all parties is not just important but imperative.</P>
    <P>Mar focail scoir, cuirfimid críoch leis an méid atá le rá ann, I again draw attention to the historic work we have put in place.  We have recognised as a nation the critical importance of taking immediate steps to protect and conserve what remains of the most important elements of our natural heritage.  We have approached this task in the knowledge that it can only be accomplished by the co-operation and active participation of all parties.  We have a responsibility to the generations from which we have inherited our unique natural heritage to pass this on to future generations so that they too can enjoy the benefits that all of us are currently fortunate enough to possess.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes the publication of the Regulations for the designation of Special Areas of Conservation, condemns the failure of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to engage in full consultation, further condemns the Minister for his failure to provide full information, <Col N="767" /> notes with concern the continuing disquiet of landowners, who are key partners in the conservation process, and calls on the Minister to ensure that a genuine partnership between conservationists and landowners exists&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I put forward this amendment because of the continuing disquiet about the manner in which the designation of special areas of conservation has been handled by the Minister.  There is no doubt about the importance of conservation and the need for action.  We object to the Minister's failure to provide full information and take account of the continuing disquiet of landowners who are key players in the conservation business.  They have been in that business for hundreds of years and remain at the front line.  There is an onus on the Minister to ensure conservation and to ensure that the partnership between conservationists and landowners is real, which does not appear to be the case.  At a meeting this week in County Galway major disquiet was expressed by landowners about the continuing lack of information, consultation and partnership.  Farmers continue to liken the Minister, Deputy Higgins, to Cromwell and make the point that at least that gentleman came in daylight.  They accuse the Minister of trying to nationalise their land by stealth, by coming in the night and in secret.  They accuse him of pushing the matter through without due consultation. Certainly in his dealings with them, there was no sign of the &ldquo;people first&rdquo; principle.  All the Labour Party talk about bottom-up approaches was abandoned, and dictats from the top applied. That mentality still applies and landowners believe the agriculture establishment has been sucked into the mire <i>via</i> the negotiations on national agreements.</P>
    <P>Farmers go so far as to say the editorial line of their bible, <i>The Farmers Journal</i>, has not been sufficiently questioning about the SACs deal and whether it represents a good arrangement for the long-term.  They point out that further questions need to be asked by the media about what happens when REPS ends after five years.  Will farmers be stopped selling their land for forestry and stopped reseeding?  Will scientific appeals, the only ones provided for, be very limited and unsatisfactory?  Will farmers have to get permission for every turn they make on their own farms?  They fear they will become cheque-in-the-post landowners.  People do not want that.  They want to have active involvement on their land.</P>
    <P>There have been questions about what will happen if the EU disagrees with the changes in REPS and the overall plan.  What happens if in the current round of financial cuts the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht loses ground? This SACs deal will require additional staff in the Department for implementation and monitoring. Yet, the Minister already claims he has not enough staff to even get a plan together for Ireland's millennium celebrations.  So what about this project?  How will he cope with this?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> The disquiet of landowners stems from the manner in which the Minister went about his business in the first instance.  He refused to consult on designations.  I thought this was best summed up by Dr. Peter Foss, Chairman of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council, when he was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> several weeks ago. He said shortly before Christmas, draft regulations to implement the Habitats Directive were shown to conservation groups at a meeting in the Minister's Department and said: &ldquo;It was the first time any of us had seen them, but we were told that they couldn't be changed.&rdquo;  Farming groups met the same rigidity and absolutism from the Minister and his Department.  They were delivered with a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; ultimatum.  It was interesting to read in the February edition of <i>Irish Farmers Monthly</i> that the IFA's Michael Slattery said at that stage they were still encountering difficulties getting the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to spell out what was involved. All the farming organisations continued to warn just weeks ago that farmers were confused with the concepts and not enough was being done.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attempt to railroad these matters through led to a debate in this House.  That debate had to be in Private Members' time because the Minister refused to give Government time.  He would not accept any input from the Oireachtas and displayed arrogance and anti-democratic tendencies.  The Private Members' debate at least forced the Minister to be a little more open but he continued to display an intolerance of criticism in regard to SACs.  He also refused to allow any examination by the Oireachtas of his activities in the matter.  His constant mantra has been that once they are signed into law, then and only then could elected Members of this House comment.</P>
    <P>The same has applied to those to be affected by these proposals.  Landowners whose land is being designated have not been told.  The Minister insisted that all consultation with individual landowners would only be after the event.  Even though between 10,000 and 15,000 farmers will be affected by the land designations, most of them remain in the dark.  Some of them may be under the illusion that maps for the SACs and the NHAs will be the same, but that is not necessarily the case.  Any complacency of farmers may be rudely shattered when the Minister eventually concedes to consult individually with them.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledged last month that his plans were in a shambles and he deferred signing the SACs into law at that time. Fianna Fáil had warned him for weeks it would be foolishness to proceed with signing the regulations while there was no deal with landowners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We warned that riding roughshod over landowners would not produce happy conservationists.  The signing of the order on special areas of conservation will affect about one <Col N="769" /> million acres of land or one-twelfth of the country.  The estimates of the number of farmers to be affected varies greatly.  Even though these areas have been signed into law, however, the Minister's Department has conceded that it still knows only about 6,000 of the 15,000-plus farmers who will be affected.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has only 6,000 addresses and concedes it does not even know exactly how many others will be involved, and their addresses are a complete mystery.</P>
      <P>Even though the Department knew 6,000 addresses before the directive was signed, none of these was notified or sent maps of the areas affected.  No attempt was made to find the farmers through advertising or information campaigns.  The deal done with the farmers' organisation does not go down well with everyone as was evident at a meeting this week in County Galway. I pay tribute to the IFA which, through its strong negotiating prowess, has been able to get concessions from the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for its members.  I commend it on doing so.  That organisation will acknowledge that raising questions in this House before Christmas afforded an opportunity for consultations to take place.  In answer to questions I put down at that time, we were told signing would not take place for a couple of weeks.  As a result of questions raised by this side of the House, followed by a debate in Private Members' time, there has been a flurry of consultations, particularly in recent months, and I welcome them even though they have been held at a late date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there are individual farmers who are not members of any farming organisation and they will want to know where they stand.  Many of those farmers are extremely concerned because they do not know if they will have a say in the matter or a right of appeal.  Apparently, appeals will be allowed only on a scientific basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers are also concerned that a lobby has not been launched at EU level.  The Minister has to negotiate with Brussels.  It is important that he gets an early decision on the SAC package and direct approval from Brussels on the REPs approvals.  He has not outlined the Government's view on the proposals to use the SACs as a way of developing heritage tourism.  Will the Government run with this?  Will farmers not in the REPs benefit from allowing tourists on their lands?  As we are one of the best conservation sites in the EU, the plan for SACs should be a platform for an initiative between the EU and the Departments <Col N="770" /> of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil recognises that effective conservation of habitats and species is crucial to farming interests and that there have been problems in this area.  However, it should be noted that we are better than other EU countries at maintaining habitats and species, and we can thank farmers for that.  The role of farmers in conservation has not been recognised in some quarters, particularly in the media.  The environment correspondent with <i>The Irish Times</i> has painted farmers as being happy to be cheque-in-the-post merchants and has shown a distinct intolerance of their concerns.  In an article last January he stated &ldquo;Farmers see NHAs and other nature protection measure as an interference with their rights to do what they like with their land&rdquo;.  That was a rather patronising and simplistic comment.  The remainder of the article presented farmers in a similar light and argued that conservationists have a superior right in this affair.  That approach is out of sync in a newspaper that prides itself on encouraging plurality and tolerance in Irish society, North and South.</P>
    <P>I have yet to meet a journalist who would not take a stand when his or her terms and conditions of employment are being changed, and that is commendable.  I am sure the environment correspondent with <i>The Irish Times</i> would be exceedingly vocal and defensive if a major change was planned in his area of operation.  Why should farmers not protect their rights?  Why should they not negotiate the best possible deal?  Surely they do not have to apologise to <i>The Irish Times</i> or to anybody else for their existence.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting aspects in this debate has been how the Minister has used the EU as a big brother or sister.  He claims if we do not do this now, the EU will slap a case on us.  Why did the Minister not begin this process during the last four years?  Why did he wait until the dying hours of this Government?  Is it necessary to beef up his list of achievements before the election?  Having a flurry at the last minute does not excuse inactivity for four years.</P>
    <P>There is also an irony in this issue.  While the Minister is doing one thing, his Government colleague, the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry, is doing another.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is in trouble with the EU for not monitoring environmental damage. Both arms of the Government must move in tandem on these matters.  When the Minister is concluding, I do not want him to engage in the despicable cop-out of claiming this side of the House did or did not do this, that or the other when in Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister is in the hot seat and should face up to his responsibilities, rather than make excuses or live in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its recent policy document, Caring for Our <Col N="771" /> Heritage, Fianna Fáil set out its views on conservation matters.  We believe SACs provide an opportunity to make farmers an even greater instrument in conservation.  We believe the deal must be used to provide farmers with a future and to ensure that vast tracts of the country do not become a series of deserted villages and homes. A new future has to be developed and this an opportunity to do it.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the green image of Ireland presented in mythology, song and story and of the green image we want to portray to visitors. Despite the move to the cities and towns, we are a people with clear links to the land and the landscape.  We are a people devoted to place and we love our natural environment.  In recent decades, however, our natural environment has been under threat and, as development proceeds, we must implement co-ordinated policies to protect it.  The cornerstone of any development policy must be sustainable development so that the environment within which it takes place and the resources required for it and for society are not put at risk.</P>
    <P>The Earth Summit in Rio de Janerio, the Dublin UN conference on water and the environment and other international conferences and studies have pointed to the fragility of the planet's natural environment.  We must play a significant role in caring for the international and global environment and cherish and protect our own natural environment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that a balance is needed in the area of conservation.  I listened with interest to what he said about the importance of our blanket and raised bogs and our turloughs. Clare people &mdash; the Minister was born in Clare &mdash; have a heightened awareness of their great historical wealth in terms of heritage.  It is unfortunate that farmers are often juxtaposed with conservationists in such debates.  That is a wrong approach.  I hope that will fade into the background when people realise our farmers are the front line conservationists.  We can protect our wealth of heritage only when we have achieved a balance between landowners and conservationists.</P>
    <P>I tabled two questions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht which were disallowed because of this debate.  How does the Minister intend to transpose the directive into Irish law? Will it be done through legislation or regulation?</P>
    <P>A group of people from the golfing fraternity are concerned that their needs are not being met under this directive.  They want to outline that there is no anti-environmental feeling among golfers and current tensions raised on the interpretation of the environment and possible application of the law following the implementation of this directive are causing them concern.  They claim the EU Council Directive 92/43/EEC (Wildlife) specifically states that economic, social, cultural and regional requirements may be taken into account when it is being enforced, but the Minister's <Col N="772" /> officials state that only scientific arguments will be allowed.  Will the Minister clarify that matter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the directive to which they refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They are concerned about a direct conflict and they submit that, as the law comes into force, the following points should be considered.  There are only 150 golf links in the world of which Ireland has 39.  These golf links form a vital part of our heritage, culture, social fabric and tourism based economy.  They also contend that because of the issues involved and the fact that Ireland is one of the cleanest and most sound environmental land masses in the world, it should not be compelled to designate golf lands under the new law, which may have a greater urgency in overdeveloped continental settings.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this issue.</P>
      <P>Those involved in wildlife associations want to know when the NHAs will come into force. NHAs have been proposed but their implementation will depend on the introduction of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  When will this legislation be introduced?  Those interested in bird life have put forward a number of views.  They claim there is a need to strengthen the powers of wildlife rangers and carry out a number of surveys of certain bird populations because current surveys are not sufficient.  There is also a need for greater monitoring, but we need more funding to do that.</P>

This is an important issue which the Minister should not <Col N="773" /> scoff at and I hope further funding will be put in place to ensure the monitoring of these surveys. The general health of the environment can be assessed by the reaction of the bird population to it.

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhtheachta, an Teachta Síle de Valera, as ucht an deis a thabhairt dom pairt a ghacadh sa díospóireacht ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Cuidím leis an leasú ar an rún a mhol sí.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera asked if it would be more appropriate to deal with this matter through legislation rather than by way of a directive.  The manner in which the debate has been conducted is unsatisfactory in that it does not allow us to tease out the complex issues.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of openness and transparency in the way this issue has been addressed.  I am not sure if the Minister wanted to hoodwink people or if officials in his Department were not sure what they wanted to achieve.  Perhaps it was complicated by the fact that negotiations were under way as this issue was being advanced.  One factor which militated strongly against openness and transparency was that the Minister said maps of the areas concerned would not be made available until after the directive was signed for legal reasons.  However, it made people more suspicious than they might have been had they known what areas were included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great concern that areas which have been intensively farmed up to now may be included in the SACs.  Farmers are afraid that their role may be seriously undermined as a result of these regulations.  We must consider the implications for planning authorities in the future.  In response to recent parliamentary questions, the Minister indicated that workshops had been held to discuss this issue.  However, like the meetings with farmers, little clear information was available to planners.  It seems that no one knows what is being decided and it is being made up as we go along. <Col N="774" /> We must also consider the operation of SACs and environmental schemes in Europe.  In some countries a large percentage of the land is designated under one or other of the categories.  In France it is 16 per cent but in other countries it could be as little as 0.4 of 1 per cent.  This suggests there is no uniform approach across the EU. Some European countries have decided to designate large areas and imposed a lax regime, while others have chosen smaller areas and imposed a draconian regime.  When this issue was discussed with the farmers and bodies concerned there was no mention of striking a balance.  That led to dissatisfaction, particularly in the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>The Burren is of great importance in environmental terms.  Unfortunately, however, it has been the subject of much controversy.  Sometimes controversy throws light on an issue but, in the case of the Burren, it had the opposite effect in that it polarised people and made the job of conservation more difficult.</P>
    <P>I support conservation where there is a clear case for doing so, such as in substantial areas of the Burren.  However, I take issue with the manner in which the Minister and all those involved sought to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I have a fundamental difficulty with the appeals procedure which is being put in place, mainly on the basis &mdash; as the Minister explained &mdash; that it is only on scientific grounds.  It is one of the areas about which there does not seem to be any confusion.  However, there are cases when a particular kind of economic development, which is almost always agricultural in nature and which has taken place traditionally, will be undermined by the imposition of the SAC.  Considerations other than those which relate to scientific grounds could come into play in a tiny number of cases.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the role of the arbitrator in the question of compensation.  I am disappointed that there is still much disaffection and confusion despite all the meetings and attempts to clarify issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one EU directive which I am happy to see finally transposed into Irish law and I fully support the motion.  Nevertheless, I have a number of reservations about the manner in which the matter is being approached, certain fears about how we are to proceed from here and a number of questions to put to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The principle, to protect areas of particular scientific and other interest in Irish law as much as possible, is a good one.  It is high time that we transposed this directive into Irish law as it should have been implemented in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The places in question which we are now seeking to identify as areas for conservation are of unique importance to the future of this country, to our citizens who wish to see such a fundamental part of their heritage protected and conserved, and to our self-respect as Irish people and proud Europeans.  A great deal which ought to have been conserved and preserved has been irretrievably <Col N="775" /> lost.  That is a sad commentary on our sense of values but it is a fact which cannot now be overturned.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  How do we best put and keep in place a very complex kind of arrangement?  There is nothing simple about the proposal to put in place a partnership between farmers, who have a traditional approach and deep attachment to the land, the ownership of which was hard fought for and won in many cases, and the rights of the community who want certain elements conserved.  It is important that the Minister would, at the outset, seek to put and keep in place an inclusive partnership where farmers and conservationists sing from the same hymn sheet, move in the same direction and be at one on what needs to be done and how it is to be done.  That task is difficult enough.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed as my understanding was that greater progress had been made in recent times by the Minister in his discussions with farmers.</P>

      <P>The Minister will reply to this debate later and answer my concerns.</P>
      <P>I hope that is the case because the farmers are and have been the best custodians of our natural inheritance.  They will continue to be and it is critically important that we give them that role and seek to have them totally committed at the outset to the principles of conservation and preservation which are enshrined in this motion.</P>
      <P>I said I had reservations as to how the matter was being progressed and I will come to that later.  I am unclear as to whether the boundaries of the area earmarked for conservation have been finally and fully agreed.  I take on board what the Minister said in his speech but is it his intention to place copies of maps and boundaries in the Library to enable Deputies to have access to them?</P>

      <P>That is important.  What happens when the REP scheme runs out as it will inevitably?  Is that eventuality anticipated at this point and will clear provision be made now for it?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister set a start-up date for the application of the regulations under this provision?  Will there be a uniform start-up date for the whole country?  At what point will he be in a position to announce that the procedure has come into effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the appeals mechanism at Question Time and when we debated this matter earlier.  I am glad the Minister has provided for an independent appeals mechanism.  That is the correct thing to do because this is a conservation measure.  Compensation is only a vehicle to make conservation possible but conservation is the primary issue.  In the event that a designated site was <Col N="776" /> damaged by the extraction of peat for commercial reasons, for example, can a conservation body appeal against such an action?  If so, will it get a hearing?  If a renegade farmer decided to act in such a way, will there be provision to penalise that person by reducing his or her compensation? It is important that the independent appeals mechanism should work to the benefit of the conservationist as well as the farmer because there must not be an incentive to damage any protected habitat.</P>
    <P>With regard to NHAs and SACs, is it the intention of the Government to extend the scope of the regulations to all Natura 2000 sites so that any developments which are likely to impact on such sites are subject to environmental impact assessments?  As a conservationist, I argue that all Natura 2000 sites must be brought under the scope of the planning Acts to give legislators scope to manage these matters properly in law and strike a fair balance between the indisputable and constitutional rights of farmers and conservationists for generations to come.</P>
    <P>On the issue of golf links, people who own or run them are concerned to ensure the provisions of the directive when transposed into Irish law will not extend to golf links.  We have 39 of the world's 150 golf links.  They are a major national asset we should seek to maintain and we should ensure they will not be needlessly interfered with under the banner of conservation measures.  Golf links like Ballybunion and Dooks in County Kerry, Lahinch in County Clare and Portmarnock are some of the finest in the world.  The sand dunes and other natural features of importance to conservationists on those golf links are intact because golf clubs kept them so.  They have been incredibly good custodians of important elements of our natural landscape.  Golf links should not be interfered with.  There is no need to interfere with them.  They are well preserved and will continue to be if their owners, developers and clubs are allowed to continue their business unimpeded.  It would be an outrage if a civil servant or other agent of the State at any level sought to impose regulations on golf links in Ballybunion, Dooks or Lahinch which have been areas of conservation for generations.  Will the Minister confirm that golf links will be excluded from the provisions of this directive?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Minister.  It is important when discussing designation of specific areas of conservation that a matter brought to my attention by my party colleague, Senator Cathy Honan, should be raised.  She is concerned about a problem that has arisen in regard to Croghan Hill in County Offaly, an area of historic and great religious significance in folk memory.  That area has been designated as one of special control and is a protected area in Offaly's county <Col N="777" /> development plan.  The Minister may say this matter is not related directly to this motion, but I bring it to his attention because I know such matters concern him.  In the meantime ESAT has erected a Portakabin-like construction containing equipment on the site claiming that it has done so because it is an exempted development.  Offaly County Council was forced to go to court to obtain a temporary injunction against ESAT and it has also had to refer the matter to An Bord Pleanála.  I am concerned that what happened on that site could happen in another part of the country.  This is unacceptable in terms of what we are trying to do in regard to our heritage and what we are talking about here.  The protection of areas of archaeological, geological and historical interest is vital.  Steps must be taken to ensure their protection and appropriate measures must be put in place as a matter of urgency.  I consider that more important than doing anything in connection with golf links that are adequately protected already.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the necessity to amend the Wildlife Bill sooner rather than later.  One newspaper carries the heading, hedgerows butchered in policy farce.  That is happening in Counties Cork and Kerry and throughout other parts of the country.  There seems to be a lack of clarification between local authorities and farmers as to who is responsible for cutting and keeping hedgerows under control for road safety purposes.  In a number of areas local authorities have issued instructions to have hedges cut with road safety in mind but the hedgerows have been butchered around some of the most scenic parts of our country.  The visual impact is appalling. People have told me, but because of work commitments I have not seen, of the devastation of beautiful fuchsia hedgerows which have been cut down on part of the Ring of Kerry.</P>
      <P>As well as the visual impact, cutting hedgerows results in the loss of bird habitats.  This issue must be addressed and it is mainly the responsibility of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  I draw this matter to the Minister's attention because this debate is about conservation in all its elements and applications.  Our hedgerows are important, but perhaps not as important as some of the elements sought to be protected under this directive because hedgerows will grow, commonsense will prevail and a better procedure will be put in place in regard to the manner in which local authorities and farmers address this matter.  If a number of the elements we are seeking to protect in the context of this motion are lost, they will be irretrievably lost. This is an important motion.  I hope the Minister will provide clarification on the reservations I expressed and answer the questions I asked to ensure we will put in place the principles of the directives sooner rather than later and give the areas in question the type of protection they need in law.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome this legislation.  Conservation and the preservation of wildlife is a hobby-horse of mine.  I am glad the Government and the Minister responsible for this area are taking positive steps to safeguard habitats, the basis of all wildlife.  It is a shocking indictment that for many years we neglected protecting many species, some of which are now extinct and many of which are under threat of extinction.  I hope this legislation goes some way towards addressing that problem.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about the implementation of the directive until there are sufficient personnel to implement the measures proposed by the Minister.  I live in County Waterford which has two major mountain ranges and a good deal of hill land, but there is only one wildlife ranger to monitor and protect the wildlife in that county. Dozens of people should be assigned to that work.  Many people are interested in taking up employment related to safeguarding our wildlife and protecting our habitats.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern about the impact of last month's bad weather on the fishing industry and I understand the frustrations and difficulties which resulted from these weeks of relative inactivity.  The situation is being closely monitored and, while weather conditions are currently good, the impact of another sustained period of bad weather would require further review. Any State aid for a national fishing fleet must be approved by the European Commission under <Col N="779" /> the relevant EU legislation.  The Commission is opposed to State aid to compensate for weather conditions and has previously confirmed that EU fisheries funding for exceptional events does not include bad weather.</P>
    <P>The Commission opposed the national compensation scheme following the winter of 1993-4 and only accepted it because of the exceptional severity and duration of bad weather that winter and the fact that the aid was funded entirely by the Exchequer.  The bad weather this winter has not been comparable to the severe conditions in 1993-4.  It would not be appropriate or productive to approach the Commission at this stage on the basis of the meteorological evidence to date.</P>
    <P>Meteorological Office statistics indicate that, apart from last month, the wind conditions to date this winter from November to March have not been as severe as in some other years.  Overall, it appears that this winter was slightly better than average.  While many vessels were tied up last month, the fishing conditions in December and January were better than normal for that time of year.  The anticipated level of fishing effort during the coming weeks should assist fishermen in making up for the bad conditions experienced in February.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister firmly ruled out negotiating compensation for fishermen?  In his reply he stated that the situation would be kept under review.  A very serious situation has developed and, while December and January were good, February will be remembered as one of the worst months fishermen have been obliged to endure for many years.  I understand they have been losing approximately £9 million per week due to the bad weather.  In the past, other sectors received compensation and I see no good reason that fishermen cannot also receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Any action taken by my Department in this regard must be approved by the Commission.  When compensation was provided in 1993-94 because of the exceptional severity and duration of the bad weather, it was entirely funded by the Exchequer.  It would be unwise to approach the Commission for approval unless we had concrete evidence to show that conditions this year were exceptional in comparison with other years.  I fully understand the concerns of fishermen whose vessels remained tied up because of bad weather.  I will monitor the situation closely and reconsider taking action if the weather takes a turn for the worse.  However, I would have to approach the Commission and make a case for exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the figure quoted by the Deputy, compared to other years statistics for landings in February do not indicate that a loss of £9 million is correct.  However, I will investigate the figure and communicate with him on the matter.  It is unwise to quote figures without first having concrete evidence.</P>
      <P>In respect of the number of gale days per station, the indication is that while the weather was bad during February it was not exceptionally so when compared to previous years.  Figures for the station in Dublin for February in successive years show that in 1991-2 and 1992-3 there were no gale days; in 1993-4 and 1994-5, there were two; in 1995-6, there were none; and in 1996-7, there were three.</P>

While the weather was bad, the figures do not indicate that it was exceptionally bad.  If other months are considered, the situation does not compare with previous years.  I am not unsympathetic but, in order to make a case, exceptional circumstances must be shown, otherwise we would be in trouble with the Commission.  Compensation would also have to be funded from our own limited resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To admit new entrants and give them a fair chance of competing we decided to allow up to six months from the awarding of the contract for the successful contractor to meet the auto-hover requirements.  During the first eight months of the original contract awarded to Irish Helicopters Limited no auto-hover was fitted to its helicopter and no problems were reported.  In this instance, in order to give everybody a fair chance and have an auto-hover, we allowed tenders be submitted to end February to give new entrants a chance of having an auto-hover fitted to any helicopter being provided.  It was not discriminatory, it was a question of being fair while allowing new entrants into the field.  It would not have been physically possible for anybody to have provided an auto-hover within a shorter timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time 51 per cent of the shareholding in Irish Helicopters Limited was owned by Bristow UK and 49 per cent by Petroleum Helicopters Incorporated, USA.  The three companies that tendered were West Air Aviation, which is Irish, Brintel, a subsidiary of Canadian Helicopter Corporation, and Bond Helicopters Limited based in Scotland. We were meticulous in examining tenders, engaging independent people to examine the quality and cost of service.  I have a responsibility to the taxpayer to ensure that whoever is awarded a contract provides the best service at the cheapest possible rate, which was the criterion used in this assessment.  Everybody was given the <Col N="782" /> same chance.  All we had to do was ensure that we were not excluding others by placing an unreasonable time limit on the provision of an auto-hover.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's assertion that an auto-hover was not available by end February is incorrect.  It has been fitted to the relevant helicopter.  Delay arose because of a technical hitch in electronics, in terms of wiring in the helicopter itself.  This was discovered in the course of trials, which had to be discontinued on account of the prevailing bad weather.  The contractor who had been providing a very good service since being awarded the contract allocated another helicopter, making two available in the event of an emergency which might necessitate the use of an auto-hover.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Power there was nothing strange about the awarding of that contract.  The negotiations were conducted entirely fairly and openly and afforded everybody a chance to tender.  I am glad to report that the helicopter in question, with an auto-hover fitted, will be operational between the middle and end of this month.</P>

      <P>My purpose is not to represent any company, whether Bond Helicopters Limited, Irish Helicopters or any other.  Safety must be our sole and primary concern.  One of our leading marine safety campaigners, Joan McGinley, has expressed some concern about the awarding of this contract to the company concerned.  While not wanting to appear to make political capital out of this issue, I must draw the Minister's attention to an emergency which occurred since the beginning of this year involving a trawler operating off the Kerry coast when the helicopter located at Shannon was unable to respond and a man lost his finger.  While the Minister appears to be happy with the awarding of the contract, I am merely reminding him that some concern has been expressed and that there is room for much improvement.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to place on record &mdash; in view of inaccurate statements made here &mdash; that the company awarded the contract is a highly respected one providing an excellent service about which there have been no complaints. Since being awarded the contract its capabilities to perform any task requested have been well proven.  I should not like anybody to be of the impression that it is incapable of providing an excellent search and rescue service.  It would be unfortunate to allow the message go out from this House that there is something wrong with the company, or that it is providing a second-class service, which would be totally inaccurate.  There was a slight technical hitch in the provision of a helicopter fitted with an auto-hover which will be <Col N="783" /> sorted out within 14 to 21 days of the prescribed date.  That had nothing to do with the auto-hover. It was purely a technical matter and caused by delay in trials because of the bad weather in February.  The House will be aware that the tests &mdash; insisted on by the civil aviation authorities and others &mdash; to which these helicopters are subjected are very rigorous bearing in mind the extraordinary conditions in which they must operate. Because of the weather prevailing it was not possible to fully carry out those tests.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should not attach any credence to anybody telling him that, as a result of this contract being awarded to Bond Helicopters Limited, we have opted for a second-class service at a cheaper price.  This is definitely not the case.  I read the article to which he referred and it is not correct.  We are not skimping on funds.  We have endeavoured to obtain best value for our tax-payers, all tenders having been examined in great detail by professionals who advised me and my Department on the successful applicant's suitability and capability to provide the service we required.  Having advertised for tenders and obtained a competitive price we are now in a position not only to have a medium-load helicopter on the west coast but also one on the east coast, the south-east being covered by the Air Corps, thus ensuring that our coastline is adequately covered by search and rescue helicopters.  Twelve months ago we had a search and rescue service on a permanent basis in only one location on the west coast.  We are now in a position to provide a rescue service all round the coast.  I appreciate the Deputy is repeating what he has read or heard but what I am saying is factual.  If the Deputy wishes to have further information or to examine the files, I will make them available to him.  I do not want anybody to think we are providing a second class service simply to save money.  That is not true.</P>

      <P>In awarding the contract to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Limited my objective is to deliver the highest achievable standards of reliability and quality of service while ensuring the best value for State resources.  The contract was awarded to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Limited, on the basis of its ability to provide the relevant performance, equipment, training, experience and back-up, at the most competitive price.  During the tendering process strict guidelines were adhered to and my Department complied fully with national Government contracts procedures and the relevant EU public procurement directive relating to the Co-ordination of Procedures for the Award of Public Service Contracts 90/50/EEC of 18 June 1992. The three tenders received were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary, expert helicopter contract working group and were assessed on an equal basis.  I am fully satisfied that my Department's conduct of the tender and its evaluation was ethical and in compliance with EU public procurement procedures.</P>
      <P>Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Limited advised my Department on 20 February 1997, in accordance with its contractual obligations, that the fully compliant helicopter with auto-hover which was to be delivered to Shannon by 28 February 1997, is expected to be in service by mid to end March 1997.  The delay in the delivery of this helicopter arose from an electrical design fault identified during a recently completed independent quality check.  Adverse weather conditions have also hampered flight testing.  The fault has since been remedied and flight testing has resumed.  The Bond helicopter development programme, which commenced after the contract award in August 1996 and has been the subject of close monitoring and regular review by the Department, was fully on schedule up to this recent development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fully serviceable marine emergency helicopter is already in permanent operation by Bond from Shannon.  This helicopter has been providing marine emergency response since 1 January 1997 and has carried out 12 successful rescue missions to date.  It has rescued or assisted 22 people including the rescue in extreme weather conditions of 13 fishermen from a fishing vessel which caught fire at a location 150 miles off the <Col N="785" /> coast of Galway on 1 March 1997.  It has all the features of a fully compliant helicopter, with the exception of an auto-hover system.  The absence of an auto-hover makes winching from a small vessel at night difficult but not impossible.  Otherwise the helicopter is fully equipped for 24 hour marine emergency response.</P>
    <P>Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Limited has made available, with effect from 1 March 1997, a second helicopter to improve the capabilities of the existing helicopter at night time and in bad weather conditions.  Crews and specialist lighting devices have been provided to support the operation of two helicopters on a rescue mission.  Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Limited has been providing a satisfactory search and rescue service which will be underpinned by the early entry into service of an auto-hover equipped helicopter.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments closely and will review all matters relating to the service, including contractual obligations, on a week to week basis.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his reply but it does not provide the information I am seeking.  My interest in this matter is to establish whether the EU procurement requirements have been properly complied with.  Did the advertisement include a clause requiring the helicopter sea rescue service to be in place by 28 February?  Is it true that at least one of the applicants inquired whether a penalty clause would be acceptable if it was not able to meet the 28 February delivery date?  Is it true that the Department wrote to the company informing it that a penalty clause would not be acceptable and that if it was not able to meet the 28 February delivery date its application would not be accepted?  Is it true that company disqualified itself because of the answer it got to that question, that the company awarded the contract did not meet the 28 February delivery date and that the Department subsequently entered into a penalty clause after the contract had been awarded and has now indicated it will not apply the penalty clause?  The Minister will note that many questions arise in regard to whether the EU procurement requirements have been fully complied with and whether the matter has been dealt with fairly, particularly bearing in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that my Department has said we are not doing anything about the possible breach of contractual obligations.  We are monitoring developments on a day to day basis.  The <Col N="786" /> contract was for a helicopter service to be provided as and when from 1 January 1997 and that a helicopter with auto-hover would be available from 1 March 1997 onwards.  Due to an electrical design fault it has not been possible to have the helicopter with the auto-hover in operation from 1 March.  If the Deputy considers that in some way the rules were changed half way through I would like to have the evidence because that is not the case.  The closing date and requirements were specified.  An independent committee was set up to assess the tenders and on the professional advice available to me, those who tendered and provided the service required at the cheapest price were awarded the contract.  There was nothing behind the scenes.  As long as I am in the Department, that is the way it will continue. People are entitled to know where they stand.  If they tender and are unsuccessful, I cannot do anything about it.  The Government has an obligation to the taxpayer to ensure we get the best service at the cheapest possible price.  That was done in this case.</P>

      <P>Did West Air offer a penalty clause if it could not meet the 28 February deadline and was it informed in writing by the Department this was not permitted and that the deadline had to be met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The company awarded the contract stated that it would supply a helicopter with an auto-hover by 1 March.  Because of a technical hitch in the electrical design, bad weather and inability to test, it is 14 to 21 days late in delivering it.  We were satisfied, on the advice of the independent committee, that it could provide it by 28 February.  In the meantime a service is being provided with a helicopter without an auto-hover.  The company in question has provided a second helicopter to ensure the best possible search and rescue service is available to those who find themselves in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is no question of changing the rules or dealing with Bond differently to West Air or Irish Helicopters.  In the tendering process applicants were told they had to show they could provide a helicopter with an auto-hover by 28 February.  The expert group was satisfied that Bond, one of the biggest companies in the world, was in a position do so.</P>

Did West Air offer a penalty clause and was it informed by the Department that this was not permitted and a helicopter had to be supplied by 28 February?  If so it disqualified itself from the competition and despite this, the Minister proceeded to accept a tender from a company which has failed to meet this requirement.  Did the Minister inform West Air in writing that he would not accept its offer of a penalty clause and that if it could not deliver a helicopter by 28 February, it was out?</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the impact of last month's bad weather on the fleet but do not consider a compensation package is warranted at this time for the reasons outlined in an earlier reply.  I have to question the basis for the Deputy's calculations that £9 million per week was lost.  Landing statistics show that in the past three years the average monthly value of national landings of fish in February amounted to more than£8 million.  Estimated value of landings for last month was £4.2 million.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> It is strange the Minister has questioned the figure of£9 million which was supplied by fishing industry representatives who state that up to 6,000 fishermen have been either laid off or are on a short working week because of the bad weather.  Within the European Union, farmers, fruit growers and domestic dwellers have received compensation following spells of bad weather.  There is, however, no mechanism of which fishermen who are most affected by bad weather can avail.  When President of the Council of Fisheries Ministers, did the Minister try to secure funding for this purpose and will he agree there is a need to put a mechanism in place which will trigger automatically in times of bad weather?  Fishermen lost a substantial amount of money in February.</P>

      <P>The statistics show that in the past three years the average monthly value of national landings of fish in February amounted to more than £8 million.

      <P>I am sympathetic to fishermen who do a difficult job in all weather conditions. During the Irish Presidency I did not seek the introduction of a compensation package for fishermen which would trigger in times of bad weather.  When one considers the definition of &ldquo;bad weather&rdquo; the issue does not arise.  In order to make a special case we would have to show we suffered extreme weather.  If a package was to be provided it would be directly from the Exchequer.  I hope weather conditions do not change again but if we run into a long period of bad weather I would be only too pleased to go to Government with a recommendation.  However, we would have to get it cleared with the Commission.</P>

The farming lobby does not seem to have any difficulty obtaining compensation for bad weather through the Minister of the day and its powerful lobby in Europe, not that I have a problem with that.

      <P>I would not underestimate the strength of the fishermen's lobby, it is an excellent group and as Minister I am aware of its pressure and power.  In saying that February was not a particularly stormy month I mean that the winter as a whole was not exceptionally harsh.  The Deputy is seeking a package for extreme weather conditions but one has to look at conditions over <Col N="790" /> a period.  Admittedly there were stormy conditions in February but this winter as a whole has not been exceptional enough to make a special case.  In drawing up guidelines for a package one would have to base it on a winter period as distinct from one month and the weather conditions over winter have not been exceptional when compared to other years.  As I said, if things change I will look at it again.</P>

      <P>In advertising for tenders one must be reasonable.  It was felt that fixing the date of 28 February 1997 was both reasonable and achievable in accordance with the best advice available to us.  When one goes to tender one does not <Col N="791" /> know who will offer prices in accordance with the tenders advertised.  To say that one company might or might not succeed is not reasonable in tendering terms.  As to the price, it is not common practice to announce who tendered what.  The company which won the contract offered the service required, complied with all the conditions of the tender and charged the lowest price.  On that basis, I think if the Deputy was in my position he would do precisely the same thing.  If he was satisfied he was getting the best service from a reliable company at the lowest price, he would give the contract to whoever met all three conditions.

I share this general concern but as well as securing stricter marine environment protection in the lough I can also see many other benefits, particularly in the area of tourism, which should follow from the establishment of a harbour authority for the whole of Lough Swilly.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, my Department and officials of Donegal County Council have recently been exploring the possibility of that council assuming statutory responsibility for Lough Swilly as a whole.  Donegal County Council has indicated that it agrees in principle with this proposal subject to a mutually satisfactory arrangement, which is currently under discussion, being put in place. I expect that the outcome of those discussions and the recommendations of the Department thereon will be submitted to me in the near future for my approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> Regarding the lease of foreshore at Buncrana, I approved this lease last July and a draft lease was offered to Donegal County Council on 15 July last.  I understand that the county council is disputing the rent and that the Valuation Office, which fixed the original rent, is arranging a review of this and discussions with the council with a view to securing its agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He said the price of the lease was being reviewed.  If the lease fixed for Rathmullan is £150 per year and the cost of buying out the lease has been quoted at £4,000, why was the lease for Buncrana set at £1,200 and the cost of the freehold at £15,000?  That is a big difference between two sites across the water from each other.  Could the Minister use his good offices to reduce the price of the Buncrana lease to the same as the Rathmullan lease?  As he said, the council wants to develop the facilities and I am angry about the lack of progress made on many piers along the Donegal coast.  The council wants to provide ferries, boating, sea angling, shellfishing and other services but it is not receiving suitable help from the Department.  I hope the evaluation will take into account that the pier requires substantial repair, the on-shore facilities and access are poor, the harbour is silted up and only available at certain tides, which restricts sea access, and when the slipway is developed dredging will be required on a regular basis.  This should be compared with the cheaper rent charged at Rathmullen which has excellent deep water facilities.  There is goodwill in the council towards the development of this pier and I ask the Minister to ensure this work is undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is obliged to ask the Valuation Office, which is the expert in this area, what fee should be charged for a freehold lease.  People often compare fees with those charged four or five years ago.  If one was to compare fees one could call for a review of the fees set four or five years ago.  For this reason, we should not concentrate on this issue.  My Department is obliged to accept the figure given by the Valuation Office and to seek the approval of the Department of Finance.  Because Donegal County Council has sought a review in this case I am arranging for the Valuation Office to have another look at the matter.  The council will be able to make its case in that context.</P>
      <P>On the question of piers generally, when I took up office I visited all coastal counties.  Many small harbours and piers are neglected by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>One will not get money if one does not seek it.  It is a question of priorities.  It is a shame that these small harbours and piers have not been maintained.  My Department gives advice to local authorities on engineering matters, <Col N="793" /> etc.  The ideal way to manage small harbours and piers is through the local government system. Deputies refer constantly to the need to devolve powers to local authorities and this is one area with which it could properly deal.  It is not good enough for local authorities to say they do not have adequate finance for this work and to let these harbours and piers fall into the sea.  This work should be a priority and I ask the Deputy to ensure that Donegal County Council gives the same priority to this work as it does to other matters for which it is responsible.  If these harbours and piers are not repaired it will cost millions of pounds to replace them in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">
      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because Donegal has a poor road infrastructure, no train service and a limited airport service the public has to depend on the sea for access.  There is much potential for the further development of port facilities in the county.  Donegal County Council has carried out a survey of piers and drawn up a list of priority work.</P>

      <P>However, it still needs money to carry out this work.  I ask the Minister to ensure funding is allocated for this work.  The will exists to develop this resource.  I accept that the Department must be guided by the Valuation Office but there is a substantial difference of opinion on the method used to determine the fee. I ask the Minister to ensure the fees are reduced and brought into line with those charged in Rathmullan.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing concern of the bereaved families of an accident at sea in September 1992 when two Irish fishermen lost their lives in a collision between the Orchidee and the French vessel the Agena; if the statements given by the French crew at the rogatory commission inquiry will be made available to his Department; the reason the families involved were not told of the retirement of a senior official dealing with the case; if a new person has been appointed and briefed on this issue; if this person will meet the families; if he will expedite the Irish inquiry into the affair; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6802/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to his question on 11 February in which I explained that the Department's investigation into this accident could not be completed until a report on the proceedings of the maritime tribunal had been received from the French authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> As the Deputy is aware, following sustained diplomatic effort over the past four years by the Irish authorities, I and officials of my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Paris and the French authorities finally completed their investigation which resulted in legal proceedings being brought against the skipper and one of the crewmen of the French vessel involved in the collision.  These proceedings concluded on 27 September 1996 at the maritime tribunal at Lorient when both men were found guilty of negligence for their part in the sinking of the <i>Orchidee.</i> They were sentenced to one year and to three months' imprisonment, respectively.  Both sentences were suspended for five years on the strict condition that no further offences of any sort were committed.</P>
    <P>Since the tribunal hearing in September 1996 officials from my Department as well as officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Paris have continued to press the French authorities to expedite the release of this report to the Irish authorities.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as a result of this pressure the French Foreign Ministry has, in the past few days, made a copy of the report available to my Department through the normal diplomatic channels.  I understand the report includes witness statements given to the court by the crew of the French vessel as well as details of the tribunal's findings.  Arrangements are being made to have this report translated into English.  Copies will be made available to the parties concerned and they have been so notified.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the marine surveyor who conducted the initial investigation has since taken up other employment.  The investigation will be finalised by the chief surveyor.  While the departure of the original investigator has had no material bearing on the progress of the investigation as the report of the French proceedings was not to hand, I accept that the families should have been informed of this development and this omission is regretted.</P>
    <P>My Department has endeavoured since 1992, when the accident occurred, to keep the bereaved relatives informed of progress in the investigation, particularly during the lengthy French legal process.  I assure the Deputy that departmental officials will maintain regular contact with the families and keep them informed as further developments arise.  Any request from the relatives to meet the investigating officer is a matter for him.  He will consider such a request on its merits having regard to the procedures governing the conduct of investigations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for acknowledging that the families of these men were ignored in some instances.  This should not be allowed to happen in future.  These families are rightly concerned at the length of time it has taken to reach this stage in the investigation.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Irish investigation, which has not yet commenced, is brought to a <Col N="795" /> conclusion as soon as possible so that these families can have some peace.  I am sure Deputy Deasy has received many representations on this issue from the people on his side of the river.</P>
      <P>There is a strong suspicion that the <i>Orchidee</i> was rammed by the <i>Agena.</i> This has been confirmed to some extent by the suspended sentence meted out to the skipper and one of the crewmen. Is the Minister aware of the many incidents at sea, including a recent one to which I do not wish to refer, where Irish vessels which have timber hulls and are vulnerable have been rammed by foreign vessels which have steel hulls?  Does the Minister share my suspicion that there is more going on at sea than is reported on land?  Has he taken an interest in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I take an interest in any incident involving loss of life at sea, and will continue to do so.  I am not in a position to speculate.  As Minister, I can only deal with facts and, from time to time, statements are made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Byrne's concern about the bereaved families.  I fully appreciate that the continued delay in this matter will be a cause of great concern to them.  I assure the Deputy and the families that the investigation will not be delayed any more than is absolutely necessary.  It remains my intention to publish a report of this investigation, subject to normal legal considerations, as the Deputy will appreciate from his own experience.  Unfortunately, in this case, Captain McGrath, who was carrying out the Irish inquiry, was unable to interview the French crew because the French maritime authorities proceeded with a judicial inquiry rather than a technical inquiry by a surveyor.  As the judicial inquiry resulted in criminal proceedings being brought against the two crew members, the matter became, in Irish terms, <i>sub judice.</i> Captain McGrath's investigation was suspended pending the outcome of the criminal action.  We put a great deal of pressure on the French authorities to bring this investigation to finality.  It was as a result of a sustained diplomatic effort on our part.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, approved by Government on 5 March 1996, recommended the reorganisation of Defence Forces Headquarters and a revised management and control system.  Implementing this recommendation involves the abolition of the existing appointments of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General and their replacement by two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff, both of whom will report to the Chief of Staff.</P>

      <P>Ten requests to supply Defence Forces personnel for service outside the State were received during 1996.  Details of these requests are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request was received from the United Nations on 2 January 1996 for two ammunition technical officers for deployment to Croatia and Bosnia for approximately six weeks.  Deployment was approved on 8 January.  However, the United Nations indicated that as there was already an adequate number of suitable personnel deployed they would not be taking up our offer;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request dated 5 February 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking our agreement to the redeployment of five military observers serving with the United Nations Peace Forces (in the former Yugoslavia) to the United Nations missions in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  These missions have a one year tour of duty.  The required redeployments took place on 29 February 1996.  These personnel were replaced by five other Irish personnel at the end of their tours of duty;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request dated 14 March 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams to operate with the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern <Col N="799" /> Slavonia (UNTAES) for a period of about nine months.  It was indicated that each team would consist of two or three personnel of a rank no higher than captain.  The duties would involve demining and destruction of unexploded ordnance and booby traps.  The request was declined on 16 July 1996 on the basis of the inherent great dangers associated with participation in UNTAES on the types of duties contained in the request;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the United Nations issued a request on 4 April 1996 seeking to increase the number of Irish military personnel serving with the United Nations Preventative Deployment Force in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (UNPREDEP) from one to two observers, the tour of duty to be for one year.  The request was met on 18 April and deployment took place on 18 May;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; HMD International, a UK-based charity issued a request in April 1996 for up to 15 military personnel to take part in a hospital rehabilitation programme in Angola for a period of 3 months, with the possibility that some of the personnel might require replacement at the end of the three month period.  The request was approved at the end of May and arrangements were made to select volunteers. However, the Angolan Hospital rehabilitation programme has been deferred until sponsorship has been agreed between HMD and its donors.  It is anticipated that a revised request will be received from HMD when they are ready to implement this programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; on 21 May 1996, the United Nations requested an engineering officer for assignment to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations United Nations New York, for a period of one year.  On 10 June 1996, it was decided not to accede to the request due to priority commitments at home;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; requests were received from the Department of Foreign Affairs on 24 June last for the provision of two monitors for the municipal elections in Mostar and for the appointment of a presidency co-ordinator to liaise between the EU Administration in Mostar and the presidency.  The requests were approved on 27 June and the required personnel were provided;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request for an unspecified number of liaison officers to operate with the Civilian Security Liaison Group for Rwandese and Burundi refugee camps in Zaire was received from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on 4 July 1996.  The duration <Col N="800" /> of the mission was not specified and the request was declined on 25 July 1996 due to existing commitments to United Nations Peacekeeping operations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; as a result of a United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted on 15 November 1996 the Government offered to supply up to 100 troops to the Canadianled Multinational Force for the purpose of providing humanitarian aid in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  This force was not deployed and was stood down on 15 December 1996;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; in November 1996 Trócaire submitted a request for the release of four military personnel to assist with their emergency programme in Rwanda and Zaire. However, in view of the rapidly changing situation in that area, the number that will actually be required is unclear at present and discussions with Trócaire are ongoing.</P>

      <P>I am greateful to the Minister for his detailed reply.  The sensitive information indicates the extent and variety of the operations to which Defence Forces personnel are assigned by the Government to serve under the United Nations flag.  In view of the large number of Defence Forces personnel serving in different parts of the world in fragile security situations, I am sure the Minister would agree that it is important to ensure the provision of adequate facilities to support them.  Is the Minister aware that in the case of personnel losing their lives on a UN mission, their widows do not receive the full UN widow's pension applicable and payable in those circumstances?  If not, will he look into it and see if something can be done to improve the situation?  It seems to be a penny-pinching exercise on the part of the Department of Finance or whichever Department is responsible.</P>

      <P>We have managed to fulfil all our obligations.  We had some difficulties last year in relation to the Lebanon.  One must remember that service with the United Nations is on a voluntary basis.  The inconsistency of recruitment to the Defence Forces has meant that people who served in the Lebanon have done so on many occasions and, because it is voluntary, people cannot be forced.  Fortunately, we were able to fulfil our engagements there and I am quite confident that we will be able to do so again in the future The situation will be eased by the influx of young recruits who, as soon as they are trained, will be available to serve.</P>
      <P>As to the Deputy's other question, that matter is with the Department of Foreign Affairs who sponsor the moving of the appropriate motion, and we have been in touch with them asking them to do so as soon as it is humanly possible.</P>

    <Title>Special Areas of Conservation: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, on Thursday, 13 March 1997:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> That Dáil Éireann welcomes the publication of the Regulations for the designation of Special Areas of Conservation under the Statutory Instrument laid before the Oireachtas on the 26th February by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for the purpose of transposing into Irish law the terms of the Habitats Directive of the European Union in accordance with the terms of the European Communities Act 1972; and notes with approval the success of the Minister in promoting a spirit of partnership between all those concerned for the conservation of the Irish countryside in advancing the objectives of the Directive.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Eireann&rdquo; and substitute the following: notes the publication of the Regulations for the designation of Special Areas of Conservation, condemns the failure of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to engage in full consultation, further condemns the Minister for his failure to provide full information, notes with concern the continuing disquiet of landowners, who are key partners in the conservation process, and calls on the Minister to ensure that a genuine partnership between conservationists and landowners exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation in this area goes back to 1977 when the Wildlife Act was enacted.  That comprehensive Act was supposed to cure all the ills affecting the preservation of wildlife, but 20 years later the Act has not done anything to safeguard wildlife and habitats.  I have no hesitation in saying that there have been 20 years of neglect since that legislation was passed.  I have no doubt that many of the endangered species specifically mentioned in the 1977 Act are now extinct and those that remain are in more danger than ever. There has been incredible neglect in this area.</P>
      <P>Legislation such as this will never be of use in safeguarding our wildlife unless personnel are employed to safeguard wildlife and monitor what is happening in the fields, glens, hills and lakes.  I come from a county &mdash; Waterford &mdash; that is mountainous, with two large mountain ranges and much hilly country, and there is only one wildlife ranger in charge of that county, with no staff to assist him.  Does the Minister believe that is satisfactory?  It cannot be.  This legislation is not worth much unless personnel are recruited to implement it and to monitor conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that many habitat sites and species of fauna and flora have been destroyed, degraded or seriously threatened and that that cannot continue.  He said that such critical issues need to be grasped and remedial action taken. That is true, but will that be done.  My experience in 20 years in this House is that it has not been done, and it will not be done.  There is no evidence that the personnel whose job it is to <Col N="803" /> oversee the operation will be employed.  I continuously ask in this House if additional staff will be provided.  There were two wildlife rangers in my county, but one of them died three years ago and was not replaced.  How can monitoring take place and wildlife be protected when the staff are not available to do so?  Is it envisaged that there will be dozens of wildlife rangers in each county? I asked that question before but received no reply.  What is the point of passing legislation unless its provisions can be implemented?  The 1977 Act was never implemented.</P>
    <P>A difficulty I have with the legislation is that it is selective.  I know that the Minister means well in introducing it, but it involves 550,000 hectares covering the Twenty-six Counties.  I do not know what percentage of the land mass that is, probably less than 10 per cent, but what about the other 90 per cent?  What is being done to protect wildlife in the 90 per cent not covered by the legislation?  Will we continue to allow hedgerows, the natural habitats of much wildlife, particularly songbirds, to be cut and burned?  Will we allow marshy land, the natural habitat of many game birds such as duck and snipe, to be drained, given that it is not included in the legislation?  For years people have received grants for reclaiming bad land while the European Union pays people huge sums of money not to cultivate the best of land. It is hard to accept that we are eliminating systematically the natural habitats of our wildlife, fauna and flora while encouraging people not to till land of the best quality.  That is illogical.</P>
    <P>I previously asked the Minister whether we keep an inventory of wildlife species and he replied that we do not.  That is shameful.  We should have information on the number of each species, what species are endangered and why they are endangered.  What is causing their numbers to fall?  Irish people tend to have a genuine interest in animal life and their natural surroundings.  We should enlist the services of school children to carry out surveys in their local communities.  That would be a two way process.  We would get the information we want and it would engender tremendous interest in wildlife in school going children.</P>
    <P>How many goldfinches, bullfinches or chaffinches exist in the country?  Are their numbers depleting on a daily basis?  If so, why?  We do not know the answers to these questions.  The same questions could be asked about the number of linnets, wrens, thrushes and blackbirds.  Are there any kingfishers left in the country?  I have seen one or two, but they are few and far between.  Is anybody interested in finding out this information?  Why does the Department not issue a publication listing endangered or extinct species of wildlife?  If we do not know the facts, how can we address the problem?</P>
    <P>More attention was paid to the preservation of wildlife 100 years ago.  At that time people took positive steps to preserve wildlife.  We now live in <Col N="804" /> the age of pesticides, modern methods of agriculture and industrial evolution.  Wildlife is being wiped out, but we do not know the specific reasons.  We do not even have figures for the varieties of wildlife being affected by agricultural development or emissions from industrial developments.  Questions I have posed at Question Time, and in other debates, give the clear impression that studies on these matters are not being carried out.</P>
    <P>This is the start of the breeding season for many species of wildlife.  What measures are being taken to protect their breeding ground? Hedgerows are being cut and mountain heather will be burned even though birds are nesting and breeding there.  What is being done to curtail activity that leads to the extinction of wildlife? It is demoralising to see regulations being passed without resources to support them.</P>
    <P>The most positive aspect of these regulations is the compensation that will be paid to landowners who conserve areas of their land for wildlife to breed.  However, these regulations will apply to only about 10 per cent of the country.  Until such time as we carry out research into what is causing the extinction of our wildlife we will not make progress.  There have been 20 years of inaction in terms of the Wildlife Act, 1977.  Unless the personnel is provided to protect our habitats, the regulations before us will be meaningless.  While they may have some practical effect in the west, they will not have any meaning for the rest of the country.  I hope the regulations lead to a positive outcome.</P>

Tá faitíos orm, de réir a chéile, go ndéanfar iad a chúngú agus a chúngú go dtí nach mbeidh mórán deis acu dul ar aghaidh leis na bealaí traidisiúnta a bhí acu.  Nil aon rud atá déanta ag an Áire go dtí seo tar éis a n-intinn a shuaimhniú faoin gceist <Col N="805" /> seo.  Mar sin déarfaidh mé uair amháin eile go bhfuil gá go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó oscailteacht agus comhphlé i dtaobh an ábhair seo.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to make statements, rather than debate, this issue.  The lack of involvement by elected representatives and our difficulty in getting information is an indictment of the Minister and the Government.  It highlights the low level to which public representatives have been brought.</P>
    <P>As a representative I have a right to know what is happening.  I should not have to go to representative bodies to find out what Governments and Ministers are proposing.  We have been given bald regulations that do not provide the details. Only today the Minister gave Members details of the compensation package which has been available to members of the IFA for the past two weeks.  This is no way to treat us.  We have a right to this information on behalf of our constituents.</P>
    <P>There are a number of major fundamental issues at stake, one of which is that the people do not resist conservation.  No farmer worth his salt wants to destroy his land because he wishes to hand it on as he got it.  To accuse farmers of destroying their heritage is the anithesis of the so-called partnership of which we are meant to be part.</P>
    <P>I also disagree with the European Union's heavy handed approach to this issue.  A message should be sent to Europe that we do not operate here by diktat or regulation but through a spirit of co-operation.  If it is interested in conservation, it should listen to the people and make arrangements with them; it should not issue regulations which will only fill rooms with paper and destroy the rain forests which are used to manufacture that paper.</P>
    <P>We are trying to preserve different aspects of Irish life.  It is part of our tradition to preserve historical monuments.  We all know the traditional rural attitude towards fairy forts, etc., most of which were only destroyed in the past 20 or 30 years.  Modernisation did most of the damage by changing those traditional positive attitudes.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debates organised by the IFA and to what the Minister's officials said, one would think SACs were introduced in Connemara to stop overgrazing.  There are two reasons that is nonsense.  The first is that overgrazing is happening in hills which are not in the proposed SACs just as much as in hills in the SACs.  If over-grazing is worrying the Minister and the EU, we could deal with it tomorrow.  I have put forward proposals on numerous occasions to deal with this problem which would not cost a penny and would have the support of all farmers.  However, it will not be dealt with under these proposals which will not work.  We can introduce schemes but we will not deal with the problems in Connemara until we recognise the method of farming there.  There are too many ewes on the hills so we must reduce the number of sheep to deal with overgrazing.</P>
    <P>Bogland is the main area of preservation in Connemara.  In recent years the famous &ldquo;sausage <Col N="806" /> machine&rdquo; for producing and cutting turf caused much destruction to the bogland.  Not only did the &ldquo;sausage machine&rdquo; destroy the habitat, it was also an inefficient way of cutting turf in the wet bogs of Connemara.  It produced a maximum of two cuts of turf and there was little recoverable turf.  The machine destroyed the bogs because of the way it operated without a drainage system. People, like myself, have begged for years to outlaw this machine because of the destruction it caused to the habitat and the bogs in terms of recoverable fuel.  The people using it were cutting off their nose to spite their face.  If we were serious about protecting our habitat we would have ensured that those using this method did not do so again.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes great play of the compensation issue.  There are two ways to get compensation, one of which is to join REPS.  If a person joins REPS, they will get £15 an acre compensation for the first 100 acres for being in a SAC. If a person is not in REPS, they must prove they incurred a loss to get compensation.  That will be difficult to do in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The IFA has generously offered, in the case of disputes, to attend the arbitration hearings and provide advice for its members.  I compliment it for the way it sustains its members.  However, only one in ten farmers in Connemara are members of the IFA and they are the strongest and most viable.  Who will defend the interests of the 65 or 75 year old pensioner?  How will they challenge on scientific grounds designations and regulations introduced by the State?  Bureaucracy always favours those with resources or access to resources and penalises those on the margins &mdash; the weakest, the oldest and the least endowed intellectually.  This is another imposition on farmers.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons farmers do not want to join REPS.  A neighbour told me it was not worth his while joining REPS because the planners told him the money he would receive would have to be spent on slatted housing for his cattle. He can winter his cattle and farm successfully without causing any environmental damage. REPS does not suit everyone.  Some people believe there is too much bureaucracy or that the Department is introducing too many regulations. A new regulation is that someone with an environmental qualification must countersign the REPS plan in a national heritage area.  We all know that more conditions will be incorporated in these plans, although payments to farmers will remain the same.  One has only to look at the extra regulations in Leader II compared to Leader I.  REPS finishes in three years but we have no guarantee there will be a new REPS scheme, particularly with the expansion of the EU.  What will this mean for farmers?</P>
    <P>Will somebody clarify what is restricted, what one can and cannot do without the permission of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht if one is not in a REP scheme because it is the matter of control, not money, which worries <Col N="807" /> people?  It is about freedom, the right to get on with one's occupation.  The blurbs we were given stated that one cannot reclaim one's land.  Does that mean an overgrown stream which was drained ten years ago cannot be cleaned without the permission of the Minister?  We are told that one cannot clear scrub.  Does that mean that if a person cut back gorse five or ten years ago in one of his better fields, he cannot do it again without the permission of the Minister?  Can a farmer put up 100 yards of fencing without the permission of the Minister?  We and the people want to know the answers and whether the Minister is adding endlessly to this list as the environmentalists put pressure on the conservation of open fields and mountains?</P>
    <P>I welcome the clarification on the compulsory purchase issue.  That is a step forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned compensation of £20 million and Minister De Rossa must be smiling because the bulk of the compensation paid in Connemara will be paid indirectly to the Minister for Social Welfare.  Vague promises have been given on the question of the exemption of these payments from means testing.  Have they not been given?</P>

      <P>At present £2,000 of the payment under the REP scheme is exempt from means testing for the purposes of social welfare but if a person is in receipt of more than £2,000, the rest of the money is assessed on a pound for pound basis.  That means a farmer in receipt of unemployment assistance or a pension, that is, the vast bulk of farmers in an area like Connemara, the net maximum benefit from REPS irrespective of their acreage is £2,000 a year.  In fact, under the existing regulations, the maximum income of a farmer who wishes to avail of social welfare is the basic social welfare rate plus £2,000, if he or she is a member of REPS.  If the farmer already has 33 acres at £60 per acre on which he is drawing REPS, until the regulations are changed every penny of the money he gets under the SAC compensation provision will be assessable for means testing purposes.  No agreement should have been reached until it had been clarified that that system of pound for pound means testing of payments under REPS and SAC schemes would be changed.  It is no good giving a vague undertaking that the Minister for Social Welfare will examine the matter.  The Minister of State can shake his head but that is exactly how the social welfare scheme works.  I thought he would have known better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not convoluted. People come to my constituency clinic with such cases every week.  I know exactly how the scheme works.  It is calculated pound for pound for all income a person earns from their farm and the only exemption as of today is £2,000 for the REP scheme.  It means that a farmer who needs social welfare to survive cannot benefit by more than £2,000 from being a member of REPS and if the Minister's only intention is to increase that to £2,500, for example, it still does not deal with the issue and the people know that is the case.  The reality is that these payments go into one pocket and are taken out in time by the Department from the other pocket and the farmer does not wind up any better off.  It is important that this issue is addressed.  If there are to be compensation payments, it is important that they wind up in the pockets of the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to approach this motion from a different angle as my colleagues have spoken on its various aspects.  We are critical of the fact that these areas have been designated without a proper consultative process with many groups.  This is the reason many people have come to my clinic over the past number of weeks to complain about how the matter was handled.</P>
      <P>The scheme without a consultative process probably signs the death knell for what links golf courses, which have not been taken into consideration.  The Minister mentioned that there are 54,000 hectares of salt marsh, machair and sand dunes.  Large stretches of coastline have been included in this area so I put it to the Minister of State that this is something which did not occur to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy of County Donegal relies heavily on tourism and I assure the Minister of State that a number of people will be in contact with him because they were not consulted.  I know of one development which was ready to proceed, and for which planning permission had been granted, <Col N="809" /> when a map was produced which showed that it formed part of a scientific area.  Hence, this entire development for County Donegal has gone up in smoke.  I want the Minister's officials to see what can be done about such situations because I have been informed that a person will have three months to lodge an appeal, the appeal will go before a committee in Ireland and whatever is picked out as being worthy of appeal will be then sent to Europe.  Is that the case?  As the matter relates to an EU directive, is it a fact that if a development is to be appealed today it may not be given the go-ahead for two years?  The Minister has not considered that aspect.  Some of the his Labour Party colleagues agree with me that they have not been consulted about that aspect.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this is a matter of concern throughout his county.  On contacting the Department about this matter I was told the EU directive frowns on golf links, there are too many of them and no more are wanted.  If that is the attitude, a large number of people and a large part of the economy will be excluded.</P>
    <P>The designation of a priority area can be appealed only on scientific grounds.  Will the Minister consider designating national heritage areas that could be appealed on social and economic grounds?  The designation of some areas in a county as large as County Donegal could be appealed on social and economic grounds, but because the designation of a priority area can be appealed only on scientific grounds it could be referred to Europe which could result in the loss of developments of value to tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cúiv said that this motion is shortsighted in a number of respects.  As the Minister said, there is general consensus that our natural heritage has been seriously damaged and that many sites and species of flora and fauna have been destroyed.  I am not pressing this but I ask the Minister to take account of the points I made.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the possibility of Members meeting the relevant bodies concerned? There should be greater consultation before the appeals process comes into play.  Areas in respect of which planning permission was sought should be given the go ahead provided those concerned give a guarantee that the wildlife species in the area will be protected.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the problems associated with the designation of SACs and NHAs.  I support the amendment tabled by our spokesperson, Deputy de Valera, because a good deal was left to be desired in the way this debate was initially introduced.  We sought a debate on this matter last year, but we did not succeed.  The Minister said he was about to sign the directive and he was very anxious to sign the document in Europe, but he <Col N="810" /> would not give us an opportunity to debate the issues.  It was only because Fianna Fáil and the farming organisations, assisted by their local representative, brought the issues to light that the Minister woke up at the eleventh hour and decided he should consult the environmentalists and the farmers.</P>

Nevertheless, the Minister was slow in coming forward with information on this issue.  That is not partnership.  The manner in which this matter has been dealt with shows scant regard for this House.  It is not good enough to blame personnel in the EU and use the excuse of meeting deadlines for the delay in dealing with this matter.  As Members of this House, we have a right to know what is happening.  Farmers and others have a right to know details of the regulations and how they will be affect them.  Very little was done to address the issues involved until pressure was put on the Minister.  Despite his relenting at the eleventh hour and agreeing to meet those concerned, we have not been given all the details.  Having discussed the matter with various groups, including the IFA, many questions remain to be answered. Approximately 15,000 farmers and 217 special areas of conservation, many of which are in the west, particularly in Donegal, Galway and Mayo, will be affected.</P>

      <P>We must look after the interests of our people, be they farmers, fishermen or those interested in agri-tourism.  We have a duty to look after their interests and that is why we have put so much pressure on the Minister to address some of the questions raised by my colleagues.</P>
      <P>There are 400 sites and nearly one million acres involved, but many questions need to be answered.  Bord na Móna has an operation around Bellacorick.  What will happen to its operation under the regulations governing the designation of NHAs and SACs?  Will it be allowed develop its operation?  Will those who cut turf for sale be allowed to continue to do so?  Those are some of the more relevant questions that were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What restrictions will be imposed on those involved in agri-tourism?  Will they be allowed build in certain areas?  Will pony trekking be allowed and will other activities that would involve a change of practice be allowed?  We have heard of practices that might have been in vogue <Col N="811" /> previously, but if someone wishes to make a living by changing their <i>modus operandi</i> will they be allowed to do so under the new framework following the designation of SACs?</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about the cheque in the post.  I hope the implementation of these regulations will not be a nail in our coffin and drive more people off the land.  The population in Mayo has been decreasing although at present there are some signs of stabilisation.  It is important in a country where farming is a major industry to retain as many people as possible on the land.  Deputy Ó Cúiv made some interesting remarks on problems of overgrazing.</P>

      <P>The mast is causing a problem there.  The issue of whether a mast can be erected in designated areas is another matter.  The Minister may tell us more about that because there is a dearth of information.</P>
      <P>The IFA has more information on these regulations than Members of this House.  We had to get information on the compensation package from members of the IFA.  While I welcome the compensation package, was the IFA constrained in the deal it made with the Minister because of its involvement in Partnership 2000?  Some have stated this will cost £20 million while others, including the IFA, believe it will cost £30 million. Has it been costed and do we know from where the funding will come?  The Minister admitted he will have to go cap-in-hand to Europe to obtain money for the programme.</P>
      <P>Another aspect to which the Minister referred was REP schemes.  He stated that these will be specially formulated and advised people to become involved in them.  REP schemes will last for five years but the programme has a duration of 15 years.  What will happen after the initial five year period?  We have not been advised on that. We are aware finance is available and Deputy O'Keeffe stated he could provide information on the additional expenditure required.</P>

      <P>People are aware of the disclaimer provision.  Deputy O'Keeffe was not too wide of the mark when he disclosed relevant information <Col N="812" /> on that issue.  The issue of over-grazing was also discussed and, as Deputy O'Keeffe stated, there are ways to circumvent this without introducing draconian regulations.</P>
      <P>Everyone has an interest in the environment and we must laud the Minister for actions he took which will help the nation in the long-term. However, farmers, fishermen or those involved in tourism do not want to be constrained by the regulations.  Deputy McDaid referred to golf courses and this issue is of interest to people in places such as Enniscrone, Bundoran and Belmullet.  There are many links courses along our coastlines and further development may be in danger.</P>
      <P>People will no longer approach the county councils for planning permission.  The Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be involved in this and scientific elements will be brought into the equation.  However, the meaning of &ldquo;scientific criteria&rdquo; has not been made clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and Gaeltacht, Deputy Carey, will be interested in my next question.  How will the economy develop if there is too much red tape and too many constraints?  It is fine to talk about a good environment and people are striving to achieve this.  Ordinary farmers have provided the areas under discussion such as blanket bogs, etc., which are well preserved.  Nevertheless, no one wishes to impose too many constraints on further development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural renewal project was established by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and is concerned in its general thrust with the depopulation of the west and what can be done about it.  The focus of this project is on the public service needs of rural areas and how these can be improved to retain or maintain the present population and perhaps encourage an increase.  This is an interesting and worthy project, involving a joint venture between statutory bodies and local communities.  That in itself is a new development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five areas were chosen to host pilot schemes throughout the country.  One of these was in County Sligo in the Lough Arrow area, a major <Col N="813" /> part of which is comparised of the parish of Geevagh.  As far as the provision of public services to Geevagh or any other rural parish in the west is concerned, the post office is the essence and central focal point of that service.  With the rural renewal project scheme midway through its duration the people of Geevagh discovered that An Post intends to pull the plug on their post office. The town is at the very heart of the area being studied but the people received no formal notice of the closure on the local radio station or a notice through the local press; a small notice was merely placed in the window of the post office.</P>
    <P>I am glad the permanent closure of Geevagh post office has been put on hold following vigorous activity by the local community in the form of protests and delegations.  The post office services are now being run from a room in the local priest's house.  That is somewhat reminiscent of an episode from &ldquo;Father Ted&rdquo;, but it is good that the permanent closure has been averted for the time being.</P>
    <P>The closure of post offices brings much hardship and a loss of identity to a community. However, I do not advocate that argument on this occasion.  I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for the west is present because he initiated the rural renewal pilot programme to study public services, particularly post offices, and encourage the take up of such services and proactive participation by local communities.  In the middle of the study, An Post is preparing to close Geevagh post office.  The Minister of State is a vigorous man.  I ask him to refuse to have his good work and that of the Lough Arrow community enterprise and other pilot schemes throughout the west blown out of the water in this manner.  This closure must be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware that, in the past, An Post gave a commitment not to proceed with its planned mass closure of sub-post offices. However, when a postmaster or mistress retires, the office is often closed down.  I discovered this morning that Tourlestrane post office in south County Sligo, which is situated in my native parish, is due to be closed at the end of the month. This post office, like others throughout the west, has always been a central part of the parish and is the precise phenomenon currently being studied under the renewal pilot scheme.  It is illogical, wrong and crazy that a State body is involved in an expensive and important scheme to study the role of post offices and how this might be augmented, expanded and embellished while a semi-State body, An Post, begins to close down that which is the essence of the study.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State ensure there are no further closures in Geevagh, Tourlestrane or any other communities in the west until the findings of the rural renewal pilot scheme study are published.  What is the point of engaging in study and developing remedies if post offices are closed down?  I have spent much of my working life, as a journalist and Dáil Deputy, seeking to help the west and it is sad that one of the final contributions <Col N="814" /> I am likely to make in this House is concerned with the closure of Tourlestrane post office in my native parish.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take action and ensure that my final contribution is not in vain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Nealon for having raised this matter. As Minister responsible for western development and rural renewal, I am overseeing a number of initiatives in that area, one of which is the implementation of a pilot programme to actively explore models for a unified, location-based approach to providing public services in rural areas with dispersed or declining populations.</P>
      <P>Although decisions regarding the viability of rural post offices are a matter for An Post, I am very concerned at recent developments in regard to the post office at Geevagh, County Sligo, and I met a deputation from the area on Thursday, 27 February to discuss the problem.  I made representations to An Post and was informed that that post office will remain open on a restricted service basis in the short-term.  It is expected that a full service will be resumed on a temporary contract basis, pending an examination of the case by the Geevagh community.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme to which I referred has its origins in report No. 97 of the National Economic and Social Council &mdash;&ldquo;New Approaches to Rural Development&rdquo;.  One of the key recommendations of that report was that the practicalities of developing service centres to provide a range of public services should be explored on a pilot basis.</P>
      <P>Following a consultative process of seminars and public advertising, involving Government Departments, State agencies, public service providers, local development organisations and voluntary and community groups a number of project proposals were developed for inclusion in the programme.  Projects selected had to be clearly needs-based and capable of being sustained over time.  In the long-term, projects will be assessed to ascertain whether they can be transferred successfully to other rural communities.  A further criterion which had to be satisfied in the case of such projects was that they be based on a partnership between service providers and local communities users.</P>
      <P>Local steering committees have been established to run each of the projects, involving the active participation of representatives of local communities and development organisations, in addition to public service providers.</P>
      <P>These projects are also being monitored and overseen by a high level steering group comparised of representatives of my Department, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and a staff member of the Adult and Community Education Centre, St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, who is assisting in the management of the pilot programme in a consultative capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> The pilot programme includes a number of innovative projects which will be implemented over a two to three year period: the Sligo rural renewal project in the Lough Arrow and Lough Gara areas; the Feakle and Cranny community service project at two locations in Ballyheigue, County Kerry and Kilmihil, County Clare and, lastly, the Aiséirí &mdash; action integrated services project &mdash; in Lisacul, County Roscommon and Kilmovee, County Mayo.</P>
    <P>Each of those projects is progressing well, with a very positive response by the local communities and service providers.  This community involvement, along the lines provided by the pilot programme planners, has been most effective in alerting local communities to the value of their post offices and their proper usage, particularly in the case of Geevagh.  Further pilot projects are at present in course of development and I hope to see a couple of additional projects up and running this year.</P>
    <P>The Sligo rural renewal project involves a number of State service providers, including the North Western Health Board, Sligo County Council, Sligo Leader, area development management and the Department of Social Welfare.  The project is developing a model of public service provision, involving the establishment of local centres in two remote areas of County Sligo, Lough Arrow and Lough Gara.  The centres will provide public services, information and assistance through a local facilitator, in partnership with the agencies, and act as a conduit between the local communities and their service providers.  The project was established at the end of last year, and this is its first full operational year.  I am making a grant of up to £40,000 available towards the cost of the project in 1997.</P>
    <P>Of their very nature, pilot projects are experimental.  Some may be transferable, while others may survive the period of the pilot phase but, ultimately, not develop into sustainable initiatives for the future.  The lessons to be learned from such innovative initiatives will greatly assist in the future development and implementation of policies on public service provision.  It is too early in the pilot programme to say what those lessons will be and which model will be sustainable and transferable.</P>
    <P>The objective of the programme is to test models for essential service delivery in areas of low and dispersed population which will include an assessment of each project's potential for transference to mainstream service provision.  An interim evaluation of the programme will be available later this year in line with the commitment contained in Partnership 2000 in the context of approaches to dealing with rural exclusion.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the compassionate consideration of An Post to appeals such as that made by Deputy Nealon this afternoon, particularly in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Deputy Nealon speak about a local post office being operated from the front room of a priest's house it struck me that that must be a unique phenomenon today, with the Government attempting to exclude the churches from education while involving them in the operations of post offices.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the continuous controversy about the replacement of a statue of Saint Patrick on the Hill of Tara.  It is appropriate that this subject be aired again with the advent of his feast day.</P>
      <P>A statue of Saint Patrick was erected on the Hill of Tara approximately 100 years ago to signify his connection with that site and the arrival of Christianity here.  Around 1992 the original statue, which had been formed of cement or concrete, was removed for repair when the Office of Public Works discovered it was not really replaceable, as someone had aimed a few pot-shots at it with a firearm.  After it was removed, the Office of Public Works refused to replace it on the Hill of Tara.  I was serving as Minister of State at the Office of Public Works around the time that decision was taken, one with which I agree, although perhaps I should not be voicing such an opinion in an election year.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works pointed out that the statue was not in keeping with the archaeological and historical significance of the Hill of Tara, the former seat of the High Kings of Ireland, with which I agree.  Nonetheless, as we all know, the Hill of Tara is associated with Saint Patrick.  That statue was also a landmark for miles around the Hill of Tara and its removal caused great annoyance.</P>
      <P>While serving as Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, I reached a compromise when, with great reluctance, local people concerned about its removal agreed that it would not be replaced on its former site.  In return, the Office of Public Works agreed to provide a new statue, at an agreed location, adjacent to the Hill of Tara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything was fine until the new statue was commissioned.  It was designed by Annette Hennessy and is not a traditional-style Saint Patrick.  His depiction in so much of our literature as a bishop who brought Christianity to Ireland is evidently not now considered suitable for erection adjacent to the Hill of Tara.  Its reputable sculptress has herself described it as not a traditional type-Saint Patrick but as a young boy, dressed as a swine herdsman, more akin to his appearance during the time he spent on Slemish than on his arrival, as a bishop, at the Hill of Tara.  I ask the Minister to accede to the wishes of the local community to have a statue that is in keeping with the Christian traditions of St. Patrick placed adjacent to the Hill of Tara, in the place agreed.  I ask the Minister not to proceed with the type of statue proposed and to announce his decision soon.  It is a source of annoyance to the local community that <Col N="817" /> the episcopal representation of St. Patrick should be replaced by a statue depicting a young boy dressed as a swine herd on the Hill of Tara.  I ask the Minister to ensure a traditional type statue is erected on the Hill of Tara.</P>

      <P>A competition among reputable Irish artists for the provision of a statue of St. Patrick at the Hill of Tara was held last year.  Five submissions were received and publicly displayed, following an advertisement in the local newspapers, in the former old church at Tara for a period of three weeks.  The comments of the public were recorded and later taken into account in the assessment process.</P>
      <P>A selection committee comprising representatives of the Arts Council, An Comhairle Ealaíon, the Association of Artists of Ireland, my Department, the Office of Public Works and the local community, examined the submissions and recommended that of Ms. Annette Hennessy. The following is Ms. Hennessy's description of her submission:</P>
      <P>The proposal is for an eight foot figure in bronze.  My sculpture is not a traditional type statue of St. Patrick but speaks of the myth and magic associated with the many folk legends which have come down to us.  The sculpture depicts the man who fought druids with fire, who was said to have been untouched by rain, who could light up the dark with his fingers, and who changed himself and his followers into deer, to escape from the High King Laoghaire and his Druids on the Hill of Tara.</P>

      <P>In the past few weeks this House has been dominated by education debates. I am proud of the many improvements this Government has brought about in the education sector.  The issue I raise is the gross inequity suffered by students in the Royal College of Surgeons.  Those students do not enjoy the free fees initiative introduced by the Government which was the difference between students being able to accept a place in college or not.  This initiative has been much appreciated by students and parents alike.</P>
      <P>Given that the Royal College of Surgeons has agreed to become involved in the CAO system it is extraordinary that the students who will get a place will not be entitled to avail of the initiative. The fees at this college are an enormous burden on students and families and many will not be able to afford them.</P>
      <P>Under the CAO system, which we always boast is the fairest, we can have students who want to pursue a career in medicine but because they achieve the points for the Royal College of Surgeons rather than for UCD, UCC or any other college, they will have to pay up to £3,000 per annum in fees.  This is a grave injustice to those students who, when filling in the CAO form, indicate their preference for the Royal College of Surgeons.  Many will not be aware that should they get a place in the Royal College of Surgeons they will have to pay those fees while their fellow students can pursue their medical career in the other colleges and have their fees paid.</P>
      <P>In a written reply I received during the week, the Minister for Education said that while the college will be part of the CAO system of entry from the commencement of 1997-8, it does not wish to be considered for inclusion in the free fees initiative at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the right of any college to decide that its students will not avail of the free fees <Col N="819" /> initiative.  This is an extraordinary statement. How fair is the CAO system if within it there is a college that does not provide the same opportunities because free fees are not included?</P>
    <P>Many students who are studying desperately hard and who will achieve the necessary points for entry to the Royal College of Surgeons may not be able to accept their place simply because they cannot afford the fees.  This is a grave injustice and should not be tolerated particularly since the college is within the CAO system.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Education to review the system and to take a decision based on the rights of students rather than on the preference of the college.  I hope from 1997 onwards that students whose parents are paying tax and funding the free fees initiative for fellow students in other colleges will receive the justice they deserve by being allowed avail of it in the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahearn for raising this matter.  In keeping with its commitment in the programme, A Government of Renewal, the Government phased out third level undergraduate tuition fees which were halved in 1995-6 and abolished from 1996-7.  The free fees initiative is concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to promoting equality of access to higher education, irrespective of social class, age or disability, for all who have the capacity to benefit from it.</P>
      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the initiative in the 1995-6 academic year.  The costs associated with the initiative have been offset by the savings from the abolition of regressive covenant tax relief.  Any extension of the initiative to other colleges, such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints.</P>
      <P>The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland met officials of the Department of Education regarding its inclusion of the free fees initiative.  The Department advised the college that in considering any application for inclusion in the initiative regard would have to be had to the overall financial implications; the college's recognition for the purposes of the third level student support schemes operated by the Department of Education and whether the college was part of the CAO third level entry system.  In addition the college would have to comply with the Higher Education Authority quota on medical places and confine the fees charged to Irish-EU students to a level in line with those charged by the other medical schools in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education has no plans to extend the scope of the free fees initiative to <Col N="820" /> include the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. The college has written to the Department stating that while it will be part of the CAO system of entry from the commencement of the 1997-8 academic year, it does not wish to be considered for inclusion in the free fees initiative at present. Tax relief is available, at the standard rate, on fees paid to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland in accordance with section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>I have raised this matter on a number of occasions, the most recent being 11 February when I was informed by the Minister that he expected the arrangements for the hand over of Balbriggan and Skerries harbours to Fingal County Council to be made in accordance with regulations under the Harbours Act, 1996 in advance of the establishment of the Dublin Port Company earlier this month and that he would visit both harbours prior to vesting day.  On 24 April 1996 the Minister informed me that he was undertaking a programme of visits to fishery harbours around the coast and that he hoped to visit Skerries and Balbriggan harbours &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;, possibly on completion of works being undertaken at that time and in advance of their transfer to Fingal County Council.  The Minister should explain why those replies were so inaccurate.</P>
      <P>There are two issues which need to be addressed, the first of which is the provision of resources for outstanding works.  These include the resurfacing of Balbriggan harbour and the provision of waste removal facilities.  There is a need for proper inspection and maintenance of the harbours and enforcement of the law in regard to wreck removal.  There is a need for dredging facilities.  A dredger is available at all times in Kilkeel harbour whereas Skerries and Balbriggan harbours have not been dredged for some time.  Some works were undertaken over a year ago in Balbriggan harbour where an ice plant is needed.  In Skerries harbour the metal piles are in need of repair and boats have been damaged when they hit off the bottom of the harbour.  There is a need for proper electricity and water supplies, particularly in Balbriggan harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any resources provided will need to be used effectively.  This will not happen by transferring the harbours to Fingal County Council which, although its heart may be in the right place, does not have the necessary expertise or experience. The Minister should facilitate the putting in place <Col N="821" /> of consultative procedures, whether through a harbour authority &mdash; this may require legislation &mdash; or other non-statutory body, to ensure the experience and expertise of fishermen built up over many generations is availed of and the harbours continue to be developed.</P>
    <P>The dredging works undertaken were a waste of money and ineffective and may have proved counterproductive.  On wreck removal, we are back to where we were because the necessary monitoring and inspections were not carried out in the meantime.</P>
    <P>There is a threat that the harbours will be downgraded by Fingal County Council in the way Loughshinney and Rush harbours have been.  The council is threatening to close them.  If that happens, the fishermen will be forced to use other harbours and incur extra expense.  This will result in the industry, the poor relation, being downgraded.  The Minister is responsible for its promotion and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise on behalf of my ministerial colleague, Deputy Barrett, who, due to other commitments, is unable to be present.</P>
      <P>Section 88 (4) of the Harbours Act, 1996 provides that, on its commencement, there shall stand transferred to Fingal County Council from the Dublin Port Company the harbours of Skerries and Balbriggan together with all the property, rights and liabilities of the said company.  Section 1(2) (c) of the Act states that an order under section 88(4) can only be made with the consent of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Dublin Port Company was incorporated on Monday, 3 March.  On 19 February, the Department of the Environment advised the Department that Fingal County Council was awaiting details from the Dublin Port and Docks Board of the liabilities and assets it was expected to take on as a result of the transfer to it of Skerries and Balbriggan harbours. Information on the precise boundaries and condition of the harbours, staffing, property disputes etc. has been sought by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been advised that the local authority, on its own initiative, has had meetings with Dublin Port management in an effort to establish the position on these matters.  In light of the foregoing, the Minister for the Environment requested that the proposed transfer be deferred for a limited period to enable the issues raised by the county council with Dublin Port management to be resolved.  This we have agreed to do.  The harbours in question, therefore, remain within the limits of Dublin Port.  This is only a temporary <Col N="822" /> measure.  I am anxious, in the interests of fishing and leisure interests in the harbours, that the transfer is effected as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>On 28 February, my Department requested the management of Dublin in Port to co-operate as fully as possible in providing the information sought by the county council in relation to the transfer. The Dublin Port Company has confirmed that it will continue to co-operate in providing the information requested in respect of the harbours concerned.  The matter is one which needs, in the first instance, to be thrashed out between the Dublin Port Company and the county council.  It would not be helpful to the process if too many other parties were to get involved.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the harbours can be transferred within the next few months.  Once transferred the county council will be responsible for their control, management, operation and development and will be empowered to introduce by-laws for their good rule and governance.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of local authorities are responsible for harbours, piers and landing stages around the coast.  I am convinced, therefore, that there is in existence a wealth of expertise which could be tapped into through the forum of, for example, the County and City Managers' Association.  The Department will be available to assist with advice, where appropriate and relevant.</P>
    <P>On funding for the maintenance of the harbours, the Deputy will recall that in December 1995 the Department provided State grant assistance of £60,000 to Dublin Port and Docks Board towards the cost of a significant programme of remedial and renovation works.  It was apportioned to meet 50 per cent of the cost of the works.  Dublin Port's berthing master is satisfied that this money was spent to best advantage.  I understand the fishermen were also pleased.</P>

      <P>There are many fishermen who would be glad to secure investment in their harbours. The State grant was made available as an exceptional measure.  No further funding will be made available by the Department towards the cost of maintenance or development works at the harbours.</P>
      <P>On 11 February, my ministerial colleague, Deputy Barrett, gave a commitment to visit both harbours.  He intends to visit them before they are transferred to the county council.  Arrangements for the visit will be made early after Easter.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 1 p.m. on Wednesday, 19 March 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 8 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>Following consultations recently between the Department's engineering division, the harbour master and a representative of the Small Boat Association, it has been agreed that a damaged pontoon at Dunmore East will be removed very shortly and the remaining pontoons will be reconfigured to facilitate the fishermen concerned.</P>
      <P>Longer-term plans for the berthing of small boats at Dunmore East are being considered in the context of an overall assessment of the future infrastructural needs of the harbour at Dunmore East.</P>
      <P>There is an acknowledged shortage of berthing at Dunmore East particularly during the herring season.  In order to fully inform an assessment of the development options for the harbour I approved the commissioning of a wave study at Dunmore East harbour.  The terms of reference for the study are to investigate the effect on wave patterns within the harbour of a number of development options, to examine the causes of the &ldquo;surge&rdquo; which occurs in the harbour, and to recommend solutions.  This essential technical assessment will critically inform future development options.</P>
      <P>I understand that the local harbour users committee has commissioned a study of the infrastructural requirements at the harbour.  The findings of this study will also be taken fully into account in future plans.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problems of siltation which have affected Cheekpoint harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Works carried out by Waterford Harbour Commissioners in order to improve access to <Col N="824" /> Belview Port have caused a build up of silt in Cheekpoint harbour.</P>
    <P>Waterford Harbour Commissioners accept that there is a problem in relation to access to the harbour.  Their plan is to redress this problem as quickly as possible and are using their best endeavours towards this end.  In so doing, they hope to come to a consensus with the local community, including the fishermen, as to how the problem can best be solved.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners, as part of a significant dredging campaign co-funded by EU grant aid secured by my Department, have recently dredged the approach channel and restored adequate access to the quay.  They are also evaluating further what needs to be done in the longterm to control the siltation problem.</P>
    <P>The Belview Co-ordinating Group is a forum set-up to address and monitor many of the issues that arise in relation to planning in the context of the development of Belview Port.  A final report was presented last month and is being considered by those organisations to which it was circulated. A member of my staff attended and participated in the group's meetings.

      <Quest>the reason he did not adhere to the full Slaney River salmon management plans as agreed by all parties for a defined period of years when making his salmon fishing regulations for 1997.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the concept of salmon catchment management plans, both in principle and as a practical approach to addressing specific and localised concerns through consensus.  The concept has also been endorsed by the Salmon Management Task Force.  The Slaney catchment management plan which has been operating since 1994 with the co-operation of local netsmen and anglers, is a good example of local catchment management at work. The programme was designed primarily to improve the spring salmon run to the River Slaney through agreed conservation measures and the by-laws underpinning the plan are renewed each year.</P>
      <P>In introducing new national conservation measures for the 1997 season I indicated that the Slaney management plan would be fully recognised by allowing the proposed local variation on the opening time for the fishery.  Accordingly the draftnet fishing season will begin on the River Slaney on 1 May next which is some weeks earlier than the national opening date of 15 May.</P>
      <P>The national conservation measures also include a new four day rule for commercial netting.  I am aware that this particular provision has given rise to disagreement between the parties to the Slaney plan.  In light of this difficulty and having considered the views of the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board, the Slaney Advisory Council and the latest scientific advice on the state of Slaney salmon stocks, I have decided that the following specific arrangements will apply on the Slaney for the 1997 season: draft net fishing will be confined to four days per week in May, 1997; draft net fishing will be extended however to five days per week from 1 June; the use of monofilament nets will not be permitted in the fishery; last day of draft net season will be 31 August, 1997.</P>
      <P>The specific concessions proposed in these measures have been made on the basis that there is a management plan for the Slaney which has been paying dividents for salmon stocks in the system to the benefit of all legitimate interests in the fishery.  The proposed measures are designed to continue the work of conservation of the Slaney spring salmon runs and I very much hope that the parties to the plan will reach consensus that this is the reasonable way forward.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 2 August 1996 that the Government has approved the award of a contract to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Ltd., for the provision of a marine emergency helicopter including search and rescue based at Shannon Airport.  The contract commenced on 1 January 1997, on the expiry of the previous contract with Irish Helicopters Ltd., which is a British/United States owned helicopter company, and is for a minimum period of two and a half years with an option to extend for up to five years.</P>
      <P>Bond advised my Department on 20 February 1997, in accordance with their contractual obligations, that the fully compliant helicopter with auto-hover, which was to be delivered to Shannon by 28 February 1977, was now expected to be in service by mid to end March 1997.  The delay in the delivery of this helicopter arose from an electrical design fault identified during a recently completed independent quality check.  Adverse weather conditions have also hampered flight testing.  The fault has since been remedied and flight testing has resumed.  The Bond helicopter development programme, which commenced after the contract award in August 1996 and has been the subject of close monitoring and regular review by the Department, was fully on schedule up to this recent development.</P>
      <P>A fully serviceable marine emergency helicopter is already in permanent operation by Bond from Shannon.  This helicopter has been providing marine emergency response since 1 January 1997 and has carried out 11 successful rescue missions to date.  It has rescued or assisted 22 people including the rescue in extreme weather conditons of 13 fishermen from a fishing vessel, which caught fire at a location 150 miles off the coast of Galway, on 1 March 1997.  It has all the features of a fully compliant helicopter, with the exception of an auto-hover system.  The absence of an auto-hover makes winching from a small vessel at night difficult but not impossible.  Otherwise the helicopter is fully equipped for 24-hour marine emergency response.  Bond have made available, with effect from 1 March 1997, a second helicopter to improve the capabilities of the existing helicopter at night time and in bad weather conditions. Crews and specialist lighting devices have been provided to support the operation of two helicopters on a rescue mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1 January 1997 Bond has been providing a satisfactory search and rescue service which will <Col N="827" /> be underpinned by the early entry into service of an autohover equipped helicopter.</P>
    <P>In awarding the contract to Bond my objective is to deliver the highest achievable standards of reliability and quality of service while ensuring the best value for State resources.  During the tendering process strict tender guidelines were adhered to and my Department complied fully with national and EU public procurement requirements.  The three tenders received were evaluated by a multi-disciplinary, expert Helicopter Contract Working Group and were assessed on an equal basis.  I am fully satisfied that my Department's conduct of the tender and its evaluation were both ethical and in compliance with EU public procurement procedures.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor developments very closely and will review all matters relating to the service, including contractual obligations, on a week to week basis.</P>

      <Col N="828" /> I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and Others) Act, 1996, the Commencement Order for which I signed on 6 February 1997.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Act brought Irish law in relation to the carriage of goods and passengers by sea into line with current international standards as set down in the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976 (the London Convention); the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their luggage by Sea, 1974 and the Protocol of 1976 thereto; and the Brussels Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading, 1924, and the Protocols of 1968 and 1979 thereto.</P>
    <P>Among the benefits arising from this Act is that it ensures that passengers qualify for realistic levels of compensation for loss, injury or damage either to their persons or their luggage, thus putting travellers by sea on a par with air passengers.</P>

      <P>I have given RACO and PDFORRA assurances that they will be consulted regarding the reorganisation process.  To that end a sub-committee of the Counciliation Council for the Permanent Defence Force has been established to deal with issues arising from that process.  Since 1 March 1996 officials of my Department have had 20 meetings with the representative associations to discuss various issues related to the reorganisation including the VER scheme, manpower policy and the restructuring of the force itself.  I have personally met with the associations on a further nine occasions in the last year or so.  The reorganisation process has also been discussed with the associations on a number of other occasions, and consultations with RACO and PDFORRA will continue.</P>

      <P>My Department has no grant-aided buildings or structures under its administration nor has it constructed any such premises.  As regards Defence Forces installations the Corps of Engineers specifies, where appropriate, in contract documents, that all steel to be used in construction should comply with British Standard 4449.  In addition, provision is made in contract documentation to have construction materials tested should the site engineer require it.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence Branch of my Department on occasions provides grant-aid to local authorities for the construction of buildings.  In such circumstances, the local authorities arrange the necessary design work and supervision of the construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of ten requests to supply Defence Forces personnel for service outside the State were received during 1996.  Details of these requests are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request was received from the United Nations on 2 January 1996 for two Ammunition Technical Officers for deployment to Croatia and Bosnia for approximately six weeks.  Deployment was approved on 8 January.  However, the United Nations indicated that as there was already an adequate number of suitable personnel deployed they would not be taking up our offer;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request dated 5 February 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking our agreement to the redeployment of five military observers serving with the United Nations Peace Forces (in the former Yugoslavia) to the United Nations missions in Croatia, Eastern Slavonia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  These missions have a one year tour of duty.  The required redeployments took place on 29 February 1996.  These personnel were replaced by five other Irish personnel at the end of their tours of duty;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request dated 14 March 1996 was received from the United Nations seeking Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Teams to operate with the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) for a period of about nine months.  It was indicated that each team would consist of two or three personnel of a rank no higher than captain.  The duties would involve demining and destruction of unexploded ordnance and booby traps.  The request was declined on 16 July 1996 on the basis of the inherent great dangers associated with participation in UNTAES on the types of duties contained in the request;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the United Nations issued a request on 4 April, 1996 seeking to increase the number of Irish military personnel serving with the United Nations Preventative Deployment Force in the former Yugoslav Republic of <Col N="831" /> Macedonia (UNPREDEP) from 1 to 2 observers, the tour of duty to be for one year.  The request was met on 18 April and deployment took place on 18 May;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; HMD International, a UK-based charity issued a request in April 1996 for up to 15 military personnel to take part in a hospital rehabilitation programme in Angola for a period of 3 months, with the possibility that some of the personnel might require replacement at the end of the three months period.  The request was approved at the end of May and arrangements were made to select volunteers.  However, the Angolan Hospital rehabilitation programme has been deferred until sponsorship has been agreed between HMD and its donors.  It is anticipated that a revised request will be received from HMD when they are ready to implement this programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; on 21 May 1996, the United Nations requested an engineering officer for assignment to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations United Nations New York, for a period of one year.  On 10 June 1996, it was decided not to accede to the request due to priority commitments at home;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; requests were received from the Department of Foreign Affairs on 24 June last for the provision of two monitors for the municipal elections in Mostar and for the appointment of a Presidency Co-Ordinator to liaise between the EU Administration in Mostar and the Presidency.  The requests were approved on 27 June and the required personnel were provided;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a request for an unspecified number of liaison officers to operate with the Civilian Security Liaison Group for Rwandese and Burundi refugee camps in Zaire was received from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on 4 July 1996.  The duration of the mission was not specified and the request was declined on 25 July 1996 due to existing commitments to United Nations Peacekeeping operations;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; as a result of a United Nations Security Council Resolution adopted on 15 November 1996 the Government offered to supply up to 100 troops to the Canadian-led Multi National Force for the purpose of providing humanitarian aid in the Great Lakes region of Africa.  This force did not deploy and was stood down on 15 December 1996;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; in November 1996 Trócaire submitted a request for the release of four military personnel to assist with their emergency programme in Rwanda and Zaire.  However, in view of the rapidly changing situation in <Col N="832" /> that area, the number that will actually be required is unclear at present and discussions with Trócaire are ongoing.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to requests for assistance from the civil authorities.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 also serves to increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area. The question of the equipment required by the Naval Service to fulfil the roles assigned to it, including the interdiction of illegal drugs is kept under continual review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to report that steady progress has been, and is being made in putting the necessary organisation, training and equipment in place to develop Civil Defence along the lines foreshadowed in the Towards 2000 development.  The purpose of the development strategy is to put structures in place and develop the necessary skills to face the challenges of the new millennium with confidence and determination.</P>
      <P>Since the start of this innovative development, my Department has spent nearly £1.25 million purchasing 80 high specification vehicles, including ambulances, transport vehicles and pick-ups to ensure the capability and mobility of the organisation both on and off road.  In addition, 31 boats and more than 100 kayaks have been purchased and have been used extensively in water search operations.  Operational and protective equipment has also been acquired and is now being used by Civil Defence groups to serve their communities.</P>
      <P>The impressive range of activities undertaken includes saving and preserving lives, stewarding at local events and even, I am told, returning a dolphin in difficulties to the sea off the Waterford coast.</P>
      <P>The Civil Defence School conducts a comprehensive programme of training support for Civil Defence in each local authority.  The training courses cover the full range of emergency operations and organisational support.  The number of courses conducted in recent years is as follows: 1993, 35; 1994, 45; 1995, 52 and 1996, 55.</P>
      <P>These courses are conducted at the Civil Defence school in the Phoenix Park in Dublin or at regional venues making them more accessible to the voluntary members of Civil Defence who balance their commitment to the organisation with the demands of work and home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to again place on record my appreciation of, and admiration for, the tremendous vol- <Col N="837" /> untary work done by the volunteer members of Civil Defence at local level.  They are a credit to themselves and their communities.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the changes now taking place in the court-martial system in Britain, his views on whether similar changes would have to be adopted in this country in view of the fact that the Irish system was adopted from the British system; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>There are significant differences between the Irish and British court-martial systems.  Irish military personnel, in common with all other citizens, have rights arising from our written Constitution.  This constitutional jurisprudence has been applied increasingly in the military legal sphere in recent years. Also, the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, which is a civil court, has full appellate jurisdiction over the finding and sentence of any court-martial.  It is considered that our court-martial system conforms with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights for a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.</P>
      <P>The details of any changes that may be taking place in the British court-martial system are not yet to hand.  However, when these become available they will have full consideration in my Department and if it is considered that some changes in our system might be desirable then these changes will be made.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that I have at all times emphasised the importance of communication and consultation with all interested parties with regard to the reorganisation process of the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, dissemination of information on the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan is widely encouraged by the military authorities. Steps have been taken by the military authorities to ensure that all Defence Forces personnel are kept informed of developments in the carrying out of the implementation plan.  This is currently achieved by means of publications in the monthly Defence Forces newsletter, Connect, which is provided free of charge to all serving members of the Defence Forces.  Additionally, information on the reorganisation is continually passed down the <Col N="838" /> military chain of command by means of briefings and conferences.</P>
    <P>In addition the representative associations are also kept fully informed of developments through the normal channels available under the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.  I understand that since 1 March 1996, officials of my Department have had 20 meetings with the representative associations to discuss various issues related to the reorganisation including the voluntary early retirement scheme, manpower policy and the restructuring of the force itself.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State Deputy Burton, was interviewed on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme on 27 February on the increase in the number of people seeking refugee status in Ireland, and the procedures for processing their applications.  The Minister explained that, in considering applications for refugee status, which have to be based on a well-founded fear of persecution, a distinction has to be made between applications from people fleeing conditions of strife &mdash; in this context she cited a number of countries including Iraq and Iran &mdash; and other applications where the main interest of the applicants may be in bettering their economic conditions.</P>
      <P>It is undeniable that, as the Minister of State said, both Iran and Iraq are both in an area of tension, not least because of the ongoing Kurdish conflict in northern Iraq.  The Minister of State made her comment because there have been a number of recent cases of applications for refugee status in Ireland by people from Iran.</P>

      <P>The Government is currently assessing all the relevant material emerging about Bloody Sunday, including material referred to by the Deputy.  I discussed this ongoing assessment with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, at yesterday's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to present our conclusions to the British Government when this assessment is complete.  It is vitally important that the new material emerging, and its significance in regard to both the conduct and the outcome of the Widgery Tribunal, be considered in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  As I stated in my reply to the Deputy on 6 February 1997, a full <Col N="840" /> new inquiry may not be essential to set aside the discredited findings of the Widgery Tribunal.  At the same time I emphasised that whatever is required to bring peace to the relatives and honour the memory of the dead of Bloody Sunday should be done.  The Deputy will appreciate that I would not wish to prejudge whatever position the Government may ultimately adopt on the question of a new inquiry until the current assessment is complete.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the Taxes Acts do not provide specific tax allowances or reliefs for people, including married men, who stay at home to mind their children.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, however, married couples have the option of being taxed on their joint income.  Where they avail of this option, they are entitled to double the allowances, rate bands etc. available to a single person.  The combined allowances are allocated between the spouses on the basis of their instructions to the tax office.  In a case where one of the spouses is not in paid employment, this facility for joint assessment can be of significant benefit as he or she can instruct the tax office to allocate the total tax allowances due to the couple to the other spouse.</P>

      <QRef>[7186/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only formalised scheme of merit pay which applies in the civil service is the performance-related bonus scheme for assistant secretaries, and some deparmental and professional post-holders at that level, which was introduced with effect from 1 May 1995.  This scheme and the criteria under which it operates were recommended by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector in Report No. 35.</P>
      <P>Essentially, bonus payments are made by reference to assessment of performance against objectives agreed in advance with the Secretary of the Department for the bonus year concerned.</P>
      <P>A total of £220,023 was paid to 88 individuals, in respect of 1994-95, under the performance-related bonus scheme for assistant secretaries. Details relating to the succeeding twelve month period are not available in my Department at this time.</P>
      <P>The Government has recently published Report No. 37 of the review body and has decided to accept its recommendations in principle.  One of the recommendations is that my Department should examine the feasibility of extending performance-related bonus arrangements to other grades at assistant secretary level and to grades at deputy secretary level.  While the Government has decided that the question of implementation of the salary rates which would flow from the recommendations contained in Report No. 37 will be considered at a later date in the context of Partnership 2000, it has decided that, in the meantime, some preliminary arrangements which would arise from new or improved approaches recommended for certain areas by the review body will be addressed.  These will include arrangements for the further development or performance-related pay in the Civil Service, as recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should mention that under the programme of change, Delivering Better Government, a system of performance management is currently being <Col N="845" /> designed and developed in order to underpin the achievement of objectives set out in the day-to day work programmes for staff at all levels in each Department and thereby to promote a high performance, results-oriented civil service. Recognition and reward for good performance, and a constructive approach to the management of underperformance, are essential features of an effective performance management process. Rewards, including performance-related pay, will be addressed, therefore, as an integral part of the overall design of the system.  A firm of consultants has been engaged to assist with the design and development of the system.</P>
    <P>I should also mention an arrangement introduced a few years ago whereby heads of Departments and offices have a very limited discretion, within their administrative budgets, to reward exceptional performance by persons in grades below assistant secretary level by means of <i>ex gratia</i> payments or other awards.  The operation of these arrangements and the number and amounts of awards are matters left entirely to the discretion of the heads of Departments and offices.</P>

    <P>*The EHB do not employ home helps directly.  Instead home helps are employed by Voluntary Committees which are grant aided by the EHB.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract people primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Income in respect of services provided was introduced more as a token payment or stipend.  Such income does not come within the scope of the PAYE code.  It should also be noted that income earned by the home help is not taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a home help, or the spouse of a home help is in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  As the Deputy will be aware, the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  The rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day-to-day management of the service.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that my Department has allocated additional funding to three of the health boards this year for the purpose of increasing the rates of payment to home helps.</P>
    <P>In response to previous questions raised in the House on this issue I stated that the Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, has under active consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.</P>
    <P>A discussion document submitted by the chief executive officers group formed the basis for this examination of the home help services.  Following on from these discussions, my Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in <Col N="849" /> tandem with the other community based services. Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and the work will commence shortly.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 January, 1997 is in the range of £207.98-£220.19 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
      <P>The latest available details of the rate of gratuities applying to part-time home helps in each board are given in the following table 1.  With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part-time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups which accounts for the wide variation within the area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The administration of the civil registration system is a matter for An tÁrd-Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who act under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I understand from inquiries made, that the Deputy may be referring to the birth of a child which occurred in 1963 and that the child in question may have been stillborn.  The Stillbirths Registration Act, 1994 (No. 1 of 1994) came into effect on 1 January 1995 and applies in relation to the birth of a child born weighing 500 grammes or more or having a gestational age of 24 weeks or more who shows no sign of life.  Prior to the introduction of that Act there was no provision for the registration of stillborn children.</P>
      <P>The Stillbirths Registration Act provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the registration of a stillbirth which had occurred prior to the commencement date of the Act, subject to an application being made by one of the parents of the child and to the provision of satisfactory evidence to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages that a stillbirth had occurred.  I understand that the difficulty in this case may be in relation to the provision of such evidence.  In this particular case, An t-Árd Chláraitheoir has suggested that the mother of the child contact the General Register Office at 016711000 extensions 3373 or 3344 to discuss the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> An initial offer in relation to the settlement of the claim for nurses under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> was agreed with the nursing unions &mdash; INO, SIPTU, IMPACT and the PNA &mdash; on 23 March 1996 in discussions between health service management.  Following these discussions the proposals were put to a ballot of the membership and subsequently rejected.</P>
      <P>Arising from the failure of this group and a number of others in the public service to reach agreement on restructuring under clause 2 (iii) (a) of the public service agreement on pay, incorporated in the PCW, the Government met ICTU and outlined its commitment to achieve the necessary restructuring in a positive and constructive way.  The statement issued also outlined the development of a framework aimed at achieving the continuation and successful completion of a number of outstanding discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on from this statement a further series of discussions took place with the nursing unions.  As provided for within the framework, the parties agreed to refer the outstanding issues <Col N="851" /> to adjudication.  Submissions were made to the adjudication board on 22 July 1996.  The finding of the adjudication board was issued to management and unions on Monday, 23 September 1996. A revised set of proposals incorporating these recommendations of the board were balloted on by the nursing unions.  SIPTU and the PNA accepted this offer but it was rejected by the INO and IMPACT.</P>
    <P>Arising from this impasse.  The Deputy will be aware the matter was ultimately referred to a full hearing of the Labour Court.  A Labour Court recommendation, LCR15450 issued on 7 February 1997.  The findings of the Labour Court were again put to the nursing unions in a revised offer. This offer has been accepted.</P>
    <P>The Government statement issued on 9 February 1997 in relation to the nurses' dispute pointed out that no provision has been made in the 1997 Estimates to meet the significant additional costs arising from the Labour Court recommendation.</P>
    <P>In that context, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has indicated that he is reviewing expenditure plans across all Departments with a view to identifying savings to fund the additional expenditure.</P>

    <P>Inquiries were received from 90 firms following the placing of an advertisement in the national media and the EU Journal and 32 submitted detailed proposals.  These responses have been considered and a short list of six firms have been invited to submit fixed price tenders for the work. I understand that the Government purchasing agency in Northern Ireland, on behalf of the Rivers Agency of their Department of Agriculture, and the Waterways Service of my Department hope to award a consultancy contract in the summer of 1997.  The duration of the contract will be about nine months.</P>

      <P>The question of access to Dublin Port was considered in detail as part of the Dublin Transportation <Col N="859" /> Initiative and the subsequent report recommended the development of a northern port access route.  As this route is intended to be a national primary road the development of appropriate proposals is, accordingly, a matter for Dublin Corporation, as road authority, acting under the general supervision of the National Roads Authority which has overall responsibility for the planning, design, construction and financing of national roads.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that the proposed route should be constructed as a motorway.  The Roads Act, 1993 outlines the statutory procedures which must be complied with before a project of this nature can proceed.  These include a full environmental impact assessment, the preparation of a motorway scheme and the holding of a public inquiry into all matters relating to the scheme, including the environmental impact.  These procedures, which involve extensive public consultation, give all interested persons or organisations ample opportunity to make their views and concerns known, and ensure that all views or objections are fully considered before a final decision is taken on a proposed scheme.  As Minister, I have a quasi-judicial function in relation to individual motorway schemes and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on any aspect of a particular proposal until the statutory procedures have been complied with.</P>

      <P>In March 1996, Bray Urban District Council submitted a proposal costing an estimated £112,500 in respect of this scheme under the small schemes programme.  However, as that programme is largely directed at meeting the water and sewerage needs of small towns and villages on the basis of proposals submitted by county councils, it was not possible to approve the proposal.  It will, in the future, be a matter for county councils to decide on funding for small water and sewerage scheme projects under the new measures being introduced for the devolution of responsibility for such schemes.</P>

      <P>In 1990, procedures were initiated at local level, under the Local Authorities (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1936, to extend the boundary of Westport Urban District Council.  However, no formal application for a boundary extension was made.</P>
      <P>The procedure to be followed for making boundary alterations has changed since then.  The legal framework for local authority boundary alterations is now contained in Part V of the Local Government Act, 1991 and associated regulations.  Under this legislative framework, it is open to any local authority to make a proposal for a boundary extension.  The legislation enables all the issues in relation to a boundary alteration to be thoroughly considered in the first instance by the local authorities involved and it includes provision for public advertisement and consultation.  Once this local process is complete, an application for a boundary alteration can be made to the Minister for the Environment.</P>

Arising from that review, I granted recognition to the Ballybrack gaelscoil, with effect from 7 April next.  The school was informed of the position on 5 March 1997.</P>
      <P>As part of the review, I took into account the fact that the commission on school accommodation needs has commenced its work on recommending criteria for the recognition of new schools, including gaelscoileanna.

      <P>In the 1994-95 academic year, there were almost 90,000 full-time students and some 22,000 part-time students at third level.

    <P>It is estimated that some 45 per cent of the students attending approved courses qualify for assistance under the higher education grants scheme.

      <P>I have informed the House previously that I welcome the recent ASTI survey on staffing, funding and facilities in Irish second level schools as a valuable input to the debate on the optimum allocation of our national resources to the greatest benefit of our people.  I have noted the findings of the survey regarding the second level schools in counties Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the demands for increased funding by second level schools.  There are also demands for increased funding in the other sectors of education as well as demands for increased spending on other public expenditure programmes.  Notwithstanding the many competing demands on budgetary resources, significant increases have been granted in funding schools at second level.  In this context, second level schools in counties Cavan and Monaghan have benefited from these increases.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, I have established a steering group on the funding of second level schools which will draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for different schools within the second level sector.  Following the enactment of the Education Bill, it is intended that schools will have statutorily based entitlements to current funding on the basis of nationally based criteria.</P>
      <P>The steering group includes representatives of the education partners and is being assisted by a working party of technical experts.  The technical working group will prepare a report and recommendations and will be published.  The steering group will then submit final recommendations to me and these will also be published.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted, all persons in the State may claim in respect of their injuries.  The scheme allows for the payment of <i>ex-gratia</i> compensation in the form of certain out-of-pocket expenses and medical expenses in respect of personal injury where the injury is directly attributable to a crime of violence, or in circumstances arising from the action of the victim in assisting or attempting to assist the prevention of crime or the saving of human life.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes a commitment to review this scheme and I expect to receive a report shortly.</P>
      <P>Apart from the formal scheme for <i>ex-gratia</i> financial compensation, the Deputy may be aware that, on 28 February 1997, I published a Charter for Victims of Crime.  The charter pinpoints the legislation relevant to victims, explains the role of the Garda Síochána and brings together details of the various services available.  The special needs of victims of sexual offences and domestic violence as well as tourists, the elderly and children are separately identified.  The charter also explains how victims themselves fit in to the overall structure of victims support and emphasises the importance of reporting the crime in the first place.</P>
      <P>I have this year provided financial support of £280,000 to the Irish Association for Victim Support who provide a wide range of services focused on victims of crime.</P>
      <P>Accommodation has been made available by my Department to the association in the Four Courts and other courthouses.  Where possible, account is taken of the particular needs of victims and witnesses in the design and planning stage of any new court building project or courthouse refurbishment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> As regards financial compensation for persons whose property has been the subject of crime, the position is as set out in the Malicious Injuries (Amendment) Act, 1986.  This provides that, while compensation can continue to be claimed from local authorities, the right is, however, limited to cases of damage in incidents attributable to the Northern Ireland situation, or unlawful damage by a person or persons riotously assembled.</P>

      <P>The area is patrolled by members on foot patrol from Kevin Street Station, by mobile patrols and by task force and plain clothes units. Furthermore, on 1 April 1997 the tourist initiative for the area will become operative and this will result in increased foot patrols.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that the area will continue to receive appropriate Garda attention.</P>

Since it is the folio of the register, not the deeds, which is evidence of title to registered land, it is not clear from the information supplied whether an application for a certified copy folio or a land certificate has been lodged.

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, a safety statement has been prepared for all offices under the aegis of my Department, including head office, the Prisons Service, the courts, the Land Registry and the Probation and Welfare Service.  Statements are in the course of preparation for the newly opened prisons at the Curragh and Castlerea as well as for the office of the State Pathologist, for which my Department assumed responsibility in January 1997.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for safety, health and welfare at work in An Garda Síochána is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I have been informed that the relevant safety statements have been prepared for all areas under his control.</P>
      <P>In each of the above areas, individual members of local management have been designated with responsibility for the matters assigned to them under the respective safety statements in accordance with section 12 (4) (c) of the Act.  In addition, staff in most of these areas have exercised their right under section 13 (3) of the Act to select a safety representative.</P>
      <P>There is a central co-ordinating committee in my Department which oversees developments generally in the area of safety, health and welfare at work within the Department.  Apart from ensuring that management and staff are fully aware of their obligations under the Act and the various related statutory instruments, a central feature of the committee's remit is to ensure that safety statements are updated on a regular basis.</P>

      <P>The social welfare code provides for equal treatment of men and women.</P>
      <P>Child benefit, is payable in respect of all children.  Under the &ldquo;Homemaker&rdquo; provisions introduced in 1994, up to 20 contribution years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to age 12 years of age or an incapacitated person, are disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for old age (contributory) pension.  Under these provisions, credited contributions may also be awarded in respect of the contribution year in which a person commences, or ceases to be, a homemaker.</P>
      <P>The administrative arrangements governing the scheme are at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position shortly to make the necessary regulations to give effect to these arrangements. This will increase entitlement to the old age (contributory) pension by calculating the pension over the period in the paid workforce.</P>

      <P>Darndale-Belcamp resource centre is one of some 80 projects funded by my Department under the community development programme.</P>
      <P>Following a complaint made in relation to the workings of the project in September 1996, the Department wrote to the management committee expressing concern at the implications the reported difficulties could have for the future work and viability of the project.  The Department asked Meitheal, a community training and support organisation with specific responsibility under the community development programme for supporting CDP projects in Dublin North, to offer its assistance to the resource centre in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Given the overall number of projects in the community development programme it is inevitable that some of the projects will experience difficulties.  My Department's approach in all such cases is to work constructively with all concerned to try to resolve the problem and re-establish the project concerned on a sound footing and this is the approach being adopted in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that a number of meetings of the centre's management committee were held since September to facilitate a full discussion of the <Col N="879" /> complaints and the issues arising from them.  At a management committee meeting on 12 February 1997 it was decided to replace the existing management committee with a smaller group that could work together as a team to turn the Centre around.  This was a decision made by the management of the resource centre and my Department was not involved.</P>
    <P>The Department is continuing to fund Darndale-Belcamp resource centre on an interim basis to allow the group to resolve the situation.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear (BSCF) scheme is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear.  People on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.  The scheme operates from 1 June to 30 September each year and is administered by the health boards as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>There is no provision under the BSCF scheme to cover the costs of school books and exam fees as the Department of Education has primary responsibility and makes provision in this area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to pursue the matter further with the Department of Education.</P>

      <P>This is a three year pilot programme which was scheduled to end in June 1997.  Given that there will be wind-down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be end September before the project is completely finished. Funding is being made available in 1997 which will allow the pilot programme to be completed.</P>

At present the approved plant is accepting material from knackeries at a very attractive commercial rate and is currently looking at ways of reducing transportation costs for product being delivered to Monery.</P>

      <P>Data available from the Central Statistics Office suggests that in the period November 1995 to November 1996 prices for unleaded petrol and auto diesel grew by 7 per cent and 10 per cent respectively.  The Central Statistics Office have not yet issued date for the current year.</P>
      <P>The changes indicated reflect upward movement in the price of crude oil, particularly in the latter half of 1996.  Current market perception is that future oil prices will be lower than that experienced in late 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly it is in Ireland's interest that as a peripheral trading nation, we achieve the lowest possible energy prices.  Low prices are essential to national competitiveness and export performance.  Since 1990 Ireland has benefited from comparatively low oil prices in international markets. I would be hopeful that the volatility evident in 1996 will ease and that relatively low oil prices <Col N="889" /> in the 1990's will be maintained with consequent benefits to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>The ministerial air transport service is provided by the Air Corps using a Gulfstream IV jet aircraft, Government Jet.  A Beech Super Kingair 200 turboprop aircraft is also made available from time to time mainly to a limited number of destinations in Europe.</P>
      <P>In 1996 these aircraft flew a total of 1,180 hours in connection with the transport of the Taoiseach and all Ministers, including Ministers of State.  In addition to this a further 445 hours were provided by an air taxi service in connection with the EU Presidency.  In 1992 a total of 1,012 hours was flown in connection with the transport of the Taoiseach and all Ministers, including Ministers of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to costs, my Department now follows the normal practice in the aviation business <Col N="892" /> to cost aircraft by reference to the cost per flying hour under either of two headings: (a) the direct cost, i.e., the costs which are additional to those associated with having the aircraft and which only arise when the aircraft is flown or (b) the total cost, i.e., the direct cost plus the costs associated with having the aircraft.  The figures currently being used by the Department in respect of the relevant aircraft types are as follows:</P>

    <P>For different periods during 1992 the ministerial air transport service was, due to changes in aircraft operated by the Air Corps, provided by four different aircraft viz. a HS 125-700, a Gulfstream III, a Gulfstream IV and a Beech Kingair.  This mix of aircraft would invalidate any cost comparisons between 1992 and 1996.</P>

      <P>The Naval Service fleet consists of seven all-weather patrol vessels.  These undergo regular planned maintenance `and repair to ensure maximum availability to meet operational requirements.</P>
      <P>In this context European Union fishery protection programmes have facilitated certain planned maintenance and refitting to extend the service life of the vessels on a part-cost recoupment basis. Two vessels, <i>LE Deirdre</i> and <i>LE Emer</i>, have been refurbished in recent years.  Refurbishment work on <i>LE Aoife</i> will be completed in April 1997 and will commence on <i>LE Aisling</i> shortly afterwards.  The remaining vessels are due to undergo refitting in the period 1998-2000.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the maintenance arrangements outlined are fully adequate.</P>

      <P>As advised in previous replies the position on this application is as follows.</P>
      <P>For a fishing vessel over 65 feet in registered length to be eligible for a herring licence, the registered tonnage capacity removed to enable its entry to the Irish fishing fleet must have previously fished actively for herring.  As this condition was not fulfilled in relation to the vessel in question and as the registered length of the vessel is calculated to be in excess of 65 feet, the fishing licence which issued to the applicant contains a general preclusion from fishing for herring or mackerel.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has indicated his intention to submit a technical report in support of his contention that the vessel's registered length is less than 65 feet and this will be examined by the Department on receipt.  To date this report has not been received.</P>

    <P>The national control and enforcement regime backed up by stringent penalties is paying dividends. While boardings of fishing vessels increased in 1996, the level of detention proportionately decreased by about 35 per cent on 1995.  This demonstrates the deterrent effect of surveillance and enforcement operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Utilisation of fisheries quotas is measured against the quantity of produce landed or transhipped.  In respect of species to which a quota limitation applies, it is a legal requirement that the quantity of all such produce caught and retained on board are entered into the relevant vessel's EU logbook. The logbooks entry system is well established and provides the basis for the assessment of quota utilisation.</P>
      <P>In order to measure the quantities of quota species which are caught and not retained on board vessels, it would be necessary to maintain a constant presence on every vessel in the EU fleet, an option which I am sure the Deputy will recognise as being completely impractical at this stage.  Equally, a system whereby vessel skippers were obliged to record unretained quantities for reckoning toward quota utilisation, would present similar problems in terms of policing.</P>
      <P>However, there are on-going discussions in the Fisheries Council on new conservation measures which could be introduced to reduce both the level of discarding and the amount of juvenile fish caught.  I will bear the Deputy's concerns in mind in the context of those discussions.</P>

      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that there has been a large loss of employment in the fishing industry.  The catching sector is estimated to provide employment for approximately 7,500 people.  While there has been a small decline in the level of employment in the sector due to a reduction in the more labour intensive fishing methods, the overall numbers employed in the fisheries, sector as a whole has continued to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment in the processing industry has shown consistent increases since the mid 1980's when employment levels were estimated at around 1,450.  Current studies indicate that <Col N="901" /> approximately 3,700 people are now employed in fish processing.</P>
    <P>This increase in employment is due in part to the strategic investment which has been undertaken in the context of the Processing Measures of the Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99.  A total of almost £31 million will be invested in fish processing outlets around the coast, attracting some £9.5 million in EU aid over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>To date, 104 projects have been approved under this measure, representing a total investment of £18 million, including £7.7 million in EU aid.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether twin rigger trawlers are unsuited to fishing in the Irish Sea in view of the declining stocks and the unsustainable and rapid depletion which this fishing technique causes; and the measures, if any, he proposes to take in order to protect stocks and the livelihoods of the less predatory trawlers in the Irish Sea.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of EU member states, including the United Kingdom, have entitlements to fish in the Irish Sea.  All vessels fishing in Irish waters are subject to Community fisheries legislation.  The scope which a member state has to impose additional restrictions on fishing methods is limited to its own national fleet.  As twin rigging is permissible under Community fisheries provisions, if the Irish Government were to introduce additional restrictions on fishing methods they would only apply in respect of Irish vessels.  The method is not commonly used in the Irish fleet.</P>
      <P>Twin-rigging, together with other matters of a technical nature relating to fishing gear, is the subject of ongoing discussion at EU level and bilaterally between Ireland and the UK.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine works closely with the UK fishery authorities on the introduction of conservation measures to safeguard and regenerate Irish Sea stocks in order to preserve a sustainable livelihood for the fishermen who fish in those waters.</P>
      <P>Most recently both the Irish and UK authorities have introduced a requirement that all prawn trawls must have square panels which allow immature white fish to escape.  This measure is aimed to substantially reduce discards in the prawn fishery.</P>
