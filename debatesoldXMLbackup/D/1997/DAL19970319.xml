      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach's position on the matter has been uncertain in recent days, is it the Government's intention to call on the British Government to hold a new full-scale inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday?  The <i>prima facie</i> evidence which has come to light in recent months would indicate that the Widgery inquiry covered an act of state terrorism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the matter will be addressed by way of questions.  There is no change in our position.  The Departments of the Taoiseach and of Foreign Affairs are assessing new information and evidence.  Deputies will appreciate that the first requirement is to make sure the information and evidence is authentic. We hope to conclude our work on this in a short time and present the facts to the British Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will time be provided tomorrow for the Ministers, Deputy Noonan and Deputy Howlin, to answer questions on their handling of the hepatitis C issue?  Given that the Government made a commitment to be accountable, does the Tánaiste agree there should be parliamentary accountability in the House?  If the Government will not provide time for questions on the matter we will not have parliamentary accountability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the arrangement made between the Whips is there will be a debate on this matter tomorrow and on Tuesday next.  I understand the Minister for <Col N="907" /> Health will take questions in the normal course of events next week.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste's answer was not satisfactory.  He referred to the Minister's usual parliamentary questions on Tuesday next.  He must be aware that the handling of this issue leaves much to be desired &mdash; it was mishandled by both Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has tabled a &ldquo;take note&rdquo; motion for tomorrow.  For the past five days it has been indicated in the media that there will be an amendment to this motion.  Is this the case and, if not, will the Government accept the Fianna Fáil amendment in the name of Deputy Brian Cowen which proposes that the Government should accept aggravated damages?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled private notice questions to the Minister for Health today so that he can account to the House for the current donor selection procedures which are clearly inadequate given that last December a woman who had been contaminated with hepatitis C by the State was asked to donate blood.  Even if we cannot ask questions of the two relevant Ministers, will the Minister for Health account for the inadequate donor selection procedures?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Opposition Whips requested that time be provided for a question and answer session during the debate. However, the Minister has refused to answer questions and has stated that it is not his report and he answered all questions at the tribunal.  In other words, he is denying accountability to Dáil Éireann for his political handling of this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 8, to delete &ldquo;AND&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3 are consequential on amendment No. 23 which is being introduced to provide legal certainty in the powers in the Pensions Act, 1990 to make regulations in respect of external pension schemes, that is, those schemes set up in another jurisdiction with the members in Ireland.  The amendment arises as a result of concern expressed by pension practitioners in Ireland and the United Kingdom about the situation that will arise when the UK Pensions Act comes into force in April of this year, particularly as it relates to schemes with members in Ireland and the UK.  Existing pension schemes set up in the UK with Irish members may, from April 1997, technically be subject to the laws of two jurisdictions, as would be the case for Irish schemes with UK members.  While the legislation of both countries on pensions will be broadly similar, there are some differences which will cause difficulties to schemes and practitioners dealing with them.  For example, members of Irish schemes based in the UK could be liable to the indexation requirements of the UK which are different from the revaluation provisions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, pension practitioners are pressing for legal certainty in such schemes.  The possibility of making a pension scheme with members in both jurisdictions solely or largely liable to the legislation of the country where the scheme is set up is currently being discussed at official level with the UK DSS.  This would exempt the scheme from the legislation of the other country on the basis that the safeguards in place in the set-up country are broadly similar and therefore provide adequate protection.  If agreement is reached it would be implemented via regulations by each jurisdiction.  The existing regulatory provisions relating to external schemes do not specifically provide that these schemes can be exempted from the provisions of the Pensions Act, and it is the purpose of amendment No. 23 to provide explicit powers to allow the exemption of such schemes and thereby provide legal certainty.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are consequential on amendment No. 23.  They provide for reference to the Pensions Act, 1990 in the Long Title of the Bill and for the exclusion of the amendment being made to the Pensions Act from the collective citation of the Bill provided for in section 1(2).</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are technical amendments and are acceptable. Amendment No.3 is somewhat similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us initial notice of amendment <Col N="918" /> No. 23 at the select committee when he said there would be an amendment on Report Stage, but he did not explain what its effect would be.  The amendment provides that regulations may exclude external schemes or certain categories of external schemes from the application of some or all of the provisions of this Bill and of regulations made thereunder.  This seems a straightforward and simple amendment to cover the movement of people between jurisdictions.  In explaining the amendment the Minister mentioned the possibility of a scheme becoming liable to indexation.  I am mainly concerned that the beneficiaries of such schemes should not lose out. We need a system that supports and facilitates mobility.  We need to ensure pensions can be carried from one jurisdiction to another without being adversely affected.  Such an arrangement already exists for social security pensions between the UK and Ireland and between the EU and Ireland, because Ministers in the Department of Social Welfare took the trouble to ensure people who worked in countries outside the European Union would get credit for accumulated pension entitlements.  That arrangement is of great benefit to Irish workers working abroad and to people coming home to work or to enjoy their pensions in Ireland and who, but for the existence of this arrangement, could not have done so.  We want to see fair play for individuals and to ensure that by providing for exemptions we will not disadvantage people who, of necessity, move from one jurisdiction to another.  It appears from what the Minister said the technical details have not been worked out and it will be necessary to inquire further into them.  I note also that in the amendment it is stated: &ldquo;Regulations may exclude...&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Regulations shall exclude...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our first interest should be to ensure that workers who work in different jurisdictions get full credit for pensions to which they built up entitlement while working in another jurisdiction. I would like the Minister to elaborate on the situations that might arise and give us an assurance that the workers who benefit from the pensions will not be disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this amendment. My concern is that nobody should incur a loss in moving from one jurisdiction to another and any loss should be recouped in a short time.  I welcome the existence of an arrangement between the two countries.  It is satisfying for people who have to work overseas that they can come and go and their pensions are secure.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies on the preservation of benefits.  The purpose of the exercise is to ensure that people who have contributed to a scheme will not lose out as a result of the enactment in either jurisdiction of legislation that causes a conflict for people involved in the delivery of pension schemes.  Concern was expressed by pension practitioners in Ireland and the UK <Col N="919" /> about the application of such laws in either jurisdiction. That is the reason these amendments were introduced.  It would be virtually impossible to anticipate all possible scenarios with absolute certainty but, given the concern expressed by pension practitioners, it was thought necessary and desirable to introduce this legislation.  I agree with the Deputies opposite who rightly pointed out the necessity to protect and preserve the rights and entitlements of subscribers, and we are doing that in this legislation.  If agreement is reached, the measure will be implemented by way of regulations in each jurisdiction.  Those regulations will be in concert with each other to facilitate the protection of subscribers in both jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  &mdash; The Minister shall consider the possibility of increasing the personal rates of benefit of widows and widowers over age 66, over the course of three years, to the level of the personal rate of old age contributory pension, and place a report on this matter on the table of Dáil Éireann within three months.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many widows and widowers over 66 who, even though they are in the old age category, are not entitled to old age contributory pension. The maximum pension they will receive from next June is £71.10 whereas the personal rate for old age contributory pension will be £78. A substantial number of widows and a small number of widowers and invalidity pensioners are in this category.  Will the Minister examine this matter, take all the elements into consideration and place on the table of the House within three months a report outlining the parameters on which future policy may be debated?  It is not possible to put down an amendment stating that we should do this because it would involve a charge on the Exchequer &mdash; that is the rule of the House &mdash; but the facts should be noted and consideration given to whether that should be done.  I believe strongly that it should.  I am aware it cannot be done in one fell swoop in one budget, <Col N="920" /> but it is reasonable to expect it would be done over a period of, say, three years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that there are now fewer widows at a young age because, fortunately, men are surviving a little longer &mdash; with further improvements in medicine I hope they will live even longer.  There is less demand therefore on widow's pension in the under 66 bracket, although there is still a demand on window's pension for those over 66.  On the other hand, the steps being taken to ensure women get pensions in their own right will facilitate pensions for those over 66.  Since that is the direction we are going, why not give those widows the support they very badly need?  A widow who reaches 66 years still has to maintain a household, to deal with all the problems associated with old age and be capable of meeting the financial needs.  She should therefore receive the same rate as a person on old age contributory pension since she is an old age pensioner and is entitled to money from the social insurance fund, which is cash rich to such an extent that the Minister is stealing from it £133 million.  Why not assist beneficiaries by giving them that support?  That raises a wider question about the fund, but the problem is that widows in that position do not have sufficient contributions in their own right.  This matter should be addressed without delay.</P>
    <P>I hope it is possible to place on the table of the House a report on this matter, as proposed in the amendment.  This is simply a request for information to enable proper discussion of an issue that affects a substantial number of people who need our support.  The other group that comes to mind includes people on invalidity pension who reach 66 years and do not have suitable qualifications for old age contributory pension.  Those people, who by medical definition have a serious problem and are rigorously assessed, should receive the same rate as those on old age contributory pension when they reach 66 years.</P>
    <P>Widows, widowers and invalidity pensioners are included in this category and it is time we gave due consideration to putting their position right.  Since there is no money involved &mdash; it would simply involve putting a report on the table of the House within three months, and I know the Department would be capable of doing that &mdash; I ask the Minister to consider this matter.  The report on child benefit is a classical example of what the Department can do to aid policy formulation and development.  This would be a good precedent because if committees of the House are to be relevant and discussion is to be worthwhile, reports of that kind should be a feature of consideration of policy.  I hope the Minister will agree to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is dealing with one of my favourite subjects, but since this is Report Stage I do not have time to discuss it at length. The Minister and I are anxious to improve the position of widows over 66 years of age, but we have gone as far as possible this year.  We should <Col N="921" /> not anticipate what will happen in the 1998 budget, which will be introduced in 1997.</P>
      <P>When one partner dies, with the exception of the food bill, the outlay of the household remains the same.  It can be traumatic for an elderly widow to run a household on roughly half the income to which she was accustomed.  Widows and widowers under 66 years of age do not qualify for many of the ancillary benefits available to persons over 66 years of age.  While the Deputy made a valid case, he was somewhat selective because there is a large section of people for whom we would love to do more.  It was not possible last year or this year to resolve all the problems in this area, but we will continue to make progress.  When we were in Opposition we highlighted many of the problems faced by people on social welfare.  We must operate within the current budget and next year's budget will be determined by Estimates compiled over the next few months.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the commitments in Partnership 2000, the Minister's priority is to bring all rates up to the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Deputy Woods requested that a report be laid before the House. We are already conforming to the recommendations of a report and have surpassed its targets in many areas.  In 1997 the cost of increasing the rates provided for in this Bill will be almost £83 million and more than £148 million in a full year. We are making significant progress in meeting the commitment to which I referred.  Most social insurance payments are now at or well above the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Old age and retirement pensions are now 113 per cent of the rate recommended by the commission, while unemployment and disability benefits are being increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the main rate.  Similarly, all long-term social assistance payments are being increased from 95 per cent to 98 per cent while short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance are being increased from 92 per cent to 98 per cent.  The extent of our achievements in this area is illustrated by the fact that the cost of increasing all rates to the CSW main rate when we came into office was £150 million, but following this year's increases it will have reduced to under £60 million.  Considerable progress has been made in that area.  It is our intention to eventually eliminate the difficulties and poverty traps that have developed over many years.</P>
      <P>To bring all rates up to the main rate recommended by the CSW additional resources will have to be allocated to those payments currently below the main rate.  This is the approach the Minister adopted this year.  Providing additional increases to payments already above the CSW rate would inevitably mean those in greatest need would have to wait longer before their payments reached the rate recommended by the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The flat rate increase of £3 provided this year <Col N="922" /> in all personal rates represents a much more balanced approach in that it provides an increase in real terms to all recipients.  Widows and widowers on contributory pensions received an increase of 4.4 per cent and those on non-contributory pensions received an increase of 4.7 per cent.  At the same time significant progress has been made towards bringing all payments up to the CSW rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also referred to the difficulties faced by people on invalidity pension when they reach the qualifying age for old age pension.  The same rate applies to both.  This highlights the progress made in recent years to bring all payments up to a similar level while adhering to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare. To a large extent we have succeeded in treating all people equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable the Minister of State is not prepared to accept the amendment. If we are to have openness, accountability and informed debate in advance of budgets or Estimates the reports to which I referred must become a feature of the system.  If the House is to be involved in debates on these matters, we must know the facts.  We can no longer play hide and seek with figures and information.  The information should be consolidated in a comprehensive manner and related to particular issues and groups of people.  While I accept information can be drawn from various reports, we must focus on groups of people with particular problems.  The Minister of State referred to the rates proposed by the Commission on Social Welfare and said the Government has gone as far as possible this year.  While I welcome the progress made this year, many problems remain to be resolved and the social welfare fund will record a deficit of £133 million.  By reducing the fund the Minister is weakening his position and that of his successors to get resources for necessary improvements in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said we should not anticipate next year's budget.  To prioritise matters, the facts must be established well in advance of the budget.  No less an authority than the Minister for Finance said we should talk to him before the budget.  Some people were even invited to a dinner before the last budget, but that is a separate matter.  He has also invited people to talk to him more generally before the budget.  There seems to be a conflict between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance on whether we should discuss or anticipate matters before the budget.  It is not very desirable or democratic for such discussions to be held only with the select few.  It is much better to put matters openly on the table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also said I was being selective in picking out widows over the age of 66 years.  I tried to explain to him that there is a special problem there which will have to be addressed.  I spelled out that not only are those <Col N="923" /> people widows, they are also older people.  The only reason they do not receive the same rate of payment as the old age contributory pension is that they do not have that entitlement in their own right.  We must move away from that and give women entitlements in their own right, especially where they already have derived entitlements and are due credits in other areas. Fortunately, that system has begun to operate.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State feels he has done enough this year and that widows have done very well.  I cannot agree with him entirely because over the three years a widow will receive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reality is that over the three years a widow will have received an increase in the personal rate of £2.20 per week per annum. That is nothing to shout about.  We discussed it on Committee Stage and I did not intend to raise it again but the Minister of State has brought it up.  When the Minister of State talks about the £3, he very conveniently side steps or forgets to mention that if the widow happens to have children the increase is less.  For example, a widow with five children will get an increase of 1.9 per cent.  A widow on a contributory pension with three children will get an increase of 2.5 per cent. The Minister of State is being quite selective in talking only about the personal rates in this regard.  Many widows have families and the personal rate is only part of the money they will receive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Widows over the age of 66 years will receive £71 per week from next June, which is not a princely sum.  We must close the gap between the amounts received by widows, widowers and invalidity pensioners and that received by old age contributory <Col N="924" /> pensioners.  I intend to press the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;In the case where a person who is in receipt of a Social Welfare benefit or assistance payment, and either that person or an adult dependant of that person dies, the Minister shall consider the implications of continuing the current payment in full for a period of six months during the first year of bereavement, and he shall place a report on this matter on the table of Dáil Éireann within three months.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the present system when a dependant of an adult beneficiary dies the beneficiary receives the full payment for six weeks.  That was introduced to help people, particularly widows, to get over the trauma, sense of loss and difficulty in dealing with the problems which arise following a bereavement.  The six-week period gave the Department an opportunity to establish entitlement to a long-term contributory pension.  That is a very caring and considerate measure which is particularly welcome at such a traumatic time.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand the tremendous sense of loss, hurt, loneliness and lack of support which occurs after a bereavement.  It is a huge wrench and a period of great difficulty.  It is a time when people find it very difficult to cope.  The Department has grant aided many studies of the difficulties which arise in such situations.  In my experience, the sense of trauma lasts for about a year but it is obviously much more difficult in the earlier months.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister of State to follow up the interim report of the Commission on the Family which recommended special support for bereaved people and recognition of the need to introduce a bereavement allowance.  That issue was frequently highlighted in the reports the commission received from around the country.  That report set out some principles, the results of the surveys conducted around the country and the important issues, one of which was how to handle bereavement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the loss, loneliness, hurt, sense of isolation and the need for support felt during a bereavement, there is also a need for financial support.  Under the previous amendment we discussed the types of financial losses incurred by the bereaved.  For example, from June onwards the old age contributory pension personal rate will be £78 with a dependant rate of £51, giving a total of £129 per week plus the fuel allowance and so on.  The household income of a widowed dependant will be reduced from £129 to £71.10, which is a very large reduction of £57.90.  If a non-contributory old age pensioner is involved, the <Col N="925" /> figure drops to £67.50, which is an even greater fall.</P>
    <P>Given the severe loss of income involved, there is a need for a period of adjustment and recovery. While the provision of a period of six weeks, which has been in place for many years, is beneficial, we have reached a stage in our economic growth, levels of income and buoyant income contributions to the social insurance fund that it would not be difficult to allow for a six month period of recovery.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister of State may take the view that this provision cannot be made immediately and I am prevented from moving a motion which would involve a cost, I am obliged to move this amendment requesting the Minister to place a report before the House within three months to ensure the matter will be considered.  That is plenty of time in which to produce a comprehensive report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is sensible.  The Deputy depicted cases of trauma which arise from the income gap created when a spouse dies. The survivor is suddenly obliged to run the household on an income approaching only half of that provided up until then.  In cases where both spouses have separate old age pension books a surviving spouse is not entitled to the six week payment.  Some years ago, I brought such a case to the attention of the Minister of State's Department. The matter must be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, I said short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance are being increased in the current year from 92 per cent to 98 per cent of the main rate.  I should have said from 92 per cent to 95 per cent and I apologise for that.</P>
      <P>I note the case made by the Deputies regarding amendment No. 5.  It is similar to the case made in respect of amendment No. 4.  However, it is well recognised that the trauma experienced by a surviving partner is significant and arises at a time when two people in the household have become accustomed to working to a fixed budget which is almost double what the remaining partner must survive on in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, while there is a five weeks payment, made for a specific laudable purpose, I do not accept that the trauma is any less in financial terms after a period of six months or even after a period of 12 months.  We should recognise that the problem continues and it is not just the personal loss associated with the death or the loss of a partner.  This point was made to me when I addressed the National Association of Widows in Ireland on this matter some time ago.  The association is in the best position to assess the situation because its members deal with it on a daily basis and at first hand.  Given this, we must look at increasing the basic rate as opposed to dealing with the problem on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or attempting to alleviate it for a short period, such <Col N="926" /> as by extending the period from five weeks to six months, or even from six months to 12 months.</P>
    <P>While recognising the case made by the Opposition, the right way to address the problem is as I have suggested.  Present arrangements provide for the continuation of payment to a recipient of social welfare benefits or his or her adult dependant for a period of six weeks.  The purpose of these payments is to ensure the family has an income pending the surviving spouse making and processing a claim for widow's or widower's pension where this arises, and also to avoid a sudden reduction in income at a distressing time for the person concerned.  They are also designed to relieve people of the need to make a claim for a payment in their own right at such a difficult time.</P>
    <P>While the Deputies opposite have referred to the importance of these arrangements, which we also recognise, it is more important and of greater benefit to people to increase the basic rates of payment, thereby providing an ongoing improvement of a permanent nature for the family.  That is fundamental to the debate.  While there is nothing wrong with the interim arrangements suggested in the amendment, they are only interim.  The manner and method by which we are proceeding is better.  There is no benefit in assessing the situation, placing a report before the House and suggesting that matters be improved next year.  We must address the situation head on and this will be done when the Estimates are reviewed.</P>
    <P>From my knowledge of dealing with individual cases, there are two categories to be considered. The person surviving the death of a partner faces huge trauma, whether he or she is over or under 66 years of age.  That is why some measures have been taken over the years, such as the extension of payments for the six week period, to attempt to alleviate the financial hurt and the person's trauma.  However, the solution to this problem does not simply lie in postponing the financial impact to a period further down the road in the hope it will go away.  It does not go away, indeed, in the case of persons over the age of 66 the problem can be accentuated because they can be in worse circumstances six months or a year after the original loss.</P>
    <P>Likewise the trauma suffered by a widow under the age of 66 following bereavement does not lessen after six months, a year or two or three years.  In countless such cases widows have had to survive on substantially less income.  Notwithstanding family loss, they have had to cope with economic problems.  I know of widows who have had to cope with economic problems for 20, 30 or 40 years.  As the financial problem involved is ongoing, a basic requirement is to deal with it in the most satisfactory fashion by addressing the issue of the basic rates of payments to ensure that in the event of a tragedy the survivor will be catered for in financial terms in so far as that is possible. We cannot compensate for their personal loss.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister of State does not agree with my proposal to present a report on this matter to the Dáil.  I am also disappointed with his approach to the matter.  He said the main requirement is to address the issue of the basic rates.  They will remain an issue. While the 1986 report of the Commission on Social Welfare is a yardstick, a new yardstick based on the adequacy of current payments must be used.  The Minister of State agrees there is a period for which it is beneficial to make an extra payment and, hence, he is very much in favour of the six week payment after bereavement.  He does not consider there is any point in postponing the decrease in benefit, but I believe there is.  While the six week payment is beneficial, it is not sufficient in financial terms to enable people cope with their bereavement.</P>
      <P>The Minister confirmed what I said earlier and know to be true, that the six week payment was initially introduced because of the difficulty of ensuring payments were made in that period following bereavement.  With computerisation it is now much easier to issue payments on time.  In the past people suffered a great deal financially because of delays in issuing a book to the recipient which resulted in the need to pay supplementary welfare benefit.  The introduction of the six week payment eased the trauma suffered by those concerned over that period.  However, it is necessary to recognise that a substantial financial need arises from a bereavement.  As the people concerned suffer a financial loss at that time, it is important to consider extending the six week payment.  My amendment proposes extending it by six months, but if, on analysis, the Minister considers extending it by three months that would be beneficial too.  All the evidence supports its extension.  If the Minister of State took the time to read the report of the Commission on the Family, he would note it strongly highlights the need for the provision of finance and counselling over that period following bereavement.</P>
      <P>I am trying to look forward, I want to get out of the current time warp of being tied into the recommendations of the 1986 report of the Commission on Social Welfare and accepting that is all that is at issue.  That process has been ongoing for a number of years.  As the Minister of State said, when the Government came into office some of the payments were more than 100 per cent of those recommended in the report and others are close to it.  Rather than waiting until the recommended level of payments is achieved, we should plan how to address issues that are considered important.  Addressing them is a matter of will.  The Minister of State knows a Government can find £100 million, £200 million or whatever depending on its will at a time.  In recent times substantial moneys were found and that matter is regularly boasted about inside and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of benefits following a bereavement is an important issue.  It is necessary to provide resources to address the issues that affect the <Col N="928" /> people concerned.  Bereavement is a real issue for widows, widowers and others affected.  We have shown some consideration for them in the provision of a six week payment following bereavement, but we must show greater consideration. We must acknowledge those affected are special and must be given greater attention and assistance at the time of their bereavement.  We should focus on the issue of bereavement to ensure it is on the table when considering the next budget and set of Estimates.  In that way we will advance by tackling problems experienced by bereaved people.</P>
    <P>The financial problems associated with bereavement were highlighted by a recent report prepared by the widows' association with the assistance of a grant from the Department of Social Welfare.  It has done excellent work in highlighting the trauma and financial difficulties experienced following bereavement.  We know that bereavement is an exceptionally difficult period and we should do more to help those affected by it.  We should prepare a report on that matter and lay it on the table of the Dáil to enable us consider it from the perspective of the forthcoming budget and the next set of Estimates.  If we did that, we would advance the position. When Ministers consider what the priorities should be at the next budget, they will have the necessary information, as will members of the relevant select committee and other Members of the House, to make the correct decisions and to provide the type of care and support the Members would like to provide for those affected by bereavement, taking account of the quantification and costing of the payment of benefit for different periods.  Having examined the figures, they could take rational and reasonable steps to address the problems while showing we recognise people face special problems following bereavement and want to help them and show care and compassion.  We could do that as well as addressing the issue of the basic rates of payments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy that the statement of strategy for the office of the Attorney General has been completed and was sent for printing last week.  I understand that publication is expected later this week.  As soon as it is printed, I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Oireachtas Library and for a copy to be made available to each Member.</P>

      <P>I have pursued this matter for months and I am glad my repeated questioning has pushed along the preparation of the report. This is the fifth time I have been told that it is almost ready and it appears the Minister of State has some good news.</P>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach's office happy that the early warning system operated by the legal assistants in the office is functioning satisfactorily?  I have pursued this matter for months and I am sure the Minister of State has been briefed on it.  It was stated in the summary of progress and recommendations, which the Taoiseach forwarded to me, that the development of the information technology systems would assist the overall system. I was told the offices were to have moved into the final stages of this information technology development by early February.  Did that happen?</P>
      <P>I raised questions over a number of months about staff appraisals, which were due to take place at the end of last year.  Has this issue been addressed?  I was also told that the position of the senior claims manager would be addressed. However, I am not aware of any moves in that regard.</P>
      <P>I received a commitment during the Judge Lynch affair last October and November that two parliamentary draftsmen would be recruited. However, I understand from a reply I received last week that there are still six long-term contract parliamentary draftsmen.  Two of the six should be appointed rather than continuing to employ them on contract.</P>

      <P>All my questions arise from a reply I received on 12 February last.  However, I appreciate that the office which briefs the Taoiseach does not brief the Minister of State any better. My questions arise from the schedule the Taoiseach gave me on 12 February.  He stated then that he would give me the information in a schedule rather than answer detailed questions.

      <P>I tabled the questions for 12 February.  It is obvious I will not receive information today.  The Taoiseach's office wanted some questions postponed until next week but it wanted these questions to be taken today so the Taoiseach would not have to answer them.  That is odd.  Will the Taoiseach's office or the office of the Attorney General ensure my points, which arise in relation to the schedule I received on 12 February 1997, are included in the strategy statement? I would be happy if that was case but I doubt it will happen.  Will the Minister of State at least ask the office to do that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said the strategy statement in relation to the office of the Attorney General would be published next week. Does it take into account the report carried out at the request of the office of the Attorney General by Professor Stephen Mason?  The Government has apparently had this report for the last <Col N="932" /> six months but has not published it.  The report apparently states that the office of the Attorney General was starved of resources in recent years. Will the Minister of State outline whether it is the Government's intention to divide the office of the Attorney General into two offices, with a separate independent office for the drafting of legislation? This was one of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a matter for a statement of strategy.  While the office of the Attorney General can present statements of strategy currently in operation, it has not been directed to implement any specific changes, nor can I foretell what will happen in the future.  I am not party to the detailed consultation thereon nor am I involved at that level.</P>
      <P>I understand Professor Mason's report published some time ago is now a matter of history and considerable progress has been made since it was written.  Deputy Dermot Ahern referred to one or two points of its overall 90 recommendations. Since then the Government has acted and provided considerable additional resources, in terms of staff and money, to the Offices of the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously someone in the Attorney General's office decided to provide an answer to a question about resources.  One of the main recommendations of the Mason report was the establishment of a separate parliamentary draftsman's office, the view being that the Attorney General's office was top heavy with requests for and preparation of legislation in recent decades, and the workload would worsen rather than lessen.  Surely the Government should express some view on that recommendation rather than the Minister of State merely saying she does not know and is not involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a subject which would perhaps merit a substantive question rather than a supplementary. The questions I am answering today relate specifically to the publication of strategy statements for the offices in question and, if I make a statement on the matter, it is on their publication.  As far as I can ascertain from the question, the point the Deputy is making is a matter for Government &mdash; he will be aware I am not a member of the Cabinet &mdash; not one falling to be dealt with in the strategy statement of any of the offices in question.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me whether the strategy statement in the case of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions would contain X, Y or Z.  I will tell him what it will contain, which might eliminate the necessity for some of his supplementaries. The statement of strategy for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions will build on the findings and recommendations in the initial assessment report prepared by Grant Fortune Consulting, commissioned to assist in the first phase of the strategic management process in that office.  The Deputy will be familiar with that report which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in June last.  The statement of strategy will cover the period 1997 to 2000, will address the mission for the office, stipulating key goals and objectives relating to justice, quality, efficiency and value for money in the provision of a prosecutory service for the future.  A key goal will be the establishment of a best case management <Col N="934" /> system which will serve to optimise the use of resources and deliver increased effectiveness, efficiency and value for money in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  A working group, comprising a representative of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the Garda Síochána and personnel from the Department of Finance, has been established to address ways in which the quality of investigation of files received by the office can be improved.  The Deputy must accept that I cannot go into specifics.  The working group has met, decided on a course of action which is being implemented and will convene further meetings to monitor implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair employment in Northern Ireland is an issue to which successive Irish Governments have attached a high priority.  We wish to see the eradication of discrimination in employment in <Col N="936" /> Northern Ireland and we regard the question of fair and equal access to the labour market in Northern Ireland as a basic human right for all, regardless of their community background.</P>
      <P>In 1989, the then Government made a major contribution, through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to the strengthening of fair employment legislation when new legislation was enacted which amended and expanded the 1976 Fair Employment Act.  We welcome the most recent findings of the Fair Employment Commission that the Catholic community's participation rate in employment has risen slowly but steadily since the adoption of the 1989 legislation.  At the same time it is encouraging to note that the protection of the legislation is being invoked by both communities.</P>
      <P>The matter raised by the Deputy is one of concern to the Government.  We received representations on the issue from a number of Nationalist political figures in Northern Ireland who were also concerned at the implications of the case. The British Government was made aware of these concerns through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
      <P>On 10 March, the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, announced an independent review of the deployment of staff in the private office of the Department of Agriculture.  The investigation will be undertaken by the former Northern Ireland Ombudsman, Dr. Maurice Hayes.  It is expected that Dr. Hayes's review of the case will be completed by mid-April when his report will be presented to the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  I share the Deputy's concerns on this issue and he can be assured I will keep the matter under careful review.  In the meantime, I prefer to reserve any further comment pending the findings of Dr. Hayes's report.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and his acknowledgement of the efforts made by the Government in 1989.  I had the privilege of being involved in the debates on fair employment legislation through the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  That is good legislation but it is unacceptable that the Minister in charge of overseeing the implementation of fair employment rules should be seen, by her actions, to condone sectarian harassment of an official in her office, who was the subject of sectarian harassment and received an award of £10,000 as a result.  The person involved in that harassment, the private secretary to the Minister, is still in the office.  Surely it does not need an independent inquiry or an independent review; that is a means of putting the matter on the long finger until after the British general election. Action should be taken at this stage in respect of the behaviour of the Minister involved.</P>

The question of whether sectarian harassment <Col N="937" /> occurred is not in doubt.  Liability has been admitted and the victim received £10,000 in compensation. Dr. Hayes will concentrate on the events surrounding the subsequent transfer of the victim. We should await the outcome of this inquiry.

It is a question of judge me by what I say rather than what I do because, by any yardstick, the behaviour of Minister Denton in this case fails to conform to the words of the framework document.

      <P>I understand that the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy recently adopted a report on the challenges facing the European defence-related industry, but that the report has not yet been considered by the European Parliament in plenary session.  The main thrust of the report in support of a European armaments policy is not new: the European Parliament has, over the years, repeatedly advocated the development of European armaments co-operation.  The European Parliament is of course competent to consider and make recommendations on these issues, although they remain primarily within the purview of the member states.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to the issue of armaments derives in the first instance from our strong and enduring commitment to disarmament and arms control.  Our primary concern, therefore, will be to ensure that any developments in this area are consistent with our priorities in disarmament and arms control and our overall approach to international peace and security.  We wish to ensure also that any development of co-operation related to armaments includes a strengthening of arms export control policies at the level of the European Union.  The Government will continue to work for enhanced EU co-operation on arms export policy to achieve the maximum possible transparency and restraint in arms transfers.</P>
      <P>As regards the Western European Union's nuclear policy, this is a matter for the Western European Union full members in the context of their mutual defence commitment and, therefore, does not arise in the context of the relationship between the EU and Western European Union. In relation to the development of the Western European Union as an instrument for the implementation of aspects of the European Union's common foreign and security policy, I recall that this is already provided for in Article J.4.2 of the Maastricht Treaty, which was signed in 1992 by the current leader of Fianna Fáil on behalf of the Irish Government and subsequently ratified by the Irish people in a referendum.</P>

Some 30 per cent of the trade is with the developing world and it flies contrary to all the expressed views in relation to such things as the protection of human rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised many questions. Ireland has always been committed to disarmament and arms control as the key element of our efforts to promote international peace and security.  We have promoted efforts in the UN, OSCE and EU to encourage maximum transparency and restraint in international arms transfers.  That has been the consistent policy of all Irish Governments. The European Commission acting on its own authority sent, in January 1996, a formal communication summarising developments and challenges in this area to the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.  The report of the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy is in part the European Parliament's response to the Commission's communication. The Commission's communication points to the arguments for further restructuring of the arms industry as it exists within the EU and proposed a range of responses essentially based on existing Union policies.  Ireland's approach would take this into account.  We have outlined our policy in the White Paper, there are policy options which are supported by all parties in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made clear on many occasions its total abhorrence of these attacks.  Their persistence and increase remains a matter of grave concern.  The Government's position on this matter is clear and unambiguous. Such acts are totally reprehensible and antidemocratic practices and they should be brought to an immediate end.  The actions of those involved in organising and carrying them out are repugnant and entirely inconsistent with the rule of law.</P>
      <P>The inflicting of punishment beatings is also incompatible with the principles and objectives of the peace process.  As the Deputy will recall, the Mitchell principles call on all participants in all-party negotiations &ldquo;to urge that punishment killings and beatings stop and to take effective steps to prevent such actions&rdquo;.  The report goes on to state that the members of the international body &ldquo;join the Governments, religious leaders and many others in condemning punishment killings and beatings.  They contribute to the fear that those who have used violence to pursue political objectives in the past will do so again in the future.  Such actions have no place in a lawful society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government fully endorses that position. The ending of punishment beatings would be a significant confidence building measure.  Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties are well aware of our views on this issue.  We have made clear on a number of occasions the importance of both using whatever influence they may have to put an end to these attacks.  Spokespersons for these parties have said that they are opposed to such attacks. It remains vital that they should bring their influence within their respective communities to bear on the issue to ensure that these attacks are brought to an end.</P>

Will he agree that they are not indicative of people who are prepared to resort to normal political activity but rather of those who seek to get their way by non-political and violent means?  Will he seek to use the Government's influence with the three parties mentioned to try to bring to an end immediately this barbarity which besmirches the name of Ireland and ask these people what justification they have for a continuance of these practices?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in absolute agreement with the Deputy.  The Government abhors the practice of punishment beatings which is outside the rule of law.  The people engaged in such attacks, whether in Northern Ireland or the South, are acting contrary to the spirit and principles underlying the prospects of establishing peace on this island.  We have used the opportunity at all times &mdash; I would expect all parties in the House to do the same &mdash; to make clear that the Government does not accept punishment beatings.  As I have said on many occasions, we want to see a restoration of the ceasefire and an end to violence or the threat of it.  I consider punishment beatings part and parcel of the threat of violent activity.</P>

      <P>When the Minister states that he wants to see a resumption of the ceasefire does he take the point that during the former ceasefire these activities not alone continued but increased in intensity and in number?  Is there anything he can do to ensure, for example, that associated matters such as the purported banishment of people from Northern Ireland will cease and, in particular, that the bodies of the dozens of people who have been murdered by republican and loyalist activists will be uncovered and returned to their families?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made it clear &mdash; other parties have done likewise &mdash; that on the restoration of a ceasefire there should be no activity on the ground inconsistent with a ceasefire. I regard punishment beatings part and parcel of this.  As a former Minister for Justice, the Deputy is aware that there is very little we can do apart from asking and pleading with people and making it clear to them that we will not tolerate this activity.  It is the consistent view of all Members of the House that punishment beatings are not acceptable in a democratic society.</P>

Sinn Féin and the two smaller loyalist parties were flavour of the month at the time; it seemed that everybody wanted to get them on side and keep them there.  Little was said about the activities that were taking place during the ceasefire, including punishment beatings and the re-arming and regrouping of the IRA.</P>

I want to see and end &mdash; not a ceasefire &mdash; to violence on this island, to which the Deputy also subscribes.  All democratic politicians in this House want that.  Consistent with this would be the ending of punishment beatings or the threat of their use in any community.</P>

The position on discussions on Burma since then, particularly at the EU-ASEAN meeting in Singapore in February, is outlined in my replies to Question No. 48 of 19 February and Question No. 44 of 11 March.</P>
      <P>At my meeting with Dr. Sein Win on 5 March I had a useful exchange of views on the current position in Burma.  This included a discussion on the internal situation, including the position of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the military offensive by the SLORC against Karen National Union forces.  I briefed Dr. Sein on EU policy on Burma, including the common position on Burma, adopted by the Council of the European Union on 28 October last.  I was also able to brief him on discussions on Burma which had taken place at the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Singapore in February.</P>
      <P>Dr. Sein Win urged the international community to show its displeasure at the SLORC offensive against the Karen National Union and to help the refugees on the Thai border.  I was able to inform him that the EU had issued a declaration on the matter urging the Government of Thailand to apply internationally recognised norms and standards relating to the treatment of refugees and to ensure that all civilians seeking refuge in its territory will be allowed protection and shelter there until the underlying causes for their flight have been removed.</P>

Some travel restrictions have been imposed, as the Deputy will be aware, and sanctions have been discussed.  A majority is not in favour of sanctions at present but this will again be discussed.  A strong determination is shared by all member states that what is happening in Burma is unacceptable to the EU.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps, if any, being taken by the EU to ensure that Turkey complies with the provisions contained in a recent report by the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture, in view of Turkey's membership of the Council of Europe.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union and its member states, including Ireland, have a fundamental interest in developing and strengthening relations with Turkey, a country associated with the EU under the terms of the 1963 Ankara Agreement and with which the EU has entered a customs union.  In seeking to pursue this objective, the European Union has also made clear on many occasions that the observance of the rule of law and the full implementation of basic human freedoms form the basis for the further development of relations between the EU and Turkey.  We fully share this approach.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I refer also to my reply to Question No. 52 of 13 February 1997, in which I set out the policy of Ireland and our EU partners on human rights in Turkey.  As I stated in that reply, human rights in Turkey remain a matter of serious concern.  In the meantime, the Turkish authorities have announced new initiatives to amend criminal legislation to diminish the risk of torture.  The measures include reducing the period of detention and requiring the registration of detainees and the inspection of detention centres. We welcome these initiatives as steps in the right direction within an ongoing process of reform. However, it will be essential that these measures are rigorously implemented and built upon.  We will continue to stress this to the Turkish Government, with the aim of ensuring full respect for and protection of human rights for the citizens of Turkey.</P>
      <P>In my reply to Question No. 52 on 13 February, I also addressed the question of a resolution on Turkey at the annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is now under way in Geneva.  The position remains as outlined in that reply.  Ireland and our European Union partners will avail of the session to highlight our concerns on human rights in Turkey and to impress on the Turkish authorities the need for tangible progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards action within the Council of Europe, the primary mechanism for dealing with human rights abuses is the European Convention on Human Rights, or ECHR, and its control mechanisms, the European Commission and Court of Human Rights.  Article 3 of the convention states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  Turkey is a party to this convention and, accordingly, persons within its jurisdiction may lodge a complaint with the Commission in Strasbourg.  Noting that the ECHR machinery relied on complaints made by the persons allegedly suffering infringements of their human rights, and that this avenue could be denied to persons in custody, the member states of the Council of Europe established the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and <Col N="945" /> Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1987.  Under its provisions, the committee referred to by the Deputy in his question was set up.  The Council of Europe, through this committee and its other monitoring mechanisms, will continue to press for the necessary reforms in human rights in Turkey.</P>

      <P>We welcome any improvement in Turkey's human rights record.  However, is the Minister aware that in 1994 more than 50 cases of disappearances were reported to the UN working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances from Turkey?  In 1995, 35 more disappearances were reported by Amnesty International; in March 1995, 22 people were shot dead by police in political disturbances in Istanbul; and in the same year, there were approximately 100 political killings.</P>
      <P>Police officers and gendarmes commit such violations and remain immune from prosecution under the law relating to prosecution of civil servants which permits local governors to block the prosecution of security force personnel.

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs the action, if any, that is being taken at EU level in view of the eight year Iranian fatwa against Salman Rushdie; and the progress, if any, made in having the fatwa lifted during Ireland's EU Presidency.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7465/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On 13 February, the Dutch Presidency of the European Union issued a declaration on behalf of the EU on the eighth anniversary of the fatwa, which clearly outlined the EU's position on the threat to the life of Mr. Rushdie.  The statement reiterated that the fatwa is in defiance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the principle of the sovereignty of states and is null and void.  The EU renewed its demands that Iran abide by international law and called upon the Iranian authorities to make further efforts to obtain a satisfactory solution in respect of Salman Rushdie.  The statement also regretted the increase in the bounty offered by a private Iranian organisation for Mr. Rushdie's assassination and called on the Iranian Government to take appropriate steps against any initiative that might endanger ongoing efforts to reach a solution.  In its statement the EU stressed that it will continue to take advantage of its critical dialogue with Iran to defend fundamental rights and freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>In the context of Ireland's Presidency of the EU, I met Mr. Rushdie in Dublin on 11 December.  Mr. Rushdie outlined his concerns about the continuing threat to his life posed by the fatwa and I briefed Mr. Rushdie on the efforts made by the Irish Presidency, following on those of the previous three presidencies, to arrive at a satisfactory resolution with the Iranian Government. I also stressed to Mr. Rushdie the EU's firm commitment to the pursuit of a resolution of this issue through negotiations with Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency we availed of a number of opportunities to raise the issue with <Col N="948" /> Iran, for example, during the critical dialogue session which took place in Dublin on 29 November. This provided an opportunity for us to put the EU's view to the Iranian side in a full and frank way.  The Government also regularly raises the issue in bilateral contacts with the Iranian authorities, such as the visit of the Deputy Speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Mr. Rohani, to Dublin in November last.  The Irish Presidency took the opportunity to raise the question of the fatwa against Mr. Rushdie in the speech which it delivered on behalf of the EU to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in New York in November.  In the speech, we repeated our condemnation of the fatwa and affirmed that it is a blatant breach of international law.  We underlined that the EU would continue its efforts to obtain firm and incontrovertible assurances from the Government of Iran that the life of Mr. Rushdie would not be endangered under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>While some progress was made in bringing about a resolution of the threat to the life of Mr. Rushdie during the Irish Presidency and Iran now understands the EU's position better, talks with Iran have not reached the stage where we could claim that there has been a breakthrough.  The EU will continue to use the critical dialogue with Iran in order to defend fundamental rights and freedom of expression, including the issue of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie.</P>

Progress will not be made until the Iranian Government accepts its responsibility to ensure the fatwa against Mr. Rushdie is lifted.</P>

      <QRef>[6666/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Ulster Unionist Party paper, Pathways to Peace Within the Union, published on 4 March, as I do all contributions to political debate in and about Northern Ireland.  The paper does not purport to be a comprehensive statement of UUP policy, nor does it pretend to offer a final resolution to the current problems.  Rather, it claims to present &ldquo;an interim set of common sense proposals&rdquo; which it sees as &ldquo;complementary to the Talks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That said, most, if not all, the issues raised have been identified as matters to be dealt with in the comprehensive, three-stranded, multi-party negotiations and I am firmly of the view, given the need for a balanced accommodation between differing interests and objectives, that progress on matters of concern to any individual party is most likely to be achieved within the existing framework of those negotiations.  Nevertheless, while many of the UUP proposals are in the first instance primarily for the Northern Ireland parties themselves to consider, I would be happy to discuss any or all of these proposals with the UUP to see whether they could help achieve the progress in the negotiations required to bring about a comprehensive agreement.  I would be particularly interested in an exchange of views on what the paper refers to as &ldquo;how matters of mutual interest and benefit can be discussed or pursued with appropriate representatives...of the <Col N="950" /> Republic of Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;how we can address the void of misunderstanding that presently exists between politicians in Northern Ireland and those in the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;.  Curiously, the paper seems to envisage discussion on North-South co-operation with the British Government but not with the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>One particular point of concern about the paper is the assertion in the opening section that the UUP &ldquo;will not allow themselves to be drawn into a position which provides for the arrival at the table of Sinn Féin&rdquo;.  At face value, this would appear to deny the possibility of inclusive negotiations, even after an unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire and Sinn Féin's compliance with the requirements for entry to the negotiations set out in the Ground Rules and enshrined in British law.  I consider it inconceivable that any party refusing to participate in the multi-party negotiations alongside all parties which have met the legal requirements for participation would have the remotest possibility of persuading the Governments and the other political parties to join them in working to their alternative agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the publication of this paper on the day before the cessation of the nine months of talks was not very helpful in the sense that it was known that the talks were coming to an end and would not resume for several months?  On what date does the Minister anticipate these talks will resume and does he believe they are likely to be more successful than they were?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the timing of the publication of the paper, it may well be that the UUP was working on this paper for some time.  Deputy O'Malley will be familiar with a similar paper published in 1992.  Whenever views are put forward in a policy document or in statement form we must take them on board for critical assessment.  Very little of what is contained in the paper is new.  The prospect of the UUP discussing North-South trade with the British Government but not with the Irish Government, which has a major role in this area, is baffling.  The date fixed for the reopening of the negotiations is 3 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of whether the resumed talks offer a prospect for progress, the talks are slow, difficult and tortuous at times.  As someone who likes to get things done and enjoys working 24 hours a day if things need to be done, I find the talks an extremely frustrating experience. However, if we are to make progress in finding a resolution to the difficulties in Northern Ireland this can only be done by an inclusive three-stranded talks process.  To put this in context, we are trying to find a resolution to a conflict which has bedevilled this island and which politicians in recent years and in the distant past have failed to resolve.  The Deputy has much experience in this area and he knows it will take a long time to <Col N="951" /> resolve this conflict.  However, we must provide whatever time is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The sincerity of the Ulster Unionist Party can be judged by the publication of this document on the eve of the adjournment of the talks.  There was a similar incident in 1992 when the Ulster Unionist Party submitted a document at the end of those talks.  The contents of this document and the sincerity of the Ulster Unionist Party give rise to questions.</P>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that these talks went nowhere and that we need all inclusive talks which include Sinn Féin after the declaration of a permanent and unequivocal cessation of violence? These all-inclusive talks should move forward on the basis of the three-stranded formula devised in 1991.  The intransigence of the Unionist parties is as much a barrier to progress as the continuing violence, murder, beatings and expulsion of people from the North by the IRA and the loyalist groupings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy managed to fire four salvos against the Unionist parties.  Ironically, just as we question their sincerity in the talks process they question ours.  This is apparent.  I do not agree that the talks went nowhere.  The talks are certainly going somewhere but they will take a long time.  Part of the difficulty is the accumulation of distrust and fear.  The Unionist community has fears about the ambitions and policies of Nationalist parties on this island.  It will take a long time to establish bona fides across the table about the political motivation of what we want to achieve.  The three-stranded process is the only show in town in terms of the talks.  The conditions and terms for participants are well laid out and these have the overwhelming support of the Members of this House.  It must be dawning on Sinn Féin and the IRA that the continuation of violence and the threat of violence are the biggest inhibiting factors to making progress on this island.</P>

We have consistently expressed our serious concern to the Nigerian authorities about human rights violations in their country both bilaterally and with our European partners.  The Government strongly supported the restrictive measures against Nigeria adopted by the EU in its Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995.  In addition, we have fully supported the subsequent retention of the Common Position measures, which were extended during the Irish Presidency for a further six months until 4 June next.  Our continuing concerns about the human rights situation in Ogoniland and throughout Nigeria have been heightened by the charges of treason brought last week by the Nigerian authorities against Nobel prize winning author, Wole Soyinka, and 14 others.  We are pursuing these concerns at the current session of the Commission on Human Rights which began in Geneva last week.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council which I chaired last July, it was agreed that the Union would continue to identify and examine further measures that could be taken against Nigeria and to keep developments in the country under close review in consultation with other interested countries and bodies.  We have been actively engaged with the EU and other interested parties in this ongoing process of consultation and close review both as Presidency and now as a member of the Troika.  In this context, the imposition of an oil embargo is one of the options which Ireland and a number of our partners would support.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work, both bilaterally and with our European partners, for the early restoration of democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the Minister's views on the imposition of an oil embargo and I would like to know the EU view on this matter.  What efforts have been made to assist the supporters of Ken Saro-Wiwa who are still in detention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I outlined to the Deputy on two or three previous occasions, Ireland and a number of EU partners favour an oil embargo.  For an oil embargo to be effective, however, it would need to have global support.  A unilateral EU oil embargo would not have a great impact as it would not include the major markets for Nigerian oil.  We support the European Union consultations with other states on such an embargo.</P>
      <P>In relation to the detention of supporters of Ken Saro-Wiwa, we have made numerous complaints to the Nigerian authorities, and will continue to do so, because the sooner the Nigerian government realises it is being isolated from the world because of its lack of human rights and lack of respect for democratic government, the better for everybody.  We will keep pressure on the Nigerian government, as we have done for a number of years.</P>

      <P>As a person who worked in Nigeria for a year, I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that the public is hearing the full extent of what is happening in Nigeria.  Will he inform the House of any future delegations that may travel to Nigeria on an information gathering basis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a United Nations fact finding mission to Nigeria.  We have constant reports from our Ambassador in Lagos.  The Ambassador has regular meetings with the missionary community in Nigeria which would be a reliable source of information.  I had the opportunity of meeting members of the family of Ken Saro-Wiwa when they visited Ireland and got first hand testimony of some of the difficulties and atrocities.  We are probably getting the information that is available, which by and large is reliable, through the United Nations and other international organisations.  I am not currently aware of plans for future visits but I will communicate with the Deputy in view of her own experience.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the behaviour of the Nigerian government.  Is the EU taking action in relation to the activities of Shell, which has been funding the operations of the Nigerian administration in Ogoniland?  It is also alleged that Shell is funding the purchase of arms for the Nigerian administration and generals operating outside Nigeria.  The activities of Shell in Nigeria leave a lot to be desired and should be condemned unreservedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government supports the view that multinationals such as Shell should carefully consider the human rights aspects of any business operations.  There is also an onus on the Nigerian government and the state partners to do likewise. We made our view very clear in relation to that. I am not aware of any proposed action in relation to Shell.  I am aware of a number of allegations regarding the supply of arms to the security forces in Nigeria.  We are consulting with our EU partners <Col N="954" /> on this issue and will, in the light of any additional information, take appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 19, 25, 35 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I discussed the prospects for this year's marching season and ways in which the potential for a repetition of the events of last summer could be averted with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 12 March last.  As I made clear in my remarks after the conference, both Governments are anxious to ensure that everything possible should be done to defuse the situation and are convinced that this should be done through dialogue and reasonable compromise.</P>
      <P>I have had meetings recently with representatives of the communities and residents' groups most directly concerned with the parades issue. For example, I met with a delegation of representatives from a number of residents' groups on 26 February last.  We discussed their views on the North Report and on the prospects for this year's marching season.  I also took the opportunity to commend and encourage the commitment of residents' groups to pursue every available opportunity for dialogue and local accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government made clear on this, as on many other occasions, its belief that local dialogue and agreement, based on mutual respect and accommodation, is the best way to resolve contentions arising from parades.  It is the Government's earnest hope that local agreement <Col N="955" /> and accommodation will yet emerge as factors which both ease tensions and point the way towards a peaceful resolution of the parades issue.</P>
    <P>The Government's position on this fully accords with the views of the overwhelming majority of both communities in Northern Ireland.  According to the public attitude surveys carried out as part of the consultations undertaken by the North Review, 97 per cent of Catholics and 83 per cent of Protestants agree that negotiated accommodation should be sought in disputes between residents and marchers.</P>
    <P>These views should serve as the guiding lights in the response of all those in positions of responsibility and leadership on how to handle disagreements between parade organisers and residents.  While there are disturbing signs of confrontation, there are also some encouraging signs that those most directly involved in the parades issue, including in the Orange Order, are heeding the views of the people in Northern Ireland and are seeking to defuse the tensions likely to lead to confrontation this summer.  Individuals and groups are engaging in the difficult and complex process of dialogue and mediation.  They deserve support and encouragement by all those in a position to offer it.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to dialogue and agreement is reflected in its support for the core recommendation of the report of the North Review of Parades, the establishment of an independent body to mediate, arbitrate and, if necessary, issue determinations on contentious parades. I have made clear on a number of occasions our disappointment with the British Government's decision to proceed, for the moment, with only the non-adjudicatory aspects of the report. We have repeatedly pressed the British Government to establish without delay the independent parades commission as recommended by the North Review.</P>
    <P>This was reflected in the communiqué issued at the close of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 12 March, which makes clear that the Irish Government urged immediate implementation of the report's recommendations, in particular the powers of determination proposed for the parades commission.</P>
    <P>The potential of the parades issue to destabilise the situation means that responsibilities on this issue go beyond the necessary dialogue we wish to see between marching organisations and residents associations.  Northern Ireland remains a divided society.  In the absence of a political settlement, responsibility rests with the British authorities.  The authorities need to take all appropriate steps to ensure the pre-eminence of the rule of law in the months that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>The ongoing protests at Harryville are an affront to all decent people.  Their toleration by the authorities appears to be a calculation that it is the lesser of two evils, yet it is appalling that the community's right to attend Mass in their parish <Col N="956" /> church can only be exercised by running a gauntlet of abuse, menace and violence.</P>
    <P>What is normally the first march of the season is due to take place at Easter on the Lower Ormeau Road.  The violence which marred that event last year was seen as a portent of things to come, and so it proved, but it was not inevitably so.  Time to reach agreements is certainly becoming a diminishing resource.  It must be used as productively as possible by all those concerned to avoid another summer of conflict and confrontation and the consequences which threaten to flow from that.</P>
    <P>I hope those who have the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland at heart will prevail and that the wishes of the vast majority are realised by a summer in which local agreements on contentious parades are brokered, determinations in the absence of such agreement are issued and respected and, above all, the rule of law emerges as the anchor on which peace and stability rests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all share the view that the way forward is through dialogue and reasonable compromise.  Will the Minister gauge the sincerity of the public attitude surveys against the decision made last night by the Orange Order in a case where there had been dialogue and reasonable compromise?  Does that augur well for the 1997 marching season?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The public attitude surveys speak for themselves.  The overwhelming body of opinion in Northern Ireland is in favour of mediation and compromise, at local level if possible. The decision announced last night is regrettable. One was feeling relatively optimistic that agreement could be reached on the ground.  I would not give up hope that that can be achieved in the time remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Dialogue with the communities is the way forward, and the Minister has met the communities, as have those of us on this side of the House.  We want the Orange Order to enter into dialogue with the local communities. Approximately 3,000 parades are held each year, only 20 or 25 of which are a source of conflict. One of those is the one that was discussed last night and, apparently, it will now become a source of conflict.  Regarding Drumcree, it has become a matter of principle for the Orange Order that they parade and are seen to dominate the Nationalist community within the town of Portadown.  Will the Minister again encourage the British Government to bring forward the independent commission in order that the problems at Drumcree will not be repeated, because it will be a recipe for disaster for this whole island if there is a third incident in Drumcree?  Portadown has parades every weekend through the marching season.  The parade at Drumcree is merely a blatant assertion of supremacy.  I ask that action be taken to ensure there is compromise.  Nobody is <Col N="957" /> against the Orangemen parading, but let them parade on an agreed route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is general agreement on the necessity for compromise.  What is unacceptable is the process whereby one community apparently wishes to exercise dominance over the minority community.  We have expressed our regret and disappointment to the British Government that it did not set about implementing the North report as a matter of urgency.  It has set up a consultative process.  I can only hope that after the election the incoming Government will take it upon itself to implement the report's recommendations as a matter of urgency, because time will be of the essence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  We have emphasised time and again that it is not in the interests of either community or of community relations in Northern Ireland to have a repeat of what happened last summer.  Anybody who witnessed what happened last summer will be well aware of how close Northern Ireland was to the edge of the abyss. People should learn from what happened last summer.  That will require compromise and leadership, and I hope the leadership of political parties in Northern Ireland will play a constructive role this summer rather than the destructive one they played last summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has rightly expressed disappointment at the Orange Order's intervention in regard to a local march, but what dialogue or engagement are the Minister or the Taoiseach having with the Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, or with Sir Patrick Mayhew on this matter?  Is there not a danger because of the pending election in May and the reality that John Major and his party will be campaigning, that the situation will drift?  We on this side of the House are concerned that the Irish Government is not being proactive on a daily basis in ensuring that trouble does not arise.  If it is allowed to drift there is clearly grave potential for danger for everybody concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see us allowing the situation to drift.  The matter of parades was discussed in detail at our meeting in Iveagh House last Wednesday.  The Taoiseach had discussions with the Prime Minister last week and this was very much part of the agenda.  We have the machinery of the Anglo-Irish Conference at which to raise this matter constantly.  Despite the fact that, as of yesterday, there was an announcement of an election in the UK, Government responsibility remains with the Government and it has to take heed of the risks that are evident in Northern Ireland in relation to the forthcoming Easter Monday parade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the matter of parades was the subject of discussion <Col N="958" /> between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister.  It was the subject of discussion between himself and Sir Patrick Mayhew at last week's meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  Will the Minister give me one example of a concrete step that has been taken arising from those discussions that will make an impact on the streets in the months ahead?  There is talk, talk, talk.  What we want is action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have availed of the opportunities afforded by the discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and by the Anglo-Irish Conference to outline our views, and I believe there is at least a far better understanding by the British Government, the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister of the risks involved, the urgency and the necessity for the British Government, irrespective of the fact that an election will take place on 1 May, to ensure that everything is done to avoid a recurrence of what happened last year in Northern Ireland. Ultimately the responsibility rests with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the Minister and express my regret at the decision of the Orange Order, specifically the Orange Lodge in Dromore to reverse its original decision to have a compromise. Would the Minister agree it is encouraging that such a sizeable element of Orangemen wanted to compromise?  Is that not an improvement on the situation in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an improvement.  I am not sure whether the Deputy was here when I outlined the survey figures on the public attitude in Northern Ireland to parades, but it reflects that the vast majority of people on both sides of the divide, 97 per cent of Catholics and 83 per cent of Protestants, are in agreement that a negotiated accommodation should be sought in disputes between residents and marchers.  I welcome the fact that many of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland want to see an accommodation arrived at and to avoid the disruption to civil society that took place last summer.  There is a huge responsibility on political leaders in Northern Ireland to help and not to add fuel to the fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>To come back to the discussions between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and between the Minister and his opposite number, Sir Patrick Mayhew, at the Anglo-Irish Conference, I asked if even one concrete step had been taken on securing peace during this marching season.  The Minister tells me <Col N="959" /> that, as a result of those discussions, there is a greater understanding on the British side of the danger of another marching season like last year's.  After last year, when 6,000 plastic bullets, etc., were fired on one weekend, surely it did not take discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister and between the Minister and Sir Patrick Mayhew for the British Government to come to an understanding of the danger.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the best he and the Taoiseach have achieved is to get the British Government to be aware that there is a problem when Orange marches are not allowed through Catholic areas that results in the burnings, mayhem and blocking off of streets by Orangemen in Northern Ireland that we saw last year?  Is he seriously suggesting that is all that has been achieved?  It is evidence of the British Government's recognition of the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Minister that it refuses to implement the recommendation of the North Commission to establish an independent commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>From his experience of Anglo-Irish relations, the Deputy will be aware that there are two sovereign Governments dealing with one another.  We can make proposals within the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but a decision has to be made.  We have voiced our strong views that the North Commission report should be implemented without further delay.  The Deputy is aware of the decision that was taken by the British Government to set up a consultative process.  We felt that the consultative process was over and that it would be in the interests of both Governments and communities in Northern Ireland that the British Government should immediately set about implementing the North report recommendations on parades.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 43 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my statement in the House on 26 February 1997 in the Adjournment Debate which gave a full account of my action in the case of Róisín McAliskey to that date.  Since that date, on my instructions the Irish Embassy in London has continued to monitor closely Ms McAliskey's circumstances.  The Embassy has been in continuous contact with British officials to follow up on the humanitarian concerns I expressed to the British Ambassador on 19 February 1997.  Ms McAliskey was visited again yesterday by an Embassy official and she has now received five consular visits of this kind. The Embassy has also been active in facilitating visits by Members of this House and other public representatives.  An Embassy official attended the hearing in Bow Street magistrate's court on 12 March 1997 when Ms McAliskey was further remanded to 9 April 1997.</P>
      <P>On 7 March 1997 the British Embassy advised my Department that Ms McAliskey's security classification was being revised downwards from category A high risk to category A standard risk and this would facilitate a more flexible approach by the Governor of Holloway Prison, particularly in terms of her access to various facilities in the prison.</P>
      <P>I raised Ms McAliskey's case with the Secretary of State, Mr. Patrick Mayhew at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference which was held in Dublin on 12 March 1997.  I strongly reiterated the widespread humanitarian concern about her treatment and that of her unborn child.  I urged that she should be allowed to keep her baby after the birth and that the British authorities should make clear there was no question of her being shackled before, during or after it.  The Secretary of State made clear at his subsequent press conference that Ms McAliskey will not be restrained either during her journey to and from hospital for the birth or during her stay there.  I welcome the decision announced the day after the conference meeting that Ms McAliskey will be allowed to keep her baby after birth and to use the mother and child unit at Holloway Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that a further application for bail by Ms McAliskey was denied by the High Court in London on 14 March 1997.  The Irish Embassy in London remains in close contact with the British authorities on all aspects of her <Col N="961" /> care and she will be visited again on my instructions very shortly.</P>
    <P>From contact we have had at senior official level with German officials with a view to clarifying the position of the German authorities regarding the question of bail for Ms McAliskey, I understand the German authorities have now made clear again to the British Crown Prosecution Service that the German request of 17 December 1996 for Ms McAliskey to be detained pending extradition to Germany stands.  The German authorities have also stated their view that the enforcement of this request is a matter for the British courts which must decide on bail applications.</P>
    <P>I have emphasised before that the Government's concern in this case is a humanitarian one. Ms McAliskey's treatment while she is in custody pending a decision on the German extradition application is a matter for the British authorities and I have pursued our concern vigorously with them.  The improvements in her treatment which have recently been announced are to be welcomed, but I assure the Deputies we will continue to monitor closely all developments in this case.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree there are two separate grounds on which this lady could not be extradited from this jurisdiction if she had been arrested here: first, there is no extradition to Germany in respect of one's own citizens and, second, our law does not permit the extradition of a person for questioning?  Will he confirm this lady has not been charged with an offence, that she is only wanted for questioning in Germany to see whether evidence may be obtained in the future, and that this is unsatisfactory use of the extradition procedure, which was not envisaged in this country or in the extradition procedures of a number of other countries?</P>

      <P>Most Deputies are aware the extradition of a person to another jurisdiction with which we do not have reciprocal extradition arrangements and which does not permit the extradition of its own nationals is prohibited, and that is the position as the Deputy describes where the extradition of an Irish citizen to Germany is sought.  I am not absolutely familiar with the German constitutional provisions in this regard.  My understanding is that in the UK the German authorities will be required to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case in this instance, but that has not been done to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct that no charges have been laid.  I have questioned the delays in this matter but I have not received satisfactory answers.  The German authorities have reaffirmed to the British Crown Prosecution Service <Col N="962" /> that their request of 17 December for Ms McAliskey to be detained pending extradition to Germany stands.  They also stated their view that the enforcement of this request is a matter for the British courts which must decide on bail applications. On further questioning I was told the German authorities would have to provide information to the British court, upon which the extradition application will be founded.</P>

I put down my question in good faith to the Taoiseach and his office contacted me directly to say he could not answer me but that the question would be directed to the Minister for reply. The Minister now tells me that he cannot answer the question because he did not meet the German Chancellor.  Did the Taoiseach discuss with the German Chancellor the issue of Róisín McAliskey? Was there Government intervention on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>I am aware of much of the discussion that took place at the meeting, but I am not sure if the Taoiseach had what I would describe as a bilateral discussion with Chancellor Kohl on that occasion.

I regard that as highly unsatisfactory. Does the Minister know precisely who is responsible for insisting on Miss McAliskey's continued detention?

      <P>This will be the third time for me to reply to this question.  Having sought further information, I understand the German authorities have made it clear again to the British Crown prosecution service that the German request of 17 December 1996 for Miss McAliskey to be detained pending extradition to Germany stands. There was some uncertainty about this matter when we discussed this case on an Adjournment debate.  Given the humanitarian circumstances, I personally believe she should be given bail. While I accept these are matters for the UK courts, we have stated on many occasions that she should receive bail on humanitarian grounds.</P>

      <P>Following the discussion on this matter on the Adjournment I sought further information on the position of the German Government and on the procedures in Germany for grounding an extradition application between Germany and the United Kingdom.  The information I received stated that the German authorities have not compiled the information on which to make the application.  I told them the delay was unacceptable.  I was also informed that if the extradition is granted it will probably be appealed to a number of courts which would take a considerable amount of time.  I am still seeking further information on the actual basis on which the German authorities will ground an application for bail, but it is probably not yet available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Question Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's position with regard to humanitarian aspects of the treatment of Irish prisoners in Britain is widely known and has been stated by me on many occasions in this House and elsewhere.  I have raised these issues at political level through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and at other ministerial meetings, and our views have also been conveyed to the British authorities through the Irish Embassy in London.  In all our representations, we have consistently emphasised the need for prisoners to be treated in a sensitive and humane manner.  We have expressed particular concern to the British authorities about the impact on the health and mental welfare of prisoners held under the very restrictive regime operating in special secure units at Belmarsh and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> On my instructions, several consular visits have been made to the prisoners by officials of the Embassy in London in the past year or so.  The most recent visits to the prisoners, to which the Deputy referred, were made over the period 18 to 20 November 1996 and I have directed that further visits should be made in the very near future.  The fullest use of all the available consular facilities is the most useful and appropriate way to follow up on the political representations which I and other Government colleagues make to our opposite numbers at senior political level.</P>
    <P>I am of course aware of Deputy Deasy's efforts to encourage a visit by a Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to the prisoners in Britain.  I have instructed our Permanent Representative to the Council of Europe to monitor this matter and she will respond to any request for information or assistance received in this context.</P>
    <P>I am also aware of Rules 43 and 64 contained in Council of Europe Recommendation No. R(87)3. These rules govern contact with the outside world and treatment objectives and regimes.  Our representations on prisoner issues have been in line with the spirit of these rules.  In particular, the Government has consistently taken the view that these prisoners should be permitted open visits, especially for family members and consultations with legal representatives.  Those opinions have been conveyed to the British authorities on many occasions.</P>
    <P>On my instructions, further representations about this issue have been made on an ongoing basis by the Irish Embassy in London.  In response, the British prison service has advised that from now on it will use its discretion in granting open visits to exceptional risk prisoners where it is satisfied there are large numbers of documents to be seen and discussed by a prisoner and his or her legal advisor.  A considerable number of remand prisoners at Belmarsh are reported to have recently benefited from this relaxation of the closed visits rule.</P>
    <P>While this is a welcome development, we will continue to persue prison issues, including the question of visiting arrangements for prisoners' family members, in the period ahead.  The conditions of Irish prisoners in Britain will continue to be closely monitored by my Department and by the Embassy in London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not be afraid to say that the treatment of Irish prisoners, whether by the courts, the police, the prison system or the establishment in Britain, is racist.  We should demand that action be taken at the highest level to stop this treatment.  It appears to be politically popular in Britain to mistreat Irish people, particularly prisoners.  That is an appalling state of affairs. What more can we do about this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On purely humanitarian grounds, the case for the improvement of prisoners' conditions, particularly those detained in secure <Col N="966" /> units, is pressing and imperative.  Some improvements have been made, but the position is not satisfactory.  We will continue to make representations to ensure prisoners are treated in a humane and acceptable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be politically fashionable to abuse Irish prisoners in British jails.  This is obvious from the British Minister's comments about Róisín McAliskey to one of his constituents, which merely confirmed the Home Secretary's attitude on Irish prisoners.  Does the Minister agree the treatment of Irish prisoners in British jails is crucial to the restoration of an unequivocal ceasefire?  Will he convey this message once again to the British Government?  Did he raise Danny McNamee's case with Sir Patrick Mayhew at the recent Anglo-Irish Conference meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Prisoners certainly have an influence on those who have the power to restore the ceasefire and that must be taken into account at all times.  We will continue to seek proper and humane conditions for prisoners, irrespective of where they are detained.  The McNamee case was raised with the British on many occasions and the Secretary of State and I discussed it last week and on many other occasions.  It is probably the case which is most often brought to my attention by Members of this House and many people outside the House.  We will continue to press that justice is done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;The recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in relation to a common basic payment or minimally adequate payment shall be reviewed in the context of the projected growth in the economy, and the Minister will consider whether the payments are adequate for the needs of pensioners and he shall place a report on this matter on the table of Dáil Éireann within 6 months.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to this amendment in the context of an earlier amendment in <Col N="968" /> relation to the updated 1986 report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  It is time to examine the adequacy of these payments for the present day.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the position of pensioners.  The Minister of State said earlier that the old age contributory pension is already greater than the rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986.  When it comes to discussing these matters at Cabinet, the fact that the old age contributory pension is 113 per cent of the main recommended rate is obviously given as a reason for describing the rate as adequate.  It is not adequate but just 113 per cent of the updated 1986 figure.  In view of the wealth of the country and projected economic growth, we need to look at the adequacy of these arrangements.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the Government is proposing that Civil Service pensioners should not benefit from agreed productivity related pay increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cause of concern to the groups representing these pensioners and must be addressed in conjunction with the concerns of social security pensioners.  Adherence to the Maastricht criteria should ensure low interest and inflation rates and considerable economic growth across the EU.  These factors must be considered when providing for increases for pensioners.  It will not be adequate to work solely on the basis of the consumer price index and will be necessary to adhere to a formula which gives true and fair recognition to the growth and development of the economy by ensuring that pensions not only keep pace with inflation or the 1985 levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare but will reflect the increasing wealth of the country.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from public service pensioners who are rightly concerned that they will not benefit from productivity related pay agreements.  Because of this and the other reasons I have outlined, the amendment calls on the Minister to place a report before the House which will consider the adequacy of payments with regard to current developments and with a view to ensuring that future increases will not be tied to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  For example, while measures may already have been taken to meet some of the special needs of old age pensioners, the growing wealth of the economy will enable us to meet more of them.</P>
      <P>Funded pension schemes depend on economic growth while unfunded schemes depend on theories applied to increases in payments.  A report on social security pensions is therefore needed and because of the complexity of the matter, the amendment gives the Minister six months to present it to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already prepared such a report.  Debate on the Bill enables us to consider aspects of social welfare law in detail.</P>
      <P>The ESRI was commissioned to review the minimum adequate payment rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, thereby fulfilling the commitment contained in the programme, A Government of Renewal.  The ensuing report, entitled <i>A Review of the Commission on Social Welfare's Minimum Adequate Income</i> was published in December 1996.  This report, and the ESRI report entitled <i>Poverty in the 1990s,</i> form part of substantial research being undertaken by the ESRI and sponsored by the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.  It will be further discussed as part of the national anti-poverty strategy.  These studies and other key reports, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare and the Department's social insurance discussion document, will contribute to informing public debate on the issue of poverty and the funding of the social welfare system while also providing a basis for assessing the adequacy of the current rates of social welfare entitlements and the standard of living of social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended a priority rate of £45 per week and a main rate of £50 to £60 per week in 1985 terms, or, using the consumer price index, £61.30 or £68.10 &mdash; depending on which scale is used &mdash; to £81.70 in 1996 terms.  Using the approach by the Commission on Social Welfare, the ESRI updated the main rates to a range of £68 to £96 per week.  This is interesting in that it recognises the need to improve rates in line with improvements in the economy, while it also recognises the extent to which we have already reached and exceeded the guidelines laid down by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The review undertaken by the ESRI was timely and correctly recognises the points raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In assessing adequacy of payments, other forms of assistance available in the form of additional cash and non-cash payments were also taken into account.  The most important appeared to be entitlement to a medical card, assistance with heating and energy costs and housing subsidies. Administrative studies show that extra benefits could add up to 25 per cent to the value of the basic cash support.</P>
      <P>On the question of the adequacy and updating of the social welfare rates, the ESRI points out:</P>
      <P>The manner in which the rates recommended by the CSW have tended to be employed in uprating &mdash; as a target which moves upwards over time only in line with prices is clearly inconsistent with the Commission's underlying approach to adequacy.  If adequacy is to be assessed against the standards of the society in question, the target will move up over time as general living standards in the community rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> However, many questions remain to be tackled as to the nature of that relationship and how it is best incorporated into the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>However, progress can still be made towards a more explicit process of evaluating adequacy in uprating using data currently available. Changes in consumer prices, in average take home pay and in average income per head provide three indicators to which specific reference could be made in assessing how an adequacy standard was changing over time.  Using these indicators in the way suggested in the EU's Minimum Income Recommendation, to regularly and publicly review changes in what would constitute an adequate income in the Irish setting would be a major step forward, and would in itself highlight the need for more comprehensive information.</P>
    <P>I agree with such a review process which will be considered further as part of the national anti-poverty strategy.  I point out that the adequacy of the old age pension provision, both social welfare and occupational, is specifically being addressed as part of the national pensions policy initiative and a consultation document on pensions issues was issued recently as part of this process by the Department and the Pensions Board.  The adequacy of pensions, social welfare and otherwise, is a matter that rightly engages the Department on a regular basis.  That is the position in many other European countries and must continue to be the case.  The experience we can glean from what has happened in other jurisdictions will be put to beneficial use at an early stage in terms of planning for the future while recognising the needs of our society as it envolves and the financial constraints within which we, as well as other European countries, must operate.</P>
    <P>The points raised by Deputy Woods in his amendment are essentially covered in the ESRI report.  The Government anticipated the need to move in that general direction, which it has done.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State does not want to bring forward the type of report I mentioned, yet having listened to what he said it is evident that such a report would be valuable and helpful to Members.  He mentioned the ESRI report, the Combat Poverty Agency report, the report on the integration of tax and social welfare and others.  If we want to consider the issue of adequacy on its own, the Minister of State must do what he said he would do in his reply.  He drew information from different reports that relate to income adequacy.  All I am asking is that he arrange for the preparation of a report over six months which relates to this issue.  Such a report, which need not be much longer than the note he read in reply to my amendment, would set out the issues involved for the information of Members.  If we are to adopt an open approach based on freedom of information, which is the subject of a Bill before the House, we should do <Col N="971" /> so in a professional way.  We should change the way we do things.  I mentioned the report on child benefit prepared in three months or thereabouts which very much relates to issues that arise in debates in the House and contains information on the issues involved.  Such reports provide Members with the necessary information to make decisions.  Often they recommend the direction that should be taken.  What is wrong in preparing such reports?  Why can the work of the House not be based on good research information?  I do not want to draw comparisons with other countries because I would like to think we would take a more researched based approach to the issues that concern us and subsequently would present the information to Members in a readily usable form.  As the Minister does not support my proposal, I have no alternative but to press my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall prepare a report on the position of self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then 56 or over, including their eligibility for a pro-rata rate of old age contributory pension, and he shall place this report on the table of Dáil Éireann within six months.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is another of the key underlying issues that need to be addressed.  There is no point in adopting a facile approach by asking why this was not addressed in the first instance.  We know why it was not.  The actuaries and finance people estimated it would cost in the order of £757 million or £787 million to do that at the time.  Regardless of whether one agreed with that estimate or claimed it should have been £600 million, there is no denying it is a very sizeable amount.  We did not know how many of the self-employed would come forward and participate in the scheme and what would happen in respect of the fund, but we know about that now.  We know that the contributions have contributed a great deal of money to the fund in the interim and there does not seem to be any doubt that we could go further in respect of the scheme at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from replies to parliamentary questions that the self-employed have contributed £587 million to the social insurance fund to date. The drawdown from that fund would be relatively small at this stage and for some time to come.  It will be some years before it matches the annual income into the fund which is in the order of £92 million or £93 million.  As the flow of money into the fund has been substantial and the scheme is well established and successful, we should give serious consideration as to whether people over <Col N="972" /> the age of 66 &mdash; even taking the group aged 56 to 60 &mdash; could be included on a <i>pro rata</i> basis. The Minister will say that a move in <i>pro rata</i> pensions could bring in some people with previous contributions.  However, people without previous contributions would be below the average because they would not make that figure.  This was their problem in the first place and why they were not included.  Will the Minister consider having the various elements of this issue examined and brought together in a report?</P>
    <P>Members need to know about these issues to deal with forthcoming legislation in this area. Members are being questioned about these matters and cannot deal with them satisfactorily if they do not have the facts.  Will the Minister bring forward a report on this issue to ensure Members will know where they stand when the Estimates are being prepared for the next budget in the autumn? Many people who were not previously entitled to be involved in the social security system for pensions depend on us in relation to the Bill.  If a death occurs, the widow's or widower's pension comes into operation.  That is of benefit but many people do not qualify for the old age pension.  The Minister is aware of this issue which should be reconsidered given our knowledge now in relation to the income, its regularity, the growth in that regard and the demands which might be anticipated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment relates to an item which has engaged the attention of Members and others who have been directly affected for some time.  I will not be facile, as the Deputy suggested, and refer to the fact that he did not foresee the dangers which existed when he introduced the Bill in 1988.  However, they were foreseen.  I recall advising people about the limitations, given the trends which were developing and the fact that many people at that time did not qualify for a contributory old age pension under the 1960 Act.</P>
      <P>I pointed out the anomaly in that regard and said the 1988 Act was built on almost the same basis as the previous Act and coincided in terms of anomalies with it.  I considered it required further review and refurbishment.  That happened this year and the Minister has correctly extended pensions to people who were outside the 1988 Act despite having several years of contributions. Many people who made contributions pre 1953, which gave them a greater average number of contributions, did not receive pensions, although others did.  The period during which they started work post 1953 and the period they finished work brought their average up.  As long as that anomaly remained, bigger anomalies developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same position applies to the self-employed. Many people correctly foresaw the institution of the Act as progressive, worthwhile and beneficial in terms of making long-term provisions. However, others foresaw that a considerable number of people over the age of 56 at that time would not benefit because they would not have the necessary ten years' contributions and would <Col N="973" /> feel aggrieved as a result.  The Deputy mentioned the entitlements of widows and orphans but they are covered in any event.  He is aware that provision is being made for refunds of the pension element of their contributions.</P>
    <P>This issue must be addressed in the near future. Since the principle has been established over many years, the tendency is to move in that general direction.  Depending on the number of contributions, people will receive a corresponding return in terms of pension payments.  There is no proposal in that regard this year.  I am not certain the production of a report would be of benefit because everybody knows what it entails and where the anomalies arise.  It involves addressing it to the greatest extent possible in a particular year and hoping to move it forward in subsequent years.</P>
    <P>When I was in Opposition I recall asking about the extension of entitlements in relation to the self-employed and those with less than an average of 20 who did not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  I recall that figures up £800 million a year were trotted out in reply and that I disbelieved them at the time.  It is easy and usual to disbelieve matters when one is in Opposition but it happens.  I am glad that the Minister and I &mdash; and I am sure the Opposition &mdash; are in agreement with the thrust of the actions taken this year, such as the improvements for people who previously did not qualify for a pension although they had a considerable number of contributions.  The problem referred to in the Deputy's amendment has also been specifically addressed in that the pension element of contributions is being refunded to those who do not and will not qualify for a non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>What is likely to happen in future will not be influenced to a great extent by the production of a report because it has all been read and said. With the evolution of the system, that issue will be addressed at some point in the future in the same way as the issue of <i>pro rata</i> pensions for those who did not qualify heretofore has been addressed this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Minister of State to the extent that the report would be helpful and timely.  He recognises the different elements but the facts of the current position must be brought together because we know so much more about it now and it is possible to quantify it.  The Minister says refunds of pension elements are currently being effected.  This concerns me because, if there is any change, those same people will not be very happy that they have accepted a refund.  The sooner this issue is addressed the better, which is why I am recommending the preparation of a report now.  Being aware that there are many people in the background who might not want to highlight the issue to any great extent I am being helpful to the Minister of State.  It is only right the House should have that information.  The numbers of participants and their contributions were not <Col N="974" /> known, but the greater knowledge now available would permit a reasonable estimate of the outcome, given developments that have taken place in the interim which will also have eased the cost element.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will know that many of these issues now converge and ultimately will reveal a different picture.  The type of report I propose would be helpful to Members and to the Select Committee in examining these issues.  We might even request the Select Committee to have the Department prepare a report thereon.</P>
      <P>Why run away from this issue?  Why would the Minister of State not agree to put the facts on the table of the House for inspection?  What is wrong with that kind of open, democratic, participatory system about which we hear so much in the media but which is difficult to implement in the House?</P>
      <P>Of course the problems were foreseen but appropriate solutions could not be foreseen.  In 1988 that development was a major step forward and we should now be able to see those solutions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  &mdash; The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension of the Family Income Supplement to the families of persons who are self-employed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a thorny issue, one which has been resolved in Northern Ireland where they have managed to extend the family income supplement to the self-employed.  Accepting that its extension will involve greater monitoring, control, checking and information than would be applicable in the case of an employee whose emoluments would be more consistent or easily quantifiable than in the case of the self-employed, we should examine this issue very carefully.  Acknowledging that there are now many self-employed people who experience considerable difficulty in making an adequate family income and who, if employed by someone else, would be eligible for the family income supplement, we shall have to face up to the possibility of its extension to some if not all of them.</P>
      <P>It is important that such issues be discussed openly, with the fullest information available, well in advance of the next budget.  I accept that priorities must be struck in the preparation of any budget, that each budget represents a selection of priorities.  However, if the most up-to-date information is adequate and available, those priorities will manifest themselves.  The reduction in the numbers of long-term unemployed must be a priority and the family income supplement is one method by which that can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back-to-work scheme is much heralded as <Col N="975" /> being successful.  The thinking behind its initiation was to give those concerned the moneys being paid in social welfare benefits on a sliding scale over three years.  Some participants, when reduced to the 50 per cent rate or less, may well find that the work in which they had been happily engaged is not sufficient to meet their family needs.  We are aware that some 65 per cent, if not more, of those participating in the back-to-work scheme are self-employed.</P>
    <P>We can be quite certain that a proportion of self-employed experience difficulty in making ends meet.  We should be making preparations for their inclusion in the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods that the family income supplement should be extended to the self-employed, many of whom are involved in small firms which are merely ticking over.  They are reaping a very meagre income from their activities.  If they were employed, they would be entitled to that supplement.  It warrants serious examination by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement is currently available to employees, with children, in receipt of low earnings.  The Minister has implemented a number of significant improvements since 1994, including an increase of £20, £10 in 1996 and 1997, in addition to changes in the threshold levels used to determine entitlement to this supplement.  Most recipients have an additional £12 per week and there is a reduction from six to three months in the minimum period the employment is expected to last; a reduction in the number of hours which must be worked in order to qualify, from 20 hours per week to 38 hours per fortnight, an extension of FIS to job sharers and an immediate increase in the rate payable on the birth of a child.</P>
      <P>In the context of reducing disincentives to work, priority is given to FIS as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to reform FIS to calculate entitlement on the basis of net as opposed to gross wages, as recommended in the final report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare. As a first step towards meeting this commitment the Minister made provision in this year's Social Welfare Bill to determine entitlement on the basis of earnings less PRSI and superannuation contributions.</P>
      <P>Under the current arrangements, self-employed people with children are not eligible to claim FIS.  However, self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances, are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on their means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> In 1994 the extension of FIS to self-employed people with children was estimated to cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost is in addition to the existing cost of providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances.</P>
    <P>In 1995 the ESRI published a paper entitled &ldquo;Supplementing Family Income&rdquo; which examined the FIS scheme.  The report also examined the issue of extending FIS to the self-employed although no costing was carried out. The report highlighted a number of issues which need to be examined.  However, should the extension of the scheme be considered, such as the method of assessing income from self-employment, the ESRI report notes that the extension of FIS to the self-employed could run the risk of a large increase in expenditure going to groups whose living standards were not adequately reflected by their incomes.  It is also worth noting that in its final report the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare did not recommend the inclusion of the self-employed in any reform of a FIS type payment on the basis that employees are the group most typically exposed to moving between employment and unemployment and for whom work incentives are a real issue.</P>
    <P>Given the estimated cost of such an extension of the FIS scheme and the Government's priority in achieving the commitment contained in Partnership 2000 to reform the assessment of FIS, the Minister has no plans to extend FIS to the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods correctly pointed out that a high percentage of people participating in the back-to-work allowance scheme are those who become self-employed.  There is a tendency to suggest they are vulnerable and will not survive. That is true of every business set up but it is probably better in the initial stages to let them feel they are in a position to paddle their own canoe, to look after their own interests, than to revert too readily to a situation where they qualify for FIS.  In the event of the person qualifying for the back-to-work allowance scheme, remaining on a descending scale and finishing the scheme, and following the theory put forward by Deputy Woods, one would assume they would have the support of FIS.  The idea is good in theory but I am not sure that in practice it would be beneficial either to improving the attractiveness of the back-to-work allowance scheme or the incentive to work because at that stage the person on the back-to-work scheme will have made a decision to run on their own and, if unable to do so, will qualify for unemployment assistance.  In the event of succeeding they will survive economically in the marketplace to which they became accustomed during the previous three years or for the duration of that scheme.</P>
    <P>The points raised by the two Deputies opposite are well intentioned and I understand where they <Col N="977" /> are coming from.  However, there are two sides to the argument.  It remains to be seen to what extent that intervention subsequent to self-employment will be beneficial.  There is a whole series of other areas in relation to self-employment, to which Deputy Woods referred, where there have been anomalies.  For example, a person who is self-employed previously did not always gain access to unemployment assistance in the event of that becoming a necessity.  That matter has been resolved to a considerable extent. On the basis of events to date and the information available to the Department, while noting the points raised it is not necessary or desirable to proceed in that fashion in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear about the people on the back-to-work allowance scheme.  I hope not many of them would find themselves in difficulty at the end of the three years but we have to accept that some will.  This is the reason I mentioned the different groups and categories of people.  It is easy to say the ESRI estimated a figure of £30 million as the full year cost of introducing the family income supplement for self-employed persons.  I note also that the standards of living would not be adequately reflected by the incomes of the self-employed.  I presume it is the same in the North.  To be clear about the criteria it is necessary to do some more homework.  The figure of £30 million is the equivalent of about 8,000 long-term unemployed and the figure for unemployment of £1,065 million represents in the region of 255,000 or 259,000, which will probably be reduced shortly.</P>

Obviously the Minister and the Government do not have a mind to tackle the issue at this stage.  It seems as if the Minister of State was sent in, since the Minister is not available, to say no to everything, even on the availability of a report in three or six months' time.</P>

      <P>In page 6, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;The Minister shall establish a register of women working full-time in the home who wish to return to the workforce, to be known as the back to work register.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 reads:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;That Minister shall reserve 10 per cent of the educational, training and other back to work options for women in the home whose names are included in the back to work register.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not mind whether it is called a back-to-work or home-to-business register but it is important to recognise the existence of women in the home who are anxious to return to the workforce.  If they are entitled to receive unemployment assistance, they qualify for inclusion on the various schemes on offer; if not, they are excluded from between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of the options available.  There is no need to include them on the live register.  A substantial number do not qualify for unemployment or dependency payments and do not have the money to undertake private courses.  It is time they were provided with assistance in appropriate ways.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to ensure that a proportion of the options available are reserved for them.  This was done successfully in the past in the case of lone parents, although the concept met with considerable resistance at the time.  This facilitated the return of many lone parents to the workforce, including the professions.</P>

      <P>Access by women to State run employment schemes, training programmes and educational opportunities was highlighted recently in a campaign organised by the National Women's Council and the INOU.  Access to these schemes is largely dependent on an attachment to the live register or receipt of a one parent family payment from the Department of Social Welfare. Concern has been expressed that the use of the live register as a mechanism for targeting job, training, educational and other developmental opportunities is indirectly discriminatory as it does not accurately reflect the true level of female unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has taken a number of steps to address the issues raised. These include the active encouragement of spouses of unemployed persons to avail of their entitlement to sign on the live register where they are themselves unemployed &mdash; this would give them access to CE and other opportunities in their own right; the availability of information to <Col N="979" /> all those who wish to sign on the live register in an explanatory leaflet entitled Signing on the Live Register which details the various entitlements; allowing full access to the job facilitation service to all women who wish to inquire about the various options available to them and the promotion of the spouse swap facility available under CE and job initiative schemes which allows a person to participate in lieu of his or her spouse.</P>
    <P>As part of its enhanced programme for social inclusion, the Government aims to develop a strategy which enhances equality and counters discrimination in employment and non-employment areas.  Equity in access to labour market opportunities requires that women should not be penalised in the provision of employment supports, including training.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Minister's recommendation, the Government agreed in December 1996 that the issue of women's participation in mainstream vocational educational, training and employment programmes should be reviewed.  The social partners, the National Women's Council and the INOU were invited to participate in this review. A specific commitment in this regard was also included in the programme Partnership 2000.  It should be evident, therefore, that the difficulties faced by women who wish to return to the workforce are being tackled in direct and ongoing consultation with all the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>I have met representatives of the groups concerned on a number of occasions.  It is not a question of preventing women from signing on the live register.  We have actively encouraged women whose spouses are unemployed to do so by the provision of information which has proved beneficial. Some women do not qualify for inclusion <Col N="980" /> on the various training schemes on offer for the reasons indicated by the Deputy.  Qualification for payment is governed by contribution regulations.</P>
    <P>All these considerations have been taken into account in ascertaining how women who wish to return to the workforce can best be facilitated in gaining access to training schemes which will give them the necessary confidence and extra skills required to allow them to compete adequately in the jobs market.  In recent years more than 50 per cent of the jobs created have been filled by women, reflecting their numbers in the population. This trend is likely to continue.</P>

That still leaves a large number of people who will not be covered.  These are the people we are concerned about and they should have the support they need, with options set aside for them.  It would be helpful to have a register of women so that we would know how many of those concerned, who are not included in the live register, are anxious to participate in the workforce.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash;The Minister shall not reduce the income to the Social Insurance Fund by 1 per cent., but may reduce the training and employment levy by an equivalent amount to benefit both employees and pensioners and maintain the solvency of the fund.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The point involved here is that by reducing the level of contribution to the social insurance fund from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent there may be difficulties in future with the solvency of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> Another way of achieving this is through a reduction in the levy.  Previously there were two 1 per cent levies which were separate from the social insurance fund.  One levy was removed some years ago, while the other levy is still used to bring in funds for a range of activities, including training and employment.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that the social insurance fund can meet its obligations on a year by year basis. The Minister may say that the fund will meet its obligations this year because the Government will make up the deficit of, say, £133 million.  This will not give rise to problems immediately but it will weaken the fund in future.  Unless the contributions are increased or decreased each year having regard to the needs of the fund or the Government includes contributions from employers, employees and the self-employed at a particular rate then the fund will be weakened.</P>
    <P>We have referred to the needs of those who depend on the fund.  In some cases the rates of payment are not adequate.  We have an opportunity in the Bill to increase the levels of payment. I have no objection to the Government giving money to workers or easing the burden on employers but I am concerned about the entitlements of workers who depend on the fund.  We should not undermine the fund or weaken its ability to meet its obligations in future.</P>
    <P>The fund is receiving extra money as the self-employed and some civil servants now pay the full rate.  The contributions by the self-employed amount to £92-93 million a year.  To date they have contributed approximately £587 million and they will draw down this money in future.  It is easy to say there is plenty of money in the fund but the danger is that in future the money in the fund will not be earmarked for these workers.  I am concerned that the Minister is weakening the position of the fund and reducing its solvency.  I tabled this amendment as it is important to ensure that the fund is kept solvent and that workers benefit from it.  I would be concerned about any move to means test the benefits from the fund.  If we remove money from the fund it is inevitable that the benefits will be means-tested in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's argument; this theory is often put forward by those in Opposition.  People can have different views depending on whether they are in Opposition or Government.  I do not say this to be unkind to anyone.</P>
      <P>The fund has been affected on many occasions as a result of Government actions.  The Social Welfare Act, 1990, provided for the abolition of the occupational injuries fund and the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund.  The surpluses in those funds at that time, which amounted to approximately £52 million, were used to reduce the Exchequer subvention to the fund in that year.  This process is not new and does not put the fund in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Employees' PRSI was reduced from 5.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent specifically to increase the take-home pay of workers in industrial, commercial and service employments.  These sectors were targeted to promote employment and to reward work in the non-State sector.  The increase in take home pay which these workers received is capped when earnings reach £23,000 per annum because of the operation of the earnings ceiling for employees' PRSI.  Single and married people benefit to the same extent, unlike changes in the income tax system which are worth double to a one earner couple compared with a single person. Furthermore, a reduction in employees' PRSI is the only way of improving the net income of approximately 1,000 employees on low pay who have no dependent children and who, therefore, do not qualify for family income supplement.  It is important to remember that a cut in the levies would not benefit workers on incomes below the threshold for payment of the levies which is being increased from £188 to £197 per week.  A cut in the levies would benefit people in other categories such as those on very high incomes who were not targeted by this measure.  For that reason a 1 per cent reduction would cost approximately two and a half times a reduction of 1 per cent in employees' PRSI.  This additional cost would have to be found by reducing expenditure or the other tax improvements announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion in recent years about the potential of PRSI levels to act as a tax on employment.  The Government examined this matter and took into account the advice it received.  It identified the areas where it would have most benefit, the low income groups.  The need to encourage those in low paid jobs to remain in employment and to encourage unemployed persons to take up employment was uppermost in the Government's mind.  This is the correct approach.  The points made by the Deputy have been made previously and would, if applied in the fashion suggested by him, cost considerably more than our proposals and would not necessarily have the same beneficial impact on this group.</P>
    <P>The social insurance discussion document &ldquo;Social Insurance in Ireland&rdquo; which was launched last October is designed to stimulate a debate on the future of social insurance.  The views of all interested parties are being invited as part of a general consultative process in the development of policy in this very important area.  As Deputy Woods correctly stated, this will engage the minds of those charged with responsibility for looking after the social insurance fund in future.  It will initiate debate in such a way as to enable decisions to be taken in future which will specifically target the areas most in need and ensure that the funds available to the Minister are allocated in the best way possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot divorce myself from my own practical knowledge and experience.  On that <Col N="985" /> basis, I cannot accept what the Minister of State said, which is irresponsible and short-sighted.  It undermines the position of workers in their own fund.  It is a pre-election sweetener.  Another way was open to the Minister.  He could have changed a number of the thresholds in relation to people on the lowest incomes or the amounts paid by those people.  Nobody would have objected to that, but the Minister did not do that.  This is obviously a pre-election measure and I am concerned it will adversely affect the social insurance fund in the future.</P>
      <P>If there was so much money available in the fund this year, why were many other measures not implemented?  The budget was not a good one for widows, old age pensioners and others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not made up for the past three years.  The three years, when combined, were three bad years.  This was an effort to make up for a very bad period.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is an article by Vincent Browne which states: &ldquo;The sad reality is that in the social welfare area, the performance of this Government does not match what was done even by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats between 1989 and 1992&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It further states:</P>
      <P>While Proinsias De Rossa has been Minister for Social Welfare, the real increase in benefits has been a mere 64 per cent of what the real increases were while the Progressive Democrats governed with Fianna Fáil.  As this claim will be disputed, I will elaborate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to write to <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes on to show how the calculations given are reached.  That articles bears out what was obvious to me from the beginning and which I tried to get across to the Minister.  He is not doing a good job for the people who depend on social welfare.  They will outline the real position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was so much additional money in the social insurance fund this year the Minister felt he could take money out of it.  How can the Minister do that without giving the increases people need?  Why could more not have been done for widows and families?  Very little was done for families in particular.  The Minister of State referred to personal rates, but if the rates are combined in respect of families, it is obvious that families have done badly.  The books, which I am sure will issue to them before the election in April or May, will show that, for instance, a widow with five children will get an increase in her widow's pension of only 1.9 per cent.  How can the Minister give away money from the fund <Col N="986" /> when such miserly increases are being given? That is the reality of what this Government is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I could point out to him that in other areas we gave 11 per cent in that period in addition to other large increases.  This Bill will only partly make up for the deficits of the past two years, and the pensioners are aware of that. Unfortunately, the Minister is undermining the very fund which exists to pay for these benefits and increases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension to self-employed contributors of the benefits of Occupational Injury Benefit, health and safety benefits and Invalidity Pension.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an example of what I was saying in relation to amendment No. 13.  I cannot put down an amendment to require the Minister to do what is stated in this amendment because that would involve a charge on the Exchequer, but I can ask him the reason he will not do it, particularly as he is giving away money from the fund. The Minister seems to think the fund is doing all the work required of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious issues arise in regard to this amendment. The media has covered accidents in Dublin and other cities involving people on contract work falling from scaffolding or having other accidents on the job.  Those people now come under the self-employed area because of changes over the years.  Employers hire them as contractors and subcontractors, not full-time employees. That is now an extensive practice.  People on contract work contributed to the social insurance fund for many years &mdash; I know some people who made contributions up to the age of 50.  They have been forced by the changes made over the years to become subcontractors and, consequently, do not have the protection of the social <Col N="987" /> insurance fund.  They have protection under the self-employed category but that covers them only for old age, widow or widower's pension, not occupational injury benefit or invalidity pension. These people are crying out for cover in this area, and the problem must be dealt with.  That is an example of what I was talking about in regard to the fund as a whole.  It is important that we address this issue in the House and that a report on the implications of the extension should be brought before it.  One of the implications is that it would be a charge on the fund, that we would have reduced it by 1 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event let us have the report and examine it, because it is important.  There is no point in Ministers making statements about falls from scaffolds.  We should not have to wait for a PR merchant to tell us this area should be covered because there has been a fuss over it.  The fund should cover obvious needs, and these are controllable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the founding fathers of the Deputy's party realised what he was up to he would be in deep trouble.  The National Pensions Board in its final report did not recommend the extension of invalidity cover to the self-employed at present.  The board considered that cover for permanent incapacity in the case of the self-employed and other people who are permanently incapable of work and not eligible for an invalidity pension under social insurance should continue to be provided by schemes of social assistance under which entitlement is subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The improvements which I have made in introducing the new disability allowance last year and the new sickness allowance provided for in this year's Bill are broadly in keeping with the board's recommendations.  The board also recommended that the question of introducing social insurance cover for invalidity for the self-employed should be reviewed not later than five years after the introduction of the new invalidity and sickness schemes and in the light of experience of their application.  That adequately addresses the issues raised by Deputy Woods in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the national pensions initiative, questions in relation to coverage and quality of disability cover are included in the consultation document which completed stage one of the initiative.  Stage two involves the consultation process and the compilation and examination of responses to the document.  The pensions board will then draw up a report including recommendations. The target date for the completion of the second stage is early autumn, and it will fully address the concerns expressed by Deputy Woods.  Everybody is aware of the changing structure of the workforce and the greater number of people in contractual employment.  That <Col N="988" /> has been taken into account in the document to which I referred.  It is not entirely true, as Deputy Woods has suggested, that people are crying out for action in this area or that there is a major emergency.  There is a need that is being addressed by the consultative process already in place.  That is the best way of dealing with it because, following that consultation, the Minister will be in a better position to assess how best to proceed so that the maximum benefit accrues to the people directly concerned.</P>
    <P>If all the amendments which have been proposed were taken on board the social fund would be depleted four times over.  I appreciate the difficulties faced by the Opposition in that it cannot table amendments which entail a cost to the Exchequer, but it should be noted that there are two sides to the debate.  There are compelling reasons for making improvements.  However, there is a cost factor which will always be ignored by the Opposition but cannot be ignored by Government.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;apart from allocating a general overall increase.  The Minister mentioned that the National Pensions Board recommended a wait of five years after the introduction of the new schemes.  In this respect, it is wrong.  I would not wait one year.  When I see an ordinary decent working man going out to work on these sites and he is not covered, I am not going to tell him he will have to be satisfied with means-tested assistance. That is what the Minister said, and it is not acceptable.  It worries me that there appears to be an undermining of the fund so that people do not get the benefits they need.  There will not be many accidents in the workplace, but there will be some.  There are people in wheelchairs this year as a result of accidents at work who will not have the cover of an invalidity pension and will have to apply for a means-tested pension.</P>

If the Minister were to ask his officials they would tell him it would not cost much to cover people in <Col N="989" /> that situation.  It might be argued that it would have to apply to people working on farms, but why should a farmer who has been invalided because of an accident on the farm not be covered too?  It is farmers who make the products from which we all live.  They are the most fundamental producers in the country, no matter what is said about them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.  &mdash;The Minister shall, within three months after the end of each year, lay before Dáil Éireann an annual actuarial account of the future liabilities of the Social Insurance Fund and of the projected needs of the Fund.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because of the need to be conscious of the status of the fund.  On Committee Stage the Minister stated that there would be an actuarial study every five years.  That interval is too long.  We should know each year where the fund stands, and that may mean having an actuarial study every three years.  However, I believe we should have an annual study and that is why I have asked the Minister to lay such report before the Dáil within three months after the end of each year.  We are talking about openness and accountability, and those reports should be laid on the table for discussion.  That is what openness is about.</P>

I remember painstakingly asking questions from <Col N="990" /> time to time when the Deputy was sitting over here, and I recognise how frustrating it is for Members in Opposition to extract information in circumstances such as those that prevailed at that time.  Circumstances have changed considerably since then and there is now openness.  A great deal of information is available and we have no objection to giving it, within reason.</P>

      <P>In an election year we should not lose our reason.  We should not suggest to every group that they are hard done by, that as a result of intervention by an Opposition Deputy or a Minister there will be a permanent beneficial impact on their lives and that anybody who suggests otherwise is refusing to disclose or covering up something.  I do not accept that.  The current Administration has done a great deal in a very short time to address the issues to which the Deputy referred, to address the needs of the people who are less well off and provide for the people who perhaps had been self-employed and need to fall back on social welfare because of the unfortunate change in their circumstances.  All those matters have been carefully assessed and substantial improvements made in every area where payments are required.  There have also been substantial extensions in terms of entitlements.</P>
      <P>With the passage of time people tend to forget what happened in the past.  I will be gentlemanly however and will not resurrect the ghosts of the dirty dozen.  I will not refer to 1990-1 and the horrendous measures imposed on a hapless public by a Government which, it said, was doing its best at the time &mdash; I have no reason to disbelieve it. Ample time followed during which the problems could have been addressed but that was not done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not.  I have always believed that Deputy Woods is a compassionate man and I am sure he must have had nightmares when he thought about the impact of some of the measures implemented at that time.  I do not wish to go down that road, but I get annoyed when I hear calls for expenditure of up to £400 million in one day.  If this debate went on for a week we would need the Exchequer of two or three other jurisdictions as well as our own to fund the inspiration of the Opposition, not to talk about addressing the problem in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social insurance fund consists of the PRSI contributions of employers, employees, and the self-employed.  This funds social insurance payments, <Col N="991" /> with the Exchequer making up any shortfall. The National Pensions Board, in its final report, Developing the National Pensions System, recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that an actuarial review of the projected long-term costs of all social welfare pensions, not just SIF pensions, be carried out every five years.  The first such actuarial review is currently being carried out by Irish Pensions Trust consultants in the Department and it is hoped to have it completed by mid-year.  That is positive news and there is no need for an amendment in that regard.  The Department is ahead of the posse.</P>
    <P>The focus of the review is long-term pensions, contributory and non-contributory, covering old age, retirement, widow's, widower's and invalidity pensions.  Non-cash benefits, free schemes paid by the Department of Social Welfare, are also to be included in the review which will cover the next 60 years.  That is indicative of the recognition by the Government of the need to make adequate provision for the future.  Some of us will not be around at the end of that period and those who are will be in need of the resources that are available from the respective funds at that time. Following completion and examination of the review the Minister will consider the formal legal arrangements that need to be put in place for future reviews &mdash; it would be premature to do so at this stage.  Any such arrangements should refer to more than the SIF and it would be unnecessary to carry out such reviews annually.  Those matters will be reviewed from time to time in accordance with necessity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Government the best of luck with the review that will cover the next 60 years.  If it sees beyond three years it will be doing very well.  It was not very successful in the past and there is no reason to believe it will be in the future.  There is an estimate of what might happen in given circumstances, and they are very interesting models, but we need to know on a much more frequent basis what the position is likely to be.  The Minister said that a five year review would be sufficient, but it would need to be carried out more frequently.  I will not press my amendment, but it is important that actuarial studies take place on a regular basis so that we know exactly what is happening with the fund and what the future needs are likely to be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 20, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;13.  &mdash;The Minister shall make every possible effort and take all steps open to him to ensure that the EU subsidised butter scheme is restored to its pre-December, 1996 level.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> The butter scheme has been halved, but that was not necessary because there has not been a drop in the level of butter consumption since 1990.  The Government had to go back to 1981 to find a drop in consumption, concentrating on the years 1981-95.  The review, however, covered the two years 1994-6 and there was no drop in butter consumption during that period.  The press release was misleading in that it was based on the much longer period.  It was a misrepresentation of the position.  That was the case put to the meeting of the Council of Ministers in December when it was agreed to reduce this scheme.</P>
    <P>We do not agree with the reduction in butter vouchers, which are paid to 900,000 people.  The people who benefit most are families and, therefore, they will lose most by this measure.  A family with five children who previously received 14 butter vouchers per month will now receive only seven per month.  With the meagre increases in basic payments, that is unacceptable in present circumstances.  It is regrettable the Government is not prepared to restore the scheme to its original level.  If given an opportunity, we will do so.</P>

      <P>The beauty of being in Opposition is that Members can safely say when they return to Government they will overturn everything.  It was fortunate we got into Government to overturn some of the proposals Members of the Opposition made when they were Government.</P>
      <P>This is not a serious issue, it is a political one. What Deputy Woods said is not true.  There has been a reduction in butter consumption since the introduction of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have our eyes firmly fixed on the ball and intend to continue doing that.  The Deputy examined the position since 1991 and concluded that there has not been a great reduction in butter consumption.  However, there has been a considerable reduction in butter consumption since the scheme was initiated and for the reasons I outlined on Second Stage, it was decided to reduce the butter voucher scheme. Deputy Woods said the reduction will have a negative impact on families.  Any alleged loss will be more than compensated for by the substantial increase in child benefits.</P>

      <P>In essence, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not make a proper case at the Council meeting.  The memorandum presented to the Council of Ministers by the Commission left it open to retain the scheme at the current level. I will leave it to the Minister of State to tell the widow with five children, who will receive an increase of only 1.9 per cent in her widow's pension, that this reduction will not impact negatively on her.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>15.  The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before Dáil Éireann a detailed report on the implications of the extension to recipients of Disability Allowance the entitlement to earn up to £6,000 per year, and retain their full payment, and where their earnings are between £6,000 and £12,000 that they shall be entitled to a reduced level of payment.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While the special arrangements for lone parents and one parent families should be extended to many other groups of people, one group stands out in this regard.  As more than 80 per cent of those on disability allowance are unemployed, they should be given every assistance to get back to the workforce.  That group should be given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary. The matter is not as simple as Deputy Woods appears to believe.  There has been a significant improvement in benefits as a result of the transfer of the disability allowance to the Department of Social Welfare.  Universal application of the guidelines has greatly improved the operation of the scheme.  Obviously, teething problems will occur when transferring a scheme from one Department to another, but application of the guidelines on an equal basis, irrespective of health board or county boundaries, has ensured the benefits are displayed equally throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The provisions specified in this amendment for the assessment of means for disability allowance are the same as those that currently apply in the case of the one parent family payment, which I introduced last January.  Under these provisions, the first £6,000 of earnings are disregarded in the assessment of means, earnings in excess of this amount are assessed at 50 per cent and the payment ceases to be payable where the earnings exceed £12,000 per year.</P>
      <P>Research by the ESRI and Combat Poverty Agency has shown that one parent families are vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion.  The policy I have adopted on one parent families is reflected in the way the one parent family payment has been designed as an income support mechanism to take into account the special needs and requirements of single parents raising children and maintaining a household on their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="994" /> The one parent family payment is also aimed at facilitating lone parents to return to the workforce by providing positive support, so that over time they can become less reliant on social welfare payments for their income needs.  The new £6,000 disregard of earnings for the one parent family payment is designed to make employment a more attractive option for single parents and to simplify the method of means assessment, so that in considering employment single parents can more readily understand their position in regard to social welfare entitlement.</P>
    <P>In so far as disability allowance is concerned, responsibility for the administration of the allowance was transferred to my Department from the Department of Health last October.  In taking over this scheme, my main concern was that the transfer would be effected efficiently, with as little disturbance as possible for existing clients. However, at the same time, I introduced a number of improvements, including provision for two full personal rates where both partners are in receipt of the allowance, the payment of disability allowance for up to 13 weeks where a person goes into hospital as compared with the eight week period under the former disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme, the payment of child dependant allowances up to age 22 where the young person is in full-time education, and improved arrangements for the assessment of capital under which the first £2,000 capital is disregarded.</P>
    <P>In the context of taking over responsibility for the administration of the scheme, I replaced the title &ldquo;disabled person's maintenance allowance&rdquo; with &ldquo;disability allowance&rdquo;, following consultations with representative groups.  Means for disability allowance are now generally assessed along the same lines as unemployment assistance. The benefit and privilege provisions, however, applied in the case of unemployment assistance, under which young people living at home may be assessed with parental income, is not applied in the case of disability allowance.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making further improvements to the scheme this year, including the payment of disability allowance at half rate to people who are in part time residential care and the payment of two full personal rates where one spouse is in receipt of disability allowance and the other is in receipt of either old age pension or invalidity pension. He has also allocated 1,000 of the increased numbers provided for in the back-to-work allowance this year for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities.  This represents 20 per cent of the increased numbers provided for in the scheme this year.  In so far as the future development of disability allowance is concerned, my Department is in the process of undertaking a comprehensive review of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities with a view to bringing forward proposals for a range of improvements in the scheme in the context of the 1998 budget.</P>
    <P>Substantial improvements have already taken <Col N="995" /> place which have addressed, to a great extent, the points raised by Deputy Woods in the amendment. It is generally accepted that is the case.  I do not see the benefit at this stage of intervening further.  However, as time passes it will be necessary to review the operation of this scheme, as is the case with a number of other schemes, to ascertain whether it is sufficiently targeting the people whom it is intended to assist or whether changes are needed.  The scheme is greatly improved, which is reflected in the support for it and the general comments from those whom it directly affects.</P>
    <P>Incentives to return to the workforce are essential and should be viewed from two vantage points.  First, provision is being made in the revised scheme to encourage those who are in a position to return to the workforce to so do. Second, it must be recognised that recipients of disability allowance might not be physically capable of returning to the workforce and should not be coerced into so doing.  We must find the right balance between recognising the existence of the disability and the need to protect such people and their families and the need to provide an incentive for those who are capable of returning to work to do so.  That has been done very effectively in a very progressive and worthwhile package which sufficiently meets the requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions are very much welcomed by those on disability allowance.  I accept their position has been improved, which was the whole idea behind bringing them under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare so that they could receive the attention and support which they deserve.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to look again at the incentive package for the next time &mdash; I know he will not do it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 35, to delete &ldquo;of the Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments replace the phrase &ldquo;objects in the collection of the Board&rdquo; with the phrase &ldquo;objects in the collection of the Museum&rdquo; or &ldquo;objects in the collection of the Library&rdquo; as the case may be.  Deputies Quill and de Valera suggested on Committee Stage that references to &ldquo;in the collection of the Board&rdquo; should be substituted by the phrase &ldquo;in the collection of the Museum&rdquo; and I agreed to table the necessary drafting arrangements on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, the relevant phrases in the Bill do not constitute ownership because the ownership of objects is not being transferred in the Bill.  In general, the references were to the board as that is the corporate body being established.  However, I have no difficulty with the alternative approach suggested by Deputies Quill and de Valera, while noting that a similar approach &mdash; which I think the Deputies accept &mdash; needs to be adopted in the case of the Library for the sake of consistency.</P>
      <P>While changing the emphasis from the board to the institution concerned entails the need for many drafting amendments, I have been persuaded there are advantages in making this change.  Accordingly, this is what is proposed in the relevant amendments.  I ask, therefore, the Deputies to accept my amendments in place of their own.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking the spirit of our amendments on board because we are at one on these very important definitions of ownership.  The distinction must be made between the Museum's collection and the function of the board.  The ownership of the collections of the National Museum and National <Col N="998" /> Library is obviously vested in the State.  The Bill, therefore, envisages the creation of a new expert administrative arm of the State which will have exclusive responsibility for maintaining, managing, controlling, protecting, preserving, recording, researching and enlarging the collection of museum heritage objects.  It does not purport to vest ownership of the collection in the proposed new board, which is the essence of our discussion. The ownership of the Museum's collection of heritage objects is vested in the State and not in the board.  I greatly welcome the Minister's amendments because they tidy up what we all agree is a very important principle.</P>

      <P>Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 10 from the Bill. Section 10 is a core section, providing for the establishment of the museum and library boards on the respective establishment days to perform the functions set out for them in the Bill.  Debate on this was exhausted on Committee Stage while <Col N="999" /> there was a discussion on the principle on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I have said enough in favour of the establishment of boards for the National Museum and the National Library.  I do not have to defend them on the basis of so much academic and objective support.  An initiative of this kind should have been take perhaps 70 years ago following Professor Bodkin's report on the museum.</P>
      <P>Most, if not all, national museums and library institutions in the developed world are run by boards under some kind of legislative framework. While I commend the public service ethos of our civil servants, some of the requirements involved in the Civil Service are insufficient and inappropriate and sometimes inflexible in the running of cultural institutions.  It can hardly be preferred that Ministers and civil servants should continue to be formally responsible for every artefact in the case of the museum, and of every book that is to be collected, lent or disposed of in the case of the library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody with an interest in the museum or library could prefer that the strictest of staffing restrictions should continue to apply to them or that these institutions should continue to have all the obligations of estate but without the option as independent entities to forge other avenues of support from the public.  It must be understood that providing large amounts of public money to the museum and library for major capital projects can only be justified if, at the same time, modern, relevant and coherent governing structures with flexibility are put in place.  The ongoing process of regeneration, indeed the long-term survival <Col N="1000" /> into the 21st century towards which this legislation is directed, requires that the necessary governing structures are put in place now.  That is what is being proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree in principle with the Minister's proposal regarding the establishment of the boards.  The Government has a penchant for the establishment of boards.  While we accept that change is needed to the structures of our cultural institutions, there is no purpose in establishing structures unless they are funded.  The unions representing the workers in these institutions have expressed a number of reservations with regard to the new situation in which they will find themselves.  Given these arguments, I must press the amendment.</P>
      <P>Those civil servants involved with our cultural institutions throughout the years have done excellent work.  Our failure to create modern institutions should not be blamed on them, rather it has perhaps arisen because of lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed that insufficient funding has been made available to the cultural institutions over a number of years.  However, every outside and objective academic study on them has recommended a model like that which is proposed. While we disagree on this, the three issues go hand in hand.  There is a need for good legislation and modern flexible, institutional innovation which must then be supported by resources.  That is what is required, and it does not reflect on those who have gone before.</P>

      <P>This is an important occasion on which householders and groups such as ACRA in particular, which led a campaign for many years for the abolition of ground rents, must be happy. The Government informed us today that it will accept the legislation, which is a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.  That is a welcome development and I congratulate ACRA on its work over the years.  I am happy the Government is prepared to accept the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its foundation, Fianna Fáil has been committed to ensuring that householders, as far as possible, own their homes.  As a result, Ireland has one of highest rates &mdash; 80 per cent &mdash; of home ownership in the EU.  Grants, loan facilities and tax incentives have been used to encourage and assist home purchases.  For many thousands of families, the family home is their only major capital holding.  The family is the cornerstone of society and the family home is the physical focal point for the family.  This is why we want to shelter and safeguard homes and to ensure outright and unfettered home ownership.  In pursuing this principle, Fianna Fáil introduced the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act in 1967, which, for the first time, provided the right to householders to buy out their ground rents.  The Act benefited many householders and the scheme <Col N="1003" /> introduced in 1967 was greatly improved in 1978 when the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act was passed.  This Act enabled householders to buy out the ground rent at minimal cost.</P>
    <P>The security of the family or householder in his or her home was greatly enhanced by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 1) Act, 1978, which prohibited the creation of new ground rents.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, removed the right of landlords to repossess for non-payment of a ground rent.  These were important developments and since 1978 all new house purchasers were able to enjoy a position where no ground rent was attached to their homes.  The developments ensured that a householder has the right to buy out his or her ground rent and can do so at low cost.  They also ensured that a ground rent landlord can no longer repossess a home for non-payment of a ground rent and no new ground rents can be created since the 1978 Act became law.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is convinced that the time has come for the historic reform of home ownership by the final abolition of ground rents and the introduction of a simple system of registration in the Land Registry.  This is why we prepared the Bill, which will bring all ground rents to an end while at the same time protecting the legitimate interest under the Constitution of the landlord by providing for the payment of compensation which would be secured by a charge on the house until the householder pays it.  Fianna Fáil also believes, in the light of the abolition of ground rents, that the time is right to move forward to a position where titles to urban dwellings become registered titles as has been the case for titles to rural dwellings since the Land Purchase Acts of the late 19th century and early 20th century, which resulted from the Land League movement.</P>
    <P>The key features of the Bill are, first, that on the appointed day, the interest of the ground rent tenant will be enlarged into a freehold interest or fee simple.  This is the final step in the abolition of ground rents.  Second, the ground rent landlord will receive a right to compensation.  Payment of this compensation will be secured by a charge on the new freehold premises.  Third, the compensation due will be paid on the same basis as already applies to the purchase price under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Acts, 1967 to 1989.</P>
    <P>Each householder will receive a freehold certificate which will show that he or she is the absolute freeholder of the house.  Where a local authority is involved, the transfer document will become a freehold certificate.  A system of simple compulsory registration will be introduced.  This will simplify subsequent conveyancing when a house is sold again.  For leases which have expired or have less than 20 years to run, the householder will be entitled to the freehold on a similar basis without having to pay a portion of the value of <Col N="1004" /> the house as was the case heretofore.  There have been some tragic cases where that occurred.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is convinced that the time has come for the reform of home ownership by the complete abolition of ground rents and the introduction of a simple system of home registration in the Land Registry.  In proposing the final abolition of ground rents, Fianna Fáil is continuing a process of reform over many years.  The two 1978 Acts introduced three crucial reforms &mdash; the prohibition on the creation of new ground rent leases for private dwelling houses, the prohibition on the forfeiture of the house for the non-payment of a ground rent and the purchase scheme at minimal cost for ground rents of dwelling houses. Many thousands of home owners benefited from these reforms.  However, a large number of active pre-1978 ground rents are still in existence. ACRA, the national body of residents' associations, estimate there are some 250,000 houses to which ground rents still apply.  The time is now right for the historic reform of home ownership through the final abolition of these ground rents, a relic of feudal times which have no place as we approach the new millennium.</P>
    <P>We have introduced this Bill with this objective while simultaneously protecting landlords' legitimate interests under the Constitution by providing for the payment of compensation which will be secured by a charge on the house until the householder pays the compensation.</P>
    <P>In the light of the abolition of ground rents we believe it opportune to move forward to circumstances in which titles to urban homes become registered titles, as has been the case in titles to rural holdings since the Land Purchase Acts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries born out of the Land League movement.  The comparison with the Land League movement is not inappropriate since the right to hold the freehold title to rural holdings was established only after long and bitter conflict and civil strife in a period in which many ordinary, decent families were evicted and suffered great hardship.  Similar resistance and conflict were demonstrated in the campaign to abolish ground rents on domestic dwellings.  Some families have made great sacrifices to establish their right to the freehold ownership of their homes in perpetuity and achieved the abolition of all ground rents on homes since 1978.  All new homes being freehold, those who purchase new homes today owe them a debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>However, there remains the legacy of pre-1978. We learn from the Land Registry that up to January last only some 65,000 homeowners had availed of the ground rents purchase scheme, comprising approximately 18.5 per cent of those involved.  This means that four out of every five homes, or some 250,000, are still liable to pay ground rents.  Some 16,300 residents have been taken to court since 1974, some 300 to 400 householders annually are still being dragged through the courts.</P>
    <P>To our shame as a nation, 200 families were given sentences and five incarcerated in jail for <Col N="1005" /> their resistance to this feudal legacy.  As a modern, independent nation we must put an end to this civil strife.  The onus is on us, as legislators, to repeal these outdated ground rents and ensure that from a given date in 1997 every home will be freehold and every family will have the security of knowing it owns the land on which its home is built.</P>
    <P>This Bill will abolish ground rent leases on an appointed day, its central purpose being stipulated in section 7 which provides that, on a day to be appointed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, or the Minister for Justice, the interests of a person holding property under ground rent lease will be extended to freehold or fee simple and all intermediate interests abolished. The various strata of subleases, so common in titles in the case of urban property, will be wiped out leaving the homeowner under the ground rent lease with freehold interest.  All family homes will be freehold from the appointed day.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 17, inclusive, specify those entitled to have freehold interest.  The categories of people entitled to freehold interest under this Bill are broadly similar to those entitled to purchase the fee simple under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  In the case of leases which have expired or have less than 20 years to run the householder will be entitled to freehold on a similar basis to home owners whose leases have not expired, without having to pay a portion of the value of the house, as had been the case heretofore.</P>
    <P>On the termination of all ground rents, in order to comply with the constitutional rights of former owners of freehold and intermediate interests, it is necessary to provide for the payment of adequate compensation in respect of the interests to be abolished.  The Bill provides that this compensation will be paid by the person who becomes the new freeholder.  In effect the provisions of this Bill reverse the process stipulated in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Acts, 1967 and Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 under which a ground rent could be purchased.</P>
    <P>Section 18 sets out the method of calculating the compensation to be paid.  The method adopted is similar to that used previously, one important difference being that used for calculating the value of the landlord's interest, where a lease has expired or has less than 20 years to run, will be abandoned.  The compensation to be paid by people in these circumstances will be calculated on the same basis as that for other categories.</P>
    <P>Because the abolition of ground rents on a certain day will deprive former owners of freehold and intermediate interests of their respective assets, in order to ensure they actually receive the compensation due to them vindicating their constitutional rights, a reliable, legal protection must be put in place.  Section 19 provides for the creation of a charge or mortgage on the new freehold <Col N="1006" /> to secure payment of compensation due which will take effect on the appointed day.</P>
    <P>I will have another opportunity to make some further comments but I should now like to allow my colleague, Deputy Cullen, to contribute.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Government has accepted this important Bill proposed by me on behalf of my party.  While it will be given a Second Reading this evening there is an onus on the Government to join us in ensuring it passes all remaining Stages without delay.</P>

      <P>In accordance with an order of the Dáil of this day, I will be obliged to call the Minister for Justice in less than five minutes, at 7.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Woods, on introducing this Bill, wisely accepted by the Government, the implementation of whose provisions will represent a significant moment in the lives of many of our citizens.  It should be noted that this Bill was not hastily prepared or published.  All Members accept that its preparation involved an enormous amount of teasing out and discussion to ensure its provisions were justified on constitutional grounds.  Those of us who have been involved know how complicated it has been to find a way round the system which would restore full rights to homeowners still burdened with pre-1978 ground rents.</P>
      <P>Without the involvement of ACRA nationwide I very much doubt we would have reached that objective this evening, so that association can take great pride in its efforts.  Over the years this issue waxed and waned as difficulties arose, were resolved and additional ones came to the fore. Throughout those years within the Fianna Fáil Party there was always a commitment to find a means of justifying people's rights in this respect.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to mention Waterford where, when a specific issue arose, ACRA put an enormous amount of work into the preparation of this Bill.  Views expressed at the many public meetings I attended voiced homeowner's dissatisfaction at politicians of all persuasions having been unable to deliver their just requirements to date.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, at long last a Bill has been produced whose provisions recognise the constitutional rights of those holding a leasehold or freehold interest, encompassed within some titles, and balances those rights with the rights of those who have purchased houses, see their home as their own and want the ground rents controversy resolved once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is proof that if one persists and works hard at an issue, Private Members' time can be valuable.  Whenever a Member introduces a Bill of substance, it is very difficult for a Government to ignore its legitimate provisions, the work involved in its preparation and, in this case, the justice and validity of the national campaign fought by ACRA.  My colleague has outlined how the issues will be dealt <Col N="1007" /> with in protecting the rights of the freeholder and creating a situation where title can be purchased to create the fee simple on a said date by the Minister, at minimum cost.  I commend my colleague on his effort in bringing forward the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Woods for the explanation he has given about the contents of the Bill and, in particular, for the explanatory memorandum which he published with it.  I, too, acknowledge the work which ACRA has done during the years on this issue.</P>
      <P>In our Programme for Government we are committed to taking action on ground rents and in this context we will not oppose Second Stage of the Bill.  In taking this approach, we recognise there are many problems with this Bill which will have to be remedied.  We would be a good deal further down the road of dealing with the issue of ground rents if Deputy Woods' party, when in Government in 1994, had done what this Government is doing now &mdash; accepted, without opposition, the Bill brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I trust the Opposition will recognise the action the Government is taking tonight is one of openness and generosity to the work which Deputy Woods has done.  It shows a spirit of generosity which Fianna Fáil in Government did not show to us when we produced Private Members' Bills.</P>
      <P>Particular aspects of the Bill as drafted would considerably worsen the position of tenants liable to pay ground rents.  In effect, it seeks to achieve the abolition of ground rents through forcing people to buy them out.  In practice this would mean that a tenant who has to pay a ground rent of £50 per year would be obliged, under the Bill, to make a once off payment of about £650 to buy out the ground rent if the landlord so demanded. That £650 is aside altogether from legal and registration costs which may arise.  In addition, if arrears of grounds rent were due these would have to be paid.  Under the existing scheme a person has a right to buy out a ground rent.  In effect this Bill would replace that right with an obligation. It would be difficult to explain to people who are concerned about having to pay ground rents how this would improve their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will explain how the figure of £650 arises. According to the explanatory memorandum the compensation due to the landlord will be on the same basis as already applies to the purchase price under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rent) Acts, 1967 to 1989.  Under that legislation, where agreement is not reached between the landlord and tenant on the amount to be paid a &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; is used based on the yield from <Col N="1008" /> Government securities.  The multiplier is 13 and is applied to the existing annual ground rent.</P>
    <P>The Bill is virtually identical to a draft Bill which Deputy Woods, when Minister for Social Welfare, passed on to his colleague the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Gerry Collins, in May 1987.  That Deputy Collins or any of his successors as Minister for Justice &mdash; Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Padraig Flynn &mdash; did not bring it forward is a clear indication there are problems with it.</P>
    <P>In the context of the commitment in the Programme for Government I have been carrying out an examination of ground rents.  The House will appreciate that because of the complex issues involved and the unprecedented programme of law reform particularly in the criminal law area which I have been bringing forward, it has not proved possible yet to complete that examination. In the context of not opposing Second Stage, the Government will have no hesitation in bringing forward any proposals for change in this area which may emerge which would &mdash; unlike some of the provisions of the Bill &mdash; represent a genuine improvement in the position of ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>There have been many Private Members' Bills dealing with the issue.  Any Deputy would like to be in a position to say he or she had brought about the abolition of ground rents.  The reality is that under the Constitution we must have regard to the fact that both ground rent tenants and ground rent landlords have rights.  Deputy Woods' Bill specifically recognises this through its provisions on compensation &mdash; provisions which would worsen considerably the position of ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>There is a long legislative history associated with ground rents, to which Deputy Woods has referred, and I do not propose to go over it again. Under the two Acts of 1978 and the 1987 Act, 65,000 householders have availed of the scheme to buy out their ground rents, many at a rate agreed with the ground rent landlord well below what they would pay under this Bill.  It is worth mentioning that the No. 2 Act of 1978 deprived a ground rent landlord of the right to repossess a dwellinghouse for non-payment of ground rent on foot of a covenant in the lease, leaving the landlord simply with the right to sue for any arrears as a civil debt.</P>
    <P>As part of my examination of this issue I will consider whether any improvements may be made to the present arrangements and will be happy to further examine the contents of this Bill, particularly in conjunction with the Attorney General, regarding the constitutionality of any proposals.  Equally I will take into account suggestions made by Deputies during the course of this debate.  While we are not opposing Second Stage, there are major problems with the approach taken in parts of the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
    <P>The central purpose of this Bill is achieved by section 7, which is the key section of the <Col N="1009" /> Bill.  The section provides that on a day to be appointed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform [or Justice as the Deputy has said] the interest of a person holding property under a ground rent lease is enlarged to the freehold (fee simple)...</P>
    <P>This is not actually what section 7 does.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>From the appointed day a person to whom this Part applies shall have the right as incident to his existing interest in land, to have that interest enlarged into the fee simple, and for that purpose any intermediate interests in the land shall be extinguished.</P>
    <P>The key phrase is &ldquo;have the right&rdquo; where the explanatory memorandum suggests the enlargement into the fee simple would take place automatically. There is a difference between the explanatory memorandum and what is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It may be that what is intended is the approach set out in the explanatory memorandum.  This would seem to be borne out by the fact that section 18 provides that, from the appointed day, the compensation to the landlord shall be deemed to be charged upon the interest which has been enlarged to the fee simple.  This would suggest that from the appointed day, the interest has actually been enlarged but section 7 creates a right to a fee simple, a right which a ground rent tenant already has, rather than a fee simple.  It would make no sense in section 18 to provide for the charging of compensation against an interest in land that has not come into being.</P>
    <P>Inconsistencies of this kind are riddled throughout the Bill and considerable work will be required to remedy them.  I hope in his reply Deputy Woods will clarify some of the conflicting approaches I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the technicalities &mdash; crucially important though they would be in practice &mdash; I ask Deputy Woods to reconsider the approach which is taken in the Bill which would, in effect, enable a landlord to force a tenant to buy out his or her ground rent.  That this is the effect of the Bill is clear from the explanatory memorandum which provides that the ground rent landlord will, not might, receive a right to compensation and that payment of this compensation will be secured by a charge on the new freehold premises.</P>
    <P>Under the present system, a tenant has the right to buy out a ground rent.  Under this Bill that right would be an obligation.  Obviously no one likes to have to pay ground rents but it seems odd to suggest to people who are concerned about the issue that their concerns will be addressed by imposing an obligation on them to pay 13 times their annual ground rent in one payment.</P>
    <P>There must be great doubts about the constitutionality of that proposal in terms of the rights of a tenant.  It would be most unfair to tenants &mdash; many of whom are hard pressed to keep up with their normal payment of bills &mdash; to impose on <Col N="1010" /> them a legally enforceable obligation to pay 13 times the amount of their ground rents all at once.  Incidentally, the proposal may also be unconstitutional in terms of a landlord's rights as well in as much as the legislation does not provide for interest to be payable on the compensation charge against the property.</P>
    <P>There is another major difficulty with the proposal which would work against the interests of tenants.  In the past many tenants using the special scheme have been able to negotiate buying out their ground rents at less than the &ldquo;multiplier&rdquo; rate which is used where agreement could not be reached.  Any incentive for a landlord to negotiate a lesser rate would be likely to disappear given the proposals in the Bill which would oblige the tenant to pay the full amount.  Clearly this aspect will have to be fundamentally considered and in accepting Second Stage I emphasise that the approach which the Bill takes on this issue is not acceptable to the Government.</P>
    <P>In approaching the question of improvements which may be possible in relation to ground rents it is important that we are honest with people about the parameters which will govern any changes.  It is the ground rent tenant who will have to pay the fair compensation to which a landlord will have a constitutional entitlement. Successive Governments have taken the view that there would be no question of using Exchequer funds to provide that compensation.  Such an approach would be inequitable to those who have used the existing scheme to buy out their ground rents.  People will have to accept that it is not open to the House to introduce legislation which will make ground rents disappear into thin air. I am not suggesting that improvements are not possible but it is only fair to emphasise the constraints which will arise in bringing about change in this area.</P>
    <P>There are four criteria against which any proposals for change must be judged.  They must be constitutional, workable, involve no cost to the Exchequer and represent a real improvement in the position for ground rent tenants.  One of the reasons it is important to emphasise the constraints involved is to avoid a situation where people, because of unrealistic expectations as to what might be achieved under future legislation, do not take action in relation to their ground rents and find themselves in difficult circumstances subsequently.</P>
    <P>As regards tenants who may shortly find that their lease has less than 15 years to run, the explanatory memorandum mentions that one of the proposals in the Bill is &ldquo;for leases which have expired or have less than 20 years to run, the householder will be entitled to the freehold on a similar basis, without having to pay a portion of the value of the house as was the case heretofore&rdquo;. I assume the reference to 20 years should be to 15 years.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for buying out ground rents which have less than 15 years to run differ from the position in relation to other ground rents in <Col N="1011" /> terms of the calculation of the amount payable to the landlord.  Instead of a multiplier of the annual ground rent, the amount payable is based on the value of the house up to a maximum of one eighth.  This is a difficult position for a tenant to be in.  I have been advised that this provision arises because the value of a lease to a landlord increases the closer the lease is to expiry and, in terms of vindicating the landlord's constitutional right to fair compensation, the formula relating to the value of the house was included in legislation. In those circumstances it would follow that there would be constitutional problems with what Deputy Woods proposes.  The obvious advice to give to tenants whose leases could be affected by the 15 year provision is to buy out their ground rents in good time to avoid this.</P>
    <P>The Bill raises a host of technical issues, only some of which I have outlined.  Great tracts of the Bill are borrowed from existing legislation and refer to dates which made sense in the context of when that legislation was originally introduced but would not always be appropriate in the context of this Bill.  Equally, there are provisions in the Bill dealing with registration which would need to be examined in detail in consultation with the Registrar of Titles and Deeds who would have to advise on the practicalities of what is being proposed.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that there are serious problems with aspects of the Bill but because of the Government's commitment to taking action on ground rents we will not be opposing it on Second Stage.  In the meantime, I will proceed with the examination to which I referred with a view to bringing forward proposals which would meet the criteria mentioned and which, unlike some of what this Bill proposes, would represent a real improvement in the position of ground rent tenants.  I will take into account all the points made during the course of the debate. I am sure Deputy Woods whom I have asked to reconsider the approach taken in the Bill, particularly in relation to forcing people to buy out their ground rents, will be prepared to do likewise.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, the Minister for Justice, for sharing her time with me.  As the House will be aware, this is a matter in which I have had an interest for some time.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to take action in relation to ground rents.  As the Minister for Justice said, her Department is studying how this commitment can best be given effect while being mindful of the constitutional problems which arise when one tries to legislate in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1994 which I introduced was voted down by Fianna Fáil, the champion of ground rent tenants, without making any attempt to accept or amend it or produce any proposals of its own.  The Programme <Col N="1012" /> for Government contains a commitment, based on the Bill I introduced, to deal with the problems encountered in this area.  The Government's decision not to oppose this Bill on Second Stage is a clear indication of its determination to deal with the matter and of the Minister's open-minded approach to it.  This is in contrast with the response I received when I introduced the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1994.</P>
    <P>If we are to solve this problem, we need to be imaginative in our approach.  If the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1994 had been accepted, the following four proposals would have been implemented: the transfer of the fee simple to all lessees of dwelling houses who are entitled to purchase the freehold; the landlord would be allowed to pursue moneys due as a contract debt; the removal of the remedy of seeking a court order directing committal to prison for non-payment of arrears and ground rent, and providing for persons whose leases have expired and who could be exposed to enormous penalties to be treated as if the lease had not expired.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice will judge these proposals against the four criteria mentioned &mdash; they must be constitutional, workable, involve no cost to the Exchequer and represent a real improvement in the position for ground rent tenants.  It is political chicanery of the highest order to introduce a Bill sent to a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice in 1987 as a Private Member's Bill when a Bill into which I put much effort was voted down by Fianna Fáil in 1994 without making any attempt to allay the serious concerns of those affected.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 1994 proposed to establish a statutory fee simple for every leaseholder of a dwelling house entitled to redeem the freehold interest and to convert the fee simple without prejudice to the rights or equities of existing landlords.  The landlord would have been able to continue to sue for payment as a debt.  The advantage from the homeowner's point of view would have been that, on the sale of a house, a solicitor would not have to hold up the sale while awaiting details of the title.  Since many of these landlords have disappeared they would not sue for the debt.  These issues can be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Although the proposals I have put forward may have flaws &mdash; this is a far better approach than the one proposed by Deputy Woods &mdash; they form the basis for a real solution to this problem.  This is a complex issue and has been left on the back burner for too long by successive Governments.  I congratulate this Minister on meeting the commitment in the programme for Government.  She will give this issue a high priority.  I look forward to the results of the examination currently under way in the Department as well as the legislation that will follow it as soon as possible.  There are other Ministers who have had proposals put to them but this is the first time in recent years that a Minister has accepted an Opposition Bill, though it badly needs to be amended.  The Minister <Col N="1013" /> for Justice is to be greatly admired for doing so; if I had received the same courtesy on introducing my Bill in 1994 we would have dealt with this problem three years ago.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Woods on introducing this Bill.  Over the past two years, the Opposition Front Bench has introduced a number of very important Bills, some of which were accepted by the Minister.  I commend her for accepting the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>An important Bill on this matter was introduced in 1967 by Fianna Fáil and two Bills in 1978 dealt with the abolition of ground rent and the compensation for landlords.  This Bill would abolish ground rent and register lands with the Land Registry.  Many people benefited under the previous Bills but approximately 250,000 people could benefit under this one.</P>
      <P>This is a comprehensive Bill and when one acknowledges that the Opposition does not have the Government's resources, further credit is due to Deputy Woods.  The Bill deals with extinct ground rent leases on an appointed day and it specifies those entitled to the freehold.  It deals with expired leases, ensures compliance with the Constitution and calculates how the payment of compensation will be made.  According to the Bill, the freehold owner will receive a special freehold certificate; it also deals with the arbitration procedures, local authority dwellings, the registration of new freehold titles and the costs involved.  However, the Bill does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the good work done by the Land League for rural householders.  A situation involving occupational leasehold in my hometown of Carrickmacross also applies to other towns.  The west side of the main street in Carrickmacross is owned by an absentee landlord, Mr. Shirley, who lives in Britain.  Many retail traders are obliged to pay occupational leasehold rent on 99 year leases which expired recently. They are now being charged exorbitant rents that amount to usury on the part of the landlord. People who were paying £20 a year are now paying £200 a week.  Recently, a person who was paying £65 a year is now paying £600 a week.  That is intolerable.</P>

      <P>No, occupational leasehold.  It is not covered in this Bill and legislation should address this.  Those involved are citizens of the State.  I respect the rights of landlords and their constitutional position, but this issue should be addressed on behalf of the retailers.  I will ask Deputy Woods to address this in his legislation <Col N="1014" /> when he occupies a seat on the other side of the House.</P>

      <P>It is totally unacceptable that someone who used to pay £1.25 is now paying £600 a week.  How can that be justified?  There has been much agitation in the town about this and rightly so.  When the urban district council wanted ground for a car park, the landlord objected and a compulsory purchase order was issued, which is also unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister should change the law.  It may be necessary to have a constitutional referendum as the matter dates from the foundation of the State. It is unacceptable as we approach the third milennium. If a constitutional referendum is necessary, it might be held in conjunction with another referendum.</P>
      <P>The retailers should also have the right to purchase the leasehold and the necessary legislation for this should be introduced.  In the meantime, there should be equitable occupational leasehold rents.  It is unacceptable that someone who was paying £65 a year should now have to pay £600 a week when the 99 year lease runs out.  The retailers' right are being trampled on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Government's acceptance of the Bill.  As Deputy Woods pointed out, it will end the outdated feudal ground rents system which still applies to approximately 250,000 homes.  This will be good news and a major breakthrough for thousands of families and homeowners.  When Second Stage passes, the Government should ensure that the Bill passes Committee and Final Stages without delay.  The Minister might look at the issue of occupational leasehold rents.</P>

      <P>I support this Bill in good faith because it is necessary that the matter be tidied up.  Many householders look at the democratic system and say surely there is enough ingenuity and common sense both in Government and Opposition to agree on providing time for debate on this issue.  Reasoned debate will allow amendments to the Bill to be proposed to seek modifications to it.  There is general desire to have this issue dealt with finally and in an equitable fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great tradition of home ownership in Ireland.  In my travels abroad I always reflect on <Col N="1015" /> the superb condition of homes in Ireland in urban and rural areas.  Many people take great pride in their homes because they own them.  It is a tradition worth supporting and facilitating.  This Bill indicates Fianna Fáil's support for home ownership. A simple system for home ownership registration should be provided so that the scourge of ground rents might be dealt with once and for all. There are about 250,000 homes to which ground rent applies.  It is an anachronism, an old fashioned landlord system.  However, landlords are entitled to equity and the Bill provides for compensation to be provided in an equitable manner.</P>
    <P>Many families make great sacrifices to own their homes.  There have been a number of buy out schemes over the years and they have been supported to a large extent.  People save money, pay mortgages and deprive themselves of holidays and other luxuries to own their homes.  The right to freehold ownership is dearly held.  This Bill addresses the issue.  If Second Stage is agreed it will allow the Government to prepare whatever amendments it feels are needed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to a specific problem in his area.  A similar problem with expired leases exists in a number of towns in my constituency. There are also difficulties with some public buildings, for example, schools which have ground rent problems.  The Bill addresses those problems in section 7.  Sections 35 to 40 set out a procedure for arbitration in disputes concerning any matters which may arise.  It is important to regularise matters through arbitration to achieve equity.  Sections 42 and 43 deal with the registration of new freehold titles.</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Woods for his diligence in the preparation of this Bill.  A feature of this session of the Dáil has been the number of Bills which have been brought forward by the Opposition. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that the Fianna Fáil Party when in Opposition brings forward legislation to abolish ground rents.  It is amazing what a spell in Opposition can do.  When my party was in Opposition it proposed the abolition of ground rents but we could not get Fianna Fáil to accept the proposal.  It is amazing how progressive it can appear in Opposition.  Deputy Woods and others in his party are past masters at the strategy of opportunism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1016" /> That said, I congratulate Fianna Fáil on drafting this Bill.  As drafted, it is imperfect although that is often the case with Opposition Bills because of the spontaneity with which it reacts to pressure.  It is the first step in addressing the plight of thousands of householders caught in the ground rent trap.  I regret that Fianna Fáil did not support Private Members' Bills introduced in the past by my colleagues the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, but I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>Ground rents are an anachronism which have no place in a modern state.  They represent the last vestige of absentee landlords.  We are close to consigning them to history, where they should have been consigned long ago.  It has long been an affront to the principles of natural justice that a householder does not own the freehold of the land on which his or her home is built.  During the past 20 years as many as 17,000 people have been faced with court demands to pay their ground rents bills.  Of those, 176 received custodial sentences of which five were served.</P>
    <P>A ground rent landlord may claim one-eighth of the property's value when the lease expires. With property prices rising sharply, especially in urban areas, householders can find themselves faced with substantial bills.  If they are unable to raise one-eighth of the property's value they have no option but to renew the ground rent lease for a further 99 years at a new rent which may be as much as 50 or 60 times the original rent.</P>
    <P>As more and more householders reach the end of their leases they become increasingly concerned. Increasing numbers of them are facing demands which they cannot meet.  Will the Minister for Justice indicate if this can be remedied by way of order?  Under section 26 of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, the Minister is entitled to amend, by way of order, section 18(4) of the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  This section stipulates the proportion of the property's value which reverts upon expiry of the lease.  If it transpires after further research that relief is possible, the current fraction of one-eighth should be substantially reduced, even in advance of the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Ground rent landlords never lose as they can either claim a lump sum of many thousands of pounds or impose a massive increase in ground rents.  It is little wonder that the original ground rent landlords and their descendants are being bought out by companies.  These companies buy ground rents in job lots in the hope of making a killing when the short-term leases expire.  Democratic Left has consistently argued in favour of the abolition of ground rents.  The programme, A Government of Renewal, contains a commitment to introduce legislation which will abolish ground rents as a specific lean on residential property and convert them instead into normal commercial debts.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the interest of the ground rent tenant should be enlarged to a statutory <Col N="1017" /> freehold interest and that whatever compensation is due to the landlord should be secured by a charge on freehold premises.  One of my concerns about the Bill is that it provides for compensation for the ground rent landlord even though it is the aggrieved party, the householder, who has been denied the freehold of his or her land.  Democratic Left believes that any legislation dealing with ground rents should set a date for the ending of the ground rent system, apply equally to all leases whether current or expired, address the alleged need to compensate the landlord, revise the draconian penalties and put in place a simple and inexpensive method of reregistering new freehold titles.  I ask the Minister to take our views on board so that we can get rid of ground rents once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the legislation and compliment Deputy Woods on introducing it. The abolition of ground rents has been a long-term policy of all parties.  It is also part of the programme, A Government of Renewal, which was agreed by this Government and its predecessor. I am glad the Government is accepting the legislation.  When we have dealt with this part of our colonial past we should consider the relationship between landlords and tenants in private rented accommodation.  Even though it is provided for in law, there is no registration system for landlords and there are no adequate structures in terms of standards and safety regulations. However, this is a matter for another day.</P>
      <P>There is widespread political consensus on this issue.  The anachronistic legislation in this area prevented us from dealing with this matter because of the danger of infringing the constitutional provisions on private property.  It is clearly recognised that the legislation in this area belongs to a bygone era and should be dealt with effectively.  This legacy from the past caused much pain and was a major bone of contention between our past rulers and the indigenous population. It is absurd that property owners should still be subjected to a charge based on archaic legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree with the thrust of the Bill but it requires radical surgery before it is acceptable. For example, if enacted as currently drafted tenants would be required to pay several hundreds of pounds to buy out ground rent of £40-£50.  We are either talking about a substantial bill for many homeowners or an accumulated very substantial bill for the Government and we must ensure that neither is the case.  We must not require the Government to pick up the tab or put homeowners in a position where they have to pay large amounts to buy out the ground rent on their property.  These important issues need to be addressed.  I urge the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, to ensure the Government carries out a thorough examination of all the complex issues involved in the abolition of ground rent, particularly the constitutional aspects, the entitlements <Col N="1018" /> of the owners of private property and the legal status guaranteed by property.</P>
    <P>Any legislation which makes a realistic attempt to reform the issue of ground rents must take cognisance of the provisions of the Constitution, must not give rise to excessive costs for tenants and must immediately ameliorate the current problem.  It is almost 20 years since the 1978 legislation which made it legal to create new ground rents was introduced.  It would be unsatisfactory if the Minister was to accept the legislation as presently drafted.  However, I am sure Deputy Woods will give favourable consideration to amendments, as otherwise we could do an injustice to tenants who would have to pay the ground rent.  It will not be easy to find a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Ground rents are unacceptable to everyone and all parties examined the matter in the hope of bringing forward legislation to deal with the issue.  While there is no easy solution to the problem, the Government must grasp this nettle.  I am glad the Government has accepted the Bill and I look forward to teasing out on Committee Stage the various complex constitutional issues, the rights of homeowners and the burden on the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The time for the debate is, of necessity, restricted but I am very happy the Government has agreed to accept the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the freehold certificate.  The end result of the process is that a new freehold owner will receive a document, to be known as a freehold certificate, which will become his or her primary document until registered in the Land Registry.  This document will be in a prescribed form and will contain all the relevant information in simple language concerning the interests extinguished and the new freeholder.  It must be completed by the parties to the transaction, or the arbitrator in the event of arbitration.  Where the property is a dwelling house, this can be done through the Land Registry at minimal cost and without the necessity of employing lawyers.  This procedure is broadly similar to that set up in the Act of 1978.</P>
      <P>In her contribution the Minister said difficulties could arise with the Land Registry and that there would have to be discussions with it.  What we are proposing is a major change which will involve simplification and several Deputies said they welcome that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 deals with housing authority dwellings. These are dealt with on the same basis as all other dwellings.  The special vesting procedure by way of transfer order contained in the 1978 Act cannot be retained because, in many instances, the local authority would not, on the appointed day, be the owner of the freehold and therefore would not have been in a position to vest the freehold. The interest of the former freeholder and any other former intermediate owners could not be adequately protected if the procedure used in <Col N="1019" /> relation to local authority dwellings was adhered to.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared to suggest there were good reasons nothing was done in this area over many years, but local authority dwellings belong to the State.  There is no reason this could not have been done over those years.  There is not the same degree of complexity that exists in some of the other cases.  There is a clear case which affects a large number of houses and on which it would have been possible to proceed.</P>
    <P>The registration of new freehold titles in the Land Registry is a key policy element in the Bill. The object of this is to simplify urban titles in a manner similar to that achieved with rural titles since the beginning of this century.  This would make subsequent transfers of those properties simpler and cheaper.  Sections 42 and 43 deal with the registration of the new freehold titles in the Land Registry.  A system of compulsory registration is provided for but only becomes effective on the order of the Minister for Justice.  Otherwise, the Act provides for registration on production in the Land Registry of a freehold certificate.</P>
    <P>The question of costs was raised by the Minister. The whole basis of the costs is, as the Minister suggested, similar to that which applies under the 1978 Act and there is consequently only a minimal cost involved.  The Minister gave an extreme example of this, and raised some other questions, but it is important to realise we are now in the position of firing the last shot.  ACRA recently welcomed this last shot and the fact that we were resolving this problem.  We are now at the stage where all parties in the House agree to the principle of the Bill.  The Bill is complex, although some elements are simple such as the one dealing with local authority dwellings.  We must balance the constitutional rights of landlords and their tenants, and that is what we are doing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, under the Bill, a tenant currently paying £50 per year would be obliged to make a one-off payment of £650 under the existing scheme, using a multiplier of 13.  Ground rents are currently of the order of £10, £12, £15 or £18 per year.  The Minister highlighted an exceptional case and then used the highest possible multiplier to frighten us.  I do not know why she is doing that because she is accepting the Bill, subject to amendment on Committee Stage.  That applies to Bills brought forward by the Government. By the time they are completed, 120, 150 or 300 amendments may have been made by committees of the House.  I welcome the fact that the Government has agreed to accept the principle of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a charge.  There will be a charge under the Bill but it can be allowed to run as a charge on the property.  If the Minister has a better way of doing this, I will include it in the Bill, but this method is acceptable in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> We have left it to the Minister to fix, by regulations, a time in the Bill for the abolition of ground rents.  That matter can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that I was involved in trying to get a Bill of this kind through the House in 1987 when I was Minister for Social Welfare.  Prior to that I was a spokesperson on justice and had examined this question with a view to finding a solution.  Until recently, I was spokesperson on equality and law reform.  I have constantly raised this issue, as have ACRA and many Deputies in the House.  We want this change implemented.  I make no apologies for my interest in this matter and will continue to pursue it until a solution is found.  The Minister also referred to the conflicting rights of landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for interest to be payable on the compensation charged against a property.  We purposely did not provide that as we considered it inappropriate.  There is also a Statute of Limitations on interest, of which the Minister will be aware.  There are three ways to deal with these questions.  They can be dealt with by agreement using the multiplier under the existing formula or arbitration.  Those options remain open for people to pursue.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Bill should be constitutional, workable, involve no cost to the Exchequer and a real improvement.  The Bill will be constitutional, workable and will not involve a cost to the Exchequer.  The cost for the individual will be low, approximately £30 for registration. The Bill will represent a real improvement for ground rent tenants.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the lease from 15 to 20 years can be discussed subsequently.  It is important that we do not become involved in the minutiae of this complex issue.  The parties have agreed in principle to this legislation which will abolish ground rents once and for all.  That is what people want us to do and we should proceed now to Committee Stage on which we can discuss the various details.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 13, line 30, after &ldquo;facilities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including the fixing of different fees for different circumstances and for different classes of <Col N="1023" /> persons and the fixing of fees for some circumstances only or for all circumstances or for some classes of persons only or for all classes of persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 22, 24, 25 and 26 are my amendments.  Deputy de Valera tabled amendment No. 27.  I was pleased to be in a position to introduce further initiatives on Committee Stage to ensure the securing of the maximum amount of real public access should any general entry charge system be contemplated by the boards of the museum, library or gallery.  I introduced criteria which must be taken into account before any such scheme can be introduced.  We discussed the by-laws in relation to admission charges.  This amendment was in addition to that already provided, that no general entry charges can be introduced by a board unless approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Short of an absolute statutory prohibition this is the maximum regulatory protection that can be afforded.  This recognises that if it should arise it would be a major policy issue that was worthy of consideration by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the latest amendments, Nos. 24, 25 and 26, I am making some further technical adjustments to fine-tune the wording of the criteria provision introduced on Committee Stage.  I am also providing an amendment, No. 22, to ensure that in any by-law being framed on this issue there will be the option to introduce different scales of charges.  As presently worded, it could be interpreted that no such discretion was possible.</P>
    <P>The other change to note is in amendment No. 26.  This makes explicit, as I had intended by my earlier amendment and as I undertook on Committee Stage, the need to ensure a reasonable degree of access without charge for children in particular, described in the amendment as persons under the age of 18 years.  Any scheme must still ensure an enhanced quality of service to the public on a sustainable basis and actively contribute to the level of appreciation of the collection concerned within the Irish public as a whole. These provisions are to ensure that the primary aims and objectives of the Bill to contribute to a widening and deepening of sensibilities in relation to the collections are adequately met.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 24, following the proposed deletion therein, the following amendment is required: In page 13, line 37, paragraph (a) to delete the words &ldquo;enable the Board&rdquo; and replace with the words &ldquo;the need&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The text currently reads: &ldquo;a Board shall have regard to whether the proposed bye-laws would&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) enable the Board to provide an enhanced service to members of the public in Ireland,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The text, once amended, will read:&rdquo; a Board shall have regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1024" /> (a) the need to provide an enhanced service to members of the public in Ireland,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the light of these comments I urge Deputy de Valera to consider withdrawing her amendment No. 27.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining his amendments.  I appreciate that he is taking on board the spirit of the conversation we had on Committee Stage regarding the Opposition's concerns on fees.  Although I readily recognise the Oireachtas will have the final say in this matter &mdash; the Minister has made provision for that in the Bill &mdash; and that amendment No. 26 provides that a different position will pertain for those under the age of 18, the general principle of payment concerns me.  It would be acceptable to provide for a charge for specific exhibitions, but I cannot accept the principle of payment in general terms as proposed and I intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance the Minister has struck a fair balance.  I am in favour of maintaining the principle of access to the greatest degree possible in law, but I would not like to put in place a law that would preclude forever the possibility of imposing charges for specific exhibitions or activities within either of the two institutions. I am grateful the Minister has provided for an exclusion for persons under 18 years. There should be free access at all times for children so that they are introduced to the practice of visiting the museum and see it as part of their rightful inheritance.  Citizens should not take for granted that the collection of the museum or library will be there forever without them being called upon at some stage to contribute to their maintenance or the acquisition of new purchases. We should write into law the possibility of introducing charges at a given time for certain activities provided that is done only with the consent of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  That is a good balance and I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 43 in the name of Deputy de Valera.  Amendment No. 45 is related and amendment No. 44 is an alternative to amendment No. 43.  It is suggested, therefore, that amendments Nos. 43, 44 and 45 be taken together if that is satisfactory.</P>

      <P>In page 17, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  2 shall be representatives of the staff,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the Minister's proposal to have one representative of staff.  The principle of worker director has worked very well in semi-State bodies.  We have only to look at Telecom Éireann, the ESB and Bord na Móna to see that is the case.  I am sure it is Labour Party policy to ensure that workers have a say.  The same principles should apply in this case.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that one staff representative need not necessarily be a director or a chief executive.  Two representatives would be more appropriate, but in saying that I am not casting aspersions on any director of an institution.</P>

      <P>Section 19 spells out the principle of staff representation.  As I said on Committee Stage, the provision reflected in section 19 provides a novel and important measure for involving the staff of the National Museum and the National Library on their respective boards and provides for a staff representative on each board.  A panel of nominees will be provided from which the Minister will select one to serve in a personal capacity.  While I am happy to provide that there should be one staff member serving on the board, I have serious reservations about increasing the number to more than one. The number of staff in each institution is less than 100 compared to Radio Teilifís Éireann, which has a staff of almost 2,000 and only one staff member on the Authority.  As I indicated on <Col N="1028" /> Committee Stage, the approach set out in section 19 is the most appropriate.  Will Deputies Quill and de Valera consider these points?</P>

      <P>I spoke at great length on this issue on Committee Stage.  My amendment proposes that the nominee of the nominating body should be appointed by the Minister.  It is wrong of the Minister to ask the nominating body to put forward a selection of people from which he would then select a nominee.  That would constitute excessive interference by the Minister in the business of selecting a board that should be independent. I had hoped the Minister would respond to my comments on Committee Stage about excessive ministerial control over the appointments to the proposed boards by tabling an amendment on Report Stage, but there is no evidence of that.</P>

      <P>I share Deputy Quill's concern on this matter.  The word &ldquo;selected&rdquo; conjures up negative feelings.  The reference at the end of Committee Stage to which party or member of the committee was more republican was made in jest.  However, a reference to &ldquo;selected&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;nominated&rdquo; would give the wrong signals and could be seen as downgrading the institutions, even though that may not be the Minister's intention.  The spirit of the two amendments is similar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments put forward by Deputies Quill and de Valera seek to provide that the nominations to the boards of the National Museum and the National Library by the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society, respectively, should be provided by those institutions without a selection input from the Minister other than to refuse a nomination of an unfit person.  The person will serve on the board in a personal capacity.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the general issue of nominating bodies and the issue of board members serving in a personal capacity is very important.  When the person is appointed to the board he or she will participate in a total rather than representative sense.  The provisions regarding the Royal Irish Academy and the Royal Dublin Society constitute special cases because of the legal agreement existing since the 19th century and their long involvement in the governing structure of these bodies.  While I have been happy to make appropriate provision for such long-standing involvements, I am generally reluctant to reduce the flexibility of the Minister to appoint a board that would meet particular needs and requirements at that time.  The Minister of the day, for example, would have to take account of the external circumstances, the environment in which the institution was functioning, gender balance and other matters.</P>
      <P>My approach to the composition of the boards has a clear underlying philosophical basis.  In proposing boards of the museum and library, I am providing that the Minister of the day who is accountable to Dáil Éireann, representing the public, will be responsible for appointing all the members of the respective boards, and that such persons will serve in their personal capacities.  Because of the long association of the RDS and the RIA with the museum and library, I am providing that their role will be reflected in nominating people to the board without compromising the basic principle that the Minister of the day selects the persons to be appointed to the board.  As I said, this approach is acceptable to both bodies, was discussed in some detail with them and has been agreed with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I highlighted on Committee Stage, the structures being created reflect a basic belief in the democratic structures of the State, a belief that trusts the elected Minister of the day, of whatever political party, to act in the public interest.  I respectfully ask Deputies Quill and de <Col N="1030" /> Valera to consider withdrawing their amendments, although I respect the principles on which they were put forward.</P>

      <P>The concerns I expressed on Committee Stage and this evening have not been allayed by what the Minister has said.  In light of the history and tradition of the two nominating bodies, their judgment in nominating fit persons to serve on the two proposed boards should not be undermined by any Minister.  I object very strongly to any Minister reserving the right to be the final arbiter on who is the best person to act on behalf of the nominating bodies.  It rankles in my republican blood.  I am pressing my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This was discussed at length on Committee Stage. The association of Irish antique dealers expressed their concern regarding the removal of the 25 year rule.

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>A balance must be struck regarding, on the one hand, the protection of items of cultural and heritage value that need to be kept, wherever possible, in the ownership of the State and which the law must protect because of their importance to our heritage and, on the other hand, concern that this new law may interfere with the normal commercial transaction of buying and selling, for example, of the kind undertaken by the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, which engages in legitimate trade in antique furniture and paintings.  This activity should not be inhibited.</P>
      <P>I spoke on this matter at length on Committee Stage and I expected the Minister to introduce an amendment to address my concerns and those expressed by Deputy de Valera.  How does he propose to address them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This was considered in detail on Committee Stage.  It is a matter of striking a balance between what is constitutive of the national heritage and what is legitimate commercial practice where it affects objects of art.  The effect of the amendment would be to require that the export licence requirement in the case of paintings should be set at 50 rather than 25 years of age, as proposed in the Bill, or no limit, as is the current legal position.</P>
      <P>I oppose the amendment for a number of reasons.  It is a matter to be handled through procedure rather than legislation.  I have already put measures in place to ensure that this provision will only be operated as appropriate.  These include options to change the various age limits, to set and change value limits under which the provisions would not apply, to exclude certain categories of cultural objects from the export licence requirement and for the issue of licences upon an intent to export or, for instance, in advance of a sale.  All these measures provide ample scope to refine the requirement in so far as paintings are concerned and as the need arises.</P>
      <P>The 25 year cut off point is appropriate for the reasons I advanced on Committee Stage.  There has been a cultural renaissance in the visual arts in Ireland since the 1940s, led by such importance artists as Louis le Brocque.  This was ground breaking work, especially from that exciting moment of the ROSC exhibition held in 1967, which provided an important focal point for a renaissance.  The work of the late 1960s is, therefore, of cultural importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that a licence requirement in this area can be appropriately limited to a relatively manageable number of named painters based on their established reputations and I propose to operate the provision as it stands with this limited objective in mind.  In response to what the Deputies opposite have said, my Department will consult with relevant interests, such as the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, about the proposed <Col N="1034" /> list of named painters before the section is brought into force.  Given such procedural suggestions, it may be fruitful for the Deputies to consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's assurances, any painting over 25 years, regardless of its monetary value, will require a licence before export. This is bad law.  Provisions should be made by law rather than by regulation.  We should define in law the age and monetary value of objects that will be covered by the requirement of the Bill and exclude objects that are the subject of commercial transactions, which are mainly undertaken by the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland.  I am unhappy with the Minister's reply to the substance and spirit of the amendment.</P>

      <P>(9)  Items included in household removals out of the State shall be excluded from the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>(10)  Items of purely commercial value shall be excluded from the provisions of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have already spoken on the spirit of this amendment. An excessive bureaucracy may result from the implementation of the Bill leading to an undue delay in the issuing of export licences which will have a detrimental effect on the legitimate commercial activities of dealers in antique goods.  I strongly recommend that provision should be made in primary law to ensure that no undue delay will be allowed.  I am conscious the law we are enacting is much more restrictive than that which applies to the export of cultural goods in other EU member states where a 50 year rule, not a 25 year rule, applies.  While I accept there is an overwhelming need to protect heritage items and our track record in that area in law and in general practice has not been good, we must strike the right balance.  I do not understand why our law on these matters cannot be brought into line with European law, which I expect is proving to be the correct law to give the proper protection to heritage items that are our main concern in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Quill on that matter.  The question of streamlining the acquisition of licences must be considered.  I mentioned on Committee Stage that a code of practice might be considered.  I said it might not be appropriate to this Bill, but the Minister might consider it as a mechanism for tying up related matters at a later date.  I understand what the Minister is trying to do, but without having the type of balance he wishes to achieve we are making matters very difficult for dealers.</P>

      <P>I note the spirit in which those points were made and I hope what I say will go some way towards alleviating the concerns the Deputies legitimately expressed.  The section deals with export licences and exemption from licence requirement time limits.  Section 49(4) introduced on Committee Stage provides a reasonable measure of flexibility so that certain categories of cultural objects coming within the scope of the export licence requirement do not unnecessarily become subject to it.  That is what we were seeking to achieve.  As I said, an example of what is envisaged would be cited under this heading is cultural objects imported into the State <Col N="1036" /> temporarily for the purpose of exhibition and sale.  To reiterate, this proposed legislative structure for making exclusions from the export licence requirement also provides a general framework for the citing of other instances where export licensing would not be considered appropriate. I would not be willing at this stage to spell out the full extent of the use of this provision, but it will be focused as clearly as possible on the cultural imperatives involved.  I could not accept an exemption for all household removals, if such removals included valuable cultural heritage objects, but I could accept that we would try to exclude ordinary household removals.  In view of points put forward I am happy to undertake that my Department, in implementing this provision, will consult with relevant interests such as the Irish Antique Dealers Association.  I hope that meets Deputy Quill's concerns on this matter as expressed, in particular, in subsections (9) and (10) of her amendment.</P>
      <P>Regarding subsection (8) of her amendment which relates to time limits, the current position is that where licences are required they are issued as quickly as possible, in most cases in substantially less than six months.  That will continue to be the practice.  The only exemption envisaged is for items in subsection 1(d) where important cultural objects entered in the register are involved. The Minister will have the power to impose a condition that items cannot be exported before the expiration of one year.  This allows time in the case of important objects to see if they can be kept in the State and resources provided to keep them there.  As I said on Committee Stage, my inclination is not to impose a time limit as envisaged by Deputy Quill for the issue of licences as there may be a tendency for the time period for all issuings of licences to drift towards the maximum period.  However, I accept the Deputy's concerns on that point and I am happy to undertake that in implementing the provisions of this Bill the orders to be made under subsection (4) will provide that, for the categories where a licence cannot be refused, in default of the issue of a licence within six months it will be deemed to be excluded from the export licence requirement. In the light of this undertaking I ask the Deputy to withdraw her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 43, line 2, after &ldquo;one month&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or such longer period as the Board of the Library may in any particular case allow&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments deals with mandatory deposit of library material to the National Library, deposit upon request only where certain Irish library material is concerned and the possibility for the extension of the time limit for deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I signalled on Committee Stage that I would introduce some amendments of a largely technical nature to the mandatory deposit provisions as they apply to books and other library material. These amendments are designed to fine tune the mandatory deposit requirements while at the same time providing some extra flexibility when <Col N="1038" /> the provision is being operated by the National Library.</P>
    <P>The amendments provide that the provision which widens the definition of &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; as set out in section 65(3)(b) will apply only in respect of the National Library rather than all the institutions listed in the 1963 Copyright Act and that paragraph (b) will apply only where the library requests such material, whether in the form of books as defined in the Copyright Act, 1963 or the types of library material covered in section 65 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendments also provide that a time limit of one year following publication is also being placed for the making of a request.  In particular, I draw the attention of Deputies to amendment No. 65 in which it is proposed to provide that the basic time limit of one month for deposit of the library material, other than in the form of books after publication, would be extendable at the discretion of the National Library.  This point was put to me during discussions.  The possibility of a longer time limit is considered desirable.  It was represented by certain interests that it would alleviate the fears of film interests where there might be a reluctance to make a deposit of a film reel in mint condition while the film in question still held a strong commercial value as would be the case soon after its general release.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 69, the reference to subsection (2) should be read as meaning the appropriate reference if amendment No. 66 is accepted.  It is consequential and consistent.  I commend the amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on introducing a thorough Bill in his usual professional and comprehensive manner.  I welcome the Bill which provides a statutory framework for the development and growth of the credit union movement. It will enable credit unions to provide an enhanced range of services to their members.</P>
      <P>The credit union is an essential part of community life in rural and urban areas.  It is difficult to believe that the first credit union opened just 40 years ago.  Today there are 434 credit unions with approximately £2 billion in savings and approximately 1.6 million members.  Credit unions have established a niche for themselves as providers of personal finance in the community in a different way from banks and building societies. I pay tribute to the thousands of volunteers and part-time workers whose efforts have made the credit union movement flourish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the movement, whether or not they are actively working in their credit unions, are helping by investing their savings in their local community.  This sense of local pride and the ethos of community self-help is being used in the local development programme.  This scheme, for which I have responsibility, is on target to create over 8,000 jobs in areas of greatest need on the basis of local action plans prepared by local communities. The Bill maintains the fundamental ethos of credit unions as community self-help institutions.  However, it also gives credit unions <Col N="1042" /> the necessary flexibility to develop additional services, such as foreign exchange, insurance products and ATM facilities.  We live in a fast changing world and the credit union movement must be allowed to develop its range of services if it is to continue to provide the level of service expected by its members.</P>
    <P>I made a suggestion to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, which may or may not be appropriate to Committee Stage of this Bill depending on the advice he receives.  I respect that but this matter needs to be addressed either in this Bill or other legislation.  Credit unions should be involved in forming undertaker co-operatives to offer members cheaper burial services in Dublin.  This problem is specific to Dublin and does not, I understand, arise outside the capital. Therefore, my comments are based on my knowledge of the problem in Dublin.  The cost of funerals in Dublin is scandalously high.  Dubliners, when at their lowest ebb in times of bereavement, deserve the option of an alternative to mainstream undertakers who oblige them to sign up for funerals costing £3,000 and more, hundreds of pounds being charged for every movement of a mourning car for what is in effect a short taxi ride.  As far as I am aware it is a Dublin problem and does not have the same implications elsewhere.  At present credit unions write off existing loans when a member dies and pay double the value of shares held at the time of death.</P>
    <P>I should like to see credit unions build on that provision for members by helping to form funeral co-operatives which would allow grieving relatives to bury a deceased member at a reasonable cost.  It is this cost incurred at a most difficult time for people with which I am concerned.  I have on file going back to 1991 of a series of invoices for funerals furnished to the poorest of people in Dublin for what they consider to be &ldquo;giving the best&rdquo; to their departed loved ones.  One is for a sum of £2,454 dated 24 September 1991, and others are for £2,123 and £2,416 bearing dates in 1991 and 1992.</P>
    <P>It is not by any means an exaggeration to maintain that funerals in Dublin can cost an average poor family £3,000 they cannot afford.  If the terms of reference of credit unions were amended slightly &mdash; to allow them go beyond their present funeral provisions &mdash; and become involved in some way, in a co-operative funeral service for their members, we would be doing a signal service to the people of Dublin who are being preyed upon &mdash; and I make no apology for using that term &mdash; when at their lowest.  We must devise some legislative means of dealing with this problem, if not in this, then in some other Bill.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have helped to develop communities, providing an honest, fair alternative to unscrupulous money lenders.  I welcome the provision which will allow people under 16 to join credit unions.  Many young people are familiar with the credit union movement because of its sponsorship of the national community games. Allowing young people to become members of <Col N="1043" /> credit unions will introduce them to saving, to the concept of responsible borrowing and repayment at an early age.  In that way we can stop the next generation falling into the hands of loan sharks.</P>
    <P>This Bill will help the credit union movement to grow and be of even greater significance in the 21st century.  My colleague has done a great service in introducing this Bill and I look forward to it being enacted.</P>
    <P>This matter of funeral expenses is a very real problem &mdash; in Government we should not say anything different to what we would say in Opposition &mdash; it is a scandal visited on very poor people in this city at a very difficult time.  We must find a means of tackling it and stand up for them against people milking them dry at such times.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State's deep interest in funereal matters has long been known in this House and is greatly to be admired.  I am glad of this opportunity to make some positive contributions to this debate.</P>
      <P>Our Party Whip will take up in greater detail a letter dated 10 March 1997 addressed by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment to the Secretary of each credit union branch or to the League of Credit Unions which began as follows:</P>
      <P>I feel I should briefly bring you up to date on the progress of the Credit Union Bill through the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately, due to an organised filibuster by the main Opposition party ...</P>
      <P>He maintained that he does not know what parliamentary antics are being engaged in or what kind of &ldquo;road shows&rdquo; are being held around the country.  In arrogance and pomposity, he seeks to upbraid the credit unions and the main Opposition party.  There has been a response from the League of Credit Unions, and a further one this evening addressed to all Members.</P>
      <P>I find very strange the manner in which the Minister has sought to truncate this debate which is in line with what the Taoiseach sought to do in the case of the Education Bill last week.  The credit union movement lobbied and met individual Members of this House.  I do not know whether that could be described as &ldquo;road shows&rdquo; which, to me, have a wider meaning than the very sedate, well documented and educative meeting I had with my local credit union about this Bill on two occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our party Whip will take this point further <i>vis-á-vis</i> parliamentary democracy.  I hope we still live in an era in which people are entitled to make their representations known, put forward their case, state their aims, objectives and objections for translation into amendments by their locally elected representatives.  This is the strangest correspondence I have ever seen on the issue before this House and does not do justice to the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and <Col N="1044" /> Employment.  He is reputed to be arrogant and pompous but these two items of correspondence and the one I received this evening are truly amazing and do little to underpin The Workers' Party, now Democratic Left, and its wish to participate in genuine parliamentary democracy. Indeed, in his position as Minister of State, sitting at the Cabinet table, it is a disgraceful, deliberate flouting of proper democratic investigation and observations on a Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this much needed Bill is timely but it needs careful scrutiny on Second and Committee Stages.  The credit union movement is at a cross roads, wanting to thrust forward in a modern age and be at one with overall national development.  The provisions of the Bill, as drafted, are intrusive, tending to centralise control, and unwarranted in the case of a movement founded on principles of self-help, regulation and responsibility, which should be encouraged in other areas of economic and social activity.</P>
    <P>It would be well for Members to examine the history of the credit union movement.  Why has Nora Herlihy not been referred to in this debate? I searched through the contribution of each Member so far and found but one reference to her, by Deputy John Browne.  As Minister for Education I launched Nora Herlihy's book in 1990 at INTO headquarters.  She, the founder of the Credit Union League, for many years was a primary teacher in this city, having taught in many disadvantaged areas, in Basin Lane, Harold's Cross, in Crumlin and at the centre for children with physical and other disabilities.  She was brought up in Ballydesmond, worked her way into becoming a primary teacher, had very constructive ideas and always retained the ethos and principles of the credit union movement.  While the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, may sigh and, in their usual arrogant way, think they have heard it all before, I did not hear them mention Nora Herlihy nor did I hear any other Member refer to the fact that it was a woman who started this movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Through the ideas she absorbed and her pioneering work, Nora Herlihy sought to have expression to the emerging spirit in Ireland, the need to break through a morass of discontent and deprivation and to look to an earlier age which in turn harkened back to the mid- <Col N="1045" /> 19th century, the ideas of Robert Owen, developments in Germany and Nova Scotia and the famous priest who laboured there in the co-operative movement, Fr. Finlay, Con Murphy and Pat the Cope Gallagher as head of the co-operative movement.  All those ideas sought neither Government money nor EU funds, grants or subsidies but to energise and invigorate the people to help themselves.  It is interesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, is present. The pioneers of the Irish credit union movement in the 1950s relied on community development and did not seek moneys.  They were the true founders of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the individual credit unions throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the history of the credit unions which has a bearing on the present and the future.  Neither the Bill nor the Minister's contribution on Second Stage pays tribute to what has gone before or builds on it in a proper cohesive sense.  We need to maintain in the Bill the strong voluntary effort which was the hallmark of the beginning of the credit union movement. If we lose sight of that we have lost sight of what it is all about.</P>
      <P>The Bill suffers from four major defects.  It is over intrusive; it seeks too much monitoring and regulation &mdash; while there is a need for proper regulation, in the main voluntary effort is better done in a self-regulatory way; it seeks to put a cap on investments of shareholders and all the various activities of a credit union where obviously the percentage basis is the determining factor at which the activity is to be carried out. An attractive characteristic of credit unions is that they vary.  There can be a large credit union in some part of a city and a tiny one in a village in a remote part of Ireland but both are seeking to do what the founders of the co-operative movement, in an agricultural or commercial sense, be it in Germany, Nova Scotia or in Donore, set out to do which was to awaken the spirit of people and use it as an engine for growth and community development.  They did not think of great financial institutions or profit or motivation but only of what they were doing.  To impose a cap without reference to the activity of each individual credit union is an incorrect stance to take and I hope the Minister will look at it.</P>
      <P>I regret there is not a clear recognition of the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions and the need not to have a centralised unit but an umbrella organisation as a reference point, for guidance and general direction in the whole credit union movement.  They are the major faults of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to read the contribution of the then Minister of State, Mr. Seán Flanagan, with Seán Lemass as the guiding Minister, and the contributions of other Members to the debate on the 1966 Act.  They caught the atmosphere of what was afoot in the credit union movement and the need to lift Ireland out of a protectionist age. Strangely enough we were going back to a protectionism <Col N="1046" /> but in a more comfortable setting at local community level.  The contributions on that occasion caught the spirit of the credit union movement.</P>
    <P>The whole debate has been interesting and I hope the Minister of State has learned much from it and in particular that he will reflect on what I have said regarding its beginnings.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that John Hume started his working life as a guide and motivator of the credit union in Derry.  In the forward to the book by Nora Herlihy, which I launched in 1990, he said that there is scarcely a town or village in Ireland today that one can drive through without passing a credit union office.  That is correct. There is scarcely a town or village in Ireland that does not have a committee comprised of voluntary workers, working in a civic spirit for the regeneration of their community.  In an era of county enterprise boards, Leader programmes, back to work schemes, FÁS, Forbairt, IDA (Ireland), Forfás which seek to create employment, the credit union in its modest business activity is a great engine for growth, particularly for people seeking finance to pursue their entrepreneurial ideas.  I see little expression of that either in the Bill or in the Minister's contribution on Second Stage.  I would like to see that idea advanced.</P>
    <P>Given the way in which the Bill is drafted I see the hand of other credit institutions, for example, finance houses who probably said there are 450 odd credit unions throughout the country who are taking business from them.  I say well done to an open friendly institution, known to the people of its area, where members can do their business in a more informal and relaxed way than in the main financial institutions.  I hope they will feel the hurt of successful credit union offices as they expand throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I recognise this as a crossroads opportunity for credit unions.  They must move forward, expand and develop but, in tandem with that, they must keep faith and trust with those who set them up. Given the pioneering spirit of Nora Herlihy and her ilk, that balance must be maintained.  I will give the Minister the book as I would like him to read it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister did not mention her.  He who talks about rocking the baby and having to go home to mind his kith and kin would do well to read this book.  The Minister will recall the night he had to go from the Dáil to mind the baby.  It is important that we keep in tune with the pioneers of those days and the community development, encouraged by the President, Mary Robinson, which we all applaud. Community development is the hallmark of the credit union movement, the Irish agricultural co-operative, and the pioneering spirit of Sir Horace Plunkett, the ICA, Muriel Gahon and her women who gave the nod to Nora Herlihy to be their <Col N="1047" /> nominee on the consultative committee which drew up the relevant legislation in the 1960s. Those who work within credit unions today are imbued with the same spirit.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should view credit unions as an asset which can be developed and nurtured. Following my deliberations and discussions with their representatives at local, regional and national level, I am sure they are more than ready to respond. They stand poised to renew the pioneering co-operative spirit in meeting their clients' everyday needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  The vast majority of the members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party have been lobbied intensively by credit union representatives in their respective constituencies.  Following publication of the Bill, with all of my Oireachtas constituency colleagues I was invited to a meeting organised by the credit unions in the constituency to make us aware of the position at national and local level.  It was intriguing to learn the credit unions in the constituency, in which there are approximately 65,000 registered voters, administer 65,000 accounts.  This brought home to us the huge impact credit unions have on the daily lives of our constituents.  As a solicitor by profession, I am acutely aware of how, during the years, credit unions have helped those who have not been in a position to approach banks and building societies. In recent times they are to be congratulated for having broadened the range of services on offer and made finance available to a much broader spectrum of clients.  The Minister of State is wrong to try to tie them down to a certain figure in terms of the amount they may lend.  He may well give a commitment on Committee Stage to increase this figure.</P>
      <P>As party Whip, I was approached informally to see if the Bill could proceed to Committee Stage quickly.  My response was that most Fianna Fáil Deputies who have been lobbied intensively by credit unions wished to outline their views on it. It was not my intention to contribute but I have been forced to do so because of a letter, dated 10 March, sent by the Minister of State to the secretary of the Irish League of Credit Unions, a copy of which has been forwarded to all of the credit unions affiliated to it.  For sheer arrogance and hard neck, it is both mind-boggling and breathtaking.  The Minister of State knew when he wrote it that it would find its way into the public domain.  It states:</P>
      <P>I feel I should briefly bring you up to date on the progress of the Credit Union Bill through the Oireachtas.  Unfortunately due to an organised filibuster by the main Opposition Party, the Bill did not proceed last week to Committee Stage as expected.</P>

      <P>On other occasions I have had difficulty in getting people to speak but, judging from subsequent correspondence between the Minister of State and the Irish League of Credit Unions, it accepts no effort has been made by my party to organise a filibuster.  I did not ask people to keep the debate going, they contributed of their own volition.  On one occasion the debate could have collapsed if the Minister of State had been present.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State went on to berate the Irish League of Credit Unions:</P>
      <P>Meanwhile I am aware that the League has organised a number of &ldquo;roadshows&rdquo; where, judging from the first one in Cork, a presentation is being made as if none of the above was happening... I don't know who or what is guiding a filibuster in the House on the Second Stage of the Bill...Since an almost unprecedented 52 speakers have spoken, I am puzzled as to why progress to Committee Stage is being held up.  I am also puzzled as to why a parallel campaign of &ldquo;roadshows&rdquo; are being orchestrated by the League...Parliamentary gamesmanship is probably inevitable but if the game playing generally could be contained, I could get on with processing a Bill for the development of the Credit Union movement that will stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>In a different forum there have been interesting nuggets of information about the transformation of Democratic Left into a supposedly democratic party.  The Minister of State should take the name Democratic Left at face value and understand what democracy is all about.  It is about members of Parliament discussing legislation, whether from the Government or Opposition side.  Last week the Taoiseach, the great reformer, jackbooted the Education Bill through the Dáil in six hours and tried to suggest the debate could take place at the appropriate committee.  The Minister of State wants to curtail the democratic discussion of this Bill.  The reply sent by the secretary of the League of Credit Unions to the Minister of State on 12 March stated that the right of any Deputy to speak in the Dáil is a fundamental democratic right, subject to the Standing Orders of the Dáil. He reminded the Minister of State that over 20 of the 52 speakers who had then contributed to the debate were Government Deputies and mentioned that this had been stated on a number of occasions, so obviously the Minister of State had complained about it.  The league had no part in <Col N="1049" /> organising any filibuster of this Bill with either the Opposition or Government parties.</P>
      <P>Another point made by the secretary refers to the Minister of State's letter as being unfortunate, upsetting and having an unclear purpose, which says it all.  The secretary goes on to say that the league exerted no undue influence on the democratic operation of the Dáil.  I confirm that.  It is reprehensible that the Minister of State tried, in effect, to muzzle those who were lobbied by credit unions.  The Minister of State may say this can be discussed in committee; he knows well how committees operate and that Second Stage is the only real forum where a backbencher who is not a member of a committee can deal with this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should at least be gracious in his response and acknowledge that the Opposition has not tried to filibuster.  I thought I would be the last Fianna Fáil speaker on this Bill but there may be two extra speakers who wish to give their views.  Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív told me that he has tried to speak on this Bill on several occasions and he will confirm that neither I nor any other Fianna Fáil Member exhorted him to speak on it.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister of his duty as a supposedly democratic politician.  Either democracy means that we can give our views on legislation or it means we cannot do so.  If the House is only to be a rubber stamping mechanism for cabals that this Minister of State, or other Ministers, might meet on legislation such as happened with the Education Bill, then shame on the Minister of State and the Government.  The Government spoke in flowery terms about opening up the Dáil, letting the light in and much nonsense about transparency, openness and accountability in the programme for Government.  The Minister of State should accept that he was trying to muzzle our Deputies as happened with the Education Bill, about which there will be more another day.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly about this issue and have certain views on the credit union movement.  The Minister of State should not see sitting through these debates as a chore but as an education.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an Teachta Dála Dermot Ahern, táim ag fanacht go fada le deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an mBille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take grave exception to the letter from the Minister of State.  I worked for over 20 years as manager of a small development co-op.  During that time, the provision of finance for rural development was my life.  It is strange that the Minister of State, instead of being pleased at the huge interest in this Bill and that so many Deputies want to speak on it, alleges that a filibuster has taken place.  It is strange that in many recent cases the Parliament has been seen as a nuisance to Ministers, who will talk to any group except Members of the House.  The unwillingness to enter into debate with the representatives of the people, whether it is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht on SACs, the Minister for Education on the Education Bill or the Minister <Col N="1050" /> of State on this Bill, is not only a slight to this House but to those who elect us.  There is plenty of time to speak to all kinds of interest groups but no time for debate with elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I was pleased, as chairman of the local co-op and its manager for years, that we enticed a local credit union to set up a branch office in that co-op. I had hoped to do that for a long time.  Most people see the credit union as having the right balance in lending policy, having a human view, and encouraging saving.  It is probably true that many speakers' points have been repetitious. Some of the weaknesses in the Bill have been pointed out to Members and have obviously been repeated.  I have a comprehensive dossier of points on the Bill but it would be more reasonable to keep those for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister of State should consider some fundamental issues between now and then. As a co-op manager, I concluded that under-regulation can be a problem, but over-regulation can lead to as much abuse and as many problems. There seems to be so much regulation in this Bill that it will be difficult for the smaller, community-based operations to adhere to them all.  All the regulations are brought into disrepute when that happens and the serious transgressors cannot be distinguished from those who did not comply with a minute regulation.  All of this is unnecessary because the Bill makes provision for the Minister to make regulations as he or she sees fit over time.  There is a good case for the Minister of State, when reconsidering this Bill, to go back over all the regulations, decide which ones are not absolutely necessary and remove them.  If, over time, it is discovered that further regulation is needed, he can use the powers that the Bill confers upon him to introduce further regulation.  It seems much better to start with a core regulation and to add more if necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the registrar will police this unless a huge new bureaucracy is to be created to handle masses of paperwork.  One of the faults of our modern society is that we think we can legislate away any possibility of wrongdoing or carelessness. By bringing in more and more regulations, we feel we can ensure that nothing goes wrong.  That is not true, as the good operation of credit unions is totally dependent on the efficiency and dedication of those who run them. The voluntary nature of credit unions could be lost if there is too much bureaucracy.  Many people give their time voluntarily but over-regulation will make it more difficult for them to handle the sheer volume of paperwork that will result from the regulations the Minister of State is introducing.</P>
    <P>However, their voluntary nature could be lost if they are subjected to too much bureaucracy. Many people give much time to the credit unions on a voluntary basis and if the credit unions are over regulated it will be more difficult for those voluntary workers to handle the volume of regulation and red tape.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1051" /> The Bill contains some extraordinary provisions. It provides for a meeting ten months of the year yet it also provides that a list of members must be brought to a board meeting each month. Those provisions are incompatible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Those provisions should be simplified, along with other matters.</P>
      <P>For reasons which perhaps the credit union movement has not raised, I am concerned about the ceiling proposed for loans.  In rural areas the biggest inhibiting factor for rural development has been the inability to get small commercial loans at reasonable terms.  The great strength of the credit unions when it comes to lending money is that they know the people with whom they are dealing.  They can make judgments based not on bricks and mortar or a track record but on their knowledge of the individuals involved.  While some credit unions made loans that were not repaid, overall their lending policy has been good. In the context of creating jobs through enterprise a role could be developed for the credit unions in the economic and in the social development of their areas.  However, if tight limits are imposed on lending that will not be possible.</P>
      <P>A problem we have faced in the west is that while there has been a tradition of saving with local banks, those banks have not invested the money in the community from where the money came but in projects in other areas, usually urban. We should examine how we can ensure the money of a local community would be at the disposal of that community for its development.  It will not be possible to do that through the conventional commercial banking system, given their lending criteria used in decisions made at a remove from the small communities.  They will not reinvest in local development unless the terms are right for them.</P>
      <P>There is a great opportunity in this context to develop the credit unions.  They would seem ideal for rural development.  However, I cannot see how this could take place within the confines proposed in the Bill.  How much is the Bill simply regulating what exists already but confining it within a strait-jacket.  The Minister of State should consider this matter seriously before the Committee Stage.  Recycling money as I propose would be much better than pumping money into areas in the form of grants.  Grants have many attendant problems which lending money at low interest rates on a basis of trust do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in rural development work was that it was easy in a small community to pick people who, if they got money and opportunity, would make good, despite not having large resources of their own.  When we selected people and set them up in enterprises we rarely had failures because we had local knowledge of the likely commitment of the individual to the project, his or her personality and ability to stick with it <Col N="1052" /> through thick and thin.  Grant aid systems cannot take these matters into account because they must treat everybody in an identical fashion.  In this respect lending funds can be much more flexible.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that one could give four or five people the same opportunity under the same circumstances and two or three of them would succeed.  State agencies and other grant giving authorities are not able to make the necessary value judgments because they have to treat all similar applications in the same manner. However, a credit agency, such as a credit union, operates on the basis of making value judgments on the likelihood that the money will be repaid. In that way, where there is a shortage of security or there is no track record, they are well placed to make a value judgment whether to take the chance on the individual because they can assess the probability that the individual will succeed.  I see no evidence of such thinking being developed in the Bill.  The Bill attempts to regulate matters as they are so that they will remain so for the future.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State indicated that he will recognise the role of the League of Credit Unions which has done great work over many years.  I am not clear as to the difficulty in giving the league recognition in the Bill.  In the Education Bill, 1997, which was half debated in the House recently, the National Association of Parents is recognised specifically.  Why could not a similar provision be used in this Bill to recognise the League of Credit Unions?  Most credit unions are attached to the league and more of the regulation should be left to the league rather than to the registrar.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt me ag an tús, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil díomá agus olc orm go gceapann an tAire Stáit go mba cheart go mbeadh díospóireacht níos giorra ar an mBille seo.  Is Bille fíor-thábhachtach é mar is beag pobal in Éirinn nach bhfuil comhar-chreidmheasa ann.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil na comhair-chreidmheasa tar éis an-chuid maitheasa a dhéanamh trí airgead a chur ar fáil do dhaoine ar chostas réasúnta agus freisin trí cúnamh a thabhairt do dhaoine airgead a choigilt i measc pobal nach raibh an nós sin iontu cheana.</P>
    <P>D'fhéadfá a rá gurb é an comhar-chreidmheasa an banc do na daoine bochta.  Is é an banc é atá gar do gach pobal agus is cinnte go mbraitheann na bancanna móra go bhfuil iomaíocht ann nach mbeadh ann mura mbeadh na comhair-chreidmheasa. Bheadh díomá orm a cheapadh gur tháinig brú ó na bancanna móra agus ó na h-eagraíochtaí eile iasachta ar an Aire chun smacht a chur ar na comhair-chreidmheasa ar mhaithe leo féin.  Tá údar imní amháin orm maidir leis na comhair-chreidmheasa agus is é sin má thosaíonn siad ró-láidir agus ró-mhór go n-imeoidh siad ó na pobail ina bhfuil siad fréamhaithe. Tá súil agam nach bhfeicfimid amach anseo comh-nascaithe ar bun idir comhair-chreidmheasa agus nach bhfeicfimid iad ró-láidir dóibh féin ar an mbunús sin.  Creidim gurb é <Col N="1053" /> bunús na gcomhar-chreidmheasa ná an pobal in a bhfuil siad fréamhaithe, an neamhspleachas atá ag gach comhair-chreidmheasa ón a chéile agus an chaoi gur ag an pobal áitiúil agus ag an dream atá ag sabháilt ann atá an úinéaracht.  Chonacamar le blianta beaga anuas athruithe móra bunúsacha ag teacht ar na cumainn foirgníochta &mdash; go leor acu ag athrú ina gcuid PLCs.  Ba bhocht an scéal é da bhfeicfimis na comhair-chreidmheasa ag dul ar an mbóthar céanna.</P>
    <P>Dá dtarlódh sin is é a thárlódh ná go mbunofaí cineál comhar-chreidmheasa nua mar go bhfuil éileamh ag an pobal ar eagraíochtaí beaga neamhspleácha a mbeadh smacht acu féin orthu. Is é láidreacht na gcomhar-chreidmheasa ná an t-eolas agus an aithne phearsanta atá ag na baill ar na daoine a bhfuil siad ag tabhairt iasachta dóibh.  Má imímid ón bhunprionsabal sin táimid ag imeacht ó phrionsabal na cóiríochta ar a bhfuil na comhair-chreidmheasa bunaithe.  Tá sé feicthe agam féin san obair a bhí ar bun agam agus san obair atá ar bun ag na comhair-chreidmheasa an obair íontach is féidir le daoine deonacha a dhéanamh.  Tá ról an duine deonach chomh tabhachtach anois is a bhí 20 agus 30 bliana ó shin agus tá páirt ghnáth-dhaoine i reachtáil a saoil chomh tábhachtach agus a bhí riamh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom moladh faoi leith a thabhairt do na daoine ar fad a thugann a gcuid ama agus dúthrachta ag plé leis na comhair-chreidmheasa. Tá fhios agam gur tháinig siad chuig gach Ball den Dáil ag déanamh pointí maidir leis an Bille seo.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate on what I think all sides of the House agree is significant legislation which will allow for the expansion and development of the credit union movement into the next century and of which the credit union movement and I, as sponsoring Minister, can be rightfully proud when it is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the consensus in the House that the credit union movement is one of the success stories of modern Irish society.  Speakers on all sides of the House put on the record the tremendous contribution made by people, predominantly <Col N="1054" /> on a voluntary basis, to the growth and development of the credit union movement in their areas or workplaces, providing a source of personal finance to members who in many cases would not be able to get similar credit from the conventional credit institutions.  Having regard to the time which has elapsed since the credit union movement indicated new stand alone legislation was necessary, this Bill, which provides for an enhanced role for the movement, is overdue.</P>
    <P>It is relatively easy to criticise a Bill but it is not so easy to cause a considered Bill to come before the House.  I take with a pinch of salt some of the criticism inasmuch as it came from people who had the opportunity over many years to produce such a Bill but did not manage to do so. However, I accept that the role of the House is to scrutinise legislation line by line, and if a great many of the lines were repetitive it probably does not make them any less valid.  This is the seventh Bill I have brought before the House during my two years in office and I have approached it in the same fashion as I approached previous Bills, some of which Deputy O'Keeffe was concerned with.  If there are meritorious amendments from the other side of the House or other sources I will be more than happy to take them on board.  That has always been my position.  I have no difficulty or sense of defensiveness in doing this as it is what this Chamber is about.  If there are meritorious amendments I will be happy to take them on board.  Deputy Ned O'Keeffe will be able to testify that I have done this on previous occasions.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the views of the vested interests to which Deputy Batt O'Keeffe referred also have to be taken on board.  The main vested interest in this case is the Irish League of Credit Unions and the individual credit unions, several of which I have met, including one in Deputy O'Keeffe's native city of Cork which I met only last week.  I make no apology for meeting these vested interests or for how frequently I have met them. This process has been very helpful and will result in an improved Bill at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell on the main contributions by Members on the other side of the House tonight which were concerned with a letter I wrote to the credit unions in which I adverted to the fact that an organised filibuster was under way in the House.  I do not particularly wish to trade insults with either Deputy O'Rourke or Deputy Ahern, and I hope both of them will acknowledge this is not an admission of an inability to do so on my part.  However, I ask them not to insult my intelligence.  I know a filibuster when I see one and I would be very grateful if they did not seek to insult my intelligence. The Deputy last into the fray when the debate was last adjourned was not present tonight even though he only spoke for two minutes.</P>
    <P>I also do not want to break parliamentary convention by dwelling unnecessarily on this point, but Deputy Dermot Ahern, for whom I have some regard, frequently manages not to fight by Queensberry rules.  He made reference tonight to <Col N="1055" /> the fact that, had I been in the House at an early stage of this debate, I could have collapsed the debate.  I have been in the House for every minute of this debate except when otherwise briefly detained on Government business.  If I had been here at that early stage, I would not, unlike Deputy Ray Burke on a previous occasion, have collapsed the debate.  It is a matter of some gratification to me that the Bill has provoked such widespread comment and caused so many Deputies to contribute.</P>
    <P>It is often the case that there is no necessary relationship between the amount of work put into the preparation of a Bill and the comment it attracts either in this House or outside it.  In this case, a great deal of work has gone into the preparation of this Bill, and I pay tribute to my officials who worked diligently and attentively to meet the pre-Christmas deadline we imposed on ourselves.  I would like to thank the Registrar of Friendly Societies for the work above and beyond the call of duty he put into the Bill.  I thank also the invaluable voluntary assistance of the Irish League of Credit Unions which has been involved from the very genesis of the Bill and which has made an important contribution.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said on previous occasions, which was misrepresented, for reasons unknown to me.  I never said the Bill produced was the Bill agreed with the Irish League of Credit Unions. Whereas I have had unprecedented consultation in advance and subsequently with the Irish League of Credit Unions, I never said the Bill was agreed with the league.  Changes were necessary, partly as a result of the legal advice of the law officer to the Government and partly as a result of political judgment I made on a number of particular issues.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the dedicated attention given to the Bill by activists in the credit union movement.  I cannot find a ready precedent for the extent of involvement by so many people in a legislative measure designed to impact on their own lives.  Rarely do so many people scrutinise legislation line by line and constructively offer suggested changes or improvements.  As I have remarked previously, I took the virtually unprecedented step of attending a special conference of the credit union movement in Limerick convened for the purpose of scrutinising the legislation before it came into this House.  It is the task of this House to make law, but it was an invaluable prelude to that process that so many interested people addressed themselves constructively to the published Bill.</P>
    <P>The Irish League of Credit Unions, in keeping with its own involvement at all stages of the preparation of the legislation, has been to the fore in guiding the public debate.  Simultaneously with this public debate, senior personnel from the Irish League of Credit Unions have been participating in worthwhile meetings with my officials and myself in respect of various amendments they are advocating.  Separately, my officials and I have <Col N="1056" /> also met several individual credit unions, and again the diversity of opinion has been immensely helpful.</P>
    <P>There is not a single credit union view on this Bill, and it would be surprising if there were.  We will have better legislation as a result of my having listened to that diversity of view.  At what point, however, does this genuine expression of constructive campaigning stray into internal politicking? Politicians know what it is like to have to sing for their supper, but it is not customary for a countrywide campaign and roadshows to be organised in opposition to sections of a Bill that are, at the same time, the subject of negotiations with the Minister and his officials.  Any precedents that exist relate to legislation being opposed in principle by those affected and in circumstances where the Minister of the day had slammed the door to reasonable dialogue.  In this case, my door has always been opened even to those who want to go forward with an amendment in one hand and a megaphone in the other.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the persons directing this campaign have a constituency to serve and are zealous only in the interests of the credit union movement. There is, however, quite a needless frenzy being orchestrated among what I would respectfully call the activists of the movement.  I must also confess to disappointment that, in the course of this campaign, my own position has been misrepresented for reasons that remain unclear.  The fact remains that there has been unprecedented co-operation, discussion and dialogue, and I am satisfied that the Credit Union Bill eventually enacted will benefit from that process.</P>
    <P>The numerous representations I have received from the Irish League of Credit Unions, individual credit unions and other individuals, and the invaluable contributions of some Members of this House on the content of the Bill have been taken on board by me.  Having read the various submissions received, and having met the league on a number of occasions and various credit unions on an individual basis, what has struck me forcibly is that there is no single credit union view as to what the Bill should contain.  My Department and I have examined each of the submissions received and I have selected a series of amendments which will meet the needs of the majority of credit unions, if not all credit unions. Not everyone will be happy with the amendments which I will publish in due course, but the House can be assured I am making genuine efforts to accommodate the needs of credit unions to facilitate their future development.</P>
    <P>I have to date referred over 30 Government amendments to the parliamentary draftsman. These cover matters raised in the debate by Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and several of his colleagues, as well as colleagues on my own benches. The amendments relate to the issues of savings and loan limits.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keaveney drew my attention to the question of tenant purchase finance. She gave practical examples of her experience as a county councillor, which were helpful.  I hope I can meet them in dealing with the loan limits question.  I want to meet Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív in the matter of facilitating co-operative development and micro business.  That has been and remains my intention.</P>
      <P>I will also publish amendments in relation to the regulation of credit unions and clarify recommendations in respect of credit union property.  I will deal with the question of additional credit union services and the question of the recognition of the Irish League of Credit Unions, an issue which holds large over this debate.  It is a difficult issue because it appears some people are reluctant to accept that, as a Government Minister, I cannot promulgate an amendment to legislation that I am advised by the law officer to the Government is not consistent with good practice, the Constitution or is legally infirm in any way. My fervent political wish, having listened to the league, is to see the role of the Irish League of Credit Unions recognised in the Bill.  Although I have referred that wish to the office of the parliamentary draftsman, I have not yet been successful in getting back an amendment that manages to do that.  Essentially, it concerns the fact that the league is an unincorporated body, and I am advised it is not possible in legislation to give expression to the role of an unincorporated body that is not a legal person and that cannot be sued in its own right.  I have asked the Attorney General to see if it is possible because, at my last meeting with the league&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about a comparison with the co-operative movement and the ICOS, which is a new area of responsibility for the Registrar of Friendly Societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That comparison is being tested. I am advised it does not hold up, that it is not exactly comparable.  At the last meeting I had with the league, they expressed this in terms of wanting recognition, which is a different matter from the wider role of regulator.  I am having that question of recognition looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the issue of league recognition, Deputies will be aware the league is pressing not only for formal recognition in the Bill but also for some form of self-regulation.  This is an issue which is proving most difficult to advance, but the parliamentary draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General have strongly advised against making any reference to the league in the Bill on the basis that the league is an unincorporated body.  I have been advised that an unincorporated body has no existence in law outside those who make it up and that it is impossible in law to sue or prosecute such a body.  The attention of the Office of the Attorney General has been drawn to section 94 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 which applies only to the International Financial Services <Col N="1058" /> Centre and which the league is promoting as a suitable self-regulatory model in Irish law for inclusion in this Bill.  In reply, the Office of the Attorney General has noted that under that section the Central Bank is to specify the legal character of the self-regulatory body.  Having regard to the fact that the league refuses to incorporate, the Office of the Attorney General has indicated that the league cannot reasonably be expected to be treated as a legal entity.  On that basis the Office of the Attorney General does not recommend including such a provision in any credit union legislation.</P>
    <P>As a Government Minister, I am not in a position to ignore the legal advice coming from the Government's legal adviser.  At the same time, however, I have made it clear in direct discussions with the Attorney General, as has my Department in discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, that it is politically necessary that the league be formally recognised in the Bill, given that it is a long established and recognised representative organisation for credit unions. From a practical perspective, I have indicated that I see little difference between the Bill recognising the name &ldquo;Irish League of Credit Unions&rdquo; from the day of the Bill's commencement and the registrar doing so under section 12(4) immediately following its commencement.  I am still awaiting a definitive response from the Office of the Attorney General to these representations.  It seems unlikely, therefore, that we will be able to solve this issue in advance of our starting Committee Stage next Wednesday &mdash; the Committee agreed, today, to take Committee Stage next Wednesday but, in keeping with the attitude of the main Opposition Party, that was not facilitated; it threatened to boycott it and, unfortunately, Deputy Bell had no choice but not to proceed next Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I regret that people who want to see the Bill amended will not allow me to proceed to the Stage where it may be amended.  However, I assure the House that everything possible is being done to obtain some acceptable legal mechanism for adverting to the league by name in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the other amendments are concerned, my Department needs to obtain formally from the parliamentary draftsman's office the text of all Government amendments and have these printed and published for the House as soon as possible.  Accordingly, I hope in the Select Committee we will shortly be able to start the process of examining the detail of the Bill.  I expect we will be able to make significant progress in <Col N="1059" /> addressing some of the major issues of concern to credit unions in relation to that.  I was again prevented from putting down the requisite financial motion tomorrow or, indeed, next Tuesday, which I must do before I can proceed to Committee, but the Opposition whip would not facilitate that &mdash; presumably there is some reasoning behind that.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ned O'Keeffe and O'Hanlon referred to the credit unions having the High Court as their only court of appeal against the decisions of the registrar.  The parliamentary draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General are of the opinion this is the appropriate court of appeal because they regard the registrar as having the status of a District Court in exercising his judicial functions under the Bill.  I will raise this issue with them again in the light of Deputy O'Keeffe's comments.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Molloy's request for clarification on the issue of corporation tax, the Deputy will be aware that the subject of taxation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, not for this legislation.  This Bill does not alter the non-profit making status of credit unions which is the basis on which they currently enjoy exemption from corporation tax.  Consequently I fully support their continuing to enjoy that exemption.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Pat Gallagher the Bill does not impact on the insurance products provided through ECCU which is a licensed insurance company under the insurance Acts.  This position does not hold for CUMIS, and I am considering how that matter should be handled in the Bill.  I am also giving consideration to Deputy Gallagher's suggestion that some of the objects for which a credit union is established under section 6 should be made compulsory while others remain optional.</P>
    <P>Deputies Pat Gallagher and Sargent referred to the restriction in section 68 on the remuneration of certain officers of a credit union.  I will look again at this area and I am likely to be able to propose an amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rory O'Hanlon was also concerned that credit unions were being restricted as to what they can do with their surplus funds.  The relevant section 43 is intended to ensure that surplus funds are put into secure investments.  It is not, therefore, very different in its purpose from existing legislation.</P>
    <P>An innovation in the current Bill is the provision in section 44 allowing credit unions to establish a special fund for social, cultural and charitable purposes in their community and I am likely, on Committee Stage, to propose an amendment to improve the start-up position of such a fund.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrew Boylan expressed concern that the three year term of office for directors is too short.  I refer the Deputy to section 53(4) which stipulates that, unless the rules of a credit union <Col N="1060" /> provide otherwise, a retiring director may be eligible for re-election.</P>
    <P>On the point made by my colleague, Minister of State Deputy Gay Mitchell, this evening, it is important to make the point that on the death of a member of a credit union any loans he or she may have outstanding to the credit union are written off.  It is also the case that the member's shareholding in the credit union is topped up. Both procedures are effected by insurance taken out on behalf of the member by the credit union and have the effect of alleviating the financial hardship which comes with the death of a member and, in particular, in covering the heavy cost of funerals.  I have asked the Registrar of Friendly Societies to examine the suggestion by Deputy Mitchell, and I am awaiting his reply.  I do not see anything in the Bill which would preclude credit unions getting involved in this area.  Section 26(2) provides that a credit union may &ldquo;do anything expedient for accomplishing, or conducive to or consequential upon, the objects for which the credit union is formed&rdquo;.  In the same way as credit unions effect insurance on behalf of their members for other purposes, I see credit unions being able to get involved in covering the cost of funerals.  This may well be the most effective way for credit unions to directly help their members in relation to funeral costs.  I also imagine parties interested in formally establishing a funeral co-operative would be able to apply to the Registrar of Friendly Societies under the Industrial and Provident Socities Acts.  While I am not aware of any funeral co-operative having already been approved, I see no reason they could not be established with or without a direct involvement of the local credit union.  I am awaiting the formal reply of the registrar and I will contact the Deputy on that matter.</P>
    <P>On the question of regulation, I would like to deal with some of the major themes which emerged from the contributions of Deputies. Many rightly applauded the growth of the credit union movement over the past 40 years, but some Deputies, such as Deputies Bobby Molloy and P. J. Morley, tried to argue that the controls which were considered appropriate to the small scale of credit union operations in the 1960s and 1970s did not require to be changed some 20 years later. Credit unions have from their inception operated under the supervision of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  That is a basic point that seems to be overlooked.  Some Deputies have argued for little or no regulation as in the US, and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe pointed out that these Deputies have forgotten the Savings and Loan Association experience in the United States when many associations invested in the now discredited junk bonds and other high-risk investments and investors suffered accordingly.  The US government had to provide billions of dollars of taxpayers' money to bail out these institutions and thereby prevent a damaging blow to the whole US financial system.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, for example, Deputies <Col N="1061" /> Ned O'Keeffe and Micheál Martin, have complained, with their tongues firmly in their cheeks, of the banking ethos in this Bill, and the mother of all Deputies on the other side of the House, Deputy O'Rourke, was sufficiently mischievous to say she saw the hand of the financial institutions in the preparation of this legislation.  I repeat for the umpteenth time in this House that no banking institution or building society was met, nor was there correspondence from them, nor were they communicated with in any other way before the publication of this Bill.  Despite requests and submissions to me, I have met neither a bank or building society on this issue. Colleagues of mine recently had a meeting with the banks at my request.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill was already published at that stage.  The Deputy cannot keep a straight face while suggesting that I take my riding instructions on the preparation of this Bill from the banking institutions.  I would argue that the regulatory controls have to be equally effective. Like banks and building societies, credit unions manage people's money.  They are now significant players in the personal finance area and continue to grow at annual percentage rates in double figures. Because they are entrusted with a significant amount of funds, it is proper that they be subjected to sufficient controls to ensure that members' savings continue to be given a high standard of care.  That was the only concern I had in preparing this Bill.</P>
      <P>I will not be over-influenced by what banks and building societies have to say to me because their record in meeting the needs of many ordinary credit union members in recent years has been poor.  While they may have competitive concerns about the Bill's new regime, it is a concern which I welcome having regard to the large amount of profits which banking interests are currently making. I do not deny their right to make a respectable profit, but equally I welcome whatever additional competition may be offered by credit unions when the Bill becomes law.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies including Deputies Crawford and McGahon rightly praised the contribution of credit unions to the development of their areas and their excellent track record in maintaining the security of members' money. Members have not lost money because of the initiative of the league many years ago in providing anti-fraud insurance for credit union members.  It is not the case, however, that there has been no wrongdoing &mdash; I understand it is normal to have a case or two before the courts most years.  I accept that, given the size of the movement, this record is an exceptional one, but it also means that vigilance must continue to be exercised by individual credit union managements and by the registrar to help maintain the security of members' savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, who is normally a very polite Member of this House, in an unguarded moment, expressed resentment at the regulation of credit unions by what he called a faceless person, by which he means the registrar.  It is only fair that I correct that statement.  The registrar was publicly acknowledged at the league's special general meeting in Limerick in January as performing a valuable supporting role for credit unions.  I recently met a major credit union which described the approach of the registrar and his staff as very professional in their examination of the credit union's affairs and very helpful in their advice on credit union operations.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental inconsistency in those arguments which favour an extension, on the one hand, of the range of credit union services while at the same time supporting reduced regulation or the <i>status quo.</i> The same Deputies who asked me to be accountable during the Taylor affair would do the same thing if I did not prudentially provide for regulation of the credit union movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not compare Taylor with the credit unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not comparing them.  We are talking about billions of pounds going through the credit union movement and to suggest that movement should not be prudentially regulated does not hold water &mdash; I do not think Deputies on that side of the House seriously recommend that.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of Deputy O'Keeffe, an avid reader of erudite journals, to the February 1997 edition of the <i>Commercial Law Practitioner</i> which, under the headline The Credit Union Bill &mdash; Balancing Freedom and Regulation, makes a number of interesting comments, which I commend to the Deputy.  It states:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Commercial Law Practitioner</i> is of the opinion that the Minister must exercise great caution in relaxing any of the proposed controls. People who handle other people's money must be subject to scrutiny and regulation.  On the one hand, the ILCU appears to welcome the development of the range of services which the Bill will permit the credit unions to offer. Indeed, it would appear not to be satisfied with the proposed limits of £20,000 on loans, shares and deposits and wants these increased.  Ironically, far from recognising that increased powers necessarily imply greater duties and outside scrutiny, the ILCU is objecting to the Bill's proposals on regulation by the Registrar of Friendly Societies which it considers excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers that a credit union may be formed with as few as 15 members, that the officers of many credit unions will often possess no formal qualifications and that in many cases ordinary people are entrusting their life's savings to the credit union, the case for proper and effective supervision and regulation would <Col N="1063" /> seem to be beyond question.  Indeed, one must also question the degree of control which the ILCU has over all of its members.  At the moment the ILCU carries out its own inspections, but wishes this to continue in preference to inspection by the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  Again, one must question the effectiveness of the ILCU policing its own members without the might of law, which the Registrar of Friendly Societies would have.  We shall have to await the outcome of negotiations to see how the balance has been struck.</P>
    <P>Those views by a reputable independent commentator are worth serious attention by all Deputies.  I respectfully suggest that a cautionary note should guide all our deliberations, despite the enthusiasm of the Irish League of Credit Unions to push out the boundaries of the Bill. Unlike some Deputies, in fairness to the league, it narrowed its criticism in this area to separating the question of prudential regulation from the question of day to day intervention.  That is a point on which I will have to reflect, that perhaps the Bill is overly prescriptive in terms of the daily intervention of the registrar, but there is no argument on the question of regulation.</P>
    <P>The credit union movement ought to be on its knees thanking its lucky stars it has a person of the calibre of the present registrar and that a system is in place on which it can fall back in terms of regulation and so on.  It has an excellent relationship with the present registrar and I have no reason to believe that will not continue.  It has an outstanding record in terms of this aspect of its affairs.  I am considering the question of the daily intervention in the operational affairs of credit unions, but in terms of minding other people's money I have made up my mind and I think the league has come around to agree with that position, provided it is not unduly irritated in terms of the daily work it has done so spectacularly well down the years.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies such as Deputy Nolan spoke in support of giving the league formal recognition in the Bill.  I have dealt with that question.  If the Attorney General's office comes up with a formula, I will be the first to applaud it because, having regard to the role played by the league on a voluntary basis in guiding the movement to where it is today, I would like to see that included.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher and other Deputies spoke about the offences and penalties provisions.  The point was made that they will frighten prospective volunteers, particularly directors and officers who exercise responsible duties in their local credit unions.  I would like to think no-one need fear any provision of the Bill if they are doing their job honestly and conscientiously.  There are two issues here, the first of which is the substantive issue of the level of penalties prescribed in the Bill.  While appreciating that we are dealing with a largely volunteer movement, I hope the effect <Col N="1064" /> of regulatory supervision elsewhere in the financial services will equally apply here.</P>
    <P>The second issue is more a question of drafting style than substance.  The point has been made by the league that the offences and penalties provisions should be consolidated into Part XIII of the Bill rather than have repeated references to offences and penalties throughout the Bill.  There is merit in leaving the drafting as it is because it makes everyone working in a credit union aware of the serious responsibilities they are discharging in looking after the savings of credit union members.  At the same time I have sympathy for the league's view that it may discourage credit union members from contributing to their community by becoming involved in their credit union.  Consequently, I am prepared to review, in consultation with the draftsman, whether the offences and penalties provision might be restructured in some way to remove any perception of heavy-handedness with which credit unions feel they are involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne and others raised the question of additional services.  Following discussions between officials of my Department and the league, I intend to introduce a number of amendments to alleviate the requirements imposed on credit unions under sections 48 to 52.  This is likely to take the form of a shorter timescale for the approval of services where credit unions propose to offer services on an agency basis for a reputable principal.</P>
    <P>The property provisions attracted comment from a number of Deputies, including Deputies Ring and O'Hanlon.  I am committed to removing some of the misconceptions under which many in the credit union movement have been labouring due to the construction of section 41.  Following discussions between the league and officials of my Department, I hope to table amendments on Committee Stage to meet the needs of the general membership.</P>
    <P>A number of more detailed suggestions were made by various Members, the credit union movement and other interested bodies.  I do not intend to deal now with every suggestion made, but Members can be assured that I have noted their comments and will consider introducing their ideas as best I can on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The motion passed in Limerick was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe and in a remarkable act of ventriloquism by a large number of other Opposition Members.  A special two-day general meeting took place in Limerick to consider the provisions of the Bill.  The resolution was adopted before I was given an opportunity to address the meeting. I suggested to the league that it would make more sense for me to introduce the Bill and explain its provisions at the beginning of the meeting so that delegates would be better informed of the considerations underlying its provisions before debating its merits.  However, the league decided &mdash; as it is perfectly entitled to do &mdash; to conduct its business the other way around.  Consequently, my address to the special general meeting took <Col N="1065" /> place after the adoption of the resolution.  When I spoke to the delegates I was able to point out a number of misinterpretations of key provisions of the Bill, including the question of property.  I also indicated my willingness to review the loan limit and undertook to make my officials and the registrar available to meet the league to discuss its concerns.  My comments reassured the credit union delegates that I was serious about addressing their concerns.</P>
    <P>The meeting in Limerick was one of the most congenial I have attended during my time as Minister of State.</P>

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their constructive contributions. The debate in this House has reflected the very constructive Second Stage debate in the Seanad.  I am glad to see the commitment to greater openness is shared by all sides of the House.  Any criticism which was raised was that we would have as open legislation as possible, which is a concern I greatly share.  We will have the opportunity on Committee Stage to tease out the points which were made in more detail.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDaid, in the course of his very constructive contribution, raised a couple of significant points.  In regard to access to environmental information, any information which is not accessible under the current environment regulations&mdash; I understand the Deputy's concerns about possible shortcomings in that area&mdash;can be accessed under this Bill.  A person who is refused such information can then appeal to the Information Commissioner.  That should open up any remaining areas of darkness.  I am very carefully examining Deputy McDaid's constructive suggestion that An Bord Pleanála should be listed in the First Schedule as one of the bodies to come under the Act on its first day of operation.  We can make progress on that on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDaid also raised the question of the Garda.  The Garda is listed as one of the bodies to come under the provisions of the Act without any fixed date, which means there is no time limit.  In consultation with the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1068" /> the Minister for Finance will designate a suitable time.  I hope, in the light of the strategic management initiative now under way in the Garda and the greater emphasis on good quality administration, that we will be able to bring in the Garda at a very early date.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid also raised the question of the appeal system and expressed some concern that it might be difficult for citizens to access.  The appeal system is intended to be extremely informal, although extremely powerful.  We have asked the existing Ombudsman to be the first Information Commissioner because of his fine track record as the champion of citizens' rights. That appeal system is already operating in a very simple and informal way and I do not foresee any particular difficulty in citizens being able to access that right.</P>
    <P>It has been written into the Bill that whenever a request for information is refused the person concerned must automatically be told of their right of appeal and how to access that right.  That is also being built into refusal procedures in Departments.  For example, if somebody is refused a grant they must, under the Bill, be given reasons for the decision and be informed of the relevant appeals process.  I respect Deputy McDaid's concern that the appeal system should work well.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, in the course of an interesting contribution, has raised the issue of who defines the public interest.  She gave some examples from the past where she felt political embarrassment rather than the public interest was the determining factor.  I reassure the Deputy that political embarrassment is not a test which would satisfy the public interest test under this Bill.  Ultimately it will be the Information Commissioner, who is fully independent, rather than any political figure who will make the final call on whether the public interest applies in a particular case.</P>
    <P>She also raised the question of the management and preservation of documents and expressed some concern that documents might be shredded or deleted from a computer before they could be made available.  The Archives Act already deals with the issue of the deletion and destruction of records.  However, in addition, under section 15(5) of the Bill we are placing responsibility on the Department of Finance to ensure that documents are managed and preserved and to oversee that function in relation to public bodies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally referred to the importance of county councils and health boards coming under the legislation at an early date.  I am pleased to tell him that, as a result of a very constructive debate on this point in the Seanad, I have brought forward the lead-in time for county councils and health boards.  These bodies are very close to people's day to day concerns as they deal with their health, the streets on which they live and their concerns in the community.  Within six months of the extension of the operation of the <Col N="1069" /> Act to mainstream Departments, it will apply to health boards and county councils.  I am sure Deputy Kenneally will be pleased to know the lead-in time will not be three years as he had feared.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen raised the question of the protection of personal data.  Section 28 protects the privacy of personal information.  There are provisions in it which are modelled on the Data Protection Act.  Access to personal data is only granted in very limited circumstances.  In general, only information of a very general character which people know will be in the public domain or information relating to a health or safety issue is released.  The privacy of personal information is very tightly protected.</P>
    <P>The release of information may be considered only if it is in the public interest and following consultation with the person concerned.  The subject of the personal data has a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner to stop the release of such data when they have been notified that such release is being contemplated.  These provisions protect personal data.  We discussed them with the Data Protection Commissioner, who has a particular remit in the area of personal privacy, and I am satisfied they meet the concerns spoken about by Deputy Killeen.</P>
    <P>The appeal system is the cornerstone of the Bill.  Deputy Woods had concerns about this but I am glad to assure him that they were based on a misreading of the Bill.  His fears about there being no right of appeal in the case where a decision to refuse is made directly by the head of a public body are completely unfounded.  Section 34 (b)  gives a right to appeal a decision taken personally by the head of a public body.</P>
    <P>We provide under the Bill for an internal review where the decision to refuse is taken by a junior member of staff.  Human error can occur at all levels of an organisation.  When a junior member of staff who might not be fully conversant with the provisions of the Bill &mdash; although we hope they will be &mdash; refuses access because of inexperience or lack of information, a more senior member of staff, when reviewing the file, can decide to release the information.  Experience in other countries has shown that about 30 per cent of cases can be dealt with through internal review, which takes them out of the remit of the Information Commissioner.  That means people can get information more quickly and the office of the Information Commissioner will not be clogged up with appeals which could be dealt with in a speedier and more efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner will have powers akin to those of a High Court Judge to send for witnesses and papers.  Under section 35(12) the onus of proof will be on the public body to show why the citizen should not get the information. I know that was a concern of Deputy O'Dea's.  The whole appeal system is very much citizen focused and in favour of the requester.  A public body refusing information must show on what legal basis it is doing so.  If the legal basis <Col N="1070" /> does not stand up, the information must be released into the public domain.</P>
    <P>The Information Commissioner may look for material to substantiate a contention by a public body that the public interest is at stack.  In other words, it will have to justify why it should not release the information.  The Information Commissioner will have wider powers than the Ombudsman, whose decisions are not binding.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea suggested a further layer of appeal in addition to the appeal provided for in all legislation to the High Court on a point of law. I fail to see what function in terms of citizens rights would be served by having a permanent appeals system.  Providing that public bodies could appeal the decision of the information commissioner could delay the release of information. We have created a simple and effective system.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the Bill we looked at appeal systems in operation in other countries.  We contrasted the ineffective and legalistic Australian administrative appeals tribunal with the more informal, ombudsman based system in New Zealand and in later Australian state legislation which has opted for the ombudsman model, such as that in Queensland.  We are satisfied this will be the most citizen friendly model.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Dea and Woods raised the question of ministerial certificates and expressed concern that Ministers would impose gagging writs refusing access to information.  The certificates procedure is tightly drawn and circumscribed and would only apply in the most limited and extreme circumstances.  The legislation specifies that the material must be of sufficient sensitivity and seriousness to warrant a certificate and must be deemed to harm security, defence or international relations.  If these stringent conditions are not met, the certificate will not be granted, or if granted, would fall on appeal to the courts.  It is not a blank cheque for Ministers.  Again, it is interesting to draw on international experience. New Zealand has similar certificate procedures, which have been used only once.  We would expect this to be highly exceptional and that is what is provided for.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed that the machinery provided for in the Bill would be administratively cumbersome.  While it is simple, it is important to specify it in detail.  This aspect informed much debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad in an effort to ensure that any unwilling bureaucracy is not in a position to spike the intention of the legislation in opening up the system by being able to find administrative loopholes.  The administrative details are spelt out to ensure they work on behalf of citizens.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea expressed concern about the constitutionality of some of the Bill's provisions. We have carefully checked any constitutional points with the Office of the Attorney General; indeed texts are not returned unless they have been stamped as being regarded as constitutional by that office.  Regarding his point on personnel <Col N="1071" /> records, we are satisfied the provision will preserve the confidentiality of the process.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Official Secrets Act.  This Bill tears the heart out of that Act by giving citizens a legal right to know and replacing the presumption of official secrecy with the presumption of official openness.  I discussed the good report on the Act by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security with the Minister for Justice and I know she and her officials are giving it serious, detailed and favourable consideration. We expect her to introduce proposals in due course.</P>
    <P>On the question of Cabinet confidentiality and access to Cabinet papers, we must observe the current constitutional restrictions pending a referendum, and the Bill so provides.  However, section 19 is radical and has been recognised as such by people such as Senator Lee.  It gives the citizen a legal right to see factual information underlying Government decisions as soon as the decision has been made and published, provided it is not something that would be covered, for example, by the security protections.  It also provides that all information, including the Memorandum for Government, will be published within five years.  That compares with the 30 years rule under the Archives Act and is radical development in terms of access to Cabinet documentation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea raised the question of the provisions regarding voluminous requests.  These are there for practical reasons and are subject to appeal to the information commissioner to ensure there will be no abuse.  We came across a situation in Australia where an individual requested what turned out to be 18,000 volumes of documents. He was interested in ascertaining why the potholes on his road had not been repaired but he did not specify his requests and truckloads of information were gathered which he could not possibly have accessed.</P>
    <P>The provision that administrative time not be wasted on getting information is to enable people to focus on their requests by being reasonably specific and not to seek information they effectively do not want.  However, this is done in the context of the legal obligation to be placed on officials to help people focus the object of the request and to publish information that will help them pinpoint what they seek.  The right of appeal to the information commissioner can be invoked if there is any suggestion that reluctant bureaucracies use this provision to stymie access to information and the commissioner will give short shrift to any abuse of these provisions.</P>
    <P>Similar provisions apply to frivolous or vexatious requests.  We are all familiar with people who write repetitive letters or make repetitive requests for sensitive or security information to which they have been told they cannot have access.  This is included in such legislation the world over.  In this Bill, such requests are subject <Col N="1072" /> to appeal to the information commissioner to guard against any potential abuse.</P>
    <P>The Bill was subject to detailed debate in the Seanad and has emerged as a better Bill.  I welcomed contributions from all sides in that House. When considering the Bill further on Committee Stage, I hope we will have a constructive, open and honest debate and will produce legislation that will stand the test of time and will stand as a testament to the work of this Dáil in promoting the values of openness.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the enactment of the legislation and to the change it will bring to the culture of the public service.  I also look forward to the day when files are opened to the public because information is power and the giving of information to people about their own lives, what is going on in their own communities and about the operations of Government empowers them in their dealings with the State.  It takes away barriers that exist behind Government offices and opens a window on the operations of public bodies which can only be to their benefit and to the benefit of the quality of public administration. Every jurisdiction which has introduced freedom of information legislation has seen an improvement in the quality of public administration. Openness is the best guarantee that citizens are to the fore when people conduct public business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of queries have arisen since I tabled this Adjournment matter which I hope the Minister will address in his reply.  My constituents in the greater Castleknock area have contacted me on this matter.  There is great concern within that large residential community that a concert which could attract more than 100,000 people is to be foisted on these in the perimeter of Castleknock, courtesy of the Minister.  On a more important political note, will the Minister inform the House if some selective procedure has been employed to deal with this?  Has a promoter <Col N="1073" /> been given some exclusivity without a proper tendering process and, if so, why?</P>
      <P>There are probably three venues at which such a concert could be staged without infringing on the Phoenix Park.  They are Croke Park, Lansdowne Road and the RDS &mdash; three rate paying establishments that have staged such concerts in the past.  Why is it necessary for this form of commercialisation to be brought into the Phoenix Park?  It never happened before.  Why has it been done on an exclusive basis?  There are a number of people capable of promoting and developing such projects and it should not be selectively handled.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for insurance is a matter of serious concern to my constituents.  We are reliably informed that the proposed promoters are suggesting they cannot be responsible for the safety of children, people's homes or their possessions at the time of the concert.  Most complications and problems arise outside the concert area.  Tragically that was the case in Slane and other locations.  The venues I mentioned have stadium facilities with proper management, fire control and other facilities.  The Phoenix Park is not such a location.  Does this matter go back to the Minister's former colleagues in <i>Hot Press</i> and their involvement, if at all, in this project?  Is there some kind of insider dealing involved?</P>
      <P>A public venue is being used.  Dublin Corporation has been subsumed into this process and to circumvent the process of a proper planning application it is effectively a part promoter of the concert, which ensures that the planning requirement is avoided.  In the normal course of events this project would necessitate a planning application and probably an environmental impact study based on the projected numbers that would attend such a concert.  Will those procedures be followed?  Will the people I represent have a say in these matters or will their area be infringed upon as a result of the railroad approach adopted by the Minister's Department, Dublin Corporation and those brought in to promote the concert on some sort of exclusive basis?  The staging of the concert in this venue is unacceptable, undesirable and unnecessary as the stadium facilities in the city are properly equipped, pay commercial rates and have the capacity to stage such an event.  Using the Phoenix Park is an abuse of a public amenity for profiteering purposes and the Minister should not be party to what is proposed in this instance.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply to some of the points made by the Deputy.  I am not part of any exclusive profiteering project that is taking place in the Phoenix Park.  Having listened to the Deputy one would get the impression that the Government, my Department or I were promoting a concert in the Phoenix Park.  We are not. The management of the rock group U2 has been in contact with my Department and me concerning the possible use of the Phoenix Park for a <Col N="1074" /> large public paying rock concert in August.  It was in contact before U2 announced its world tour in New York.  This inquiry was not solicited by me or by anybody known to me, be it those who worked in <i>Hot Press</i> or anywhere else.  This would be the only Irish concert in U2's world tour and, as proposed, would cater for a crowd in excess of 100,000.</P>
      <P>The approach concerning this proposal in very general terms was made to me as Minister with responsibility for the Phoenix Park under the Phoenix Park Act, 1925.  That Act and by-laws provide for the issue of licences by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for specific use of the park.  The Phoenix Park is the largest enclosed recreational space, comprising 1,752 acres, within any capital city in Europe.  Its survival is one of landscape planning's greatest triumphs. It is still larger than the total area of all London's parks.  The Phoenix Park is a prime example of a 17th century deer park.  Its landscape is dominated by broad expanses of grassland, separated by clumps of trees.  Park users are offered a variety of vistas both internally and beyond the park boundaries to the Dublin Mountains, the River Liffey and so forth.  The park provides outstanding opportunities for both active and passive recreational pursuits.</P>
      <P>In 1986, the Phoenix Park was designated a national historic park in recognition of its historic landscape.  In the same year the Phoenix Park management plan was published.  This plan sets out the management policy in relation to the Phoenix Park and the future management objectives for the park.  Four management objectives identified in the plan are to conserve the historic landscape character of the park, to encourage appropriate recreational use and public appreciation, to conserve natural and other values within the park and to develop a harmonious relationship between the park and the community.</P>
      <P>No approval has been given by me to the proposal from U2 management.  Officials of my Department have met the promoters and U2 management to discuss the proposal and have raised a number of issues which would have to be addressed by the proposers of this concert, including the environmental impact on the park, security and public safety issues, traffic management, lighting, provision of services, impact on the public and on park residents, the concerns of local residents and the need for planning permission. My officials have also met Garda representatives who are addressing the security issues raised by the proposal.</P>
      <P>While I am positively disposed to the idea of exploring the potential of the Phoenix Park for the holding of musical and other cultural events for the enjoyment of the citizens of Dublin, in particular, and of the country in general, there are clearly very many serious and difficult issues which need to be addressed and fully considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am awaiting a detailed proposal from the concert promoters addressing all the relevant issues and I will be considering this together with the <Col N="1075" /> advice of the heritage service of my Department and of the Garda before making any decision on the proposal.  I understand that Dublin Corporation is examining the question of planning permission and conditions and this, together with Garda concerns relating to security matters, are critical issues to be decided.</P>
    <P>To suggest there is any commissioning of a promoter by myself or my Department is outrageous, not to speak of suggesting that a promoter would have been chosen exclusively.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern for his constituents which is shared by my Department, but there is no question of a concert being organised, not to speak of one being foisted on them.  Since the Slane decision there is obviously a planning issue involved and that is affected by the special position of Dublin Corporation, but that is a matter for the corporation.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency where three teenagers were killed as a result of the criminal activity known as joyriding in the past month.  It is with profound pity for the families of the victims that I raise this matter in the Dáil tonight.</P>
      <P>I visited the home of one of the victims, Trevor O'Connell, yesterday and the anguish and despair of his distraught mother, his grief stricken father and his three brothers was one of the most harrowing experiences of my public life.  Their young son left home on the eve of St. Patrick's Day with a friend, Stephen Kirby, to go to the local shop for bags of chips.  On the way home, Trevor was mowed down by a stolen car and killed.  Stephen Kirby died today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This horrific tragedy has left the victims' families and an entire neighbourhood in the grip of despair.  The question they repeatedly ask is what law is there to protect innocent young children. My questions are more specific.  Why were the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act not in operation when this tragedy happened?  This law, which permits gardaí to use stingers to intercept so-called joyriders, came into effect on 4 March last.  How can the Minister explain the gap between the enactment of this urgent law and its implementation? Whose responsibility was it to communicate to the Garda Commissioner that this new Garda power was available?  When was that fact communicated and by whom?  What discussions did the Minister have today with the Garda Commissioner on this matter?  When did the Garda Commissioner communicate the new powers to gardaí?  How many Garda stations are now equipped with the devices known as stingers? <Col N="1076" /> How many gardaí have received training in their use?</P>
    <P>The stinger is a key preventative weapon in the battle against joyriders, although I do not suggest it is the only answer to the scourge of joyriding. However, this new law had an immediate and urgent intention, which was to help to prevent deaths as a result of joyriding in stolen cars. Delay in the implementation of this law can only be viewed as criminal official neglect.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for sharing her time.  I offer my condolences to the O'Connell and Kirby families.  The constituency of Cork North-Central, which Deputy Quill and I represent, does not have an epidemic of joyriding. However, joyriding has claimed the lives of three young men, two of whom were innocent bystanders.  They had their lives before them with the prospect of bright careers.  They were going for a bag of chips on a spring evening and were taken as they turned the corner on their way home.</P>
      <P>Our shock and dismay was compounded by the fact that it had not been conveyed to gardaí in the area that the legislation which enables them to use stingers, which they are trained to use, was available to them to stop stolen cars being used for joyriding.  The gardaí did not know they could use the stingers.  I do not know where the message was delayed but it was delayed somewhere.  It was not relayed to the gardaí in Cork North-Central, whatever about the rest of the country.  If the House does nothing else tonight, it should at least explain to the families of the young men, the most recent victims, why the message was not conveyed. We must ensure no more young people lose their lives in such circumstances in the future.  Measures must be used to empower the Garda to stop people who drive round in lethal weapons.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for the opportunity to address the issues raised by them concerning the use by the Garda of the device for stopping vehicles known as the stinger.  I extend my sincere sympathy to the families of Trevor and Stephen who lost their lives in this appalling incident.  I also extend good wishes for a speedy recovery to the young garda in Limerick who sustained appalling injuries after he was driven over.</P>
      <P>About ten years ago, a proposal to use spiked boards was considered but because of safety concerns, although they were tested, they were never put into operation.  Last year the Garda authorities communicated the view to my Department that a new type, the stinger, a tyre deflating device in use in other EU countries, could prove an effective means of addressing the problem of unauthorised taking of vehicles, which has become known as joyriding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 of the 1976 Act allowed a member of the Garda to use reasonable force to compel a person to comply with a requirement to stop a <Col N="1077" /> vehicle, including placing a barrier or other device in the path of a vehicle.  That power related to a number of offences specified in section 8 of that Act.  The power did not extend to the offence under section 112(2) of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, of unlawfully taking a vehicle.</P>
    <P>I was advised by the Attorney General's office that the use of the stinger to counteract the problem of so-called joyriding would require an amendment to the 1976 Act.  I immediately brought forward the necessary legislative proposals and on Report Stage of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, I introduced an amendment to that Act to extend the use of such devices to the offence of unlawfully taking a vehicle.  The effect of the amendment is to allow the Garda to use this new device to stop vehicles unlawfully taken by so-called joyriders.  The stinger will be used by trained gardaí under strict supervision under Garda guidelines.</P>
    <P>However, the stinger will not automatically be used in every case of joyriding.  The decision to use these devices will be based on the safety of people in an area.  For example, it will not be possible to use them in a built up area if the lives of pedestrians or motorists might be put in danger.  Following the introduction of the amendment to the legislation and the availability of stingers to the Garda, I do not want the impression to be given that gardaí will be in a position to use stingers every time they receive a report of a stolen car or unlawful driving of a car.  I understand from the Garda Commissioner this will not be the case and an assessment must be made in each instance by a senior ranking garda as to whether it is safe to use the stinger in terms of people not involved in the joyriding.  It is difficult to anticipate what will happen when somebody sees a stinger.  They may take evasive action and cause danger.</P>
    <P>The legislation to allow the Garda to use the device known as the stinger to stop vehicles was signed by the President on 4 March last.  Normal procedures were then followed whereby the Government secretariat informed my Department on the evening of 6 March 1997 that the Bill had been signed.  This information was transmitted to Garda headquarters on Monday, 10 March 1997.  It is standard procedure that when a Bill, such as the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, is enacted, the Garda authorities issue a policy document to gardaí indicating how the legislative provisions contained in the Act are to be implemented.  It is a matter for the Garda to notify the Garda divisions of such policy.  The Garda is currently making the necessary arrangements to provide for the operational use of the stinger and circulating the relevant instructions to all divisions.  I have been informed that stingers will be available in about one week, that is, within three weeks of the signing of the Act.</P>
    <P>The issue of joyriding, particularly recently in the Cork area, is of great concern.  The Garda Commissioner has informed me there had been significant success in cutting down on joyriding in <Col N="1078" /> the Cork area in recent weeks and I will urge the commissioner to take whatever action is appropriate to stamp out this type of activity, including, where appropriate, the use of the stinger.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service of my Department is operating the Cork auto crime prevention scheme.  This is designed to teach young offenders basic mechanical and driving skills while addressing their offending behaviour. The project is being run in conjunction with local business in the area and it is appropriate to consider extending this scheme to other areas to deal with some of the associated problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and your office for allowing me to raise this matter this evening.  I call on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to reverse this Government's job creation discrimination against Dublin.  I am particularly surprised that an elected Dublin representative such as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, should stand over and support incentives for job creation outside the Dublin area.  This Minister's and the new IDA-Ireland policy of discrimination and bias against Dublin will long be remembered as a resurrection of the rural ritual in our capital city.  This Government has attempted to strip Dublin of its much needed incentives for job creation and continued economic development.</P>
      <P>I tabled parliamentary questions on the subject on 11 March seeking the Minister's views on the need to promote jobs in the Dublin region, to which he replied that Dublin and the eastern region generally had been successful in securing a large proportion of inward investment and went on to say that job creation on the part of Forbairt-assisted companies has also been exceptional.</P>
      <P>On 6 March I tabled parliamentary questions asking that new or additional measures be focused on the north side of the city which I represent. In reply, the Minister made similar remarks to the effect that Dublin and the eastern region had been successful in recent years.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Minister of State to some questions I tabled to the Minister for Social Welfare on 11 March on the percentage of social welfare recipients with an address in the Dublin region.  As one might expect, sadly and unfortunately, Dublin had by far the highest percentage of such recipients, over 28 per cent, followed a long way behind by Cork with 11 per cent and Galway with 5 per cent, all other areas showing single figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also tabled some questions to the Taoiseach on 11 March in relation to the unemployment rate in the Dublin region.  I was given an interesting figure in response to my question, showing that the relevant rate in April 1996 was 12.3 per cent compared with a national average of 11.9 per cent.  The Taoiseach went on to state <Col N="1079" /> that the average unemployment rate for the European Union was 10.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Why is this Government standing over and supporting incentives for job creation outside the Dublin region, bearing in mind those facts and figures?  As I travel around my constituency of Dublin North Central I am only too well aware, as are others, how bad the job scene is.  There are specific areas of high unemployment in every part of Dublin and in my constituency it is in excess of 70 per cent in some cases.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the factual information provided by the Taoiseach and Minister for Social Welfare I ask for an end to this rural ritual, this attempted rape of our struggling economy in Dublin.  Dublin warrants, and I demand, a radical vision and level playing field in job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland offers businesses an integrated incentive package that broadly applies to all parts of the State equally.  The package also extends on a broadly equal basis to overseas investors &mdash; FDI &mdash; indigenous manufacturing companies and businesses operating in certain traded services, that is designated services.</P>
      <P>This package is promoted and administered principally through IDA-Ireland and Forbairt, with SFADCo and Udarás na Gaeltachta responsible for the promotion and administration of their specific areas.  Other agencies, such as FÁS, play an important supporting role in the implementation of these incentives while local authorities work closely with the principal promotional agencies.  This unified approach and unity of purpose have been singularly successful over the years and secured spectacular success in the lifetime of this Government.  The fruits of this unity of effort are visible nationwide.</P>
      <P>I find it most disturbing that Fianna Fáil &mdash; through this question this evening &mdash; appears intent on breaking with the national consensus so crucial to our success to date.  If we are to take this question at face value it would appear that Fianna Fáil has decided to play politics with national industrial policy, something the parties in this House have refrained from doing in the national interest.</P>
      <P>In contrast, this Government and the three parties that comprise it have maintained the consensus approach to industrial policy and national development.  The general scheme can be traced back to the former Taoiseach, the late Séan Lemass, something the three parties in Government would acknowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's general incentive package has been developed and maintained by a succession of Administrations involving all parties in this House and certain agreed changes were made in the way that integrated policy operated from time to time.  For example, it is modified in the case of Gaeltacht regions to take account of their special <Col N="1080" /> circumstances, remoteness and cultural significance.</P>
    <P>Another example of ensuring fitness or determination of purpose is the International Financial Services Centre package which takes account of the emerging role of international financial services, the decision of the Government of the day being to develop our capacity to attract such services here.</P>
    <P>There are other examples of targeting one might mention, such as the Tallaght Task Force established to deal with the consequences of the Packard closure and the Galway Task Force established in the wake of the Digital announcement. Such initiatives were taken within that unified framework, to take account of exigencies as they arose.  All are characterised by a certain unity of purpose including, at the political level, an appropriate approach to national development and industrial policy.</P>
    <P>During the lifetime of this Government in particular industrial policy, as implemented by the Government and until now supported by all parties in the House, has achieved spectacular success. Between the years 1992 and 1994 employment in Dublin was growing at a rate of approximately 4,000 annually and nationally employment was expanding at a rate of 19,600 per annum.  However, between 1994 and 1996 employment in Dublin grew by 19,300 annually and nationally by 51,700 annually.</P>
    <P>The conclusion to be drawn is obvious. Employment generally has grown rapidly over the past three years and is more evenly spread than ever between Dublin and the nation as a whole, which is good for Dublin and the country.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has instituted pro-job reforms in social welfare, for example, an expanded back-to-work allowance scheme, changes in the family income supplement and the tapering of the adult dependency allowance.  These measures are helping people back to work, ensuring a fair share for working families, part-time workers, working parents on low incomes and represent action on the jobs crisis, as does the affirmative action programme introduced by the Minister incorporated in the three schemes, Workplace, Job Initiative and Job Start, and the new local employment service, LES.

      <P>In the same way as the agencies pay special attention to the needs of our smaller towns and rural areas, I can assure the House they are also intensively promoting new towns and inner cities.  These efforts are bearing fruit. In respect of Dublin I might refer Deputy Callely and the House to the proposal for a new national distribution park at Clonburris, Clondalkin, County Dublin which, when fully developed, could provide employment for up to 5000 people, most of those jobs of an industrial type, exactly what the nearby blackspots sorely need on an appropriate scale.

      <P>Is the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry aware that inferior United Kingdom reinforced steel, non-CARES approved, is being dumped on the Irish market and used extensively in farm buildings grant-aided by his Department and, if so, will he make a statement on the matter?  It has been represented to me that reinforced steel which does not comply with the BS4449 standard is being imported and used extensively in the construction of grant-aided farm buildings.  This uncertified steel is, in effect, being dumped on the Irish market at low prices which make it attractive for some unscrupulous builders.</P>
      <P>I want to establish whether the BS4449 standard is required for all Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry installations and grant-aided buildings and, if so, what arrangements are in place to ensure product certification. Will the Minister agree that third party product certification in relation to BS4449 is operated only by the UK Certification Authority for Reinforcing Steels and will he say if there are plans to involve CARES in certifying steel imported into this country?  Will the Minister confirm whether the European Commission's standing committee on construction recently decided that a product certification system will be a requirement for CE marking when the forthcoming European standard for reinforced steel is formally adopted?  If so, what certification system will be put in place here?  Will he require that all steel be embossed with the registered mark of the steel mill which provides traceability to that steel mill?</P>
      <P>In reply to a recent similar question the Minister for Defence said that as regards Defence Force installations the corps of engineers specifies, where appropriate in contract documents, that all steel to be used in construction should comply with British standard 4449.  In addition, provision is made in contract documentation to have construction materials tested should the site engineer require it.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Defence on that occasion did not state how the materials would be tested or by whom.

      <P>My Department has no evidence that inferior reinforced steel is being used in grant-aided farm buildings.  The Department's specifications for all grant-aided farm structures refer, in the absence of a relevant Irish standard, to British standards which are accepted internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK Certification Authority for Reinforcing Steels, CARES, is an organisation founded by the UK steel industry, not by the Government. It is a voluntary certification scheme only.  The certificates cover both the manufacturing of reinforcing <Col N="1084" /> steel, and its processing, i.e., cutting and bending.</P>
    <P>In Ireland there are three companies certified by CARES for cutting and bending only, not for manufacture.  This represents a small percentage, well under 10 per cent, of the number of steel stockists.</P>
    <P>It would be an unacceptable imposition on the entire industry for the Department to specify that only CARES certified steel be used in grant-aided structures.  If the steel reinforcing industry should, as a whole, decide in the future to move towards the adoption of the CARES or other national certification system, the Department would co-operate with the industry in the adoption of that certification system.</P>

The US and EU wish to see a process of peaceful transition to pluralist democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people.  It is the position of the European Union that it can best help the achievement of that objective by means of a result-oriented constructive dialogue.  The EU common position provides for a regime of systematic scrutiny of Cuban performance in the areas of human rights and democratisation. This position was made clear to President Clinton and the US authorities at various meetings, including the EU-US Summit on December 16.</P>

The human rights clause in Article 2 and the other clause to which the Deputy refers, Article 87, are standard in all of these agreements.

However, nothing in Article 87 of the agreement with Morocco, or the comparable clauses in other agreements, releases the signatory State from its obligation to comply with the fundamental norms of international law as laid out in instruments to which it has acceded. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, like other international conventions to which Morocco is party, involves undertakings provided by Morocco to the United Nations.  The covenant also stipulates that parties can in no circumstances derogate from a number of rights set out in it.  The association agreement, for its part, establishes the principle that human rights are an integral and fundamental part of the dialogue between the EU and Morocco.  The agreement gives each side the right to raise the other's fulfilment of its international obligations.</P>

      <P>As stated in my written replies to Questions Nos. 82 and 39 of 25 February and 11 March respectively, the Government and our EU partners continue to be gravely concerned about the spreading military conflict in eastern Zaire.  We have been actively engaged in discussions with our EU partners, most recently at meetings of Development Ministers on 28 February and of Foreign Ministers last weekend with a view to concerting international efforts to bring the conflict to an end and to providing effective relief to the refugees and victims of the conflict.  The Dutch Development Minister, Jan Pronk, visited the region in early March and has had very useful discussions with a range of regional leaders.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, who accompanied the President to Rwanda on 1 and 2 March, had intensive discussions with Rwandan leaders.  She was given assurances that Rwandan refugees remaining in Zaire who wished to return would be welcomed back to Rwanda and allowed to settle there, as has happened with those who returned in November and December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refugees and Zaireans displaced by the conflict who have been moving westwards into Zaire since November 1996 to escape fighting in the east Kivu region have been consistently provided with emergency relief supplies by United Nations agencies and the World Food Programme since <Col N="1087" /> mid-December 1996.  Since the deterioration of security around the towns of Tingi-Tingi, Shabundu and Kisangani, the refugees have again been obliged to leave the camps in which they were receiving emergency relief suppplies.  The Deputy will appreciate that the security situation in eastern Zaire and the constant movement of refugees has made it extremely difficult for the international aid agencies to continue to supply all refugees in Zaire with humanitarian relief. Despite these difficulties, the international aid agencies that are involved in the current relief effort are making every effort to track refugee movements and to ensure that emergency relief supplies continue to be channelled to the most vulnerable.  I understand that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is providing humanitarian relief to over 150,000 refugees who were formerly in Tingi-Tingi camp and have now fled to Ubundu to escape fighting. Smaller groups of refugees have also now been identified in Tingi-Tingi and in Kingulube and are being assisted by UNHCR and the World Food Programme.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to playing its role in the humanitarian relief effort for the Great Lakes region.  Support has consistently been provided to the international relief effort, most recently through the £2.25 million pounds which was allocated to the Great Lakes region at the beginning of November 1996.  We are presently preparing to make a further contribution to international emergency relief efforts and for rehabilitation work in the affected areas.</P>
    <P>The Government remains of the opinion that a political solution to the conflict in eastern Zaire is of paramount importance in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the refugees and displaced population can be effectively met.  In this regard, the Government fully supports and remains in close touch with the efforts of Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun, Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity in the Great Lakes region and of EU Special Envoy Ajello in seeking to find a lasting solution to the problems of the region. Ambassador Sahnoun is engaged in extensive diplomatic efforts throughout the region and has drawn up a five-point peace plan which was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1097 of 18 February.  I have given a full account of his plan in my reply of 11 March. The Deputy will be heartened by the fact that the peace plan was publicly accepted by the Government of Zaire on 5 March and that recent contacts with the rebel leader Mr. Kabila indicate that his side are also prepared to accept Ambassador Sahnoun's plan.</P>
    <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the regroupment policies of the Government of Burundi and is continuing to monitor the situation closely.  Mr. Pronk, who visited Bujumbura on 6 and 7 March, emphasised the concerns of the European Union partners that the policy of <Col N="1088" /> regrouping the rural population into camps should be a strictly temporary measure and that the camps should be as open as possible ensuring access to supplies and freedom to interact with the surrounding communities.  The Government has provided a total of £770,919 to Burundi in emergency humanitarian assistance since 1994. This money has been channelled through international aid agencies, Irish NGOs, in particular Trócaire and Christian Aid, and Burundian NGOs.  The Government and the EU are fully aware that the humanitarian and political situation in the Great Lakes region of central Africa remains critical.  The Government remains committed to both humanitarian and political efforts to stabilise the situation in the region and to allow the process of economic, political and social reconstruction and development to commence.</P>

      <P>The Government is extremely concerned at the plight of the Marsh Arab people.  Iraq's treatment of the Marsh Arabs violates Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991, which called for an end to the repression of the Iraqi civilian population.  This resolution also insists that Iraq should co-operate with humanitarian organisations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected.  In view of Iraq's continuing failure to respond to the concerns of the international community, all EU member states co-sponsored a resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights in April 1996, calling on Iraq to co-operate with UN and other aid agencies to provide humanitarian assistance to the population of southern Iraq.  Ireland &mdash; as Presidency of the EU &mdash; drew attention to the plight of the Marsh Arabs at the 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly on 18 November 1996, condemning Iraq's denial of its population's civil and political rights and expressing the EU's dismay at the plight of the community of the southern marsh areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Iraq and the United Nations concluded an agreement in December last on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 986 of April 1995.  The &ldquo;oil for food&rdquo; resolution, as it is known, is intended as a temporary measure to relieve the humanitarian plight of the Iraqi population, including the Marsh Arabs, until there is full compliance by the Iraqi regime with the Security Council resolutions imposed after the Gulf War.  It allows Iraq to sell specified quantities of oil and provides for two-thirds of oil sale <Col N="1089" /> receipts to be allocated for the purchase of food and medical supplies.  Most importantly from a humanitarian point of view, Iraq has agreed for the first time that UN observers will be allowed to operate in central and southern Iraq which includes the Marsh Arab territories.  I am assured that supplies of food and medicine will shortly be reaching, under UN supervision, the Marsh Arabs and other suffering sectors of the Iraqi population.  However, until Iraq fully commits itself to compliance with the terms of UN Security Council Resolution 688, the basic human rights situation of the Marsh Arabs and of the Iraqi civilian population in general will not be fully safeguarded.  The EU will continue to press Iraq to implement fully all relevant Security Council Resolutions.</P>

      <P>United Nations Security Council Resolution 1088 of 12 December 1996 authorised the establishment of the multinational stability force known as SFOR. SFOR's role is to help, in an even handed way, the parties to implement a peace accord to which they have freely agreed, and to contribute to a secure environment necessary for the consolidation and stabilisation of peace in the region.  SFOR co-operates with the other agencies principally involved including the Office of the High Representative, currently Mr. Carl Bildt, the International Police Task Force, which includes a number of members of the Garda Síochána, the various UN agencies active in Bosnia including the UNHCR, the International Red Cross, and the OSCE.  This co-operation covers a wide range of activities, notably maintaining local security, facilitating freedom of movement for the local population, and assisting the return of refugees.  Security Council Resolution 1088 provided that SFOR would be in operation for a planned period of 18 months from December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SFOR, like its predecessor IFOR, is an important expression of the new mutually reinforcing and co-operative security architecture that is developing in Europe.  Ireland has long been an advocate of co-operative approaches to security, and participation in SFOR would be a concrete example of our commitment to inclusive co-operative security in Europe.  Participation in SFOR would also enable Ireland to experience directly the new approach to European peacekeeping which postdates the Cold War.  Our involvement would be in keeping with our objective, as a recognised and long standing contributor to peacekeeping efforts, of staying in the <Col N="1090" /> mainstream of developments in peacekeeping along with countries, such as the Nordic states, who share our experience of and approach to peacekeeping.  Our involvement would be in the with the approach to peacekeeping set out in the White Paper.  Participation in SFOR would be in no way inconsistent with Ireland's policy of military neutrality.  SFOR is acting under UN authorisation. SFOR currently has 32,000 troops deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, made up of contingents from the 16 members of NATO and from 18 non-NATO countries, including Russia and Ukraine, most of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the neutrals Sweden, Finland and Austria, and non-European non-aligned countries such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Malaysia.  SFOR, and its predecessor, IFOR, have played indispensable roles in consolidating peace for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 27, 36 and 44 together.  Significant progress was made at the Intergovernmental Conference during the Irish Presidency.  The Dublin European Council on 13 and 14 December welcomed the outline draft treaty presented by the Irish Presidency as a good basis for the further work of the conference. Negotiations are continuing under the Dutch Presidency and the conference remains on course to conclude in Amsterdam in June.  The work of the conference since January has been focusing in particular on certain issues where most work remains to be done, notably flexibility, certain sensitive institutional questions and the area of justice and home affairs.  While a further three months of difficult negotiations remain, the prospects are that the outcome will be satisfactory from the Irish point of view.</P>
      <P>Flexibility is one of the most important questions being examined by the Intergovernmental Conference.  The issues involved are both sensitive and complex.  The concept of flexibility in the European Union is not new.  The current treaty provisions on economic and monetary union, for example, provide for significant flexibility. However, the manner in which the concept is developed in the treaty will be of the greatest significance for the future of the European Union. There are essentially three types of flexibility under discussion at the conference.  The first approach would be to provide for flexibility on a case by case basis whereby one or more member states, while not being bound by a decision, would not prevent others from implementing it.  The second approach, so-called &ldquo;predetermined flexibility&rdquo;, would involve establishing in the treaty detailed provisions with a view to flexibility in a particular area.  The third type of flexibility under discussion is the so-called &ldquo;enabling clause&rdquo; approach which would involve setting out general principles in the treaty to be respected in any case of flexibility as well as enabling clauses specific to one or more of the three pillars of the EU establishing the institutional mechanisms according to which flexibility could be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall Irish approach is that we are prepared, as we have been in the past, to consider appropriate forms of flexibility.  At the same time we are conscious that if flexibility is developed in an inappropriate way it could undermine the coherence of both the internal development and external perception of the EU.  As regards the common foreign and security policy, we have in our outline draft treaty proposed a &ldquo;constructive abstention&rdquo; mechanism whereby a member state which decided to abstain on a decision would not be obliged to apply it while at the same time it would accept that the decision commits the EU. We consider that this would represent an <Col N="1092" /> adequate form of flexibility under the second pillar.</P>
    <P>As regards justice and home affairs, the Irish Presidency proposed that conventions &mdash; which would continue to be agreed unanimously &mdash; might be allowed on a case by case basis to enter into force when ratified only by a specified number of member states.  A strong case has been made for further flexibility in this area reflecting in particular the fact that the European Union embraces on the one hand 13 member states who are committed through the Schengen arrangements to the lifting of internal frontiers and on the other hand the common travel area which we share with the United Kingdom.  Our appraoch is that whatever action the EU undertakes in this area should continue to take place within an overall institutional framework in which all 15 member states participate, that priority should be given to EU-wide co-operation involving all 15 member states and that any differentation should be limited to what is strictly necessary.</P>
    <P>As regards flexibility under the first pillar we are ready to consider further the case for building into the treaty an appropriate mechanism to allow some degree of flexibility should this prove necessary in the future provided that the functioning of the internal market and the common policies including the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion are not affected.  We are arguing that the institutional provisions would have to ensure that the interests of the EU as a whole would be served, that the central position of the Commission would be fully respected and that any resort to flexibility would in practice be a last resort.</P>
    <P>The EU treaties already contain provisions on public health.  Proposals have been tabled at the Intergovernmental Conference by Belgium, Luxembourg and the Commission to strengthen those provisions.  We are prepared to examine positively the development of the treaty provisions in this area which is of such direct public concern.</P>
    <P>We share the widespread view that a significant extension of qualified majority voting for normal Community business would improve decision-making in the existing union and is even more necessary as the EU faces the prospect of further enlargement.  However, a number of sensitive matters, notably the taxation area, should in our view remain subject to unanimity.  It is generally considered likely that decisive progress on this issue will be posssible only at a late stage of the conference at high political level.  As regards the weighting of votes of member states in the Council the more populous member states argue that already the percentage of the Union's population whose Governments can be outvoted in the system of qualified majority voting has increased, that this trend will increase further with the accession of several more small and medium sized countries and that some redistribution of voting weights is therefore necessary.  Our approach, like that of several other member states, is that we are <Col N="1093" /> not convinced of the need for change in this regard.  We are, however, sensitive to the concerns of our partners.  The outcome of the conference must be acceptable to all member states and preserve the broad balance between member states which has been essential to the success of the EU.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 28, 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government on Burma is based on the common position on Burma which was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 28 October last.  The common position not only reaffirmed measures against Burma which were already in place &mdash; the expulsion of all military personnel attached to Burmese diplomatic representations in EU member states and the embargo on arms, munitions and military equipment &mdash; but also introduced additional restrictions such as the ban on entry visas for senior members of the SLORC and their families and the suspension of high-level bilateral governmental visits to Burma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already informed the House, in reply to Question No. 48 of 19 February and Question No. 44 of 11 March, about recent exchanges between EU and ASEAN countries in relation to the deteriorating situation in Burma.  I would refer again to the discussion at lunch at the EUASEAN ministerial meeting in Singapore on 13 <Col N="1094" /> February in which the concerns of European Ministers were conveyed to the ASEAN side in great detail and to the formal EU statement made at this meeting.  In addition to expressing the concern of the European Union at continuing human rights violations in Burma, the EU called upon the SLORC immediately and unconditionally to release all political prisoners and to embark upon a process of national reconciliation and democratic reform respecting the aspirations of the Burmese people as expressed in the elections of May 1990.  To this end, the EU also called upon the SLORC to enter into a meaningful dialogue with pro-democracy groups in general and with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in particular as well as with representatives of various ethnic groups. Ireland, of course, associates itself fully with this statement by the Presidency.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Karen people, I remain deeply concerned about the fate of the refugees who have been turned back from Thailand as they attempted to flee from the renewed conflict which has erupted with such violence between the SLORC forces and the Karen National Union over the last few weeks following a renewed SLORC offensive.  Together with our partners in the European Union, we urge the parties involved to exercise maximum restraint and to seek non-violent means to resolve their dispute.</P>
    <P>The EU issued a declaration on the Karen refugee problem on 28 February urging the Government of Thailand to apply internationally recognised norms and standards relating to the treatment of refugees and asking the Thai authorities to ensure that all civilians seeking refuge in its territory will be allowed protection and shelter there until the underlying causes for their flight have been removed.  In making this declaration, the European Union countries also underlined their appreciation for the assistance which the Royal Thai Government has been providing to refugee populations on its territory for many years in fulfilment of its humanitarian obligations.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that the European Union, through the European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO, has provided a total of 3,240,000 ECU since 1994 to support Karen refugees on the Thai border.  My Department has recently received a number of proposals seeking Irish aid funding for humanitarian relief programmes with Karen refugees in Thailand.  These appeals will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>On the question of the imposition of economic sanctions on the military regime in Burma, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 103 of 25 September 1996.  I would add that in January 1996 the European Commission began an investigation of forced labour practices in Burma in the context of the European Union's generalised system of preferences.  This investigation was initiated on foot of a complaint lodged by the European Trade Union Conference and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.  The investigation has now been completed and the results have been presented to the <Col N="1095" /> Council of Ministers.  I expect that the Council of Ministers will take a decision in the near future on the continued application of the benefits of the GSP to Burma.</P>
    <P>On Question No. 47 concerning my meeting with Dr. Sein Win, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 7 today.</P>
    <P>The Government remains gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in Burma.  I assure the House that I will continue to take up the question of Burma, including human rights violations there, at every appropriate opportunity.</P>

      <P>We are fortunate to have been able to hear the views of a number of distinguished South African visitors on how their country's remarkable transformation was achieved.  In addition to the joint lecture given in Belfast last June by Cyril Ramaphosa and Roelf Meyer, to which the question refers, interesting presentations have been given by, among others, Judge Albie Sachs, Minister Kader Asmal and Dr. Alex Boraine.  Moreover, several Members of this House, including myself, were present at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when it was addressed by former President De Klerk in November 1995.</P>
      <P>Each of these speakers has been at pains to emphasise that each conflict is unique and that drawing exact parallels is simplistic, though there are undoubted elements of similarity.  As Cyril Ramaphosa said, &ldquo;While you might learn some lessons from the experiences of others, ultimately you will have to find for yourselves the processes and solutions that suit your own situation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, there are undoubtedly technical aspects of the South African experience which offer potential guidance.  The rules of procedure of the multi-party negotiations have already drawn from the South African example the concept of &ldquo;sufficient consensus&rdquo;, although it is somewhat more tightly defined.  As the Taoiseach has already stated, the adoption of a clear and realistic agreed timeframe would also be potentially valuable &mdash; as it proved to be in South Africa &mdash; and I would like to see the two Governments bring forward proposals for consideration by all the participants when the negotiations resume in June.  The parties may also be able to draw useful lessons from South African views on matters such as internal consultation and the composition of delegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what comes through very clearly <Col N="1096" /> from accounts of the South African negotiations is the absolutely central importance of less tangible factors: courage, leadership and trust.  Of the many thought-provoking points made by Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa last June two perhaps stand out in my mind: &ldquo;it was trust that finally delivered a settlement&rdquo; and &ldquo;the one thing that always bound us together was the belief that there is always a solution to any problem.&rdquo;  Ultimately no solution is acheivable without the building of trust and without a determination to succeed.</P>

      <P>I have raised the question of human rights at every appropriate opportunity with the Chinese authorities, most recently when I participated at the EU troika meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on 14 February. During this meeting, a full account of which has been given in reply to Question No. 44 of 11 March, the EU expressed its regret that China had not agreed to a new date for an EU-China meeting within the framework of the human rights dialogue initiated in 1995 and highlighted European interest in resuming such a dialogue. The EU also repeated its call that China become party to the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as that on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</P>
      <P>We also sought the release of political prisoners in need of medical treatment and the agreement of China to facilitate prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Since the meeting, there have been indications that the Chinese authorities are considering, in particular, the issue of prison visits and the question of adherence to the two UN covenants which I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues which the EU has consistently raised with the Chinese authorities is the situation which obtains in Tibet, including violations of human rights standards; the immigration into Tibet of persons of Han-Chinese origin; issues relating to religious freedom and the fate of the seven year old boy who is the Dalai Lama's choice as Panchen Lama.  The Deputy will be aware that the annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is currently taking place in Geneva.  The commission is the major UN instrument in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights.  Ireland is currently a member of the commission.  In that capacity, and in tandem with our EU partners, we <Col N="1097" /> will be seeking to ensure that close attention is given during the session to the human rights issues that I have already mentioned.</P>

      <P>It is the task of the European Commission to put forward proposals for the multi-annual financial perspectives within which the annual budgets of the European Union are drawn up.  The current financial perspectives apply until the end of 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission is currently in the process of drawing up proposals for the financial perspectives <Col N="1098" /> which will apply during the years 2000 to 2004.  It has been agreed that it will table these proposals following the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Maastricht Treaty.  If the Intergovernmental Conference concludes as planned at the meeting of the European Council in Amsterdam in June, we can expect the proposals to be tabled in July.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken, and will continue to take, all appropriate steps to ensure that Ireland's interests are taken into account in the Commission's proposals.  To this end we are keeping in close touch with the Commission at both political and official levels.  The Taoiseach visited Brussels at the beginning of this month and held meetings with President Santer, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and other Commissioners.  He has given a report of his meetings in reply to questions in this House.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the proposals are likely to extend at least until the end of the year.  The Deputy will understand that it would not be appropriate for me to go into detail on Ireland's negotiating position at this time.  We will, however, be concerned to ensure that the new financial perspectives are adequate.  They will have to be sufficient to meet the Union's ongoing needs especially in areas such as cohesion and agriculture which are of particular interest to Ireland, as well as the new demands arising from enlargement.</P>
    <P>Despite current levels of GDP, Ireland will continue to have major development needs well into the next decade.  The levels of growth which we currently enjoy are relatively recent.  We have yet to attain European averages in terms of accumulated wealth, investment, capital formation and infrastructure.  Commissioner Wulf-Mathies herself has stated that there should be no sudden shock in the case of Ireland &mdash; that the success which has been achieved should not be put at risk by a sudden withdrawal of funding.  I am confident, therefore, that Ireland will again secure a substantial measure of structural funding in the next round.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the report on human rights in Israel, the occupied territories under Israeli control and the Palestinian autonomous areas, to which the Deputy refers.  I am also aware of the resolution which was passed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs on 26 February, calling for the establishment, in conjunction with the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements, <Col N="1099" /> of an EU monitoring committee on human rights.</P>
      <P>The European Union remains gravely concerned at violations of human rights in the region. The Union insists on the fundamental nature of human rights obligations in all of its new generation association agreements, such as the EU-Israel Agreement and the Interim Association Agreement between the Union and the PLO.  In addition both Israel and the Palestinian Authority have made a solemn political commitment to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, the Barcelona Process, and the promotion of human rights and the development of democratic institutions are essential elements of this process.</P>
      <P>With regard to Israel and the occupied territories under its control, the EU has regularly underlined to Israel the importance of compliance with human rights.  During our Presidency of the EU, in Ireland's statement to the Third Committee of the General Assembly on behalf of the European Union, we stressed the need for Israel to promote compliance, in the areas under their control, with the basic norms of democracy, including respect of human rights and the rule of law.  In this regard, we called on Israel to respect the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians. In addition, the Government has expressed its concern at the decision taken by the Israeli Supreme Court in recent months that Israeli secret service investigators can use physical pressure in the questioning of Palestinian detainees.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Palestinian Authority, the Interim Association Agreement between the EU and the PLO which was signed on 24 February allows for the establishment of a political dialogue between the EU and the PLO.  This dialogue covers all issues of common interest, in particular the conditions required to ensure, <i>inter alia</i>, democracy and respect for human rights.  In the Third Committee at the General Assembly, the Irish Presidency stressed the Union's view that respect for human rights and the promotion of democratic institutions are essential in order to maintain the peace process and to strengthen the foundations of Palestinain self-rule.  In addition, in its contacts with the Palestinian Authority, the Union has expressed its concern at the treatment of detainees in Palestinian custody and underlined the importance of full respect for the rule of law and human rights.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention, and that of the EU as a whole, to continue to monitor the human rights situation in Israel and the occupied territories under Israeli control as well as in the areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority, in order to help ensure that both Israel and the Palestinian Authority comply with their commitments under their agreements with the Union.</P>

      <P>The European Union is seriously concerned at the situation in Belarus arising out of the Constitutional referendum of November 1996.  The Deputy will recall that the Taoiseach met President Lukashenko <i>en marge</i> of the OSCE Summit in Lisbon on 3 December 1996, and that he strongly expressed the Union's concerns on that occasion.  During this meeting, the Taoiseach suggested that the EU send a fact-finding mission to Belarus to assess the situation there in the aftermath of the referendum.  This mission visited Belarus from 26-31 January last. It was mandated to obtain all the relevant facts pertaining to the constitutional referendum, to assess the procedures of the new bicameral legislature established by President Lukashenko and to assess the relationships between the executive, legislature and judiciary against the accepted standards of separation of powers.  It was led by Mr. Kosto, a former Minister for Justice of the Netherlands, and also comprised representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe.  The mission held meetings with Government, including two lengthy meetings with President Lukashenko, opposition, including discussions with members of the Parliament dissolved by President Lukashenko, non-governmental organisations and members of the diplomatic community.</P>
      <P>The report of the fact-finding mission was presented to the General Affairs Council on 24 February and Ministers had a detailed discussion of its recommendations.  These recommendations included the questions of the legality of the referendum process, and of the new bicameral legislature as well as freedom of the media.  The report was critical of the conduct of the referendum, and criticised the concentration of power in the hands of the President.  Ministers adopted a series of conclusions calling, <i>inter alia</i>, on Belarus to accept the report of the fact-finding mission, and to adopt appropriate measures to ensure respect for accepted standards of separation of powers.</P>
      <P>The report of the fact-finding mission and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council were presented to President Lukashenko on 3 March. The European Union is now awaiting the response of the Belarussian authorities to the report and the conclusions.  In the interests of ongoing dialogue with the Belarussion authorities, it has been agreed not to publish either the report or the conclusions until that response has been received.  I assure the Deputy that both the report and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council will be placed in the Dáil Library at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>Under the EU's agreed common criteria on arms exports, known as the Luxembourg and Lisbon criteria, member states are encouraged, in the framework of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, to inform and consult each other increasingly on matters of arms export control policy.  The ongoing process is being used to assist the development of a common approach leading to a harmonisation of national policies, not least with respect to the implementation of arms embargoes.  Ireland's input to the process consistently reflects our overriding objective in the field of arms exports, namely the promotion of restraint and responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and of technologies for military use.</P>
      <P>In the framework of the common foreign and security policy, EU arms embargoes have been evolving and developing.  Prior to the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union on 1 November 1993, EU arms embargoes were usually introduced by way of Council Declarations and implementation was effectively a matter for individual member states.  Under the Common Foreign and Security Policy, EU arms embargoes are adopted as common positions of the Council and, in accordance with Article J.2.2 of the Treaty, member states ensure that their national policies conform to the common positions. In addition, the EU endeavours to specify the categories of arms covered, at Union level, by UN arms embargoes where these are non-specific and by embargoes imposed directly by the Union. This is an effort to facilitate a more uniform implementation by member states of EU embargoes.</P>
      <P>In the case of the two most recent EU embargoes adopted by the Council, those on arms exports to the former Yugoslavia and to Afghanistan, the provisions expressly state that the embargoes cover contracts entered into prior to the entry into force of the embargo.  These developments reflect both the determination of the EU to ensure that arms embargoes are made as effective as possible, and also the strengthening of the legal basis, under the Treaty, for the implementation of embargoes.</P>

      <P>Ireland and its partners in the European Union are gravely concerned at the ongoing crisis in Albania, which is deteriorating, despite the recent formation of a Government of National Reconciliation.  The current priority of the Government and the European Union is to actively support efforts by the international community, and in particular the OSCE, to assist the new government in Albania to restore public order and achieve a return to political stability.</P>
      <P>Following visits to Albania by Dutch Foreign Minister Van Mierlo in his capacity as President of the Council of Minister, and the Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairman in Office, Franz Vranitsky, agreement was reached by President Berisha and Albanian opposition parties on a nine-point plan to restore stability to Albania. This led to the formation of a Government of National Reconciliation.  A major element of this accord was an agreement to hold fresh, internationally-monitored parliamentary elections by June.  There would clearly be a role for the OSCE in this regard, and Ireland, along with its European partners, would wish to be involved in any international monitoring effort, in order to ensure the free and fair conduct of the elections.</P>
      <P>With regard to assistance, the European Union is presently providing assistance to Albania under the Community PHARE programme.  This assistance has amounted to about 450 million ECU since 1992, when the PHARE programme was extended to Albania, and is currently concentrated on developing infrastructure and human resources, sectoral restructuring and macro-economic stabilisation.  Humanitarian and food aid and balance of payment support have also been provided.</P>
      <P>Further extension of EU aid to Albania will be considered in the light of progress made in returning to political normality and pursuing democratic and constitutional reform.  It may be necessary in the short term to provide further humanitarian assistance, and this matter is currently being examined by the member states of the European Union.  Ireland will also give consideration to the provision of whatever assistance is necessary.</P>

      <P>A European conference on conflict prevention, organised by Saferworld and a range of other European non-governmental organisations, was held in Amsterdam on 27-28 February.  My colleague at the Department of Foreign Affairs, <Col N="1104" /> the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, attended and addressed the conference.  An action programme on conflict prevention and peace building was agreed at the conference and presented to the Dutch Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises the value of conflict prevention and accepts that a comprehensive approach to preventing conflict in the world has implications for a wide range of issues.  It strongly supports the development of the greatest possible measure of cohesion between the foreign policy of the European Union and its development co-operation policy.  This is particularly significant with respect to countries and regions of tension, whose precarious stability is too often put at risk by excessive accumulations of arms.  In this context, the regulation of arms transfers is an important but difficult issue.</P>
      <P>Under Article 223 of the Treaty on European Union any member state can take such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of the essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material.  This means that, in legal terms, arms export policies in EU member states remain national policies.  Thus, any proposals which would significantly constrain the prerogative of national decision-making on specific arms exports will almost inevitably be resisted, in particular by the major arms exporting member states.  This is the framework within which the proposal to which the Deputy refers &mdash; the proposal for a common, restrictive and binding interpretation of the EU's eight common criteria on arms transfers based on a code of conduct and leading to the establishment of an EU arms transfer policy at the highest existing levels of restraint &mdash; must be viewed.</P>
      <P>As I told the Deputy in reply to a similar question on 11 December 1996, despite these constraints it has been possible to make some progress on this issue.  However, the progress to date is only a start and further work is needed to achieve an eventual common interpretation of the criteria.  Conferences such as the one mentioned by the Deputy can play a role in maintaining pressure on countries which do not, in practice, subscribe to the goal of achieving the maximum possible transparency and restraint in arms transfers.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs his views on the fact that a previous statement made in answer to Parliamentary Question No. 34 of 6 February 1997, regarding the EU-Israel Association Agreement wherein he claimed that the overwhelming importance of the human rights clause and the extent to which it underlines all subsequent commitments is shown by the fact that it is placed in Article 2, at the very beginning of the association agreement, was misleading in view of the fact that the order in which the articles of any EU agree- ment with a third country are placed has no bearing on their importance and provisions contained in the first article can still be undermined by the last; and if he will follow the advice of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs which, on 26 February 1997, urged him to clarify the supremacy of Article 2 to avoid interpretation of the agreement in any manner which may undermine the non-derogability of human rights, particularly in view of the implications of the Israeli Supreme Court ruling of 14 November 1996, which legalised torture.</Quest>

      <P>It is the view of the Government, shared by our partners in the European Union, that the placing of the human rights clause in Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement emphasises the overwhelming importance of this clause and the extent to which it underlines subsequent commitments.  Article 2 involves a commitment by Israel and the European Union to consider human rights questions as a fundamental part of the political dialogue which is established between them.</P>
      <P>This gives parties the legal right, for the first time, to raise with each other matters concerning their respective human rights performance.  As I stated in my reply of 6 February to another question on this issue, it is the intention of the EU as a whole that these human rights clauses should be regularly monitored and instances of violations discussed.</P>
      <P>Israel's fundamental commitments in the field of human rights derive from the fact that it is a party to a number of UN human rights instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  This covenant stipulates that parties can in no circumstances derogate from a number of rights such as freedom from torture.  The non-derogability of human rights provisions, which has been established in international conventions, is not set aside by any article in the association agreement.</P>

      <P>Participants at the recent EU-Russia summit meeting in Moscow included the Netherlands Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, as Presidents-in-office of the European Council and Council of Ministers respectively; Commission President Santer and Commissioner Van den Broek.  The Russian delegation was led by President Yeltsin, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, <Col N="1106" /> First Deputy Prime Minister Davidof and Foreign Minister Primakov.</P>
      <P>The summit meeting facilitated a constructive and wide-ranging exhange of views between the two sides on EU-Russian relations, including economic and trade relations, as well as on Russia's relations with neighbouring states and security issues.  The meeting provided a valuable opportunity to the EU side to express support for Russia's ongoing programme of economic and democratic reforms; to underline the importance it attaches to the early entry into force of the partnership and co-operation agrement and to express support for Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation.</P>
      <P>In the course of discussions, the two sides looked forward to the early entry into force of the EU-Russian partnership and co-operation agreement and reviewed the current state of bilateral trade relations between them including in the steel and textile sectors.  Discussions also focused on the prospects for Russia's accession to the World Trade Organisation.  In this connection agreement was reached on the need to identify and overcome the obstacles still standing in the way of achieving this important objective.  The operation of the TACIS programme and EU-Russian financial co-operation also arose in the discussions.  Among the political issues discussed was the situation in Belarus following the constitutional referendum.  President Yeltsin also spoke about relations with Ukraine, including the issue of the Black Sea Fleet and its home port of Sevastopol, and said that productive talks on the matter were being held with the Ukrainian authorities. Developments relating to the European Security Architecture also featured in the discussions.</P>

      <P>The main impetus driving this change was the expressed wish of the Government of Tanzania to assume a strong leadership role in the process of educational reform.

      <P>I am familiar with the case of the individual to which the Deputy refers and am aware that, along with other prisoners on temporary transfer to Northern Ireland, he was transferred from Maghaberry Prison to the Maze Prison in September last.</P>
      <P>My Department has monitored his case for a number of years.  The individual is currently on a temporary transfer to Northern Ireland which is subject to review every six months.  To date, the transfer has been consistently renewed.  It was most recently renewed in February of this year for a further six months.</P>
      <P>Our embassy in London has had contact with the British Home Office, who are responsible for temporary transfer prisoners in Northern Ireland, on a number of occasions regarding the individual's applications for compassionate parole.  I understand he was last granted compassionate parole in October 1996.</P>
      <P>I understand that the individual has made a number of applications to have his transfer made permanent.  However, his applications have been refused to date.  The Government has consistently indicated to the British authorities its view that all transfers to Northern Ireland, including this case, should be made permanent.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this case continues to be monitored closely by my Department.</P>

      <P>The special support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland involves delivery of funding for a wide range of actions under measures dealing with employment, social inclusion, urban and rural regeneration, cross-Border co-operation and economic development generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> The urban and rural regeneration actions are delivered through county council-led task forces set up in each of the six Border counties.  Applications are assessed on the basis of their compliance with the programme's objectives.</P>
    <P>Grant allocations, apart perhaps from those delivered by the task forces, are not categorised on a county basis.  Many successful applications involve multi-county and cross-Border projects. Details of grant approvals, including particulars of promoters, projects, project locations and amount of grants are published periodically by the agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present preparing for a joint meeting of the programme's monitoring committee, which will be held in the Border region in the middle of April next.  In the course of that preparation updated and comprehensive listings will be produced and I will arrange to have copies made available to the Deputy and in the Dáil Library when they are available.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the registration of all vehicles in the State, that personalised number plates are not permitted under existing regulations.  The specified format of registration plates includes the lettering, numbering, dimensions and technical specifications.  A transparent and consistent numbering system is essential for control purposes. The introduction of personalised number plates would undermine the essential features of the existing system and would have serious implications for control.  It would in fact necessitate a complete overhaul of the system.  For the reasons outlined it is not intended to introduce personalised number plates.  Members of the public may, however, reserve a particular number in the normal registration sequence on payment of a fee of £250.  This system is operated on a first come first served basis.</P>

      <P>Savings certificates are a long established product, first introduced in 1923.  Since then, it has not been the practice to notify customers when certificates mature.  Nonetheless, customers could, at any time, request the current value and the extension rates to next maturity either by post or by personal enquiry at the 650 largest &ldquo;Service Plus&rdquo; Post Offices nationwide.  Consequently, there has been no customer demand for the issue of maturity notifications.  However, having reviewed current custom and practice in other financial institutions, the NTMA and An Post agree that the introduction of maturity notifications for savings <Col N="1114" /> certificates would be beneficial to their customers. Preparations to effect their introduction are now being put in train and the notifications will be introduced when the necessary changes have been made to the relevant computer systems. The notifications will be introduced on a phased basis in line with the data capture and computerisation of the various issues of certificates.</P>
      <P>National instalment savings and savings bonds were introduced in 1970 and 1975 respectively. Because these were then new products with terms and conditions significantly different from the product with which customers were than familiar, namely savings certificates, it was decided from the outset to notify investors on maturity.</P>
      <P>The balance outstanding in savings certificates at 31 December, 1996 is estimated at £2,064.6 million, broken down into 10 year periods, based on dates of issue, as follows:</P>

      <P>In general, entry to the Civil Service must be by way of open competition.  Section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973 provided for the reinstatement to their former positions of women who resigned from the Civil Service for marriage-related reasons and who fulfilled specific criteria.  The Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act, 1996 repealed the statutory provisions and, consequently, the only avenue of re-entry to the Civil Service now open to women who resigned on marriage is by competing in and being successful at an open competition run by the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to alleviate the consequences of the repeal of the reinstatement scheme, the next two series of clerical assistant and executive officer competitions will include provision for special sub-panels which will be composed soley of former civil servants but will not differentiate on grounds of gender or marital status.  It is hoped <Col N="1115" /> that this initiative will go some way towards facilitating the re-entry to the Civil Service of women who resigned on marriage.  As the Deputy is aware, competitions for recruitment to the Civil Service are run by the Civil Service Commissioners and are advertised in the daily papers from time to time.  It is envisaged that competitions for appointment as executive officer and clerical assistant will be advertised during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Since the early 1990s the age limit applying to general service recruitment grades has been 50. This limit is currently under review.</P>

      <P>The law provides that claimants for artists' relief must be solely resident in the State.

      <P>I have no plans to discontinue the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 and over.  This system reduces or eliminates the income tax burden for many pensioners on low and moderate incomes. It is also, however, necessary to provide additional relief to those elderly paying income <Col N="1116" /> tax at the standard and higher rates.  The income tax age allowance was therefore increased substantially this year &mdash; by £200 single/£400 married &mdash; the first time since 1986.  The age related exemption limits have been increased each year by varying amounts in that period.  I believe that the increase in the age allowance this year is a reasonable policy to pursue and is in line with a commitment in Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>I do not intend providing for the creation of an independent living fund in the forthcoming Finance Bill which will be published shortly.  The establishment of such a fund is proposed in the context of providing funding for a personal assistance service (PAS) to people with disabilities to live independently in the community.  Following publication of the report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, an interdepartmental task force is examining its recommendations, including a PAS, in conjunction with the health recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The results of the task force's examination are expected to be available by the middle of the year.  They will be given careful consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Health, who has responsibility for services for people with a disability. He has, in the meantime, provided an additional £200,000 this year for the existing PAS to enable more people to benefit from it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of an agreement between the County and City Managers' Association and the Ordnance Survey dated 19 July 1993, local authorities may reproduce maps for sale to the general public.  Where local authorities choose to avail of this provision of the agreement, they are required to remit a licence fee to the Ordnance Survey in respect of each sale as set out in the schedule under.  A sum greater than the figure indicated may be charged by the local authorities to cover the cost of reproduction and handling. The size of any discount offered in respect of map sales is a matter for each local authority.  The question of discounts offered to local authorities by the Ordnance Survey does not arise as maps are reproduced from the stock of maps normally held by the local authorities.  In general, local authorities do not present themselves as sales agents for Ordnance Survey products.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are not required to affix any identifying stamp, mark or number, to a map sold to the public under the agreement, nor are they required to certify that the map sold is a true copy of the original Ordnance Survey map sheet.</P>
      <P>Two local authorities have made remittances in respect of map sales over the last five years.  The total remitted amounted to £4,167.  In the period 1992-96, local authorities paid a total of £1.894 million in licence fees to the Ordnance Survey for the use of its mapping products.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Western Health Board is responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff in its own area.  The career break scheme and the job-sharing scheme is applicable to all health agencies, including health boards, under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The scheme is open to all staff.  The terms of the scheme provide that its operation and management is a matter for each health agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person to which the Deputy refers has already received a career break to the maximum period allowable under the scheme, namely five <Col N="1120" /> years.  The board has already agreed to an extension beyond this date.  The board has further agreed to allow the person concerned three months special leave without pay shortly after her return to full-time duty.</P>
    <P>The terms of the career break scheme do not preclude staff from applying to be considered under the job-sharing scheme.  I understand that discussions have already taken place between the board and the person concerned concerning her wish for job-sharing and efforts have been made to accommodate her wishes.  It is a matter for individual health agencies and their employees to agree suitable posts under the scheme.  My Department has urged health agencies to make the schemes available to as many employees as possible, taking into account service considerations.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the delivery of health services, including mental health services, in its functional area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with a key recommendation of the report on the development of the mental health services &mdash; Planning for the Future &mdash; which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted <Col N="1121" /> by successive Governments, the board is developing a comprehensive range of community mental health facilities, including community residential accommodation, in each of its catchment areas.  In parallel with these developments, patients receiving care in psychiatric hospitals, including St. Brendan's Hospital, have participated in rehabilitation programmes and successfully resettled in more appropriate community residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>Since 1986 the in-patient population in St. Brendan's Hospital has reduced from 987 to approximately 210 at present.  I am informed by the board that plans for the further development of mental health services which will impact on acute in-patient services currently provided at St. Brendan's Hospital, include proposals for the provisions of new acute psychiatric units at St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park and James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.  These units, once in operation, will provide acute in-patient services for their respective catchment areas which are currently provided at St. Brendan's. My Department has also provided significant additional capital funding in recent years to upgrade and refurbish facilities at St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board is at present drawing up a development control plan for St. Brendan's which will take into account the board's immediate and long-term requirements for the service including the needs of non-acute patients in St. Brendan's.  When this plan is completed, it will be the subject of discussion between the board and my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Due to the nature of the work of a hospital such as Beaumont which has a busy accident and emergency department, it is not always possible to predict the precise pattern of activity.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of medical attention.  Due to the pressure on the accident and emergency department in Beaumont there have been a number of occasions when some patients have experienced delays in being admitted for elective procedures. A number of initiatives have been taken in the hospital in order to improve the situation. These include&mdash; a review of the hospital's discharge policy, the opening of St. Paul's observation ward, the introduction of a regular bed audit to ensure efficient bed turnover, and tighter control of the admission and discharge policies for the five-day wards so that these beds are protected for elective admissions as far as possible.</P>
      <P>The hospital regrets that the person referred to by the Deputy has had her admission cancelled on so many occasions, however, this was due to non-availability of beds for elective surgery as a result of increased admissions through the accident and emergency departments.  In view of the numerous previous cancellations the hospital has assured me that this patient will be given priority in the future.  I would also like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that Beaumont Hospital is enabled to respond effectively to the demand placed upon it and I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children and the maintenance of waiting lists is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The health board orthodontic services are being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of orthodontic treatment services through a consultant led orthodontic service in each health board.  A primary task of the consultant is to organise and co-ordinate orthodontic training to sub-consultant level for Health Board dental staff.  This enables health boards to provide a greatly increased volume of service and a service of high quality.</P>
    <P>At present, average waiting times for children seeking orthodontic treatment vary considerably throughout the country.  In some areas there are large numbers of children on the waiting lists and there can be long waiting periods for orthodontic treatment.  However, with the recruitment of the consultant orthodontists and the development of the consultant led services it can be expected that there will be considerable improvements in the waiting times.</P>
    <P>Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected-handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity-handicap.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the provisions outlined in the health strategy, the dental health action plan and the additional resources provided to health boards over the past few years for developments in the orthodontic services, my Department in consultation with the health boards and their consultant orthodontists is currently reviewing the guidelines.  The objectives of this review are to ensure equity in the provision of orthodontic treatment throughout the health boards and reduce the waiting time for treatment, having regard to the resources available to the boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 89 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> was published in December last.  It sets out the requirements for the development of services, including a personal assistance service.  The report has been circulated to health boards and officials of my Department are now in discussion with the boards regarding the process of implementing the report.</P>
      <P>The report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> that funding deficits for existing services be addressed in the first instance.  An additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put the services on a more secure financial footing and to enable some services, initiated in 1996, to be further developed.  Of this funding, £200,000 was allocated for the development of existing personal assistance services.  In addition, a further £1 million in revenue funding has been provided in 1997 for new services.  Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the health boards as to the priorities in service development for the allocation of these funds.  The personal assistance service is one of those under consideration.</P>
      <P>The interdepartmental task force examining the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is also considering the review group report and will be making recomendations to Government about its implementation at the end of June.</P>
      <P>Over the last few months officials of my Department have had several meetings with the Centre for Independent Living.  I am, therefore, fully aware of the concerns of the organisation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The number of deaths from suicide for males and females for each of the years 1992 to 1995 is set out in the table below.  The latest year for which annual figures are available is 1995.  Figures for the first three quarters of 1996 show that 195 deaths from suicide for males and 52 deaths from suicide for females were registered.</P>
      <P>The death registration system is the principal source for statisical information on cause of death, including deaths from suicide.  Information on particular occupations and professions recorded on death certificates is in all countries known to be subject to many sources of bias, incompleteness and unreliability.  The circumstances in which the information is sought are difficult and very often the person providing the information does not have an accurate picture of the previous occupation(s) of the deceased.  For this reason the Central Statistics Office does not provide any analysis of cause of dealth by occupation in its Annual Reports on Vital Statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The only acute hospital to close in the period referred to by the Deputy was Waterford Maternity Hospital.  This hospital closed in 1995 and its services transferred to the new Waterford Regional Hospital.  In relation to future policy in the acute hospital area, I would like to stress that I have no plans to close any hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there has been a shift in the delivery of care for those with mental illness from a predominantly institutional to community-based intervention as recommended in the report, Planning for the Future, which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted as mental health policy by successive Governments. In line with two key recommendations of the report health boards are developing a comprehensive range of community-based services including day hospitals, day centres and community residential accommodation.  Acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals are also being developed and there are now 16 such units nationwide.  It is the intention to establish more of these units over the next decade as capital resources allow.</P>
      <P>The implementation of this policy has resulted in the transfer of services from a number of hospitals to alternative community-based facilities resulting in the closure of those hospitals.  In the period referred to in the question the following hospitals were closed:</P>
      <P>1.  Southern Health Board</P>
      <P>&mdash; St. Anne's Hospital, Skibbereen, which was the in-patient base for the west Cork catchment area, closed in 1996 and now functions as a high support community residence.  Acute in-patient services are being provided at a new acute psychiatric unit at Bantry General Hospital.</P>
      <P>&mdash; St. Coleman's Hospital, Macroom, which provided in-patient care for elderly patients with mental illness and with a mental handicap, also closed in 1996.  Patients have been relocated to more appropriate alternative dedicated community residential accommodation and it is the intention of the board that the hospital will in the future function as a sector headquarters within the catchment area.</P>
      <P>2.  Western Health Board</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon, closed in 1996 and was transferred to the Department of Justice.  Former patients have been relocated <Col N="1128" /> to appropriate alternative dedicated community residential accommodation. Acute in-patient services are being provided at the psychiatric unit, Roscommon General Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Policy in the regional development of acute hospital services envisages the expansion of specialist services in health boards so that with the exception of a small number of specialities of a national dimension, for example cardiac surgery, neurosurgery and organ transplantation, expertise in the full range of specialties will be available in each health board area.  Since 1994, acute hospital services in the Mid-Western Health Board have been substantially improved and a number of new services have been introduced. Areas which have benefited include cardiology, urology, vascular surgery, gastro-intestinal surgery, renal dialysis and neonatalogy.  In 1997, I have provided an additional £485,000 to the Mid-Western Health Board for the further development of regional specialities in acute hospitals.</P>
      <P>Further improvements will be made in the near future, particularly in relation to the delivery and provision of cancer services.  When I launched the action plan for the implementation of the <i>National Cancer Strategy,</i> earlier this month, I announced that, in relation to the Mid-Western Health Board, consultant appointments would be made in oncology and palliative care.  I have already provided funding for the post of consultant haematologist.  These developments mean that few patients from the mid-west should have to travel outside the region for treatment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to answer Questions Nos. 93 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The pilot employment programme is administered by the National Rehabilition Board on behalf of the Department of Health.  The costs incurred in the administration of the programme were £30,000 in the period 1994-95 and £57,220 in 1996.  The 1996 figure includes the cost of the evaluation of the programme.  A total of £868,320 has issued to date under the programme in respect of support employment grants for ablebodied employees.  A total of 32 applications were received for participation in the programme. Funding for the programme is provided as part of the Department's vote for services for people with disabilities.  All grants and subsidies requested by the agencies participating in the programme have been paid in full.</P>
      <P>Following review of the programme at the end of the three year pilot period, the Government decided, as an interim measure, to continue the payments of subsidies in respect of employees with a disability at their current level for a further year pending the review of sheltered and open employment by the NRB which will be completed later this year.  The pilot employment programme and the whole issue of subsidies in respect of sheltered-open employment, including indexation of subsidies, will be revisited later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  As the Deputy will be aware, the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  The rates are determined by the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of the service.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that my Department has <Col N="1130" /> allocated additional funding to three of the health boards this year, including the Western Health Board, for the purpose of increasing the rates of payment to home helps.  This is the second year running that the Western Health Board has been able to increase the rate of pay to home helps.  It is my intention to make further progress in this regard when resources permit.</P>
      <P>In response to previous questions in the House on this issue I stated that the Department in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards has under active consideration a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.  Following on from these discussions, my Department decided to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  Following receipt of tenders for this review, the contract has been awarded and the work will commence shortly.  It is expected that the review will be completed before the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Acute hospital services for persons diagnosed positive of hepatitis C have been provided since February 1994 in special units in six designated hospitals, Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park and St. James's Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both in-patient and out-patient treatment as required.  Special funding has been and will continue to be provided by the Government for these services.  These secondary care services are public health services.  The VHI provides cover towards the cost of private hospital accommodation and consultant's charges for members who contracted hepatitis C through the receipt within the State of a blood transfusion or blood product.</P>
      <P>The Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, was introduced to provide a statutory basis for the delivery of primary health care services and it came into operation on 23 September 1996.  Persons eligible to receive services under the Act are those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer or a health board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash; anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion.  Eligibiliy is determined on an individual basis without a means test and applies for the lifetime of the eligible person.  Eligible persons are issued with a Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, services card.  Services card holders are entitled to a range of primary care services, including general medical and surgical services from the general practitioner of their choice in respect of all medical conditions, drugs, medicines and medical and surgical applicances free of charge which have been prescribed by a medical practitioner, counselling services, home nursing services, home help services, and access to the existing arrangements covering ophthalmic, dental and aural services.</P>
      <P>At my request, each health board appointed a liaison officer to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act and to serve as a contact point for individuals and with the various interest groups whose members avail of services under the Act.  The liaison officers deal with applications and queries on an ongoing basis and each case is examined individually to ensure that the best service possible is provided to the services card holder.</P>
      <P>All the health care services which I have mentioned were introduced as part of the health care package which I agreed with the four representative groups in December 1995.  The Deputy may also be aware that the consultative council, which I established in November 1996, comprises representatives from the four groups representing hepatitis C sufferers.  One of the functions of the consultative council is to advise and make recommendations to the Minister for Health on all aspects of hepatitis C, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, and in particular on the health and counselling services for persons with hepatitis C, and the changing needs of persons infected with hepatitis C in order to ensure that the health services respond effectively to such changing needs.  The council held its first meeting last week and I am confident that it will be proactive in relation to advising and recommending any health care changes which it considers are necessary in order to deal adequately with the health of hepatitis C sufferers.</P>

      <Quest>the way in which the domiciliary care allowance is applied to parents of children with spina bifida; if the allowance is means tested or is an automatic allowance; the improvements, if any, which will be made by his Department regarding the payment of domiciliary care allowance in this regard.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Domicilary care allowance is paid by health boards in respect of children between the ages of two and 16 years who are so severely physically or mentally disabled that they need care and attention which is considerably in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. Eligibility for the DCA is determined primarily by reference to the level of care and attention which the child requires rather than the type of disability involved.  While the means of the parents are not taken into account, any income the child might have, for example, compensation awards, is assessable.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was published last year, recommends that the administration of DCA should be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  An interdepartmental task force will be submitting a detailed action plan on the implementation of the report to Government by 30 June 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The supply of incontinence wear is a matter for individual health boards.  I understand that boards assess applicants for incontinence wear on an individual basis taking account of their medical requirements and supplies are provided according to need.  Accordingly, there is no specified quantity supplied on the basis of a particular condition.  Having regard to the individual needs of persons for incontinence wear, it would not be appropriate for me to issue directives to the boards in this matter.  However, if the Deputy is aware of a specific case where inadequate incontinence wear is supplied, I will refer the details to the relevant health board for urgent investigation.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The Legal Aid Board does not maintain its records in a manner that would make possible, without the allocation of a disproportionate amount of the board's administrative resources, the provision of information on the number of people from south Tipperary who applied to its law centres for legal aid or advice, or on the number of applicants from that area whose requests for services from the law centres in the years 1992-6 were successful.</P>
    <P>A part-time law centre is operated by the Legal Aid Board in the Citizen's Information Centre at 14 Wellington Street, Clonmel.  This service is provided by a solicitor from the full-time law centre in Nenagh and is available on the first, second and third Monday of every month.  The quality of the service provided by the board is kept under constant review and action is taken, where necessary, to meet particular demand, subject of course to budgetary constraints.  At present, I have no plans to expand Legal Aid Board services in south Tipperary to provide a full-time centre there.</P>

      <P>I advise the Deputy that the waterways service of my Department is aware of the illegal dumping in the area west of Kirkpatrick Bridge.  However, it is my understanding that the land on which the dumping has occurred was sold to private individuals in 1995.  The waterways service only retains a 6.4 metre wide strip of canal bank and therefore cannot be held responsible for the removal of refuse from the area in question.  However, I have instructed the waterways service to contact the owners to see what measures can be taken to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>The scheme of works proposed by Kerry County Council for the graveyard at Old Kilcummin was approved by the national monuments and historic properties service of my Department in March 1996 and the scheme proceeded. No proposals for works were made in respect of the ruins of the old church in the graveyard. There is no preservation order on the site but it is entered on the Register of Historic Monuments the effect of which is to require the owner to give me two months notice of any work affecting the monument.  Also, interference with the monument by any person is prohibited.</P>

      <P>The question of the availability of tax incentives to encourage people involved in fine arts to practice their craft in Ireland is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  No other incentives are available in this area from my Department. However, the Deputy will be aware that an Chomhairle Ealaíon, which is autonomous in the disbursement of the funds available to it, supports many art forms.  Details of this support can be found in the annual report of an Chomhairle which are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>The Limerick main drainage scheme, with an estimated cost of £87 million, is one of the major environmental projects being assisted under the Cohesion Fund.  The recently completed preliminary report for this scheme is currently under examination in my Department.  EU co-financing has been approved for stage one of the scheme, consisting of the planning of the collection system and waste water treatment plant together with the construction of a section of the interceptor <Col N="1148" /> sewers, the prior construction of which is needed to facilitate major road and canal developments locally.</P>
      <P>The planning of the Limerick main drainage scheme is being co-ordinated by Limerick Corporation. The collection system proposed will serve the city and its environs, including areas in County Limerick, namely, Mungret-Gouldavoher and Coonagh-Clonmacken, which had been the subject of earlier proposals from Limerick County Council.</P>

      <P>There are currently 23 remedial teaching posts allocated to primary schools in County Offaly. Seven of these appointments were made during my period as Minister for Education.  It is estimated that 89 per cent of primary school pupils in County Offaly now have access to a remedial service.</P>
      <P>There are no resource teachers in place in schools in County Offaly at present.  The role of the resource teacher is to support ordinary teaching staff in dealing with children with certain disabilities who are attending primary schools on an integrated basis.  Resource teacher posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department's Inspectorate following the collection and analysis of data from schools.  Such allocations are also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>

I am aware of the condition of the prefab classroom at the school referred to by the Deputy, I included a project for the extension and refurbishment of this school in my Department's capital programme.  All of the planning work is now complete and the project is ready for tender.</P>
      <P>At present, I am dealing with a significant backlog of projects arising out of the massive cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988 period and, due to budgetary constraints, it is not possible for me to release all deserving projects to tender and contract together.  I hope to release a number of projects to tender and contract on a phased basis later this year and the school will receive every consideration at the time.</P>

      <P>I understand from Cork County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that an application was received from one of the students concerned for the 1994-95 academic year, however the candidate's reckonable income exceeded the limit set down in the 1994 higher education grants scheme.  Cork County Council has advised my Department that it has not received applications from the other students referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 157, 158 and 181 together.  I am aware of the case made by the schools in question for a remedial teacher service. Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools <Col N="1157" /> on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year. I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.  In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls on a phased basis as resources permit to all schools which do not already have them.  The question of providing physical education facilities at the school in question can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to say when physical education facilities will be provided in this particular <Col N="1158" /> case.  However, should financial circumstances permit, the school will be given every consideration.</P>

As I previously advised the Deputy, I am not in a position at present to indicate whether additional remedial teachers will be made available to any primary school, including those schools in County Donegal, for the 1997-98 academic year.  My capacity to allocate additional remedial teacher posts in any year is determined by resource availability in that year and the level of competing demand from other special needs areas.

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 169 and 196 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to provide a resource teacher to the schools in question.

      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.

The study noted that the current coverage of the scheme is already in excess of 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of this study, I recently launched the Breaking the Cycle initiative in an effort to target resources on selected urban and rural schools which had been identified as being particularly disadvantaged.  A total of 33 urban schools and 123 rural schools have been selected by the education research centre to take part in this initiative.  Each of these schools is receiving a special package of supports to help them in combating educational disadvantage in their area. Each participating school is preparing a five year development plan aimed at addressing their current problems.  The operation and effectiveness of this initiative will be closely monitored over the plan period and the outcome will inform future developments in support for disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event of any further expansion of disadvantaged area supports being undertaken, the <Col N="1162" /> needs of the schools in question will be given every consideration.</P>

      <P>Discussions with the Teacher's Union of Ireland on matters relating to staff in the Youthreach centres are ongoing.  Arrangements have been finalised with the Teachers' Union of Ireland in relation to a framework within which it is expected that negotiations will be concluded. This framework involves facilitation and arbitration under the terms of the Government/ICTU PCW statement of 15 May 1996 which was offered to the union in November, 1996.  Following clarification of certain issues in this regard, the revised terms of reference for the facilitation and arbitration process have been agreed with the union.  In effect, my Department has confirmed to the Teachers' Union of Ireland that it is prepared to enter further negotiations with the aid of a facilitator, if necessary, in an attempt to reach agreement on as many issues as possible.  My Department is also prepared to refer any outstanding issues for adjudication to the Public Service Arbitration Board operating on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
      <P>As I have already stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 48, 76 and 168 on 26 February 1997, my Department is fully committed to reaching an amicable solution to the issues involved in this matter and thereby recognises the contribution which the Youthreach instruction staff make to enabling the educationally disadvantaged participants in the programme to enhance their prospects in the labour market.</P>

      <P>My Department has continuing contact with the INTO in relation to a wide range of issues relating to primary education, including the matters to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Education I have introduced a number of measures to address the problems of difficult or diruptive children.  In 1995, I introduced a pilot teacher counsellor scheme with the specific aim of addressing those problems.  A total of 27 teacher counsellors have been allocated to selected schools in the north inner city and Clondalkin areas of Dublin.  The scheme will be extended in accordance with available resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a pilot psychological service for primary schools was introduced in 1990.  I extended the service and established it on a permanent basis in 1994.  The focus of the service is on conducting assessments on pupils whose difficulties are preceived to be acute.  There are now <Col N="1166" /> 14 psychologists serving primary schools in disadvantaged areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. One of these psychologists is assigned to work with the school to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>In cases of serious disruptive behaviour, the needs of the child may be such as to warrant placement in one of a range of special schools or classes for children with emotional disbturbance.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case made by the school to which the Deputy refers.  I can assure the Deputy that the needs of this school will be fully considered when I am next in a position to allocate additional resources to special needs children in the primary sector.</P>

      <P>My Department's policy in terms of identifying children with specific learning disability, dyslexia, is in line with the recommendations of the Special Education Review Committee report.  Under the recommended criteria it is expected that not more than 2 per cent of the overall pupil population would be found to be in this category.</P>
      <P>Estimates of numbers of children with specific learning disability have been put forward by many groups, however, in keeping with the Special Education Review Committee definitions and recommendations my Department will continue to focus assistance on the bottom 1.5 to 2 per cent of the population.</P>
      <P>The educational needs of pupils with specific learning disabilities are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher and, in the case of post-primary pupils, guidance counsellors and subject teachers.  When more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>In the current school year I have established a special support unit for children with specific learning disability in a primary school in north County Dublin.  The question of establishing a second such unit in this school is currently under consideration in my Department.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.</P>
      <P>My intention for the present is to continue to concentrate available resources on the development of school based strategies for children with specific learning disability.  However, I have recently allocated funding as a contribution towards costs incurred by a centre providing tuition for children with specific learning disability. My officials have recently met with representatives of the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities and I am currently considering a proposal to provide assistance towards its service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education sets out a range of measures aimed at ensuring early detection and intervention where children with special educational needs are concerned.  The fundamental objective is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that children with disabilities will have access to suitable resourced education services in their own area.  To this end, the White Paper provides for a continuum of provision ranging from specialised back-up services for children attending ordinary schools, to the provision of <Col N="1168" /> special facilities dedicated to children with more serious needs.</P>
    <P>The needs of children with specific learning disability will be addressed within the comprehensive range of measures set out in the White Paper.</P>

    <P>The reason approval has not been given to date is that I am dealing with a significant backlog of projects arising out of the massive cuts in the capital funding of primary schools in the 1988-92 period and, due to budgetary constraints, it is not possible for me to release all deserving projects to tender and contract together.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department have been in contact with Limerick County Council and I understand that there has been a change in the family income which entitles the student in question to part maintenance at the non-adjacent rate in respect of the 1996-7 academic year.  As the student in question is currently repeating second year of his course, and already received two instalments of maintenance during the 1995-6 academic year, he is only entitled to receive the third instalment of part maintenance at the non-adjacent rate for the 1996-7 academic year.</P>

      <Quest>her views on the position with regard to female gardaí who joined the force prior to 1983 and were placed on a 25 year pension scheme as distinct from their male colleagues of that era who were on a 30 year pension scheme, resulting in the female members contributing at a higher rate to the pension scheme; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that in 1983, such female gardaí were apparently offered an option which they did not understand which leaves them continuing to contribute at the higher rate but unable to retire until minimum age 50, thus leaving a person who entered in 1979 at the age of 20 having to contribute for 30 years to the age of 50, resulting in the situation where these female gardaí are paying at the rate of 2.5 per cent over 30 years while their male colleagues are paying at 1.75 per cent, also over 30 years; if she will address the inequality of this situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Prior to 14 June 1983, female members of the Garda Síochána were entitled to retire on full pension at age 50 provided they had approved service of 25 years.  Male members were entitled to retire on full pension at the age of 50 provided they had approved service of 30 years.  In the case of female members the superannuation contribution rate was 2.5 per cent of pensionable remuneration while the corresponding contribution rate in the case of male members was 1.75 per cent.</P>
      <P>As a result of an agreement reached at the Garda Conciliation Council in 1983 it was decided that all members of the force, both male and female, would in future, be conditioned to a minimum of 30 years service with a corresponding pension contribution rate of 1.75 per cent. The agreement also provided that all members, both male and female, who were serving on 14 June 1983 would be given the option of paying the 2.5 per cent or 1.75 per cent pension contribution rate and would be, accordingly, conditioned to serve for a minimum 25 or 30 years as appropriate.</P>
      <P>The option to pay the 2.5 per cent pension rate with the corresponding possibility of retiring on full pension at the age of 50, having served less than 30 years, applied to both male and female members of the force and both male and female members availed of it.  In the event a number of such members, both male and female, choose to remain on in the force after serving 25 years and after reaching the age of 50.  It cannot be accepted, however, that the exercise of that choice is, in any sense, proof that the option was not understood when it was exercised in 1983.  It is more likely to simply reflect a change in a member's career choice in the intervening years.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that special consideration should be given to a very small number of members, both male and female, who were under the age of 20 when they exercised the option in 1983 of paying a 2.5 per cent pension contribution rate.  Since they had to serve to age 50 anyway they obviously could not normally benefit from the option of retiring with less than 30 years service. The position of these members is currently under discussion at the Garda Conciliation Council. Since the proceedings of the council, under the terms of the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme, are confidential it would not be appropriate to comment further on those cases at this time.</P>

      <Col N="1180" /> As the Deputy is aware, under the terms of the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, the two states involved in processing a transfer request are required to exchange information about the sentenced person. This information includes a copy of the judgment and the law on which it is based, sentence administration particulars and medical/ social reports.  These must be obtained from a number of different sources.  Owing to the complexity of the documentation required and the fact that each case is considered on its individual and particular merits, the processing of some cases can take some considerable time.  The length of time is also influenced by the complex but necessary procedures and requirements that have their roots in the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons itself and, to an extent in our legislation.</P>

      <P>The primary objective of the back-to-work allowance is to allow people who have been long-term unemployed to test employment or self-employment options and regain a foothold in the labour market while retaining some financial security for a three year period.</P>
      <P>Employers are encouraged to participate in the scheme by offering jobs to persons who have been long-term unemployed.  There are three conditions attached to use of the scheme by employers as follows: 1. the jobs must be new or additional and must not displace existing jobs; 2. the jobs must have the potential to become long-term &mdash; temporary and short-term jobs are not eligible &mdash; and 3. the numbers of hours worked in a week must exceed 20.</P>
      <P>Employers who take on persons in receipt of the allowance are required to certify that the job is a new or additional one and will result in a net increase in the level of employment.  The primary purpose of this requirement is to ensure that displacement levels in the scheme remain at an acceptable level.</P>
      <P>Employers who recruit persons entitled to support under the scheme also qualify automatically for PRSI exemption.  Under this scheme an employer is exempt from paying his share of the PRSI contribution for two full years.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement &mdash; FIS &mdash; scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>The part-time job opportunities programme &mdash; PTJOP &mdash; which is being piloted for a three-year period, is aimed at creating part-time employment opportunities for unemployed people in the voluntary, community and statutory sectors.  Participants in this programme are paid at the same level as community employment &mdash; CE &mdash; participants.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated to the House on many occasions, I do not consider that FIS is an appropriate mechanism for improving the income position of workers participating in either the PTJOP or CE scheme.  As a general principle, we should avoid having one Government Department subsidising payments being made by another.  The question of the level of allowances paid under the PTJOP is a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I have no plans to review the criteria of entitlement to FIS to include PTJOP participants.</P>
      <P>In the context of reducing disincentives to work, my priority is to utilise FIS as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  As a first step, this year's Social Welfare Bill provides that FIS will be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions and levies payable, with effect from June.  Pension contributions will also be deductible.  In addition, I have provided for an increase in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS by £10 at each point.  This will mean that virtually all current FIS recipients will be better off by at least £6 a week.</P>

      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy for rent and mortgage interest supplements for 1996 are currently available only up to the end of November, but it is expected that the full expenditure figures for 1996 should be available in April 1997. I will provide the Deputy with these figures as soon as they become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The details on expenditure for rent and mortgage <Col N="1183" /> interest supplements for the months January to November 1996 are set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government commitment to openness and transparency, there is a commitment on the part of the Department of Social Welfare to publish all the guidance given by the Department on the supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; scheme to health boards which administer the scheme.</P>
    <P>The first step of this task was completed on 19 October 1995 when the guidelines on exceptional needs payments were made public for the first time ever.</P>
    <P>In the course of the preparation for publication of the guidance on rent and mortgage supplements, it was considered appropriate to give a legislative basis to this guidance, where it was possible to do so.  This has been done through two new Statutory Instruments Nos. 381 and 382 of 1995, copies of which can be made available to the Deputy on request.</P>
    <P>Those aspects of the guidance on rent and mortgage supplements which did not lend themselves <Col N="1184" /> to incorporation in a statutory instrument will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The current guidance on rent and mortgage supplements is therefore contained in the new Statutory Instrument No. 382 of 1995 and the explanatory documentation which was sent to the health boards with the Statutory Instrument.  The current guidance builds on the previous guidance which was drawn up in 1988 and incorporates some of the good administratve practices which have been developed within health boards since then.</P>
    <P>The main change from the 1988 guidance is that some direction which was formerly contained in administrative internal circulars is now covered by a statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>An information leaflet on the SWA scheme, SW54, was published in November 1996, which includes information on rent and mortgage interest supplements.  A contact address and telephone number is provided in the leaflet for anybody requiring additional information.  The leaflet is available at any Social Welfare local office and also at local health centres.</P>
    <P>In addition, information relating to the scheme is available on the Internet at www.welfare. ie and also on Aertel.</P>

      <Quest>if he will examine the matter of the computerisation of payments from his Department through the community welfare officers in respect of assistance towards pre-school play groups' attendance; if individual cheques for each pupil must be given in view of the fact that the financial charges amount to 17p per child per week which has the potential to affect the viability of some groups over a period of time.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where there are social problems and it is beneficial to a family to have a child placed in a crèche for short periods an SWA supplement ranging from £8 to £10 per child per week may be paid in respect of children attending playgroups.</P>
      <P>Up to mid last year the processing and payment of supplementary welfare allowance claims, including various supplements, was a normal process. The Department has introduced a new integrated computer system for short-term payment schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance. SWA claims are being computerised on a phased basis and it is planned to complete this by mid-1998.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new system has brought a range of benefits for the customers, the health boards and the Department.</P>
      <P>In the case of SWA, the system replaces the manual system which involved keeping manual records of the claims made, hand-writing of cheques and the manual preparation of accounts. The system provides for a computerised record of the claim, and payments and accounts are produced automatically by the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new system provides a higher level of control and improved audit trail over SWA payments which was not previously possible.  By using the RSI number as the key identifier for SWA claims <Col N="1185" /> it is possible to cross-check these claims with other short-term payment schemes to avoid duplication of payments.</P>
    <P>The new system affords a level of flexibility in the method and frequency of payments.  Payments can be made by cheque, at post offices or by electronic fund transfer to a bank or building society.  SWA payments for supplements, such as créche or rent and mortgage interest payments, can be made at weekly or monthly intervals to suit the customer's needs.</P>
    <P>Payments are issued to the individual customer. The customer may arrange for his-her payment to be made to an agent or a nominated person. While a person may act as an agent or nominee for a number of customers, it is not possible to combine the payments of a number of customers into a single payment.  Payments are normally made weekly but arrangements can be made to make crèche supplement payments at monthly intervals, which would help reduce the bank costs.  Ultimately bank charges on their accounts are a matter for the créches.</P>

      <Quest>whether all people over the age of 75 will receive free electricity as seemed to be indicated in the 1997 budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The effect of the improvement in the free electricity allowance scheme which I announced in this year's budget is to ensure that all applicants aged over 75 are treated in precisely the same way in so far as eligibility for the allowance is concerned.  It does not, however, extend eligibility for the allowance to all people aged over 75.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the allowance, applicants must normally be in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment or, in the case of persons aged over 66 who are not in receipt of such a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test; be a registered consumer of electricity on the normal ESB supply; and be living alone or only with certain excepted persons.</P>
      <P>Certain concessions have been introduced in recent years for people aged over 75 in regard to the household composition rule.  People over that age who are already in receipt of the allowance may retain it regardless of who resides with them. People over age 75, who previously held the allowance, can requalify for it regardless of who is residing with them.  These concessions did not cover the position of new applicants aged 75 or over, who were obliged to satisfy the standard and more rigorous household composition rule in order to qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure I announced in the budget is designed to rectify that situation.  From next June, new applicants for the allowance who are aged over 75, and who otherwise satisfy the qualifying <Col N="1186" /> conditions of the scheme, will now also be enabled to qualify for the free electricity allowance regardless of their household composition. Also a similar concession is being introduced to the free telephone rental allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Statutory Instrument No. 389 of 1996, entitled Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) (Amendment) Regulations, 1996, which were signed into law on 13 December 1996 by the Minister for Labour Affairs.</P>
      <P>The reason for the making of these Regulations was Council Directive 94/55/EC which applied the terms of the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road, generally known as the ADR, to national transport with effect from 1 January 1997.  The Directive permitted member states to authorise the continued use of vehicles constructed before 31 December 1996, which did not comply with the standards of the ADR provided that they complied with national requirements. Regulation 4 of S.I. No. 389 of 1996, which transposed this provision in the Directive, provided that the current version of the ADR would not apply to vehicles registered before 1 January 1997 provided such vehicles comply with an earlier (1985) version of the ADR.  The 1985 version of the ADR did not require vehicles to have ABS brakes whereas the current version does.  Vehicles registered after 1 January 1997 which are intended to carry dangerous goods must comply with the current version of the ADR and, accordingly, must have ABS brakes.  The Regulations apply to all such vehicles whether new or second hand and whether imported or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 27 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 one of the duties of the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health is to submit proposals for legislation. When it is considering proposals for legislation, the Authority engages in an elaborate process of consultation.  The proposal which resulted in S.I. No. 389 of 1996 was considered by the dangerous substances advisory committee of the authority which comprise representatives of employers and employees as well as academics and representatives of industry and the relevant Government Departments.  The regulations were then considered by a sub-committee of the board of the authority.  When the regulations were drafted, I had notices placed in all the national newspapers <Col N="1187" /> on 22 November 1996, giving interested parties 21 days to make representations on the regulations. No representations were received and the regulations were signed into law on 13 December 1996.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that an extensive consultation process was undertaken.  However, notwithstanding that process, a number of representations have been made to me since the regulations were made expressing concerns regarding the consequences of the implementation of S.I. No. 389 of 1996.  I am having these examined in my Department and I am consulting with the authority with a view to devising means by which any difficulties which might arise can be overcome.</P>

      <P>The job training scheme is a workbased training programme provided by employers in co-operation with FÁS.  This training approach links the world of work and training in a practical way and aims to use the training capacity and expertise within the workplace to train potential employees.  The benefits to the employer are a trained potential workforce and improved company performance.</P>
      <P>The programme is aimed at unemployed persons aged 16 years or over and provides full-time training for between 13 and 52 weeks, depending on the training requirement in each case.  To qualify for the scheme, a person must be unemployed and signing on the live register for at least eight weeks immediately preceeding the date of their recruitment.  Persons completing a FÁS, CERT Teagasc or other approved State-sponsord scheme are also eligible, where this involves a progression, as are individuals registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.  Trainees receive a weekly training allowance from the employer. A contribution of 75 per cent of FÁS-approved training allowance rates is made by FÁS to the training allowance paid by the employer.</P>
      <P>The issue raised in the Deputy's question concerning re-entry to the scheme is one of progression. As such, each case would have to be considered on its individual merits by FÁS at local level.  All such cases would be given every consideration, taking into account the demand for available places, particularly from people who had not availed of any previous opportunity.  At the end of January 1997, there were 2,425 people participating on the scheme.</P>

The allocation and extinguishment of turbary rights by the Land Commission are matters reserved by law to the commissioners and as such I have no direct involvement.</P>
      <P>I understand from inquiries made at the Central Bank that the individual concerned was forwarded a redemption request form in 1989 when the decision to redeem all land bonds was taken. This form was signed by the bond holder and returned to the Central Bank together with the stock certificate.  The individual's bonds were then redeemed for cash.</P>

      <P>It is a requirement of Regulation 2079/92, under which the scheme of early retirement from farming is implemented, that the applicants have practised farming as a main occupation for the proceeding ten years.  To meet this criterion at least 50 per cent of income and working time must be attributable to farming.  With nearly 6,000 farmers in the scheme, well ahead of the anticipated uptake, it is clear that the full-time farming requirement has not had any adverse effect on participation.</P>

      <P>My ministerial responsibility extends to the possible cruelty aspects of this issue.  The Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, are the principal statutes governing the welfare of animals.  This legislation is enforced by the Garda and provides for fines and-or imprisonment for those convicted of offences and cruelty.  As a result of a major recasting by section 48 of the Control of Houses Act, 1996, the penalties under the 1911 Act have recently been increased to a fine of up to £1,500 and-or six months imprisonment on summary conviction, and a fine of up to £10,000 and-or two years imprisonment on conviction on indictment.  These significantly tougher measures will act as a greater deterrent against acts of cruelty to all animals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 258 and 259 together.</P>
      <P>The Government programme, while it seeks to allow competition in television retransmission, makes this contingent on the application of good frequency management principles, our international obligations and on the outcome of the south Coast Community Television legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>The House will know that as a result of the court judgment in that case I am now reconsidering an application from South Coast Community Television.  In the course of my deliberations on the matter I will examine and take account of any implications which may arise in respect of other deflector systems.  I am not in a position to say when I will reach a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my reply to similar questions put <Col N="1195" /> down by the Deputy on 14 November 1996, I have received applications on behalf of Comhlacht Phobal Teilifise Thir Chonaill Teo and Ardara Community Television Limited.  I pointed out on that occasion that it is not proposed to issue any new licences for television retransmission systems pending a final decision on the licence application from South Coast Community Television.  The two companies concerned have been informed of the situation.</P>

      <P>The board of Telecome Éireann are committed to achieving reductions in staffing levels on the basis of agreement and staff who avail of the schemes currently on offer will do so on a voluntary basis as they have done since 1984.

      <P>The criteria, including the service requirements, governing the promotion of officers of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, are laid down in Defence Force Regulations and in Instructions issued by the Adjutant-General.  Records show that since 1987 no officer of An Fórsa was promoted to the rank of captain without meeting the service requirement of five years' service in the rank of lieutenant and that all officers so promoted had at least nine years' commissioned service.</P>

      <P>The General List is a military administrative device which is used only in exceptional circumstances.  At present three officers of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, Eastern Command are posted to the General List.  The reasons for such postings are the temporary residence outside the State of a member, no suitable vacancy in a particular unit and on the basis of a recommendation of the general officer Commanding.  The posting of these officers to the General List permitted the promotion of one officer and the appointment to commissioned rank of two members.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a widow (details supplied) in County Cork of a retired civilian employee of his Department has been refused payment of her late husband's civilian pension.</Quest>

      <P>In the case under reference, the widow concerned was not refused a pension.  She was informed at the end of February that she would be entitled to a widow's pension with effect from 15 August 1998.  The reasons for deferral to that date were also explained.</P>
      <P>The background to the situation is as follows. The civilian employee referred to retired in November 1983.  He died in February 1997.  Upon the introduction of a voluntary widows' contributory pension scheme in 1979, the civilian employee had exercised his right to opt out of that scheme.</P>
      <P>Under arrangements relating to the introduction of a revised compulsory spouses' contributory pension scheme in 1986, certain provisions were made for those who had opted out of the 1979 voluntary scheme, but who had retired before the introduction of the revised compulsory scheme in 1986.  Under these arrangements, the former civilian employee, while on pension, could have opted to pay contributions under the 1986 scheme from his pension, and thus to secure coverage for his spouse under the 1986 scheme, in the event of his death.  He did not so opt.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, a widow of a civilian employee, who had retired before the introduction of the revised compulsory scheme in 1986, may accrue an entitlement to a pension over a period subsequent to the death of her husband, this period of deferral acting in lieu of notional contributions to the scheme.</P>
      <P>I might point out that the usual Department of Social Welfare entitlements should also be available to the person in question.</P>
