      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of urgency in light of the serious problems being caused in the Dublin area of which, I am sure, the Taoiseach is aware.  A proposal has been with the Minister for Health for a number of months and I ask that the matter be given urgent consideration and that the necessary regulations be introduced within weeks.

      <P>Has the Taoiseach any intention of introducing legislation to amend the Companies Acts regarding donations to political parties in view of the revelations made during the year and the major private contributions which have been made to the three conservative parties in the House?  Has he any intention to amend the legislation so the public will know the type of funding Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats received during the last election?

    <P>(a) if at any time, it appears to the Ceann Comhairle that, in the case of a group within the meaning of paragraph (1)(b), the membership of the group has fallen below seven members or a majority specified therein, he or she shall write to each member of the group seeking confirmation of their continued membership of the group.  Unless at least seven members forming the said majority confirm their membership in writing within two weeks of the date of issue of the Ceann Comhairle's letter, the group shall cease to be a group within the meaning of paragraph (1)(b); or</P>

    <P>Provided that nothing in this paragraph shall prejudice the right of Members to seek formal recognition as a group under paragraph (1)(b).</P>
    <P>(4) Each group shall have the right to nominate a private member of the group <Col N="495" /> to present a Bill provided that there is not before the Dáil another Bill presented by a Member nominated by the group.</P>

    <Title>Report on National Lottery: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the comprehensive report produced earlier this year by the Review Group on the National Lottery.  This is an opportunity for Deputies to express views on the recommendations of the report and on any other matter relative to the national lottery before final decisions are taken.</P>
      <P>I will set out the background to the setting up of the group and outline its main findings.  I will give further information about the fund set up to aid private charitable lotteries in direct competition with the national lottery for which a sum of £5 million was voted by means of Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Finance last July. I will deal with future developments in the market in which the national lottery is operating and which is changing fast.  I will also refer to the sales of UK lottery tickets here about which there has been recent media publicity.</P>
      <P>The national lottery recently celebrated ten years of successful operation.  The lottery has already contributed more than £700 million for activities such as youth and sport and arts and culture and has supported initiatives in favour of the health and welfare of the community.  But for the success with which the national lottery has been operated, much of this funding would not have been possible.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the great success of the lottery in providing funding for the qualifying categories has been a cause of controversy from time to time.  Not surprisingly, demands for lottery funding consistently exceed the available resources and there are inevitably disappointed applicants, notwithstanding that the disbursement of lottery grants is subject to similar controls as apply to public funding generally.  Nonetheless, it is vital that the lottery's players and the public generally should have confidence in the methods by which allocations are decided and that there should be maximum transparency.  Public trust and confidence are of paramount importance to the operation of a national lottery.  Concerns such as these were central to the deliberations of the review group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The review group was appointed by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Quinn, in December 1996.  There were three independent members: the chairman, Mr Niall Greene; Mr Richard Burrows, Irish Distillers; and Dr. Kathleen Lynch, UCD.  The group also contained representatives of the Departments of Finance, Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Education, the Environment, Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity on behalf of the Minister for Finance and myself to thank the chairman and the other members of the group for all the work they did to produce a thorough and wide-ranging report which dealt fully with all the issues submitted to them.  It is clear that the group worked painstakingly and considered all the possible options in relation to the terms of reference. All future reviews of the lottery will, I believe, refer to this report as a repository of very useful information on the development of the lottery.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group primarily required it to look closely at the impact of spending financed from the surplus of the national lottery with particular attention to the allocation of funds administered by Departments under discretionary schemes involving financial support for voluntary agencies such as sporting and community bodies.  The group was also asked to review the arrangements and procedures for processing applications for national lottery funding and make recommendations for maximum transparency in the allocation of lottery resources. Submissions were invited from individuals and interested parties by way of public advertisement. Approximately 130 submissions were made to the group from a wide range of interests throughout the community.  All submissions were considered by the group.  In carrying out its task, the group reviewed the development of the national lottery since its establishment in 1987 and took account of previous reports and research into the lottery. This was with a view to enhancing public understanding of the contribution of the lottery to the community and, if possible, improving the responsiveness of lottery funding to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986, lottery funding may be provided for the following purposes: sport and other recreation; national culture &mdash; including the Irish language; the arts and the health of the community.  Further categories were later approved by Government when sales greatly exceeded initial expectations.  These categories are: youth; welfare; national heritage and amenities. Lottery funding was also provided on a once-off basis for the Dublin Millennium in 1988 and EXPO '92.  As Deputies will appreciate, the benefits of lottery funding have been apparent in every area of the country and have been made available to a large number of voluntary and community groups.</P>
    <P>Before I discuss the group's findings in greater detail, it is worth noting that, while it made suggestions for improved administration of lottery funding, the group considered that decisions <Col N="498" /> on lottery allocations should remain the responsibility of the Government rather than, for example, being given to an independent body.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation of the group is that, in future, the allocation of lottery resources should be directed entirely to the support of voluntary and community activity.  This would be intended to bring about a much closer association, than has been the case heretofore, of lottery support with a wide range of services and activities at the heart of the community.  In this way, the benefits of spending on the lottery &mdash; approximately 33p of every one pound spent on a lottery ticket goes to good causes &mdash; could be more clearly demonstrated than under the present arrangements.  The recommendation entails a realignment of lottery funded expenditure involving, on one hand, the transfer to lottery funding of some support for voluntary and community bodies currently provided by the Exchequer and, on the other, the transfer to the Exchequer of support for statutory bodies now funded from the lottery.  The group was satisfied that the initial impact of these changes would not involve any extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This greater emphasis on voluntary and community groups is one that I welcome.  Many of those involved in voluntary and community projects aided by the lottery in the past have found that the assistance provided was the catalyst to enable some very important progress to be made in the provision of facilities or otherwise.  While not wishing to prejudge the outcome of the consideration of the report, the greater direction of lottery funds towards the voluntary and community sector can only help to enhance the image of the national lottery.  For many years, while in Opposition, I argued strongly for this and I welcome the recommendations in the review.</P>
    <P>Taken with other recommendations of the group for improved administration of lottery grants which I shall outline later, the group considered that such changes would contribute to a clearer picture of the uses to which lottery funding is put.  In publishing the report in June 1997, the previous Minister also envisaged that publication would provide an opportunity for consultation between the relevant Departments and the voluntary and community agencies concerned.</P>
    <P>I heartily encourage the Departments and public bodies concerned as well as the beneficiaries of lottery funding to look closely at the review group report.  As I indicated earlier, the Government has not taken any final decisions in relation to the group's recommendations.  One issue which the review group decided to investigate was the controversial one of how much lottery spending could be considered as substituting for Government spending and how much was additional.</P>
    <P>While the earlier intention had been that all spending should be additional, it was decided in the late 1980s, at a time of retrenchment in public spending and particularly as the lottery had generated far more resources for the Exchequer than originally anticipated, that lottery funding should <Col N="499" /> be made available to mainline expenditure programmes, especially in the health sector, which would otherwise have been curtailed or even terminated.</P>
    <P>The review group commissioned independent research from Mr. Terry Baker of the ESRI which found that it would be reasonable to regard 50 per cent of lottery funded expenditure as additional spending.  This is very much higher than figures that have sometimes been put forward. It also means, when account is taken of how lottery sales exceeded original expectations, that notwithstanding the substitution, the total amount of additional spending generated by the lottery was much greater than expected when it was set up.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has become a part of everyday life in Ireland.  It contributes approximately £100 million per annum to good causes.</P>
    <P>The National Lottery Act, 1986, specifies that the Government decides the amounts to be spent from the beneficiary fund in each of the designated categories.  The proposed expenditure is shown by Vote and subhead each year in the Estimates for public services for the various Departments concerned.  If an activity is financed under the same Vote both from the lottery and from general Exchequer revenue, there are two separate subheads in the relevant Vote to make this clear.</P>
    <P>Lottery funded expenditure is subject to the same public financial discipline and procedures as Government spending generally.  In practice, the Government considers provisions for lottery funded spending during the annual Estimates process in exactly the same way as it considers the Exchequer funded expenditure.  It is a matter for the Government to adjudicate on the spending proposals of those Departments which have operational responsibility for lottery funded grants and schemes.</P>
    <P>This process helps to ensure that allocations of lottery resources reflect actual needs and priorities. It is then largely a matter for the spending Departments themselves to allocate the funds, within the approved subhead provision, among individual projects or schemes.  There is full accountability to the Dáil and, especially, to the Public Accounts Committee for this spending.</P>
    <P>It might be helpful if I briefly set out spending under the main national lottery categories which shows how much the lottery has contributed since its establishment.  The figures relate to the period up to the end of 1996: health of the community and welfare £241 million; youth, sports, recreation and amenities £233 million; arts, culture and national heritage £171 million and the Irish language £52 million. These large sums have benefited every region.</P>
    <P>In its consideration of the arrangements for the disbursement of lottery funds, the review group was mindful in particular of the recommendations made by the Committee of Public Accounts in</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> 1994.  These were aimed at ensuring as far as possible that there were standard application forms, clear criteria for making grants and adequate procedures for follow-up to ensure that the funds were spent as intended.</P>
    <P>The detailed recommendations included the following.  There should be a standard application form for lottery grants which, apart from the normal details, would, as a minimum, set out the purpose for which the grant is being sought, the number of people who benefit from the work of the organisation seeking the grant and the sources of the organisation's funding, separately identifying sources of State funding to prevent possible overlap or duplication.  There should be a structured process to ensure objectivity in the evaluation of competing applications for funding by reference to agreed predetermined criteria.  The recommendations of the line section in the Department should clearly show the justification for the grant and its amount.  In the light of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department of Finance issued in October 1994 comprehensive revised guidelines to Departments covering all aspects of administration of national lottery grants.</P>
    <P>There has been a sustained effort by the Government to ensure there is full public confidence in the arrangements for disbursing lottery funds.  As the Department which co-ordinates financial policy and under the aegis of which the National Lottery Act, 1986, operates, the Department of Finance has set out procedures for Departments which should be followed in approving funding for lottery assisted projects to ensure best practice.  These aim to ensure that clear criteria apply for each discretionary scheme, that all interested persons will have due opportunity to apply for the funding available and that all applications are treated on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>I wish to return briefly to the review group's consideration of the question of having an independent body set up to decide lottery allocations. It has been suggested by a number of commentators that decision making for lottery surplus distribution should be devolved to an independent board or boards.  Such a framework is operated, for example, in the case of the UK lottery.  The view has been put that such an arrangement would facilitate the achievement of openness and transparency in lottery funding to which the review group was asked to address itself.  The possibility of establishing an independent board was also mentioned in a number of the submissions made to the review group in response to its public advertisement.</P>
    <P>The main case made in favour of an independent board is that it would remove the scope for political influence in the making of grant allocations. It has also been suggested that such a body would have a stand-alone identity which would facilitate public access to lottery funding and that it would generally be more open, more representative and fairer than the existing system. It is also argued that an independent body would <Col N="501" /> display a more imaginative approach to lottery allocation.  The review group acknowledged that the claimed advantages of an independent board have merit.  However, the group was mindful of other considerations.  In the sectors towards which lottery funding is directed, the State has a considerable involvement and infrastructure already in place.  The Arts Council, Bord na Gaeilge and other such bodies or agencies, with the Departments which sponsor them, are channels through which lottery funding can be efficiently routed.</P>
    <P>Moreover, many projects in the voluntary and community sector are both Exchequer and lottery funded.  It did not appear to the group that the addition of a lottery surplus distribution board into this mix would achieve more than would reforming the procedures in line with the other recommendations in the report.  It could lead to considerable incoherence in both policy making and implementation in the community and voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>The group also felt there was no reason to believe an independent board would be better placed to adjudicate on competing demands, given that the demands generally exceed available resources.  Any new board would inevitably represent a range of interests of one type or another.  The one certainty is that it would raise the costs of distribution given that the current distribution system is without any charge on the lottery proceeds.  The group also concluded that the current arrangements whereby Ministers are accountable to Dáil Éireann for lottery spending should be maintained.  A new independent board would not be accountable to the electorate in the same direct way.</P>
    <P>The sheer size of the annual surplus available for distribution from the lottery &mdash; approximately £100 million &mdash; means that issues of priority and of consistency with public expenditure generally must be reflected in decisions on lottery allocations.</P>
    <P>I will summarise for Deputies the principal recommendations of the Review Group.  The allocation of national lottery funds should continue to be made by the Government rather than by an independent body.  The subsequent disbursement of lottery funds should be made in partnership with the voluntary and community sector.</P>
    <P>The surplus revenues of the national lottery, other than those in the reserve fund, should, in future, be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activity in the areas of youth services, sports, the arts, the Irish language, welfare, health, social services and community development.  The transition would initially be carried out on the basis of no net extra cost being borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The needs of the most disadvantaged groups within the voluntary and community sector should be prioritised in the allocation of lottery funds within individual programmes and due regard should be had to gender and regional balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> Application procedures for support from programmes funded by the beneficiary fund should be standardised and means of access to them made more publicly visible.  The Government should, from time to time, publish more details of how the funding is distributed over various sectors. Decision making on applications should reflect a commitment to the principle of partnership with the client base.</P>
    <P>The National Lottery Act 1986 should be amended to provide for the procedures which must be followed when national lottery funds are being allocated.  A process should be put in place to enable the Government to identify, from time to time, suitable major projects with an enduring impact which could be provided for from lottery resources.</P>
    <P>A national lottery beneficiary and monitoring committee should be established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations made in the report and to maintain a continuous oversight of the disbursement of the beneficiary fund.</P>
    <P>On the charitable lotteries fund to which I referred earlier, although it did not arise directly from the work of the review group, I am particularly pleased to be able to announce the arrangements for the operation of the £5 million charitable lotteries fund.  In July 1997, the Minister for Finance moved a supplementary estimate of £5 million on the vote for finance which was approved by the Dáil.  This is to provide an annual amount for a three year period from national lottery resources to supplement the income of the promoters of private charitable lotteries whose lottery products are competing directly with similar national lottery products.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the provision of this funding is in response to the difficulties expressed for some time by private charitable lotteries in operating within the constraints of gaming and lotteries legislation.  It has long been contended by the charitable lotteries that, because of the prize restrictions which apply under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956, they are not in a position to market lottery products alongside the national lottery.  This fund will enable a measure of support from lottery resources to be targeted at the charitable lotteries.  I am happy to announce that applications for the fund are now being invited by my Department by way of advertisement in national newspapers.  These advertisements appeared in the newspapers yesterday, Wednesday, 8 October.</P>
    <P>I would like to make clear, however, that this is a very focused initiative which is intended to address the circumstances of those private lotteries which have products in the marketplace in direct competition with the national lottery.  It was never intended that this fund would be a vehicle for supporting charitable fundraising generally. Such a measure would require funding greatly in excess of what is being provided.</P>
    <P>I will outline some of the main aspects of the scheme, full details of which are now being made available to interested parties.  Applications are <Col N="503" /> invited from the promoters of private charitable lotteries conducted under the provisions of existing gaming and lotteries legislation which were in operation on 1 July 1997.  The applications should reach my Department no later than 31 October 1997.  It is intended that support from the fund will be allocated by reference to the audited gross sales of the eligible charitable lotteries.</P>
    <P>Applications for assistance under the scheme will be evaluated by an independent committee to be set up by the Minister for Finance expressly for the purposes of advising him as to whether applications meet the eligibility criteria laid down for the scheme.  Subject to the availability of funds and to the other conditions of the scheme being met, it is intended that eligible charities would be assisted in proportion to the volume of their average annual gross lottery turnover in the three most recent years of account as certified by the organisation's auditors.</P>
    <P>The lottery promoter must be an organisation independently established for charitable purposes. Documentary evidence, such as registration with the Revenue Commissioners, will be required.  The lottery tickets must be generally available to members of the public, within the area of their circulation, on a comparable basis to national lottery products.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to review the operation of the fund before the expiry of the third year's funding.  Although necessarily limited in its compass, the fund should support the work of the charitable lotteries.</P>
    <P>The general thrust of the fund is entirely in line with the central recommendation of the review group of enhanced support from the national lottery for community and voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>The national lottery has up to now been a great success as is evidenced by the amounts that have been made available through the beneficiary fund.  As with any business, however, the national lottery has to keep abreast with developments in the market place.  The lotteries market is one in which great changes are taking place, aided by the new technologies of today which create a whole new range of business opportunities.</P>
    <P>The total gaming market is becoming more competitive in terms of the number, professionalism and image of gaming operators.  It is likely that the next few years will see the introduction of many gaming opportunities that are new to Ireland.  Technological developments and the falling cost of computer hardware will tend to remove some of the traditional barriers to entry into the gaming market.</P>
    <P>With the continued interest of the European Commission in ensuring fair competition across the EU, the traditional monopoly enjoyed by state lotteries may come more into question in the years ahead.  All these developments will pose a major challenge and anything which would have the effect of diminishing national lottery sales and, consequently, the surplus available for the beneficiary fund would obviously be of major <Col N="504" /> concern.  It will be a concern of Government, in consultation with the national lottery company, to face all of these challenges.</P>
    <P>There has been some recent publicity on the position regarding the sale of UK lottery tickets in this jurisdiction.  It is true the Department of Justice is examining concerns raised by the European Commission about the compatibility of certain sections of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, with the requirement of non-discrimination in the regulation of the operation of lotteries.  The Commission's concerns, however, were stated not in relation to our position on the sale of the UK lottery tickets but on a purported prohibition by the Irish authorities on the purchase of UK premium bonds by Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The operation of lotteries other than the national lottery, which is provided for under the National Lottery Act, 1986, is covered by the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  The Government has received legal advice regarding the sale of UK lottery tickets here.  It is our view that such sales are illegal here and the Garda authorities have taken steps to advise retailers accordingly.</P>
    <P>I thank the review group again for their excellent work and assure them that their recommendations will be fully considered by me and the Government.  I look forward to a very interesting discussion during the course of this debate.  I am anxious to take on board any ideas, suggestions or new approaches that Members of the House may have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for a full discourse on the report and for outlining the Government's intentions, in so far as it has made policy decisions on the recommendations.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice in the 1980s with responsibility for the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, I was involved in the initial stages of setting up the lottery.  After the relevant subcommittee of the Government decided there was merit in proceeding with the national lottery, the task was assigned to former Deputy Donal Creed, the father of Deputy Michael Creed.  He brought the legislation forward quickly in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Those of us who took the initiative thought the lottery would generate significant amounts of money.  We were surprised, however, at the level of first year returns which were of an order of magnitude we had not foreseen.  We quickly realised we had tapped into a source of funding in Irish life which was less painful than taxation and which gave a great return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initially the legislation setting up the lottery decided that all proceeds would go to sport, recreation, health and education.  Its genesis was peculiar because when we set it up initially the concept was that it would be a fund for sport and sporting facilities.  It was only when the money began to flow and it was clear that far more money than we had intended being dedicated to sport and community projects was coming in, that <Col N="505" /> part of the proceeds were dedicated to projects run by the Departments of Health and Education.</P>
    <P>Even though, at times of financial retrenchment in the late 1980s, lottery funds were, in effect, used to substitute for Exchequer spending, it is interesting to note that the independent group has discovered that 50 per cent of the lottery's proceeds still go to the targets for which they were intended in the first instance.  That is a greater proportion than many people who debate these issues believe, and it is very significant.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Quinn who, as Minister for Finance, saw fit to set up the independent review group which was timely.  Any source of funding which, over a reasonably short period, has generated £700 million must be subject to the same level of accountability, scrutiny and prudence as the expenditure of any other money that comes into the Exchequer.  While by and large lottery funds have been disbursed in an accountable and transparent manner, it is time to review the matter.  We are committed to transparency and greater accountability in everything we do. Therefore, it is appropriate that a review take place to ensure the rules that apply to expenditure of taxation receipts by Government Departments also apply to the receipts from the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The lottery has been an excellent source of social funding and much good work has been done as a result of it.  I am sure many members of the public will be surprised to hear that £241 million of lottery funding has been spent on health and community welfare.  Youth, sport and recreational amenities, the original intention of the lottery, received £233 million, arts, culture and national heritage received £171 million and £52 million has been spent on Irish language projects.</P>
    <P>Most Members are interested in this topic.  If the Minister proceeds to amend the lottery legislation he should do so by debating the matter openly in an appropriate committee of the House with a view to reaching consensus on the heads of a Bill before taking them to Government. While this may be an unusual way to proceed, an attempt was made on a previous occasion to reach consensus on the heads of a Bill in a committee before proceeding with legislation.  I am sure all Ministers with responsibility for disbursing lottery funds are inundated with representations from colleagues on all sides for funding for local GAA clubs, soccer clubs, amenity groups, cultural projects or for voluntary agencies who carry out great work in the area of health. These requests are part of the constant traffic through constituency offices of all Deputies and Senators.  Therefore, in seeking to amend the legislation, as well as calling on the expert advice of the independent group, the Minister should call on the expert advice of those who have brokered lottery grants for many groups.  He should rely on their advice in the first instance to formulate the heads of a Bill.  If he proceeds in that <Col N="506" /> manner he will probably get consensus from all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>There were great expectations that the lottery would change the emphasis on sport and that sporting facilities would visibly improve.  I am sure Deputies familiar with the disbursement of lottery funding will agree it has had little impact on sport.  While an allocation of £5,000 or £7,000 to improve a local GAA pitch or to install shower rooms and toilets is the stuff of local politics, when the lottery was introduced in the 1980s people expected that a swimming pool would be built in which our international athletes could at least train.  People also thought we would have a national stadium so that the Football Association of Ireland would not have to go cap in hand to the IRFU at Lansdowne Road or get involved in periodic guerrilla warfare sniping with the authorities at Croke Park to play international games here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is for the new millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been great disappointment the national lottery has not provided the nation with the level of facilities we have all seen in Europe.  Thanks to General de Gaulle, every French town has a stadium with a running track, in which soccer and other games are played, and a range of other amenities such as parking facilities and a fine swimming pool.  That is fairly standard, even in small towns.  Since the 1960s, French youth have been increasingly involved in sport and have done well on the international stage.</P>
      <P>The welfare of a nation is not necessarily in direct proportion to the excellence of its competitive athletes &mdash; sport has a wider benefit in the areas of health and recreation, which is probably of more benefit than many of the competitive sports.  However, there is disappointment in the community at large at our lack of the kind of national facilities enjoyed by other countries, and which people expected to result from the national lottery.</P>
      <P>I am not discounting the small amounts of money given to various sporting organisations.  I too have made representations to the appropriate Ministers over the years.  It is always very pleasing to ring one's local rugby or GAA club to say the money is on the way.  However, there is a feeling that the money has been scattered too widely. Now that facilities in local sporting clubs have been improved to the degree that one no longer has to throw one's clothes in a puddle behind the goal but can hang them up and have a shower after the match, I ask the Minister of State to focus on one, two or three national projects of which we could all be proud and from which we can all benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, will the Minister of State comment on the reserve fund in the Department of Finance?  My memory of that fund is that it is a very significant amount which, by any definition, is more than any group of auditors would require for reserve purposes.  The Minister of State <Col N="507" /> should examine that fund to see whether it could be used for millennium projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must be reading my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State, assisted by his Government colleagues and the Opposition, would like to have a lash for the millennium. Is the reserve fund now £65 million or £75 million?  The amount of money in that reserve fund is far in excess of what any group of auditors would require in terms of financial prudence.  Will the Minister of State seriously consider using that money for a series of projects?  He does not have to use it to build a big swimming pool or a national stadium but he should use it for something in the sporting area.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should also spend some of that money in the health area, particularly for children.  If I were marking his cards, I would tell him to give some of the money to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to replace Temple Street Children's Hospital on the site of the Mater Hospital, so that we would have a national children's hospital on the north side of Dublin.  Such a hospital will probably not be funded otherwise, from what I hear about the Estimates.  If we are to do something for the millennium, we should build on what our forefathers said in the 1916 Proclamation about cherishing the children of the nation, by building a children's hospital on the north side of Dublin so that those who currently use Temple Street would have a very good modern facility for the next century.</P>
      <P>It is very easy for the Opposition to tell Ministers how to spend money.  However, the net point is valid &mdash; there is a very large reserve fund in the Department of Finance arising from the surpluses of the national lottery.  Rather than spending that money on an instalment basis on little items around the country, a number of imaginative projects should be selected, such as those which I have just suggested.</P>
      <P>The key recommendation in the report is that the expenditure of lottery money will be reorganised so that all the surpluses will be dedicated to their original intention.  However, the Minister of State has said that this will result in no net increase in Exchequer spending.  This is difficult to understand.  Will he elaborate, because he has not fully explained what he means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the money which is being used at present to replace Exchequer spending in the Department of Education and the Department of Health is restored to the original intention of the lottery there is then a lot of extra expenditure.  Unless the Exchequer intends to cut back on health and education services, which I do not believe is the intention, that money must be replaced.  There would appear to be a hidden <i>quid pro quo</i> here, where projects, for example those in the health and social welfare areas, which are partly funded by the Exchequer and the lottery would have <Col N="508" /> their full funding assigned to the lottery in future. That is the only method of arranging the financial swings and roundabouts to result in the position, as outlined by the Minister of State, whereby there would be no extra charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>However, this only amounts to bookkeeping.  It does not fulfil public demand, which notes that approximately £700 million was accrued over the last ten years or so.  In the late 1980s approximately half that money was not spent in the manner for which it was originally intended because of severe financial constraints.  The proceeds of the lottery in times of difficult financial circumstances were used to replace Exchequer funding, principally in the Department of Health and the Department of Education.  However, the public is now saying that when there is a good flow of money to the Exchequer and while we are not experiencing the fiscal shortages of the 1980s all the surpluses of the lottery should be used for the purposes for which they were originally intended.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals appear to fall well short of that.  Although he has not spelt them out he appears to be proposing that all lottery funds will be used for the purposes for which they were intended in the first instance and that shortfalls in health and education will be replaced with Exchequer funding.  However, he goes on to say that this will result in no net increase in Exchequer spending.  That is only possible if spending on voluntary or involuntary organisations or by statutory boards, which at present are funded by the Exchequer, will be replaced by funding from the lottery.  Will he clarify the position?</P>
    <P>When this report was published there was an expectation that all lottery funds would go to the targets for which they were intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I intend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Minister of State is saying because it is not compatible with saying that there will be no net increase.  Replacement funding matched by replacement funding elsewhere appears to be the intention of the Department of Finance.  Will he clarify the position in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the recommendations, I agree with the recommendation that the funds should continue to be made by the Government and not by an independent body.  We have been bedevilled in politics by suggesting in the House that, somehow or another, the elected representatives of the people are not to be trusted while some kind of independent body, a quango, will do the job fairly.  It is as if the members of independent bodies are aliens who would not be subject to influence and who would not listen to representations. I know many independent bodies where there is more pulling and dragging and representations made than if the moneys were allocated by a Minister.  The advantage of having moneys dibursed by Ministers through Departments is <Col N="509" /> that they are fully accountable to the House, the Committee of Public Accounts and, ultimately, the electorate.</P>
    <P>As parliamentarians we are foolish to be constantly casting doubts on ourselves and on our trustworthiness and transferring obligations and tasks, which are properly the tasks of Ministers and Parliaments, to so called independent bodies. I do not know anybody in this country who does not have an angle or agenda.  However, that is not much different from any other country.</P>
    <P>The notion is that a superhuman group can be established which will decide that one GAA club is a more worthy cause than another.  They will decide to give the first club £6,000 but refuse to give £5,000 to the other by looking into their hearts independently and not on the basis of representations from dirty Deputies who might think one club has a better team and caters for a bigger population than the other.  The result will be sterile, pure and above suspicion.</P>
    <P>Nobody will be able to ask questions in the Dáil about it because the Minister will say such matters are handled by an independent body that has nothing to do with him.  However, the Minister will appoint the chairman and all the members of the independent body and will ring the chairman every night of the week to ask if his projects will be included.  I agree we should be transparent and accountable but we should forget about an independent body.  Responsible Ministers should allocate the funds in accordance with the law.  They will then be answerable to the House and can defend their decisions at Question Time.</P>
    <P>The report states that surplus revenues of the national lottery other than those in the reserve fund should in future be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activity in the areas of youth services, sport, arts, the Irish language, welfare, health and social services and community development.  That is fine.  Everybody will applaud that because it means the full £700 million will be spent rather than the £350 million spent on such causes over the past 11 years. However, the report also states that the transition will be initially carried out on the basis of no net extra cost being borne by the Exchequer.  That is not possible unless traffic moves in both directions and projects funded by the Exchequer at present are funded by the national lottery in the future.  Ultimately, that proposal will not result in any net new moneys being available for the causes outlined, which was the intention of the original lottery.  I ask the Minister to revisit this matter and explain in greater detail what he has in mind.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation is that the needs of the most disadvantaged groups in the voluntary and community sectors should be prioritised in the allocation of lottery funds within individual programmes and due regard should be had for gender and regional balance.  I agree with this proposal.  The charge has been made regarding the disbursement of lottery funds by different Ministers, including myself, that there is a <Col N="510" /> regional bias.  The suggestion is that if one puts drawing pins into a map of the country, one will see that the distribution closely follows the constituencies represented by members of the Cabinet. There is a lack of regional balance, particularly regarding sport, and this should be examined.</P>
    <P>A commission reported on the disadvantages suffered by disabled people.  The most disadvantaged people, who are best catered for by voluntary and community groups, are the disabled. However, the amount of money required to implement the commission's report is very large. A sum of £100 million would not go very far in implementing the commission's recommendations. The Minister should say to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that the notion of no extra cost being borne by the Exchequer is not a runner.  He should tell the Minister for Finance that we need to free up the lottery money and replace it with Exchequer funding in the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science.</P>
    <P>A large tranche of the extra money freed up could be used to implement the recommendations of the commission on disability.  The Minister would receive universal support in the House if the matter was approached in that manner.  His action would be of great benefit to future generations. It would be a worthy project for any Minister to have his name associated with.  I do not believe the recommendations of the commission on disability will be implemented in any real way in the foreseeable future because of lack of funds. The Government is committed to capping the increase in expenditure at a nominal 4 per cent. Those of us who have been in Government know how difficult the Estimates campaign will be with a 4 per cent cap.  A 4 per cent cap applied to the Department of Health at present will ensure cutbacks in services.  The 4 per cent cap is universal and does not have to apply to individual departments. Some will increase expenditure by more than 4 per cent and hopefully others will increase it by less than 4 per cent so that the balance can be maintained.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will not be implemented when the Government attempts to adhere to its fiscal targets, especially its expenditure targets.  The only hope is that the Minister can free up sufficient lottery funds &mdash; not on a net sum basis &mdash; to enable that to be done.  If so it will refine and give edge to the recommendation of the independent group's report that disadvantaged groups within the voluntary and community sector should be prioritised in the allocation of lottery funds.  The only way there can be prioritisation is if the Minister has more money.  He may be able to get more funds if an extra tranche of money is being generated by the lottery when he puts the recommendations into effect.</P>
    <P>Application procedures for support for programmes funded by the beneficiary fund should <Col N="511" /> be standardised.  The means of access to them should be made more publicly visible.  There are groups around the country who do not know how to apply for lottery funds and approach their local TD or councillor.  Some groups are better at it than others, some are disadvantaged because they do not know how to set about it while some miss the date and have to wait another 12 months. There must be far more visibility.  Some of the visibility should be by contacting the local authorities. Councillors are great brokers of any benefits which may be available.  I am not saying they should have a say in the allocation but elected members of local authorities should be informed of the procedures, the cut-off dates and should be given application forms so that they can explain what is happening.  That would be better than any advertisements in the newspapers.  Whatever we say about our colleagues in the local authorities, we cannot accuse them of not being in touch. They are in touch with their electorate, the voluntary and sporting groups and move around in small areas.  From the point of view of accountability it is absolutely necessary that the procedures are standardised and transparent and visible methods applied.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall a great furore was generated in one of the elections in the late 1980s by my predecessor in the Department of Health, Dr. John O'Connell, who assigned lottery funds to projects in his constituency in circumstances where no applications had been made.  In terms of the spending of money he did not do anything wrong.  The organisations to which he assigned the lottery funds were worthy.  That they were in his own constituency makes no difference, I assigned lottery money to my constituency as well to worthy causes there.  That is not the issue.  The issue was that the procedure was so slipshod at that stage that money could be allocated on the signature of a Minister to groups, no matter how worthy, who had not applied.  We cannot have that type of hit and miss carry on any longer in the expenditure of public money.  Surpluses on the lottery are as much public money as the proceeds of taxation.  It is important to have standardised procedures which would be equitable.</P>
    <P>There should not be different sets of criteria for the disbursement of grants under section 65 of the Health Acts and discretionary money being disbursed by the Minister for Health.  There has to be equity between the standards applied by the Department of Education in terms of sporting grants and those applied by the Department of Health in terms of grants to community groups. Neither can we have different standards in different sections.  The best way to achieve equity is by law.  If the Minister is amending the Acts, he should take on the further task of standardising procedures by way of statutory regulation.  It should be laid down in law how applications should be made and processed, how voluntary groups will be made accountable and how it is <Col N="512" /> proposed to ensure that subsequent to the allocation of grants they are spent for the purposes intended.</P>
    <P>In my rather disjointed remarks I have covered most of the points I wanted to make and have commented on most of the recommendations. The National Lottery Act, 1986 should be amended to provide the procedures which must be followed when national lottery funds are being allocated.  What is needed is an enabling section to allow the Minister to bring in the necessary statutory regulations to allow that to be done.  A process should be put in place to enable the Government to identify from time to time suitable major projects with an enduring impact which could be provided for from lottery resources.  The Minister should target the reserve fund.  He is new in office, and he should know that his colleagues in Government are his rivals when it comes to spending money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the Review Group on the National Lottery which was published earlier this year.  This review group was established in November 1996 under the chairmanship of Mr. Niall Greene.  The National Lottery commenced in 1987 and is operated by the An Post National Lottery Company.  The beneficiary fund has over the years been extended to many areas of Irish life, including sport and other recreation, national culture, the arts, health, youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities. Funds were allocated by a number of different Government Departments, including the old Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, the Departments of Education, Environment, Health, and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the report in the interest of openness, transparency and accountability. Openness, transparency and accountability is now an established political value in the Ireland of the 1990s.  This is a good thing and is essential for modern Government in a mature democracy.  I am happy we have cleaned up our act on the distribution of national lottery funds. Strict application procedures and criteria for evaluating competing applications are now in place. The National Lottery Beneficiary Fund can no longer be considered as a slush fund, which was the political charge made over the years against Ministers and Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to obtain details of grant schemes funded by the national lottery. <Col N="513" /> More information should be made available to groups, organisations and individuals.  Some years ago I had to table 15 parliamentary questions to discover where the funds were held.  Various Departments and agencies are involved.  They include the Departments of Education and Science &mdash; the sports and youth affairs sections &mdash; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Health and Children, and Foreign Affairs as well as the Eastern Health Board and the Arts Council. Deputy Noonan said county councillors should be informed as a matter of course but that is the least that should be done.  It appears the only people with full information at their fingertips are public representatives.  It is time some of this confidential information was released to the public who should be informed how to apply for funding.</P>
    <P>I agree with the recommendation of the review group that funds should continue to be allocated by Departments.  This procedure allows for full scrutiny in the normal way by the Dáil, the Committee of Public Accounts and the media in general. The political process has a bad name but if it means anything it is the promotion of values and the allocation of funds in a democratic way. It is not necessary to establish an independent body to distribute them.  Ministers and public representatives can be held accountable; Estimates are published each year while parliamentary questions can be tabled, representations made and issues raised in the Dáil.  That is the most effective and transparent way of allocating funding.</P>
    <P>National lottery funds should be seen as additional.  I deplore their use in substitution for Exchequer funding.  This issue is dealt with at length in the report.  The public demand that national lottery funds be used for additional spending measures.  In 1987 there were cutbacks in public expenditure to bring about our present economic miracle.  My constituents now ask why national lottery funds are not put into hospitals. There are problems with waiting lists, accident and emergency departments and other issues in the hospitals and people are concerned about health issues and using national lottery funds in hospitals is a suggestion with some merit. However, that is not why the national lottery was set up.  Normal Government financing should cater for community needs such as the health services. The report is reasonable on this point, citing a figure of 50 per cent.  We must nevertheless firmly adhere to the principle that lottery funds should be used for additional spending and that substitution be kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that poorer sectors spend a higher proportion of their incomes on the national lottery, a fact established in other countries also.  In the interests of fair play, national lottery funds should be targeted at those in need. Funds should be given to voluntary organisations which work with disadvantaged young people, the elderly, the disabled, the homeless and the poor. Public opinion would certainly agree with this <Col N="514" /> view.  Although I do not want to specify golf clubs, public representatives are often asked why these and similar groups are funded when they are in a position to raise funds from their own resources.</P>
    <P>We should adhere to the principle that those most in need should be given priority in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>We are very fortunate to have such a huge voluntary sector to work in sports, health and other areas.  It is particularly Irish.  There is a vast army of volunteers working without pay for the good of their communities or sport which we must never take for granted.  However, this is under threat in various Dublin city areas, where community life is breaking down in some cases.  It is very difficult nowadays to get volunteers for committees, for example, to look after a senior citizens' complex run by the local authority and it is difficult to get volunteers to run a summer project.  That is a new problem about which we must be concerned. Dublin Corporation is concerned that volunteers are not coming forward to run its senior citizen complexes.  It is now looking at the possibility of introducing FÁS schemes, which would be regrettable. We must be conscious of this issue.  Key funding from the national lottery for voluntary organisations is essential as only a small amount of money would result in huge dividends.</P>
    <P>The people in voluntary work are the salt of the earth.  Managers of local football teams bring teams away by coach to play matches and mothers wash the football jerseys.  We must not take for granted the network of volunteers involved with young people and should support them in every way possible.</P>
    <P>A point has been raised about when lotto jackpots reach several million pounds.  Recently, the jackpot reached £7 or £8 million.  Most people believe such large jackpots are immoral and there should be a cap, although those involved in the lottery say that would not comply with the spirit and ethos of the lotto game.  Surely, £5 million is the same as £8 million to somebody who wins the lotto.  We should decide that when the jackpot goes over £2 million, £3 million or £5 million the surplus should automatically be given to a charitable organisation.  Even if somebody won £8 million, they would probably give £3 million to charity.  We should look carefully at this issue which arises from time to time when there is a huge jackpot, although when it is won, the discussion dies down.  We should seriously consider capping the lotto jackpot at a certain level.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that in late 1997 definite plans are not in place to commemorate the new millennium. We have more or less missed the boat and it is probably too late to plan anything significant at this stage.  Last week the Taoiseach, in a reply to a question tabled by Deputy Durkan, informed the Dáil that he is consulting the relevant Ministers on how to commemorate the millennium and that when these consultations are complete, <Col N="515" /> an announcement will be made.  I am not blaming the Taoiseach but successive Governments.</P>
    <P>Surely we should have planned in 1990 how to commemorate the new millennium.  Several suggestions have been made during the discussions which have taken place.  A new children's hospital for the north side of Dublin following the demolition of Temple Street Hospital and the implementation of the report of the review group on people with physical and sensory disabilities have been proposed by Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>We should seriously consider how to commemorate the millennium.  This country has a rich and varied history and heritage and we have much to celebrate, even in the last 100 years.  The Great Famine was commemorated in a significant way and obvious planning went into that.  Even at this late stage we should put our thinking caps on and decide how to commemorate the millennium. Although it is probably too late, we must salvage what we can.</P>
    <P>The Minister said funding was made available to the Dublin millennium celebrations as I am sure it was to the European City of Culture Celebrations in Dublin in 1991.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics show the rest of the country has probably done far better than Dublin.  As Deputy Noonan pointed out, its funds are distributed in accordance with the location of Government Ministers, also illustrated by the statistics.  Over the years Dublin has lost out from the point of view of Cabinet representation, on which I am sure the Dublin lobby will work in the future.</P>
      <P>Our President, in consultation with the Government, should be allowed initiate a personal project funded by the national lottery.  I have in mind a work of art, a piece of sculpture or some form of architectural project.  This is the case in France where, on leaving office, the President always leaves a lasting work of art behind, which is a good thing.  Indeed some of the major public works of art in Paris have been commissioned by various Presidents for which funding was provided and there are no begrudgers there in that respect.  The French appreciate the many imaginative projects commissioned by former Presidents which remain for the enjoyment of future generations.  The time has come when we should allow our President to do likewise.  I do not suggest that this facility be afforded a Taoiseach when no doubt all sorts of political begrudgery would come to the fore.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will seriously examine that suggestion in the case of the President within the context of the forthcoming presidential election. A very civilised gesture for the future would be welcomed.</P>

      <P>This well thought out, valuable report is welcome.  It illustrates how the national lottery functions and advances a number of recommendations on how its administration and distribution could be improved.  Some of the difficulties encountered in its operations arise from its outstanding success, way beyond the expectations held at the time of its establishment.  In his study of the national lottery Brian Harvey resorted to extracts from debates on the subject in both Houses of the Oireachtas, some of whose Members were quite farseeing in the manner in which they envisaged it developing, anticipating some difficulties, while others were not.  Certainly, with the benefit of hindsight, those debates make interesting reading.</P>
      <P>Some of the difficulties arose from the amounts of money collected from national lottery funding being way in excess of what had been anticipated. If my memory serves me correctly, there were forecasts of its annual yield being of the order of £1 million, with a ceiling of the order of perhaps £10 million expected to be the maximum.  I do not have to remind Members that the yield has been much greater.  Those small expectations for the lottery gave rise to some of the difficulties as did the behaviour of certain politicians and others.</P>
      <P>An aspect of the lottery which has been a source of considerable irritation to me over the years is the inadequacy of information on the spending of lottery funds.  It is almost impossible to carry out a <i>per capita</i> population analysis of lottery expenditure with the exception of moneys spent by the Department of the Environment. Brian Harvey's study refers to some agencies who used the Official Secrets Act as grounds for not giving information on the spending of lottery funds.  I accept it may be difficult to make such information available but resorting to the Official Secrets Act is unacceptable.  It is difficult to identify lottery funds when they are part of a general pool of funds, including funds from other agencies.</P>
      <P>The funding channelled through the Department of the Environment is easily traced.  I have spent some time doing that and I was pleased to hear Deputy Ring refer to this matter, particularly in relation to Dublin.  I have no doubt Deputy Haughey, Deputy Hayes and myself, along with our other colleagues from Dublin, will be anxious to peruse that data with Deputy Ring and other Deputies representing the west.</P>

      <P>I am particularly looking forward to the response of Deputy Ring and others who represent the west to the fact that Dublin, which accounts for 29 per cent of the population, received 21 per cent of lottery funds in the period 1978-94.  I do not have the figures for Connacht but I hope I am correct in saying that Connacht represents approximately 15 per cent of the population yet it has received 19 per cent of lottery funds.  That is the type of data that pleases Deputy Ring and I know it will discourage him from putting on the poor mouth about the west.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am sure he will go back to his constituency and read out those figures at various meetings and in the local media.  They are a tribute to his success.  I can tell Deputy Ring, however, that I and my colleagues from Dublin intend to address this problem as a group because it is important that any differential is corrected.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to determine the position in relation to the disbursement of other lottery funds.  I would like to see data produced on where lottery funds are collected.  I assume the purchase of lottery products is uniform per head of population, but I do not know.  Such data is available to the lottery officials and I would like to see it published.  It may not deviate much from the national pattern but it would be interesting to know the reason some areas buy more lottery products than others.  It would be interesting also to examine the data in relation to the social structure of certain areas in respect of lottery funding. I understand some research has been carried out but I would like to see this area more closely examined.  I support the recommendation that a monitoring committee to oversee all aspects of spending be established.  Such a committee could assess the effects of the lottery on society.  I am not suggesting that it has a profound or enduring effect on society but it would be beneficial to assess its effects.</P>
      <P>The lotto seems to be operated on the principle of magic.  It is a triumph of magic over reason. However, if people analysed the lotto they would not invest in it as the chances of winning are considerably less than the chances of a roof falling on them.</P>

      <P>The culture of the lotto enhances the notion of magic.  While an exceptional interest is shown in lottery winners, no attention is paid to the losers. Why have no in-depth interviews been held with people who lose on the lotto every week?</P>

      <P>I do not play the lotto.  Maybe the reason for this is that I have never recovered from a course I did in statistics some years ago. The lotto stimulates and enhances the culture of illusion and some people seem to believe there is a reasonable chance of it coming good for them. However, the chances of this happening are negligible.</P>
      <P>It is time someone put the other side of the argument.  It may be possible to run an advertising campaign to counter the advertising campaign run by the lotto.  This campaign could ask people, &ldquo;Will you waste more money on the lotto this week?&rdquo;  There is nothing wrong with people putting forward the other side of the argument.  The lotto places much emphasis on advertising.  The Millennium clock in the Liffey was a mishap and I will not heap abuse on people who engage in that kind of promotion.  However, I would like to see the scales tilted in the other direction and more emphasis placed on people who have been losing money every week since 1987.  A group photograph of these people could be taken in an appropriate location, for example, Croke Park.</P>

      <P>It has been stated that the lottery has been used as a political slush fund.  I will not go down the road of shallow criticism of the political process which is under enough pressure without Deputies joining the attack.  It is time we got together and defended our profession instead of trying to exploit each other's weaknesses.  The effect of such attack damages the body politic and undermines people's confidence in it.  That may fine in the short term, but it is another matter when it reaches the stage that the public might lose complete confidence in it.  I am not saying we are next or near that, but more attention should be given to it.</P>
      <P>The carry on of some people in regard to the lottery is bizarre or eccentric.  People have come to me with lottery grant cheques made out to non-existent organisations.  That type of behaviour is over the top and gives the process a bad name.  I do not want to draw conclusions from that type of behaviour, but care should be taken to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to clarify the application process for lottery funding.  Many people seem to be <Col N="519" /> ignorant of how to apply for lottery funds.  It would be appropriate to establish a central agency which could advertise for lottery applications from time to time and inform people about the application process.  The applications could be processed centrally and, if need be, forwarded to the appropriate Department.  It is undesirable that there is a deficit of information about that process.</P>
    <P>It would also be desirable to have a list of who has applied and who has been given lottery funding. The Department of Finance produced a tome which contains all the information available on lottery funding up to l994 or l995.  It is useful and I compliment the Department on compiling it, but it should be updated on an annual basis or, if that would require an inordinate amount of time, every three or four years.</P>
    <P>The lottery lacks any great strategy.  No real thought has been given to the objectives of lottery funding, whether it is desirable, how funding is allocated and used or the alternatives.  I am not aware of any debate on a long-term plan for the lottery or of any studies on how lottery funding was spent.  I do not know if the public get value for money.  Lottery funds have amounted to approximately £600 or £700 million.  That is a good deal of money and it would be appropriate to analyse how it was spent to ascertain if value for money was obtained.  I am not advocating a witch hunt but some analysis should be carried out now that the lottery has been operating for ten years.  I am sure some of the money was spent wisely, but some of it might not have been.  What control mechanism exists to ensure the money is well spent?  What review process exists?  Are lottery projects analysed when the project money has been expended to ascertain if they were good, bad or indifferent?</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Haughey on the large jackpot. That is more of the philosophy of magic.  The bigger the jackpot the more money people spend, but statistics show they have less chance of winning. It is paradoxical that the more one pays into the lottery, the less chance one has of winning. There is a case to be made for limiting the size of the jackpot.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile analysing what has become of those who won the lottery.  There is a pool of lottery winners who could provide a broad picture of how their lives have changed as a result of their win.  I am sure many of them have used the money wisely, but some of them may have been overwhelmed as a result of their win. It may seem paradoxical that an individual could be overwhelmed by winning a great deal of money but there is anecdotal evidence that winning the lottery can have a deleterious effect even in the medium term &mdash; after the excitement wears off many problems are created.  We should analyse this to see what effect it has had on people's lives.  Hardly anyone would refuse the huge sums of money earned but it would be <Col N="520" /> worthwhile to discover what became of the winners.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for sharing his time.  The lottery has been an outstanding success and despite criticism over the last ten years it has been beneficial to many communities and organisations and the country as a whole. When we had a major balance of payments difficulty, the lottery kept many services going.  In your time as Minister for Health, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you would have seen this at first hand. Most of the money has been used wisely.</P>
      <P>When the lottery was introduced in the 1980s I was among those who highlighted the major need for it.  I was interested in the lottery because of my sporting background and position as a physical education teacher.  I saw at first hand that the level of provision for sport and recreation was totally inadequate.  I hoped there would be a bonanza for that sector following the introduction of the lottery but in the Seanad I expressed grave concern that the categories at which spending would be directed were too broad, too vague, not tight enough and open to interpretation.  Other categories were added later.  The way the lottery was used initially and the abuse by certain politicians of the allocations gave it a bad image, which was unfortunate.  Some Government Ministers led pipe bands into villages to present a cheque at a community hall.</P>

      <P>Local clubs realise this money is coming from lottery contributions and feel that, as long as they submit a proper application, they are entitled to funding.  That is as it should be.  A certain maturity has now emerged.  All of us in the House now agree with the procedures and the recommendations of the review group.  Deputy Noonan made a strong case for allowing the Departments to keep control and asked why it should be given to an independent body.  At the end of the 1980s I argued for an independent body because of the abuses of the lottery, but my view has now changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important the various Departments distribute the funds and be held accountable so that we do not have to use an independent body.  This would be just setting up another bureaucracy, leading to greater expense and probably depriving more small voluntary groups of much needed funding.  When I was a Minister of State in the <Col N="521" /> then Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, we enlisted the help of consultants in allocating Leader funds.  They examined the various applications and advised the Department officials on the level of allocation for each group.  That was very successful because it made it easy for me and my officials to say that funds were allocated on the objective advice of consultants.  It would be very welcome if there were some such procedure to take such matters out of the hands of the Minister and leave it to officials, in consultation with an expert, to make the decisions.</P>
    <P>One of the points I made in the 1980s was that if money was distributed like confetti, the national lottery would not be identified with any flagship projects.  I mentioned the need, for example, for a 50 metre swimming pool.  It may seem grandiose but we should also have a national stadium.  Despite all the hysteria created by Jack Charlton and the Irish soccer team and the successes we have had in various sports since, we still do not have a national stadium and that is very unfortunate.  The national lottery has provided us with £700 million for discretionary funding. Surely at this stage, even in partnership, we should at least have two flagship projects, a 50 metre pool and a national stadium accommodating soccer and other sports.  We have lost out on this.  In England, the great contribution the lottery has made to the arts can be seen in two national concert halls and a national theatre.  It is important in this country that we examine such major projects and I hope that, with the reserve fund, we will be able to identify projects for the millennium so that the national lottery can be identified not only with small community projects but major flagship ones as well.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Upton that there should be a requirement for development programmes. For example, the GAA in Kerry has benefited considerably over the years from lottery funding. Several clubs have benefited, including mine.  The GAA should present a five year development programme incorporating submissions from the various clubs stating exactly what they want to do and what is needed in their locality, for example such as a need for a centralised floodlit pitch rather than each club in a small area having such pitches.  There should be more demand for the provision of such programmes than at present.  I suggested in the 1980s that there should be national programmes that the national lottery could co-operate with so the position as regards facilities would be made clear.</P>
    <P>I know there was a proposal at one stage to provide a national indoor stadium and regional facilities but that came to nought.  The national sports stadium on the docks was abandoned, possibly because the philosophy was that there would be more money for providing community facilities and that distributing the money over a broader area might have greater political advantage than a flagship project.  Consideration should be given at this stage to the provision of flagship projects.  I appeal to the Minister for Tourism, <Col N="522" /> Sport and Recreation to stress the need for a 50 metre swimming pool and a national stadium.</P>
    <P>In order to protect the credibility of the national lottery, there should be more public information on the availability of funding.  Clubs with good officers seem to obtain one, two or three tranches of national lottery funding whereas neighbouring clubs might not have a good committee and, despite needing funding, may not get it.  I suggest leaving the adjudication to the various Ministers and Departments, but having some system whereby expert consultants would make decisions with the officials and forward their recommendations to the Minister.  He or she would then be accountable but the political pressure would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton mentioned evaluation.  It is important that the effects and benefits of the lottery be assessed at this stage.  Clubs and communities that received funding for projects ten years ago should be revisited to see if they are maintaining these facilities or if they have been allowed to deteriorate.  A national review of the lottery should be carried out at this stage to see if we are getting value for money and if communities respect the facilities provided.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision of sporting facilities, there should be greater co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and local communities towards the provision of sporting facilities on school grounds or as close to them as possible.  Community facilities are provided in isolation about a mile away from schools whereas there is scope to provide them on school grounds or adjacent to them.  Because of the weather and for other reasons, teachers cannot walk a mile to a community facility.  Officials should take on board the important consideration that there should be greater co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and local communities in providing community facilities as close to schools as possible, so that schools can use them during the day and the community in the evening.</P>
    <P>It is very important we encourage the continued and future success of the lottery.  Much of the criticism of the institution and the damage done to it originated in this House and was caused by politicians criticising it and abusing its funds.  It is very important and behoves us at this stage to ensure we support the lottery and encourage its future success because it is so important, especially for voluntary and community groups.  I agree with Deputy Haughey that voluntary work is under a lot of pressure.  It is very difficult to find people who will work in sporting organisations for young people.  Such people are at risk for various reasons; they feel vulnerable if asked to mind young people in sporting clubs, etc.  The lottery should support these volunteers as much as possible.  The core recommendation in the report, that more money should be directed at community and voluntary activity, is very important.  The positive nature of <Col N="523" /> this debate and its positive nature has been very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the lottery in the context of gambling.  The Irish gambling market has changed dramatically in the past decade due in some respects to a reduction in duty on off-course betting but particularly to the establishment of the national lottery.  Further change is inevitable as the State-owned national lottery vies with the private sector gambling market for market share and the spread of new communication technology generates competition at European and global level.</P>
      <P>The national lottery is ten years in existence. At the time of its establishment there were great expectations.  A number of people expressed serious concern about its effect on our citizens, but ten years down the road everybody will accept it has been a greater success than could have been imagined.  In view of that success it is unfortunate it has not had the impact it should have had in terms of distributing funds.  Major changes should be made in that regard.  An overall strategy should be implemented rather than the haphazard approach adopted up to now in handing out funds to clubs and organisations.  I am not making a political point.  All parties with the exception of the Green Party have been in Government in recent years and we have all seen the way lottery funds have been distributed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recommendation of the review group that the Government should continue to allocate the lottery surplus rather than transfer the function to an independent body.  The word &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; should be omitted because, when prizes are paid out and expenses met, all lottery money should be allocated as promised when the national lottery was set up.  The Department of Finance should not use lottery money for its own purposes or for other projects.  When the lottery was established we were promised it would be used mainly for the benefit of sport, youth recreation, arts and culture and the Irish language. Health was included at a later stage and I have no difficulty with that.  Anyone who visits hospitals will realise they are badly in need of money and they will never have enough.  It is an area much in need and funds should continue to be made available for health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major threat hangs over the lottery.  The Minister dealt with this matter in the context of the UK lottery.  With the opening up of Europe it will become increasingly difficult for us to keep out foreign lotteries.  I am not sure how much thought has gone into this matter, but one sure way of protecting the national lottery would be to introduce a ceiling on winnings.  Every time the lottery exceeds £2 million people involved in various organisations that compete with the lottery object to the fact that the prize money is so large and say that £1 million should be the maximum prize winnings.  Deputy Haughey said that for most people there is no difference between £8 <Col N="524" /> million and £5 million, and that is true.  The Government should seriously consider introducing a ceiling of perhaps £2 million or £3 million on lottery winnings.  In that context foreign lotteries would not be as attractive here.</P>
    <P>When the national lottery was established I applied for a franchise to sell lottery tickets but my application was not successful.  I know many other bookmakers who were in the same boat. Bookmakers' offices are not allowed sell lottery tickets.  If we compare the way the Government deals with the lottery with the way it deals with bookmaking, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Gambling must be considered by the Government not only as a source of tax revenue but, more importantly, from the perspective of the provision of a consumer commodity for which there is widespread public demand.</P>
    <P>Studies carried out up to a few years ago considered gambling as almost evil.  For example, under the Betting Act, 1931, there are restrictions on the setting up of a betting office &mdash; the building must be a certain distance from schools and places of worship, alcohol cannot be consumed on the premises and so on.  With the operation of the lottery, there are more than 3,500 scratch card agents throughout the country, many of them public houses, whereas the Betting Act, 1931, discourages the sale of alcohol in gambling halls. There are many anomalies in legislation and regulation in the operation of betting offices and gaming and lotteries.  One must be 18 years or more to enter a betting office whereas one can enter a gaming hall at 16 years.  There is also a difference in terms of business hours.</P>
    <P>I raised previously the updating of the Betting Act, 1931.  The Garda realise how ridiculous it is and does not enforce it as it should be enforced. If it was properly enforced many betting offices would have to close down.  That matter needs to be addressed urgently.  In terms of gambling and lotteries where the State versus the private sector, it is important that there be a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk in recent years about opening a casino in the Phoenix Park.  I was always led to believe that casinos are more or less illegal here.  I read an article in <i>Ireland on Sunday</i> last Sunday written by Rachel Borrill about the hidden Ireland.  The article read:</P>
    <P>It sounds like a seedy den in downtown Bangkok &mdash; fortunes are thrown away on the spin of a wheel.  Rachel Borrill took her chances in one of Dublin's few side street gambling clubs.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how many more seedy dens there are in Dublin but perhaps the matter should be investigated as we cannot continue to turn a blind eye in this regard.  The article claimed that there were over 5,000 members and £1,000s being won and lost each night at this casino.  The club is extremely security conscious and everything is captured on film.  If there are over 5,000 members it must not have escaped the attention of those in <Col N="525" /> authority and perhaps the matter will be addressed.</P>
    <P>Earlier speakers resisted the opportunity to point the finger at Members opposite and be too critical of the manner in which lottery money has been disbursed.  From my experience, many organisations are not sure how to apply for grants, whether they meet the relevant criteria or what funding is available.  It is important to clarify these matters.  Soccer, football and rugby organisations are well organised but perhaps we should deal with them at higher levels and pass on information to clubs outlining exactly what is available.</P>
    <P>There are voluntary organisations in every village in which people give of their time to provide a service which is not fully appreciated.  These services give great benefit to their areas and were it not for them and the voluntary contributions made by their members the drug problem would be far worse.  The funds at our disposal from the national lottery give us an opportunity to assist these people in the tremendous work they are doing and encourage young people to become involved in more active pastimes.  We should encourage participation in sport.  One often sees pupils who do not excel academically but who are able to express themselves through sport.  This is important for personal development and it is money well spent.  It would be difficult and expensive to treat these people for drug addiction at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I question the manner in which lottery funds have been disbursed to the extent that they should have had a greater impact and been more beneficial.  I would like to see an overall strategy developed.  We need some major developments in our sporting infrastructure.  A 50 metre swimming pool and a national indoor arena have been spoken of.  Unfortunately, we allow a situation to develop in which we ignore the necessity for these facilities.  It is only when an athlete returns from the Olympics with a medal and complains about training facilities in Ireland that we accept the need to do something.  Promises are made to improve facilities which will lead to more medals but after a week or two the idea is put on the back burner.</P>
    <P>The National Stadium and many of the facilities in which our sports stars have to train leave much to be desired.  These athletes are at a disadvantage before they even begin to compete internationally. There have been many cases in which our sports stars have had to go abroad to train. We are a small country and we cannot be expected to provide the same facilities which are available in the US.  However, as a Parliament and Government we must encourage more young people to participate in sport and the arts.  We have an opportunity to provide some of these badly needed facilities.</P>
    <P>When one speaks to Ministers in charge of disbursing lottery funds it is unfortunate to discover that they do not know what moneys are available from one year to the next.  There is a need for a <Col N="526" /> long-term strategy.  We must prioritise some facilities so that people know the amount of money which will be provided for, for example, an indoor sporting arena or swimming pool.  We also need to put moneys aside to deal with smaller projects which could not be funded in a single year.  The practice has been to award a major lottery grant of, for example, £50,000, to one organisation in each county.  If there was a system which included more long-term planning more clubs would benefit.  It is often the case that when £5,000 or £10,000 is awarded to a club it does little more than recognise their application. There are very ambitious projects being undertaken by some sporting organisations.  The national lottery has benefited the country and given recognition and assistance to many clubs. However, if it was examined more seriously and a more long-term approach adopted to distribution it would be more beneficial.</P>
    <P>I agree with the recommendation that the Government should continue to allocate lottery funds.  Deputy Noonan spoke about an independent body.  Over the past few years this House has passed legislation in which we have given responsibility to other people rather than accepting it ourselves.  This may have contributed to the way in which the public view politicians.  If we do not feel capable of disbursing funds in an even-handed manner it is difficult for those outside to have any other view of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate and congratulate the review group on the national lottery for their timely and excellent report.  It is specific, to the point and proposes a number of recommendations which I encourage the Government on a cross-party basis to take on board and implement either by way of amending the 1986 legislation or by ministerial order.</P>
      <P>A trait of the debate this morning has been the cross-party support for the lottery which is reflected in the attitude of people outside the House.  Successive opinion polls endorse the view that there is widespread public support for the lottery, both for the game and for the good causes it supports.  This is important.  The ingredient behind the success of the national lottery has been the support given to it by the people.  When first introduced in 1986 by the Government led by Mr. Garret FitzGerald few politician or commentators predicted that it would yield the level of finances for good causes, including sporting and voluntary organisations, which it has over the past 12 years.  This success is to be welcomed and reinforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key aspect of the national lottery is the manner in which it allows people to participate in supporting good causes.  There is a chance to strike it lucky and to participate in that awful RTÉ show on Saturday night, most of whose participants seem to be from Deputy Ring's constituency, but there is also an opportunity to contribute <Col N="527" /> to good causes.  We need to encourage and endorse this because, as Deputy Haughey pointed out, people are giving less and less of their time to voluntary organisations, a trend evident over the past ten years.  The number involved in voluntary organisations such as sporting and drama groups is declining.  We are sometimes afraid to admit that people, mostly of my generation, are not becoming involved.  This is leading to serious difficulties for voluntary organisations.  The national lottery is a way in which we can directly support those organisations.</P>
    <P>The original legislation clearly stated that at least 40 per cent of the total pool of money collected by the national lottery should be given out in prize funds.  However, the report reveals a worrying trend over the past six or seven years of up to 50 per cent being given out in prize funds. In 1986 it was approximately 43 per cent.  Is there a legislative means of dealing with this problem? More and more money is being given out in huge prize funds.  I accept that one of the motivations people have for playing the lottery is to win on a grand scale.  However, I agree with colleagues who say it is ridiculous for one person to win sums such as £2.2 million.  Deputy Upton referred to the negative effects such prize funds can have on people.  I know of one man who spent his winnings within two years and is still asking how he managed to do so.  He is now back on social welfare. The negative impact of winning such a huge amount of money has to be calculated.  We should draw back from the 50 per cent level to the 40 per cent envisaged in the legislation.  I would support a legislative means of doing this.</P>
    <P>In the late 1980s a policy decision was taken by Government to divert a substantial amount of national lottery moneys to the health and community welfare sector.  Moneys were hived off to provide direct funding for programmes within various Departments, letting the Government of the hook.  I understand why this was done given the difficult economic situation in the late 1980s. However, the reverse is now true, the good times are here.  Why are we continuing to adhere to that policy?  Given that the economy has improved in recent years it is time to change the policy.  This is one of the clear recommendations of the review committee.  It is time for the lottery to return to its original objective, namely, the provision of moneys to sport, youth, community and arts groups.  I ask the Government to take this recommendation on board.</P>
    <P>An excellent idea from an all-party committee of the House in 1989 was that local authorities should have a degree of discretion in terms of funding various organisations and that a block grant should be provided by the Government from the national lottery for this purpose.  I am in favour of this proposal.  The Government and Opposition routinely say they are in favour of giving more power to local authorities.  This is an opportunity to give local authorities the responsibility for disbursing national lottery moneys.  If we <Col N="528" /> are serious about decentralisation and giving more power to local authority members, we should give them the responsibility they deserve. There is a massive pool of money available through the national lottery.  Local authority members constantly allude to the fact that they do not have the financial resources at their disposal for their local community.  I encourage the Government to take on board this all-party recommendation of 1989 which is included in the review committee's report.  If the Government does not decide to do so, prioritised lists should be submitted by local authorities regarding projects that should be supported in each area.  If we are serious about giving more autonomy to local authorities we should consider that proposal.</P>
    <P>I agree with comments about giving autonomy to politicians to spend this money.  The national lottery was set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas in 1986.  Politicians are responsible for who gets what in our society and we should say that in public.  I agree with Deputy Upton that politicians feel they must apologise for making such decisions because of the malicious views currently circulating about politics and politicians. We were elected to do this job and will continue to do it.  I congratulate the review group for having the courage to say that, because review committees often do not have the courage to support Members of this House when determining who gets what in our society.</P>
    <P>Dublin projects have not received sufficient national lottery funding.  Deputy Upton correctly pointed out that 29 per cent of the population live in the capital city but it only received 21 per cent of funding.  People in the Dublin region would benefit substantially if a Dublin lottery was established on the same basis as in parts of the United States.  One part of my constituency, for example, which serves 75,000 people has an athletics club but no athletics track.  I know of two all-weather tracks in the country which serve 20,000 and 30,000 people respectively.  There must be better planning of sports facilities because Dublin is not getting its fair share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for sharing his time with me.  I hope he spends more money on lottery tickets than Deputy Upton.  If people are not prepared to buy a ticket, they should not get a proportion of the money being allocated.  The Deputy cannot argue his point when he has only bought one ticket in ten years.  People in the west do not have much money but they are not afraid to gamble and speculate.  People have won large sums of money in the past and they are not afraid to spend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this report.  I am glad the review group made a recommendation about local authorities. I agree with Deputy Hayes that politicians should make no apology for deciding who gets what in our society.  Members may have to table ten or 12 parliamentary questions to get a reply because civil servants do not know how to answer a question directly, although they know how to <Col N="529" /> do so indirectly.  When a question is submitted to the Department, officials wonder about an ulterior motive.  There is no ulterior motive; we are only looking for information.  I wish Departments would give straightforward replies so that Deputies do not have to table numerous questions.</P>
    <P>There was much debate about the national lottery when it was set up.  People in my constituency thought sport would be its main beneficiary, however, it was not.  People are concerned that funding is going everywhere except into sport. The Minister said that health services received £241 million.  I welcome that because the sick are the weakest in our community.  I do not care where the money comes from as long as services are improved.  Youth, sports, recreation and amenities received £233 million, while arts, culture and national heritage received £171 million. There is only a small minority of people involved in organising arts festivals, yet they received a substantial amount of money.  I also welcome the allocation of £52 million under the category &ldquo;the Irish language&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister could tell me if that money is for Teilifís na Gaeilge or to promote the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned sporting organisations and those who do voluntary work, such as bringing young people to football and swimming. They find it difficult to get £5,000 or £10,000 from the national lottery.  Sporting organisations, schools and voluntary groups are not trying to defraud the State.  They want money to build football pitches, playgrounds, etc.  and they put a lot of time and effort into filling out forms and producing tax clearance certificates.  However, it often takes two years from the time they apply for grants until they get their money.  The Minister should use his power to make it easier for people to draw down money.</P>
    <P>There are no lottery machines in big towns, such as Kilmaine and Ballintubber.  This reminds me of the time when people in the Westport area could only get the <i>Irish Independent</i> in two or three shops because it was operated by a monopoly. I am glad that is no longer the case.  People must travel many miles to play the national lottery. The national lottery should install more machines, particularly in scattered areas in rural Ireland.  I would like to see the UK lottery being played as that would result in machines being installed in every shop.  We would have no difficulty with people from Northern Ireland putting machines in the South in the same way that we have no difficulty watching English television channels, although we do not like paying for them.</P>

      <P>I received a fax this morning from St. Kevin's Boys Club asking how it could access lottery funds.  I have to meet a delegation this afternoon which wants to discuss a similar issue.  I also received a letter from a nun in Ballymun asking how she could get money for courses she is running for mothers.</P>
      <P>I welcome the open-mindedness of the Minister's contribution.  There seems to be cross-party agreement to revise some of the mechanisms used to disburse lottery funding.  The national lottery is generally viewed as an unqualified success. From the perspective of a lottery being primarily established to generate a new source of funding to support certain specified schemes, I can only concur with that assertion.  One could argue that the lottery has diverted funds from other deserving charities &mdash; many Members adverted to that fact &mdash; or that it is disproportionately supported by the less well off sectors of society.  However, these arguments have been well aired in the past and I do not propose to dwell on them.</P>
      <P>The fund-raising ability of the national lottery has surpassed all expectations.  First year sales were five times greater than projected.  In 1996, approximately £100 million was remitted to the Exchequer for allocation through the national lottery beneficiary fund.  By any stretch of the imagination this is a substantial amount of money.  It is incumbent on us to ensure that the funds are allocated to the correct project areas, allocated to the right groups in these areas and disbursed on the basis of necessity of need.</P>
      <P>I welcome the report of the review group on the national lottery which raises many salient points.  It makes a number of clearly justifiable recommendations but there are a number of areas I wish to explore in depth.  These include the question of additionality and substitution, namely, is the funding raised by the lottery being used for its original purpose or is it merely replacing normal Exchequer?  Should the allocation of grants from the national lottery beneficiary fund be assessed by a new and completely independent body or remain the preserve or various Departments and should allocation criteria be changed in ways that favour disadvantaged groups and areas?</P>
      <P>The review group pointed out that the initial legislation provided that certain categories &mdash; sport and recreation, national culture, the arts and community health &mdash; should be supported from the beneficiary fund.  Further categories such as youth, welfare, national heritage and amenities were later included.  It must be stated that groups involved in the areas of youth, community and sport found it difficult to get their toes in the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and its Departments decide the amount to be spent from the fund on each designated category.  The original and expressed intention of the lottery was to provide for additional expenditure in specific areas, not merely to substitute for existing Exchequer expenditure.  This policy was changed in the late <Col N="531" /> 1980s and early 1990s coinciding with the major retrenchment in public spending.  Such a policy shift was arguably justifiable at that time because, as another Member stated, few people would argue that the need to reduce hospital lists was a worthwhile redirection of funds.  However, the substitution of lottery funding for normal Exchequer expenditure has become the accepted norm.  In effect, the national lottery beneficiary fund has become a Government expenditure slush fund.</P>
    <P>A report by Brian Harvey in 1995 was very critical of the level of substitution involved in lottery funding.  His report concluded that additionality amounted to only 7 to 11 per cent and that the voluntary and community sector received only 37 per cent of the funding.  The Department of Finance argued the basis of the findings arrived at in the Harvey report and a second report by Terry Baker of the ESRI estimated that additionality was more in the order of 50 per cent.  Even if the findings of the Baker report, estimating additionality at 50 per cent, are accepted, it could be argued that at a time of buoyant Exchequer receipts we should be striving for a greater percentage than this.  Government Exchequer returns are running in the order of £700 million above the projection for 1997.  Surely we should not allow lottery funding to be used as a substitute for what is termed &ldquo;normal Government expenditure&rdquo;.  The original intention of the lottery was to provide a source of funding for areas that would not qualify for normal Government expenditure.  We should be adamant that this intention is adhered to in the current economic climate.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the review group is that the Government should continue to allocate the lottery surplus rather than transfer this function to an independent body.  I probably disagree with a number of previous speakers in this regard. A decision was made to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, the Government continued to allocate the funds and reasons were devised to justify this position. There are a number of valid reasons for awarding the allocation of funding to an independent body. Not only would this remove the scope for political influence in issuing grant allocations, it would also remove temptation on the part of Departments to use the lottery as a slush fund for normal Government expenditure.  During his contribution, the Minister of State adverted to this matter in an oblique way.  I will deal with his remarks later.</P>
    <P>Another valid reason for transferring allocation powers to an independent body is that the public should perceive the distribution process as being transparent, open and fair.  In the present climate, the body politic must be also seen in this light. One of the reasons advanced by the review group for not recommending the establishment of an independent body is that the State has sufficient bodies and agencies in place through which it can effectively channel lottery funding.  It also argued <Col N="532" /> that an independent body would duplicate the functions currently carried out by Departments. This argument is fundamentally weak.  At times a separate body can bring focus and dedication to carrying out a function which may not be accomplished as effectively when performed by a number of Departments.  I cite the National Treasury Management Agency and Temple Bar Properties as examples of this.  The functions of both these bodies could have been performed by the relevant Departments but I question whether they would have been carried out as effectively or efficiently.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of proposals on how the national lottery beneficiary fund should be disbursed.  Several research projects have discovered that less well off sections of society spend disproportionately more on the lottery than others.  A case can, therefore, be made that areas of disadvantage should also benefit more.  I also propose that, in the same way the European Union classified areas of disadvantage for economic aid, we should classify certain areas for greater amounts of lottery funding.  The review group points out that surveys and attitudes to lottery expenditure indicate a widespread view that those in need should benefit more.</P>
    <P>Areas classified as disadvantaged should receive a greater proportion of lottery funds and there should be a greater flexibility in the percentage of the project cost funded.  I further propose that an allocation be made to each local authority.  Deputies who are members of local authorities will, in recent years, have had the experience of drawing up a list of projects which deserve funding and passing it on to the Department of the Environment or elsewhere.  These lists have disappeared and a mish-mash list of projects have issued in their place.  We only discover the amount of funding allocated to our areas after grants have been allocated to local groups.  That is not good practice and it should be discontinued.</P>
    <P>I suggest that each local authority be given a budget for allocation in its area of jurisdiction according to clearly defined criteria.  I do not suggest that money be simply thrown at projects. Local authorities and elected councillors understand and appreciate the workings and needs of the local and voluntary sector.  Not only would local groups benefit under this proposal, there is a wider principle at stake, namely, local democracy through devolving of real power to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the review group's main recommendation which, as the Minister of State indicated is that &ldquo;the allocation of lottery resources should be directed entirely to the support of voluntary and community activity.  This would be intended to bring about a much closer association, than has been the case heretofore, of lottery support with a wide range of services and activities at the heart of the community&rdquo;.  I applaud that change of direction.  The need for <Col N="533" /> objectivity and transparency in the evaluation and granting of lottery funds must be restored.</P>

      <P>At the turn of the century when people spoke of a dream, it was that referred to by Padraig Pearse when he asked &ldquo;O wise men, riddle me this what if the dream come true?&rdquo; Today that dream is centred not on a national aspiration but on a personal aspiration focused on the movement of 42 coloured balls each Wednesday and Saturday evening.  Like Pearse the majority have &ldquo;Squandered the splendid years that the Lord God gave to my youth in attempting impossible things&rdquo;.  Even if they succeed, they may discover that they cannot realise their dream.</P>
      <P>The winner of last night's £1.5 million &ldquo;Lotto&rdquo; draw could not have purchased the house in my constituency which yesterday sold for £2.3 million. Yet it is a live dream &mdash; a dream which generated £307.8 million in lottery spending in 1996 alone.  We need to focus not on the prize money but on whether people who are spending money on the lotto can afford it, and whether the proceeds are spent in a manner which benefits those who need it most.</P>
      <P>The profile of lottery participants indicates that all sections of society participate in the lotto.  The average weekly spending by a lottery participant is £3.11p. However, £3 from a TD's salary compares proportionately badly to £3 from the income of a person on a pension or social welfare allowance.  Almost 70 per cent of skilled, semiskilled and unskilled workers are reported as regular players, compared with 54 per cent of the upper middle class, professionals, related groups and farmers.  This is backed by international data.</P>
      <P>The lottery is a form of voluntary taxation offered by people whose aim is to achieve a style and status denied them.  It is our responsibility, and it should remain, as recommended, the responsibility of the Government, to ensure that the disbursement of lottery funds should benefit those who are the greatest contributors and those most deserving in the context of the terms of reference of the National Lottery Act, 1986.</P>
      <P>I agree with the recommendations that surplus revenues should be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activity in the area of youth services, sports, the arts, the Irish language, welfare, health, social services and community development.  I also agree with the recommendation that the needs of the most disadvantaged groups should be prioritised in the allocation of lottery funds.</P>
      <P>Lottery revenue has greatly exceeded the original expectations but that should not give us an excuse to renege on our Exchequer responsibilities or to continue a situation where substitution rather than additional funding is granted to qualifying bodies.  Has the quality of Irish life improved as a result of the lottery?  Is it a drain on the resources of people with little disposable income?  Are there better community facilities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Are there more recreation centres?  Do more teenagers benefit from sporting activities?  Do the Irish charities gain from increased grants?  Is the Irish language a real beneficiary of lottery grants?</P>
    <P>Publication of details of how funding is distributed should, as is recommended, be more precise and specific.  While I praise the grants given to various bodies and projects, there is a need to commit sufficient funds to ensure that the project is completed and that local communities are not wondering from one year to the next if the parish hall will be fitted with a roof.  The recommendation of the review group that a commitment should be given to the principle of partnership with the client would establish proper procedures which would lead to greater accountability, openness and consensus.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to ensure that those who would otherwise gain from people's disposable income &mdash; charities &mdash; do not suffer.  The work of Irish charities is largely voluntary and includes groups working with the elderly, the disabled, travellers and the homeless.  In the period 1987-96, only £26.7 million in total was given in grants from the national lottery beneficiary fund to voluntary bodies working in the social services area &mdash; about 1 per cent of the total for the period. However, it could be suggested that expenditure on the lottery by the public could lead to a consequent drop in the moneys raised by charity.</P>
    <P>The most recent research available on charitable fundraising, Charitable Giving and Volunteering in the Republic of Ireland, was published by the National College of Industrial Relations in September 1995.  It reported that the amount donated by the public to charity fell from £246 million in 1992 to £217 million in 1994, a drop of £29 million.  Over the same period, sales of the national lottery increased by £39 million.  The NCIR research also reported that sales of charity lottery tickets in Ireland decreased from £16 million in 1992 to £10 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>In this context, I welcome the setting up of the Charitable Lotteries Fund, which has been established for the purposes of supplementing the income of the promoters of private charitable lotteries whose products are in direct competition with similar products available from the national lottery.  The basis for distributing the fund, which was advertised for the first time yesterday, appears to be complete, fair and transparent.  In order to ensure further fairness, perhaps it is time to review the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, which in placing a limit on prizes in charity lotteries at £10,000 per week, places them at a major disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an nGaeilge, tá sé soiléir gur ionadaíocht airgid atá i gceist dona heagrais Gaeilge seachas breisíocht.  Anuas go dtí 1988, tháinig ciste na Gaeilge ó na gnáth-meastúcháin.  Athraíodh é sin le teacht an lotto ach níor tháinig méadú ar an gciste faoi mar a tharla dona deontaisí dona hógeagrais.  Dublaíodh iad sin agus moladh tuilte acu.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="535" /> Le cúig bliain ó 1991-96, méadaíodh ciste na Gaeilge ó £1.8 milliúin go dtí £2.1 milliúin &mdash; méadú £300,000.  An leor é sin?  Taispeánann an Daonáirimh go bhfuil méadú suntasach le feiceáil le uimhir na Gaeilgeorí sa tír seo ó bhunú an Stáit.  Dar ndóigh, is eol do chách go bhfuil muintir na hÉireann níos báúla ná riamh don teanga.</P>
    <P>Táimid níos láidre san Eoraip, sáite níos mó i gcultúir idirnáisiúnta agus ba chóir dúinn tacaíocht a thabhairt do na heagrais Gaeilge.  Ní cheart dearmad a dhéanamh ar an téarma tagartha don chrannchur náisiúnta a deir gur cóir airgead a thabhairt ar son na Gaeilge.  I guarantee that money spent on the Irish language has a more lasting effect than the money spent on such major projects as the millennium clock in the Liffey.</P>
    <P>Every Irish citizen has a different dream.  Winning the lottery will apply to only a few, but benefiting from the lottery should apply to everyone. The recommendations of the review body, which recognise the accountability of the Government, the importance of prioritising allocations, developing partnerships, standardising applications and publicising funding will ensure fairness and equity.  I commend them.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I welcome the report of the Review Group on the National Lottery.  Ten years on from the establishment of the lottery, it is time that its workings be reviewed, in the light of justified and unjustified criticism.  It would be wrong for the Oireachtas to ignore justified criticism of national lottery allocations and hand over the running of the lottery to an independent body.  This would indicate to the public that we had something to hide and there may have been some irregularities in the allocation of funds or in the manner in which applications were handled.</P>
      <P>It is important that this report is examined not only by the Department of Finance but by other Departments who have made up the shortfall in Estimates by using lottery allocations in the daily running of their Departments.  The National Lottery Act, 1986, did not envisage such a means of disbursing the funds.  For that reason the Minister should consider allocating national lottery funding from a single Department rather than disbursing it through the Departments of Health and Children, Education and Science and Environment and Local Government.  Therein lies part of the reason for public disquiet about the national lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery has been a great success in its ten years of operation.  Every community and group that applied received valuable funds from it.  It is likely that these groups would not have <Col N="536" /> been recognised by any other Government agency and would have not have received funds from another source.  There are positive feelings from communities around the country about the national lottery because it has been good to them. Facilities in rural and urban areas would not have been provided were it not for national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>The issue of competition as it applies to the national lottery needs examination.  There has been a justified reaction from the charities which have a long tradition in sourcing their own funding for their works.  They have felt the effects of the national lottery's effective monopoly which must cease if we are to face the challenge of the UK lottery which, it would appear, will be allowed to compete in Ireland under EU rules, despite our efforts to protect the national lottery. Nationally, the limitations placed on organisations such as Rehab are unjust.  The success of any organisation can only be judged if there is fair competition.  The national lottery has a privileged monopoly position which is unfair to the other voluntary bodies which have a tradition going back before the national lottery was set up.  In fairness to those other organisations we must allow the national lottery to face the challenge of competition.  We must level the playing pitch so that these organisations may continue their good work.  Providing a fund of £5 million from national lottery funds for the charities is just a sop to satisfy some of the criticisms from that quarter.</P>
    <P>I am glad the report has established priorities, in particular the disadvantaged.  It is a reflection on successive Governments and on Departments that this section of society has had to rely on allocations from the national lottery to fund its legitimate claims for essential services.  A family with a physically or mentally handicapped child must struggle with the Department of Health and Children for basic hospitalisation services.  Services as basic as speech therapy are not provided to many young people suffering from autism.  As a Deputy from the west I can give many examples of such lack of access to essential services when an early diagnosis has been made and when such services would be of most benefit.  It is wrong that such disadvantage should continue to exist given that we hear so often of the tiger economy and the vast amounts of extra tax revenue available to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the physically and mentally handicapped would be prioritised at national level, not just in a Minister's constituency, so that facilities as basic as day care centres or residential care in certain circumstances could be provided. Organisations such as the mentally handicapped associations raised funds and highlighted the need for these services in the 1970s and 1980s.  At that time the parents involved were young and their children were young.  However, there is now great concern among these now older parents for the future of their children who are now young adults with a mental or physical disability and who may have to be institutionalised.  There are <Col N="537" /> many people in mental institutions who are not more than physically or mentally handicapped but who have nowhere else to go.  It is wrong and we must put and end to it while the funds are available to provide a decent service to those people.</P>
    <P>The sporting organisations who were the original intended beneficiaries of the lottery have had a fair share of funds.  After the Olympic success of our national hero and triple gold medallist Michelle Smith some years ago it would have been appropriate to provide a 50 metre swimming pool as a national monument in her honour.  Has the relevance of the Olympics and Michelle Smith's success evaporated with the passage of time?  There was some unfavourable reaction to politicians welcoming home various teams or individuals who were successful in international sport over the years; some people felt that politicians did not have the right to be present on such occasions.  We should examine that to try to find out where all that goodwill went.</P>
    <P>Has the 50 metre swimming pool been put on the back burner and forgotten about in the same way as many other prominent instances throughout the year?  Sentiments, which may have been well intentioned at the time, have been forgotten recently and that is responsible for much of the criticism of politicians from the media and other sources.  It may be justified in the case of the 50 metre pool as politicians have failed to deliver on the promises made.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will retain responsibility for the allocation of lottery funds.  To give that responsibility to an independent body would speak volumes about our inadequacy and inability.  It is a credit to successive Ministers, Departments and officials that they have applied the allocation of funds fairly throughout the country.  We may have seen an imbalance in the allocation of funds prior to an election but that is to be expected.  There are very few instances in which the benefit of money allocated has not been seen at ground level.  That is the important issue on which the success of the national lottery rests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the report of the review group on the national lottery which gives us the opportunity to make a number of points. As my colleague Deputy Burke said, it is important that every national institution, such as the national lottery, should be reviewed on a ten year basis.  I also agree with Deputy Burke's view that the Government, when examining the review, should consider giving responsibility for national lottery funding to a specific Department. As things stand, a number of Departments deal with this issue; that can cause difficulties and has done over the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the review group's recommendation that responsibility for funding allocation should stay within the ambit of Government; that is very important.  Regardless of what parties are in Government, the majority of funding distributed over the past ten years has been carried out in an <Col N="538" /> even handed manner.  In spite of the fact that some counties complain from time to time, overall funding allocations have been carried out as fairly as possible.</P>
    <P>The National Lottery Act, 1996, was established to fund a number of areas &mdash; arts, culture, heritage, sport, youth and the Irish language.  In the late 1980s when fiscal rectitude was one of the political war cries, Governments used a large amount of national lottery funding in mainline departmental areas.  National lottery funding was used by the Department of Health to keep everyday health services up and running.  Now that we are in the era of the Celtic tiger we should be more prudent in the manner in which we spend taxpayers' money.  Newspapers are reporting that more than £500 million will be given away in the December budget.  If that is the case, tax buoyancy and revenue are raising sufficient money to provide mainline services in all Departments.  The money taken in by the national lottery should be spent in the areas for which it was specifically intended.  The Minister said that over the past ten years £241 million was spent in the areas of health, community and welfare.  That was probably very necessary but, given the current levels of tax revenue, national lottery funds should now be put back into the areas of youth, sports, recreation, amenities, arts, culture, national heritage and the Irish language.</P>
    <P>Much work remains to be done in the areas of youth and recreational facilities throughout the country.  Most sports complexes and other recreational facilities have been provided by the private sector rather than the State.  Some of my colleagues referred to a 50 metre swimming pool; that may be an old red herring but if we cannot afford to built it now, we will never build it.  That would be an admission of failure especially in the light of Michelle Smith having represented Ireland so excellently at the Olympics.</P>
    <P>I disagree with my colleague, Deputy Hayes, who said he would like to see a cap placed on the amount of money individuals could win in the national lottery.  That is not a good idea; if a person wins £2 million or £5 million good luck to them.  There is an incentive for people to go out and buy national lottery tickets; the more people who do this, the more funding will be available. To place a cap on the amounts which could be won would be a negative rather than a positive step.</P>
    <P>When the Government reviews the report I would like it to consider allowing more retail outlets to sell national lottery tickets.  Many retailers are willing to sell them and that would help to increase sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BeverleyCooperFlynn" hpid="Ms Cooper-Flynn Ms Cooper-Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to discuss the report of the review group on the national lottery.  Many reports have been prepared over the past ten years on the national lottery; one such was compiled by the Irish gambling industry and was reported on 21 November 1996.  That report stated that the principal <Col N="539" /> motivation for the establishment of a national lottery was the perceived revenue generating potential of such an operation as based on evidence from other western countries.  The lottery's success was seriously underestimated as it has exceeded all expectations.  Unlike other forms of betting in this country, the national lottery is obliged to distribute proceeds, net of winnings and operating costs, to nominated beneficiaries as outlined in section 5 of the National Lottery Act, 1986.  Therefore, while there is no direct tax yield from the lottery to the Government, the funds raised have allowed the Government to finance expenditure in areas where it would previously have been unavailable or severely restricted.</P>
      <P>It can, therefore, be argued that the national lottery fund expenditure has displaced Exchequer funding requirements allowing State revenue to be freed for expenditure elsewhere.  The report of the Irish gambling industry shows that displacement of Exchequer funding in the various categories where the beneficiary fund can be spent has been in the region of 50 per cent in the areas of youth, sport, recreation, arts, culture, health and welfare and the Irish language.  The national lottery has experienced ten consecutive years of continuous growth with a total of £700 million being raised for the Government to allocate to projects since 1987.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important for the national lottery to remain competitive and to respond to market changes, particularly in the light of the European Commission's demand that foreign lotteries must be allowed the option of operating in Ireland.  The Department of Justice is currently looking at the implications of that demand.</P>
      <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 22 August 1997 a Department of Justice spokesperson said that the EU view on lottery operations was a highly complex one and that the Department was examining a report from the Commission on this matter.  Such a change to allow foreign lotteries to operate here would have huge implications for the national lottery, even though it was set up under separate legislation in 1986.  A spokesperson for the national lottery company said the Commission's demand was a matter for the Departments of Justice and Finance.</P>
      <P>The Irish Amusement Trades Association told the <i>Sunday Times</i> that the EU had informed the Government it could not ban foreign lotteries.  It is understood the Government may have no option but to change the legislation which would have a serious impact for many groups that have received funding from the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national lottery touches almost everybody's life.  Research shows that 63 per cent of the population participates and that the average weekly spend by regular participants is in the region of £3.11. Net expenditure has remained constant at 0.7 per cent of personal consumer expenditure over the last ten years.  It is evident that if foreign lotteries are allowed to operate here the spend will remain the same, but the real <Col N="540" /> losers will be the national lottery and the many groups who have benefited from it.</P>
    <P>The report mentions evidence that working class groups spend more on the lottery than others, and that should be reflected in how the money is allocated.  People pay and play, and do so because they want to feel they are doing some good and that the proceeds of the beneficiary fund are going to deserving projects.  This is an important point in ensuring the future success of the national lottery, particularly against foreign competition.</P>
    <P>A national survey of attitudes to the national lottery conducted by Behaviour and Attitudes Limited in March 1997 found that 70 per cent of people feel the lottery is a good idea.  Of that 70 per cent, 45 per cent said the primary reason they play the lottery is that it supports various deserving causes.  Any dissatisfaction with the disbursement of the lottery fund reflects badly on the national lottery company as it advertises the projects funded in its promotional literature.  It also reflects badly on the Government because Ministers decide how the beneficiary fund is to be spent.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at the ten recommendations of the review group in some detail.  The first recommendation is that the allocation of lottery funds should continue to be made by the Government rather than by an independent body. I agree with this recommendation.  Public accountability rests with Dáil Éireann.  We are elected as public representatives by the people to oversee public spending.  The Dáil is the place where questions can be asked and where policy can be enunciated to match investment.  People who play the lottery want to feel they are doing good.  The people they elect are answerable to them every four or five years at a general election. That guarantees that the beneficiary fund is spent fairly and according to the needs of the community.  It would be a retrograde step to hand over responsibility to an independent body that cannot be questioned in the Dáil about allocations.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation of the review group is that the beneficiary fund be devoted entirely to the support of community and voluntary activities.  When people participate in the lottery they believe they are doing something extra, over and above normal Government spending.  It is not their intention to replace Exchequer funding with funding from the beneficiary fund.  This is where the principle of additionality comes from.  The beneficiary fund is unique and is designed to do something extra.  It should be community driven, visible and transparent.</P>
    <P>In the late 1980s and early 1990s economic conditions were not as good as those we enjoy today. At that time it was necessary to use the beneficiary fund to boost Exchequer funding.  Projects that would normally have benefited from Exchequer funding had to be provided by the beneficiary under the lottery.  The situation has now changed, however, as we are enjoying an <Col N="541" /> economic boom and it is important to return to the original objectives of additional funding in community and voluntary activities.</P>
    <P>Two reports were carried out on the principle of additionality.  The Harvey report stated that additionality was at 7 to 11 per cent.  However, the Terry Baker ERSI report of 1997 &mdash; which the review group recognised as being more accurate &mdash; stated that additionality was at 50 per cent. In a time of economic boom, however, it is important for the beneficiary fund to be more focused.  It should select a number of larger projects that otherwise would not obtain funding and that could be readily identified with the national lottery.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk in the House about a 50 metre swimming pool.  Maybe such a project could enjoy funding and everyone would then recognise that the lottery's beneficiary fund had paid for that particular project.  When I drive along the road to Mayo a couple of times a week, I can spot projects that are funded by the European Union because signs are placed to identify them.  Projects funded by the national lottery should also use such signage.  Even small projects should be identified as having received lottery funding.  That would boost sales and increase the current level of spending on the lottery.</P>
    <P>There should be a geographical spread so that everybody can see and appreciate the benefits of the lottery.  I was surprised that I could not get a regional breakdown of figures when I requested one.  Individual Departments can provide some breakdown but nobody can provide a complete county-by-county breakdown of the £700 million that has been spent over the last ten years.  The 63 per cent of people who participate in the lottery would like to know where that money is being spent in their counties to make sure they are getting a slice of the cake.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare allocates some of the money in direct proportion to the number of people living in a county.  That is fair, although I am not suggesting the money should be allocated strictly on a <i>per capita</i> basis because if the lottery is to be successful a number of major projects will have to receive funding and there simply cannot be a major project in every county. Small projects are also important, however, and they have a huge positive impact on rural communities, particularly in County Mayo which I represent.</P>
    <P>Funding should be carried out in an integrated way so that it complements State funding and policy in many areas.  Now is the time to isolate the beneficiary fund from Government expenditure and restore it to its originally intended position of supporting community and voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>The third recommendation in the report suggests that disadvantaged groups within the voluntary and community sector should be given priority.  Even in good times, which we are now experiencing, there are marginalised communities. Disadvantage can be broken down into two <Col N="542" /> areas.  There are disadvantaged areas and disadvantaged groups.  In a time of economic boom it is important that the national lottery's beneficiary fund should support the weaker sections of our community which always need our support.  One factor which should be important when considering the allocation of funding is employability. Employability could be a key feature of funding for disadvantaged groups because it provides an opportunity for the development of skills where a gap exists currently.</P>
    <P>Lottery funding gives an opportunity and a start in life to individuals and groups.  In my constituency a women's group in north County Mayo, many members of which work on farms or as housewives, has sought lottery funding to start a computer course.  There is a great awareness in County Mayo of the information age and Castlebar recently took part in the information age town competition.  The type of course to which I refer gives opportunities to women and disadvantaged groups which enable them to return to the employment market and that is a trend which I would like to see continue.</P>
    <P>The fourth recommendation of the report deals with standardising application procedures. Bureaucracy and administration mean less money for investment.  It is important that applications are standardised to simplify the application process. Only this week a number of people contacted me who were unsure of the Department to which they should make their applications, how they should go about it and when they should apply.  The attitude towards anybody who is making an application for lottery funds should be one of assistance because these applications can form a valuable source of new ideas.  We all know funding cannot be provided for every project but valuable information can be provided which could benefit everyone.</P>
    <P>I agree with the fifth recommendation of the report that the Government should publish more details on how the funding is distributed.  I suggest that an annual event be held at which the best lottery funded projects can be displayed. This would offer an opportunity to local groups to show what they are doing with the money.  If people see that their money is being spent prudently, it can only have a positive effect for the national lottery company and the Government. The Minister should consider such an annual event when he examines the report.  This is also important for the purposes of transparency and visibility in the allocation of funds.  I also believe there is a need to introduce annual reports on funding.</P>
    <P>The report's sixth recommendation is that the decisions on applications should reflect the commitment to the principle of partnership with the client base.  Partnership is important in evaluating applications.  Partnership between project leaders, the local authorities, regional agencies and Departments need not be cumbersome.  It is not necessary for local authorities to have a say in how the funding is allocated but they should be <Col N="543" /> informed and know what is happening in other counties.  If local authorities are informed and the principle of co-operation can be agreed between the various bodies, there is greater accountability and consensus about the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>Recommendation seven of the report states that organisations or bodies which have been recipients of national lottery funding should fill out a lottery beneficiary information form and show how the money has been spent each year. This is a good idea because the most important aspect of the allocation of funding is financial accountability.  If money is being allocated, it is important that it is spent properly.  We cannot know that is the case unless we get some feedback from the projects involved.</P>
    <P>To oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report and maintain continuous supervision of the disbursement of the beneficiary fund, the review group recommends the establishment of a national lottery beneficiary fund monitoring committee.  This is the only recommendation of the report with which I must disagree because Dáil Éireann is the monitoring committee for the disbursement of the beneficiary funds.  The 166 Deputies represent the people, interest groups and communities.  We are elected by the people, who have an opportunity every four or five years to decide who represents them. There can be no more accountable review body than Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their valuable contributions to this debate.  I am aware that there was a great deal of interest among Deputies and the public in the report of the review group and its recommendations when it was published.  The debate was non-partisan in nature because Members of the House can see in every county, city and town the extent to which the national lottery has benefited targeted community groups and projects.  Many rural communities, which have suffered because young people moved to urban areas and traditional structures of society disintegrated, have regenerated themselves with new ideas and community-led developments.  It is heartening for public representatives to go into such communities and see the process of bonding in a dispersed population in which projects are begun.  The amounts of money which can be raised locally in rural areas never cease to amaze me because it seems impossible to raise such sums in larger urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great sense of spirit in the community. It is important that the Government recognise the individual value of each project and the role it must play in ensuring that local communities have access to funding which can create centres of interest which have a residual long-term beneficial effect.  Many projects, which started with an idea and national lottery funding, have mushroomed into larger developments <Col N="544" /> which bring a range of facilities into an area and rejuvenate the community.</P>
    <P>The national lottery beneficiary fund in particular has played a vital role.  After all, it is the people's money.  It is right that we should have the capacity to disburse the funds as widely as possible and at the same time in as targeted a way as possible to ensure that we maximise the benefits of what is a substantial amount of money &mdash; in excess of £100 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies raised important points in the course of the debate.  Deputy Noonan spoke at length about the reserve fund and he raised some questions about its use.  The substantial fund, which stood at £43 million when the report was published in 1996 but which has grown since, was kept with the intention of funding a major project in the next few years.  The Deputy's point is well made and I was very conscious of it.  There is an opportunity now as the millennium approaches.  I do not want to say definitively that that is where the money may end up but it is obviously a consideration in the search for a suitable major project.  Because the matter is so subjective, Members could put forward 166 ideas within a half an hour if need be but the Government will be trying to build on the strengths which have already been put in place by the lottery. While I am sure all Members would like the money to be spent on one or two major projects, we must examine the residual benefits we can derive from such investment as we move into the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the unanimous view on the report's recommendation that the control and disbursement of lottery funding should not be handed over to an independent review group.  It is important that we, as the primary focus of democracy, should be held accountable.  The House is made up of honest people with enormous integrity who are concerned about their constituents and people's welfare.  To diminish that role by suggesting that an independent group would be more answerable or transparent is not the best way forward.  The public wants access to information and we have the capacity to meet those demands.  There should be no misunderstandings or residual concerns in the public domain about how lottery projects are determined or about why some get funding and others do not.  While many of these views may be subjective, the points were well made.  The Government will remain in control of lottery funding and will take on board the recommendations made in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recommendation that lottery funding for voluntary and community sectors, currently dealt with on a statutory basis, should be dealt with by the relevant Departments.  While I acknowledge Deputy Noonan's comments in that regard, as a former Minister for Finance he should know that public expenditure comes into the equation.  Such a change will be central to maximising to the best of our ability the moneys available from the lottery for sport and youth <Col N="545" /> facilities, heritage projects and so on.  All lottery funding should be maximised in the marketplace. The review body did not state that extra funding was needed.  It suggested that allocation of moneys for statutory functions was not the best way to use the fund.  I warmly welcome that recommendation.  When that change is made, the next step will be to ensure public expenditure is properly controlled and the Minister for Finance will give that priority during his time in office. The focus will be more transparent and the public will respond accordingly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey and others referred to the compendium, the last of which was published in l994.  For the benefit of the public and ourselves, we hope to update that information on a regular basis so that everyone is aware of what is happening with regard to lottery funds.  Deputy Haughey and others also suggested capping the jackpot.  Lottery sales are driven by the jackpot. If there were large jackpots on a regular basis it might be appropriate to do that, but that is not the case.  I would be reluctant to cap the jackpot. It is part of the fun and generates the most income for the fund.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked if lottery money is being well spent.  As Deputy Noonan and others said earlier, there is plenty of evidence in constituencies of where lottery money has been well spent.  Some projects have not been as successful as others, but by and large we get good value for money.  Lottery funding comes under the same general criteria as Government spending.  It is more controlled and open than in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring asked if the money allocated to the Irish language was going to Teilifís na Gaeilge or used for the promotion of the Irish language. None of the money from the national lottery goes to Teilifís na Gaeilge.  It is being used for the greater promotion and benefit of the Irish language. Deputy Cooper-Flynn raised an interesting point.  She referred to some schemes being more successful than others and suggested that we should display these schemes and present a merit award on an annual or biannual basis.  This might focus the public's mind on the innovativeness in the markeplace.  I may take this proposal on board.</P>
    <P>There was much discussion about funding for sport.  I do not believe Deputy Noonan meant to suggest it was not correct to provide a range of small clubs with small amounts of funding because such funding has had enormous benefit in local areas.  A case could be made for allocating large sums to build national stadia and so on.  The Morton stadium in Santry is an example in this regard.  The lottery has benefited major facilities for Gaelic games, soccer, badminton, boxing and athletics.  An Olympic standard 50 metre swimming pool would cost approximately £30 million and in excess of £500,000 per annum to operate. The question of the provision of such a pool is under consideration in the Department.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  This report will form the basis of the way <Col N="546" /> forward.  As Deputies are aware, it will perhaps require some amending legislation.  I am open to examining any worthwhile views or amendments which would improve the operation of the fund in the weeks and months ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to implement the World Health Organisation directive that all children be vaccinated against hepatitis B by means of universal mass vaccination and that such a vaccination programme be initiated by the end of 1997; and his views on whether hepatitis B is globally second only to tobacco smoking as a cause of cancer deaths.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15970/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation in Ireland to introduce hepatitis B vaccine into the primary childhood immunisation programme.  While the WHO has issued recommendations on hepatitis B immunisation, a number of northern European countries, including Ireland, where the incidence of hepatitis B is low, do not have plans to introduce this vaccine into their schedule at present.  Hepatitis B vaccine is available to all high risk categories, as recommended by the WHO.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, my Department identified a number of issues in relation to vaccination which required examination in the light of developments. These included the question of whether there should be routine hepatitis B vaccination for either infants or adolescents.  In July 1997 the chief medical officer requested the Royal College of Physicians to re-establish the National Immunisation Committee to review and, where necessary, update the recommendations in its document &ldquo;Immunisation Guidelines for Ireland&rdquo; produced in 1996.  The committee is expected to reconvene shortly.</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B is globally a very important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in the Asian and African regions.  This is not the case in Europe, where the disease is much less prevalent. Tobacco smoking is considered to be the major risk factor for preventable mortality in Europe. In Ireland, more than 6,000 deaths each year, both from cancer and other diseases, are directly attributable to smoking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dr. Gary Courtney, a consultant gastroenterologist in St. Luke's in Kilkenny, has said that complacency about the spread of hepatitis B is resulting in its increased incidence in Ireland?  Is he aware there are more than 3,000,000 carriers of hepatitis B worldwide?  Will he acknowledge that, with greater international mobility, it is inevitable there will be an annual increasing incidence of <Col N="547" /> hepatitis B and, therefore, it is in the interests of the health of our population that we seriously examine the introduction of a mass vaccination programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge what Deputy Shatter said about increased mobility in the modern world, but we are advised on these matters by the National Immunisation Committee, chaired by the former president of the Royal College of Physicians, Professor Stephen Doyle.  It is a multidisciplinary committee, the recommendations of which have been well received generally and have informed the national policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The production of guidelines last October was the culmination of approximately two and a half years' work.  The area of vaccination and immunisation is a fast moving one, both in terms of scientific developments relating to vaccines and the changing epidemiological picture in respect of a number of vaccine preventable diseases.  Therefore, a number of recent developments have, in the view of the chief medical officer of the Department, implications for our vaccination policy and require further review.</P>
      <P>Far from being complacent, the chief medical officer of the Department has asked the National Immunisation Committee to meet and to further review a number of developments, for example, in relation to the question of polio immunisation which needs to be reviewed in the context of the possible elimination of the wild virus from Europe over the next few years, and the continuation of the diphtheria epidemic in Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The question raised by Deputy Shatter of routine hepatitis B vaccination for infants or adolescents needs to be looked at again in the light of developments in this area.  The direct response to the Deputy is that, in view of these recent developments, the National Immunisation Committee will consider the matters in relation to hepatitis B, in addition to the other matters I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee needs to urgently look at this matter, particularly in the context of young people and adolescents.  Is the Minister aware that Dr. Deirdre Kelly, who is a director of the liver unit at the Birmingham Children's</P>
      <P>Hospital, said at a recent conference in Dublin that selective vaccinations of high risk groups had effectively failed as a strategy?  Is he aware she stated that high risk people may not be recognised in time as they are often reluctant to be identified, and there is no effective means of delivering vaccines to these groups?  There are inherent dangers in our delaying re-examining this issue in the context of the experiences of some other European countries in which, as I understand it, the possibility of mass vaccination is being reopened for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, it is not a question of delay.  The guidelines were finally drawn up in 1996 after two and a half year's work.  In July 1997 the chief medical officer took up the issue the Deputy raised today, among other matters relating to vaccination policy, and asked the National Immunisation Committee to advise us on this matter.  The chief medical officer has suggested the committee remains in existence as a standing committee to advise on vaccination policy issues in the future, so that there will be continuing monitoring of these issues.  I hope it will advise us as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying the World Health Organisation's view on the need for mass vaccination is wrong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The WHO position on vaccination against hepatitis B is outlined in the 1992 document, &ldquo;Expanded Programme of Immunisation&rdquo;, which states:</P>
      <P>Hepatitis B vaccines should be integrated into national immunisation programmes in all countries with a hepatitis B carrier prevalence of 8 per cent or greater by 1995, and in all countries by 1997.  Target groups and strategies may vary with the local epidemiology.  When carrier prevalence is 2 per cent greater, the most effective strategy is incorporation into the routine infant immunisation schedules.  Countries with lower prevalence may consider immunisation of all adolescents as an addition or alternative to infant immunisation.</P>
      <P>According to the WHO, the high risk groups consist of some groups of health personnel, patients on haemo-dialysis, haemophiliacs or recipients of blood products, clients in the psychiatric and mental handicap services, prison inmates and injectable drug users.  The WHO has recommended that in areas where there is a low prevalence of hepatitis B, the vaccine should be made available to sections of the population which run a high risk of infection.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that, while the presence of hepatitis B in Ireland is small, it is generally accepted that health care workers are at particular risk, the Department, as far back as 1988, wrote to all health agencies in which it was considered staff were at risk of infection and offered free vaccination to staff deemed by management to be at risk.  Following the 1996 guidelines, the Department wrote again in June 1997 to health boards and voluntary agencies, drawing their attention to the most up to date advice and stressing the importance of vaccination for &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; health care staff and clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clearly the case that we are vigilant in this matter.  It is untrue to say that the WHO is against simply providing immunisation for only high risk groups &mdash; it is very much dependent on the prevalence of the virus in the home community.  We are taking what are regarded as prudent and adequate steps, given the current level of prevalence. <Col N="549" /> In view of developments, some of which were mentioned by the Deputy, we are ensuring the National Immunisation Committee looks at this matter and provides us with its expert advice.</P>

      <P>The VHI board made a report to my predecessor which set out, in broad terms, its views regarding a change in its corporate structure. The report was the subject of discussion between officials of my Department and VHI senior management.  The arrangement made in these discussions was that VHI would submit detailed proposals on the changes it wished to see implemented with regard to its legal status.  I am aware that the board is working towards providing such proposals for my consideration at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I am open to considering the question of a strategic partnership in conjunction with the VHI board.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be appropriate, in the first instance, to address the issue of a change in the board's corporate status as this is likely to bear on how it should proceed in the matter of exploring a strategic partnership.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that these important and involved matters are currently receiving careful consideration in order that the interests of the VHI's 1.4 million members will be best served.</P>

      <P>I offer to the Minister and his colleagues my congratulations on their appointment and wish them well during their tenure in office.  The Minister will recall an exchange he had with the former Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, last March when he sought the then Minister's view on this issue.  He was clear as to the role of the then Minister in setting policy. Having listened to his reply I am unclear as to his current view.  The programme for Government commits the Government to considering a strategic alliance or partnership.  Does the Minister believe that is a good thing and what potential benefits does he see for such a policy?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy and reciprocate his sentiments with regard to his and Deputy Shatter's spokesmanships.  I wish them both well.</P>
      <P>The Government will set the policy and will make decisions in this area.  I have indicated that before coming to a final decision, the VHI board is due to give me its detailed proposals within the next few weeks as to how it sees the future.  I am also insisting, as I have stated publicly since I became Minister, that all options be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that it will not only be the view of the VHI that will be considered, <Col N="550" /> although that should be given its due weight.  We must also ensure that there is an assessment of all the options.  We must be conscious of the fact that a change in the VHI's corporate status, which is the first issue to be addressed, could involve it in the removal of its exemption under the EU third non-life insurance directive and from the requirement to comply with EU regulations for the authorisations of insurance undertakings.</P>
    <P>One of the main advantages seen by the VHI as deriving from a change in corporate status involves freedom from legislative constraints with resulting commercial autonomy and the capacity to enter alliances with suitable partners on other health care products.  I have asked VHI management to be aware that we are open in the Department and in Government to considering any developed proposals it makes on the matter of a strategic alliance.  When that comes to hand I will take it into account.  I will also take other views into account and make a decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>All options will be considered by me.  I do not have any ideological hang-ups as others seem to have.  I am interested in ensuring that the VHI provides the most competitive private health insurance it can for its 1.4 million customers, which is their main concern.  I will not close off options.</P>
      <P>There was an ideological battle, or certainly a confusion, in the last Administration regarding this issue which meant that nothing was looked at.  Upon my appointment as Minister I had to sanction a premium increase.  I said at the time, and it remains my position, that we must address the fundamental issues within the VHI.  We must ensure that it has the commercial freedom to operate in a new competitive environment.  It now has BUPA to contend with in this market.</P>
      <P>I will look at all the options dispassionately and objectively, get the best possible advice and decide on the best way forward for the VHI.  I am not ruling anything in or out.</P>

      <Quest>when the necessary commencement order will be made to bring into operation the statutory tribunal for the payment of compensation to the victims of hepatitis C; the reason for the delay in making the required order; and whether regulations prescribing the procedure applicable for bringing claims before the tribunal in accordance with provisions of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997 have been prepared.</Quest>

      <P>The preparatory work on the regulations and the settlement arrangements under section 8 of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, which is being carried out by my Department, the Attorney General's Office and the compensation tribunal is almost complete. These regulations will cover, <i>inter alia,</i> the establishment of the statutory tribunal, the establishment of the reparation fund and matters relating to costs and expenses.  Although it is not necessary to have settlement arrangements under section 8 in place in order to establish the statutory compensatory tribunal, it is my intention that on the establishment day, all benefits accruing to claimants will be immediately available.</P>
      <P>The procedures for bringing claims before the statutory tribunal will not, in general, require regulations as they primarily involve administrative arrangements which will be made by the tribunal itself.  In this regard, new application forms have been prepared and printed which will incorporate the range of options available to claimants under the Act.</P>
      <P>I understand that many claimants will wish to claim from the reparation fund which will give them automatic entitlement to an amount of 20 per cent of their tribunal award.  The reparation fund will be established on the same day as the statutory tribunal and I understand that procedures for claims and payments from the fund will be straightforward and that the tribunal will notify all claimants, including those who have already had their claims determined by the non-statutory tribunal, of their entitlements as soon as possible, inviting them to claim from the reparation fund or to choose one of the other options available under the Act.  Payments from the reparation fund will be made automatically on foot of such claims where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that on 16 September last I amended clause one of the non-statutory compensation scheme.  The effect of the <Col N="552" /> amendment was to allow access to the non-statutory compensation tribunal to persons who, in particular circumstances, appeared to have contracted hepatitis C from the administration of blood or blood products outside the State.  At this point I am aware of only one such case.  However, in the interests of fairness I consider that sufficient time should be made available to allow any other person who might be covered by the amended clause to make a claim.</P>
    <P>I will be in touch with the four groups representing those person eligible to make claims to the tribunal within the next week or so to discuss the draft regulations, the settlement arrangements under section 8 and procedural matters relating to the making of claims.  Following these discussions it is my intention to sign the commencement order bringing the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act, 1997, into operation.  At that stage, all the necessary arrangements will be in place to allow claimants their full range of entitlements under the Act.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister understand and accept that all of those who can make claims are anxious that the statutory tribunal be established as rapidly as possible and that while delays are occurring the health of people is deteriorating? Does he accept that it is important that the tribunal commences work this month on the statutory basis as provided for under the 1997 Act and that there is concern that, almost five months after the Act was put on the Statute Book, the necessary regulations and commencement order have not yet been made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but two issues were involved.  The first was the amendment of clause 1 and the delay involved in finding out if there were any others in those circumstances, apart from the case of which I was aware. If so, they should have the opportunity to claim. The second issue was to ensure that the settlement procedures were in place.  It was technically unnecessary in terms of the Act to put it on a statutory basis, for it to be the same as the section 8 procedures.  However, to avoid any confusion, I considered it best to deal with everything together to ensure the full range of entitlements <Col N="553" /> were available from day one.  Subject to discussions with the interested parties, although I do not anticipate any major problem, it should be possible to proceed with the commencement order.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware some of those who have suffered from hepatitis C claim the Department has reneged on promises to provide state of the art treatment and that it is downgrading its commitment to their cause?  There is a specific concern that several consultants around the country who are experts on hepatitis C are not available to the victims at present and that the necessary teams are not always available to them.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the type of medical care which the previous Government and the Minister when he was in Opposition stated should and would be made available to all sufferers of hepatitis C, will continue to be made available to them?</P>

I am anxious to ensure those who have suffered as a result of this appalling matter find that their after care services are what one would expect, given the magnitude of the wrong done to them.  I hope to deal with those issues at the meeting next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department continues to monitor developments in the United States regarding litigation against tobacco companies. <Col N="554" /> The Deputy will be aware that individual states in the US have used a number of legal bases in pursuing cases, some of which are based on specific federal and state statutes.  The outcome of the US litigation is also being considered by other EU member states and there are obvious advantages in harmonising our actions with any initiatives which may emerge at EU level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any initiative on this matter will entail a great deal of preparation and careful assessment of the strategy to be pursued.  I assure the Deputy this matter will continue to receive a high level of priority in my Department's work programme in close consultation with health boards and other relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>What data or information is currently available in the Department in relation to expenditure incurred in treating tobacco related diseases and illnesses?  Has any computation been undertaken of the cost to the State borne by the taxpayer in providing medical treatment to those affected by tobacco related illnesses?  In the context of the Minister's reply to Question No. 1, where he confirmed there are more than 6,000 deaths annually in the State from tobacco related illness such as cancer, emphysema and heart disease, does he agree it is time to declare war on the tobacco companies in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have with me the detailed data the Deputy requested but I will ensure that he receives the information which is available.</P>
      <P>We must evaluate the position.  A detailed legal appraisal of the likely evidential requirements of Irish courts will be required.  A key question could be whether the courts would accept epidemiological evidence as opposed to taking specific evidence.  An insistence on the latter would rule out any type of consolidated or class action. Regarding the actions already taken, many of the states in the US used alleged breaches of domestic anti-trust laws to pursue the tobacco companies. Such breaches included anti-competitive pricing arrangements, failure to conduct adequate research on dangerous products and failure to develop safer products.  It has also been argued in the US that tobacco companies were responsible for inducing tobacco related diseases and states had the expense of treating these.  The companies were therefore unjustifiably enriched at the states' expense.  This was the basis for a successful action in America.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the successful claims are a relatively recent development.  We should try to harmonise the issue at EU level and work with our health boards and voluntary agencies on this matter.  We need to appraise what would be required in Irish courts in terms of taking a successful action.  I have no problem in principle beginning that task.  However, it is important to carry out the necessary preparatory work so that we do not end up doing unfocused work that has no chance of success.</P>

Is he aware that in a reply to a written question yesterday I was told by the Department that no data of any nature exists regarding the cost to taxpayers of treating tobacco related illnesses? Does the Minister agree, given that litigation in this area commenced some time ago in the United States and that 17 states are currently litigating against tobacco companies, it is time his Government woke up to this issue and took a more active approach?</P>
      <P>Does he agree our current strategies to discourage children and young people from smoking have failed abysmally?  In common with the United States, the tobacco companies have contrived to sell cigarettes illegally to young people, who are becoming nicotine addicts, and they have concealed research.  Does the Minister accept the legal position with regard to the facility of the State, through the Department of Health and Children and health boards, to sue tobacco companies for large scale damages is in effect no different from the legal system under which the 17 states operate in America?</P>

No work has been done on this issue since I took office on 23 June, but no work was done on it in the previous two and a half years when this matter was ongoing in the US.  We should not be pedantic about this issue.  Successful actions have been taken by Attorneys General in various states in America. We are taking cognisance of that and we are considering how this issue can be addressed and if it would be possible to recoup damages against tobacco companies in this country.

I got the distinct impression from it that not a great deal of work is being done on this matter but perhaps I am wrong.  Has the Minister asked the Attorney General for advice on whether a case would lie in normal civil law or under statute in Ireland?  Is the Minister aware that several health boards have indicated they would like to take a <Col N="556" /> case?  Has he been in touch with the Western Health Board, which has indicated its intention of taking a case?</P>

This is a matter I will take up.  The Attorney General is aware of the situation and has been asked to evaluate it and report back to me with preliminary advice.  Detailed preparatory work will have to be done.  I am aware of recent media reports of a call by some members of the Western Health Board for the board to seek legal advice in regard to taking unilateral action against tobacco companies. When my officials contacted the chief executive officer he stated his preferred option would be to consider the matter jointly with other health boards or for the matter to be considered centrally.  The preliminary consideration will be central and we will take the matter from there.</P>

Will the Minister agree it is undesirable that this State sit back and do nothing to co-ordinate a policy on this issue between all member states?  Will the Minister give an undertaking that he will arrange for the Attorney General's office and any other legal advisers the Minister may wish to consult about this issue, to make direct contact with the appropriate law officers in the states of Illinois, Mississippi, Minnesota, West Virginia, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland, Washington, Connecticut, Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma and New Jersey, all of which are successfully processing litigation against tobacco companies and which have resulted in the opening of talks in the context of multi-billion pound settlements being entered into by tobacco companies?</P>

      <P>At present cardiac surgery is provided at two centres, the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital.  From the latest information available to me, the total number of patients awaiting cardiac surgery stands at 1,598.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional cardiac surgery facilities is a matter of urgent national importance and one which will require significant capital and revenue investment in the next few years.  The policy decision to locate a third cardiac surgery unit at St. James's Hospital was based on the recommendations of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group and was announced a matter of days before my appointment as Minister.</P>
      <P>On taking office, I undertook to examine the report of the cardiac surgery option appraisal group to satisfy myself in relation to the policy basis for this major service development.  The question of the provision of cardiac care services overall is under review.  An announcement will be made on the location of additional cardiac care services when this review is complete.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1.6 million is being made available under the 1997 waiting list initiative specifically for cardiac patients, adults and children.  As in 1996, the main aim is to reduce the existing national cardiac surgery lists.  The Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures and the selection of suitable patients for medical cardiac therapies.  High standards of evaluation and audit will be applied to the initiative.  Participating agencies will be required to demonstrate clearly how the additional activity has impacted upon existing waiting lists and a full report will be required from each hospital on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Cardiac Surgery Option Appraisal Group did recommend that the unit be located in St. James's Hospital.  However, I am seeking to formulate a national cardiac care policy similar to the cancer strategy adopted by my predecessor in relation to the other big killer disease. <Col N="560" /> I have taken it upon myself to study that report and consult the hospitals involved.  That review is almost complete and I will be making a decision shortly on the matter to ensure that we have sufficient and adequate numbers of prospective operations to deal with the existing backlog.</P>

There is currently an average waiting time of two to three years for cardiac surgery in the Mater Hospital which, as of today, has 1,459 people on the waiting list and an average waiting time of 12 months in cardiology for angiograms and angioplasty with over 830 people on that waiting list. Therefore, will the Minister acknowledge that it is indefensible to cancel a decision made by the previous Government and to delay the processing and the construction of this unit by a period of five months for party-political reasons, and still not be able to tell the House that he is proceeding to provide this unit in St. James's Hospital?</P>

If the Deputy is suggesting that this should not be a consideration for a Minister, I have to disagree with him.  I am evaluating the situation on a national basis to make sure that the waiting lists in all areas are properly dealt with and that if more than one site is required we will go ahead and provide more than one.  That review is almost complete.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the appraisal group did not consider this issue on a national basis?  Will he not acknowledge that the appraisal group considered all the available options in the context of the national need, not simply the need within the Eastern Health Board area?  Will he now acknowledge, having considered the appraisal group's report for a period of five months, that his accusation that the decision of his predecessor, Deputy Michael Noonan, to make St. James's Hospital the site of the extra cardiac unit was a politically motivated decision was incorrect and that it was a decision to implement the objective recommendation of the appraisal group?  Will the Minister not acknowledge that if he is considering providing additional capacity beyond the 500 unit proposal of the appraisal group, and if he is considering providing it elsewhere in the country, there is no reason he cannot sanction the St. James's Hospital development and at a future date sanction any further proposal that he deems appropriate? What he has effectively done is to put this issue in limbo and the construction of this unit on hold unnecessarily to the detriment of the health service and to the detriment of those who require cardiac surgery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 47 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>In the time available it has not been possible to obtain the detailed information requested by the Deputy.  I am, however, arranging to have as much information as possible collected and will forward it to him at an early date.  Information for 1996, however, indicates that there were 60 babies born to drug misusers in the Rotunda Hospital, 50 at the Coombe Hospital and 30 at the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street, a total of 140 babies.</P>
      <P>While the Dublin maternity hospitals catered for approximately 38 per cent of total births in 1996 it would be expected that they would in fact cater for the vast majority of the babies born with a drug addiction because of the concentration of heroin addiction in the Dublin area.  According to information published by the Central Statistics Office, the number of births registered here has increased annually since 1994.  In 1994 the number of births registered was 47,929; in 1995 it was 48,530; and in 1996 it were 50,390.  The annual birth rate per thousand of the population has also increased since 1994.  In 1994 the number of live births per thousand was 13.4; in 1995 it was 13.5; and in 1996 it was 13.9. Maternity hospitals are reporting a continuing increase in the number of births in 1997 and no evidence of a reduction in this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board is conscious of the need for the collection of better information on the issue of pregnant mothers who are misusing drugs.  The board has been in contact with the three main Dublin maternity hospitals and is working on the development during 1997 of routine data collection from these sources as part of a broader data base on drug misuse.  This will <Col N="563" /> enable the health board to target its services more effectively at areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>The board, as part of its overall development plan to significantly progress the development of treatment services has identified a number of key areas where resources are needed.  One such area is the care of pregnant drug misusers, and the board has been in discussion with the maternity hospitals concerning the provision of back-up services to babies born with drug-related symptoms and their mothers.  Following these consultations the board is now in the process of appointing drug liaison midwives to operate between the three maternity hospitals and drug treatment services. These nurse-midwives will be responsible for all pregnant drug misusers from the initial point of contact with the treatment services.  The midwives will work between ante-natal and post-natal clinics as well as in hospital wards and will also liaise between drug treatment clinics and public health nurses as part of a follow-up process. The midwives will be involved in assisting patients to attend gynaecological clinics for follow-up, family planning and post-delivery care and will work closely with social services around child care issues in the early postnatal period and up to six months post-delivery.  This service will be overseen by a consultant psychiatrist.</P>
    <P>The board also plans to set up a special gynaecological clinic at a drug treatment clinic to provide family planning services to those women wishing to avail of this service.  The board has also put in place an in-patient stabilisation programme for pregnant drug misusers at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board in expanding its drug treatment services is conscious of the needs of the various groups of misusers and will continue to improve its service provision in all areas to ensure that adequate facilities are put in place for those who need them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of babies born to drug misusers in the greater Dublin area where few services are available for drug addicts appears to be on the increase.  This is a worrying development. Has an assessment been carried out to identify the needs of the professional support services and to ensure there are sufficient staff available? What mechanisms have been put in place to address any problems identified?  This matter merits priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a worrying rise in the number of babies born to drug misusers in the Eastern Health Board area in recent years. This has placed an increased burden on maternity hospitals as the babies require special attention and need to be kept in hospital longer, usually in intensive care units, to be detoxified.  The Eastern Health Board is to appoint drug liaison midwives to assist pregnant drug misusers throughout their pregnancy to minimise the effects on their babies. This will help to reduce the strain on hospital <Col N="564" /> resources at the time of birth.  The Department is in consultation with the hospitals concerned to identify the other resources they require.  This is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely serious that such a large number of babies are being born to drug misusers.  I am surprised the Minister has not mentioned the role general practitioners can play. I would have thought the general practitioner is the person closest to the pregnant mother.  I welcome the fact that at hospital level services are being developed in a targeted way but the Minister must be aware that general practitioners are experiencing difficulties in providing treatment services to drug addicts who are their patients. For example, in relation to the drug budgeting scheme the prescribing of methadone has an impact on general practitioners' budgets.  Why is the Minister not considering developing further the services that can be provided by general practitioners who are already closely involved in providing ante-natal and post-natal services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to the services available in maternity hospitals and the resources that need to be provided but I take the Deputy's point that the general practitioner is an important link in the chain in providing an adequate service to pregnant drug misusers.  I do not have the information the Deputy sought but I will contact her directly on the role health boards see general practitioners playing in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will this matter be central to the work of the interdepartmental committee to which the Minister referred?  How does the Department plan to counter heavy cigarette smoking among young women and pregnant mothers in particular on whom it has a negative impact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to consider whether the health promotion unit's targeted prevention programmes are meeting with the required success.  I would like it to produce anti-addiction programmes which will have the required impact.  We should seek to involve in this process those who have suffered from an addiction, to warn school-going children and communities of the dangers to which the Deputy referred.  On the interdepartmental committee, Deputy Flood is the Minister of State directly responsible.  The arrangements being made in maternity hospitals form part of his brief.  He is aware of the work being done at health board level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister is primarily responsible for treatment services.  Given the low success rate in treating addiction and the increased emphasis on the importance of prevention and rehabilitation programmes, is the Minister liaising with the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, to ensure sufficient funding is allocated to the area task forces?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy on that point.  The Cabinet subcommittee on social exclusion, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, is a member, is meeting as we speak under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach.  Its function is to ensure policies are co-ordinated so that they have the required impact in the areas where drug addiction is most prevalent and social exclusion is a factor.  Despite the availability of increased resources the emphasis has been on treatment services to the detriment of good health promotion and illness prevention programmes.  We have to be vigilant and try to boost budgets in health promotion areas so that not all our money is spent on the illness aspect.  We must have an impact on people's responsibility to live a healthy lifestyle.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied that services are co-ordinated in so far as is possible to enable children to be taken temporarily into care or to obtain orders to supervise the care given by mothers to babies at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is outside the scope of the question, which was technical and sought various details.  If a detailed question is submitted I can give a more comprehensive reply to the Deputy's query; it is an issue that deserves attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the appointment of midwives in the Eastern Health Board region, where the shortage of such staff is very serious. The Minister referred to other resources and supports that are required.  Will he communicate to me what resources and supports have been identified as being required by each hospital and when they will be put in place?  Due to the impact this has on the services of the maternity hospitals, the Minister should ensure that an appropriate budget is allocated in l998 to deal with this and the issue of drugs in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with the Deputy.  Consultation is continuing between the hospitals and the health boards as to what other resources are required arising from this increasing phenomenon.  I hope the Eastern Health Board will give this the priority it deserves as it is becoming increasingly problematic in its region. The overall allocation is my responsibility and I hope the board takes cognisance of the trend so that adequate resources are provided for these vulnerable people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 21 together.  As Deputies will be aware from the lengthy consultation and public debate process which was previously engaged in, the issue of mandatory reporting of child abuse is very complex.  The Deputy will also be aware that the principal aim of mandatory reporting is to improve the reporting of child abuse so that all cases come to the attention of the authorities as quickly as possible in order to allow intervention in the interests of the child. This will be my focus rather than a narrow focus on legislative change.  I am aware of fears that an over-legalistic approach could be counter-productive and could drive the problem underground so that less abuse would be reported.</P>
      <P>I propose putting in place agreed protocols on reporting of child abuse by professionals who of course already have a duty of care to their clients. I assure the House that the relevant professional groups will be fully consulted in this regard.  Arising from the extensive consultation process on mandatory reporting last year, the previous Government announced a series of initiatives to strengthen arrangements for reporting child abuse and to generally promote and protect the rights of children.  I intend to progress these worthwhile initiatives and to build on them.  I am confident that these measures, together with continued investment in our child care services, will help to ensure an effective response to vulnerable children in our society.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Currie on the fine work he did in this area as my predecessor and I hope to continue with this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his kind remarks about my performance, and I congratulate him on his appointment.  I wish him the best of luck with some very sensitive decisions he will have to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not quite understand his reply.  Is it his intention not to introduce mandatory reporting? If so, that is a wise decision.  He has referred to the consultative process that was engaged in.  I published a discussion paper, &ldquo;Putting Children First&rdquo;, and there were more than 180 submissions as a result of that paper, the majority of which were against mandatory reporting.  Is the Minister of State aware that at a forum held in Malahide the vast majority of the 400 professionals attending opposed mandatory reporting?  That <Col N="567" /> figure included those who are in daily contact with abused children, such as social workers and public health nurses.  Those people's views should be taken into consideration more than those removed from the problem.  Is the gist of the Minister of State's reply that he will not be introducing mandatory reporting?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objective is to improve reporting on child abuse.  That is the objective of mandatory reporting.  We propose introducing protocols for professionals rather than legislation. I agree with the Deputy and urge caution regarding past proposals that apply a simplistic, prescriptive, legal solution to a very complex problem.</P>
      <P>Consequently, my priority is to establish how existing arrangements for reporting child abuse can be enhanced and how a climate which encourages the reporting of child abuse can be fostered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between what is in the programme for Government and what the Minister of State proposes.  Is he aware that <Col N="568" /> protocols already exist?  For example, I brought in an agreement between the health boards and the Garda for the investigation of abuse cases, which was a form of administrative mandatory reporting.  Mandatory reporting, as we understood it until now, is different from that which the Minister suggested.  I notice he did not attempt to define what he meant by abuse.  Will he include emotional as well physical abuse?  What type of protocol will he introduce in that regard?  What is the position on underage sex and the reporting and consequences of that?  What is the position of professionals who rely, to a large extent, on confidentiality?  If they do not have that confidentiality, they will face a serious problem and we may see abuse cases going underground.  These are only some of the questions which must be answered.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister has come out against mandatory reporting.  That is effectively what he has done, so why will he not admit it? Will the Minister admit that following the work done on this matter and the consultation that has taken place, and given the opinion in his Department, the mind of the Government has been changed?  If he does so, there will be a huge sigh of relief among those in the front line in relation to child abuse.  The fear that the system will be clogged will be removed and time will not be taken up investigating complaints many of which have no firm basis, as in the experience in other countries, and some of which are made for the wrong reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>We wish to improve existing procedures for reporting child abuse.  We propose to build on the work outlined by the Deputy and have ruled out the possibility of legislation.  We are developing child care services to ensure children and professionals may report abuse in the knowledge that the appropriate investigation will take place quickly and effectively, that proper treatment will be provided and that proper support services will be available to victims and families at risk.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, all types of abuse come under this heading.  An issue about which I have become convinced since being appointed to the Department of Health is that the gap between the haves and the have nots has grown too wide. The amount of mental and physical abuse, neglect, brutality and aggression which thousands of children suffer cannot be tolerated any longer. Too many of our children live in abject poverty, belong to dysfunctional families and are psychologically homeless.  These issues are my priority. The priority for the famous Celtic Tiger must be to look after children who are seriously at risk. There is no doubt about the problem with which we must deal.  We are not running away from the problem and are dealing with it in a straightforward way and anybody trying to introduce confusion is doing a disservice.</P>

      <P>Ministers always have their own style.  Is it the Minister's style to ignore his expert group and that of the Minister of State to ignore the Government programme which clearly states that mandatory reporting will be introduced?  Is the Minister abandoning that plan by opting for a protocol procedure?  What happens if a professional ignores a protocol?  How does one make it mandatory?  Before the general election, Government TDs attended meetings throughout the country at which they gave undertakings that they would introduce mandatory reporting of child abuse if returned to Government.  I am thinking specifically of Fianna Fáil TDs.  Will the Minister provide them with a protocol to advise them on how to deal with the questions they will be asked when news gets out that mandatory reporting is not on the cards?  I have reservations about mandatory reporting.</P>

      <P>I do not see why the Deputy is so concerned since the information I gave is in accordance with her prerogatives and the priorities of those who have spoken.  There is nothing wrong with introducing a series of protocols to strengthen existing procedures.  As regards sanctions against professionals, we are satisfied the job being done by professionals is as good as that which can be done given the resources available to them.  There is no question of sanctions.  There is an unambiguous consensus among professionals on the need for the most effective reporting mechanisms.  My priority is to improve the services and the resources available to enable the reporting procedure and, more importantly, the response, to be as effective as possible.</P>

I am sure the Minister must be aware there is often conflict between reporting and treatment.</P>

The Minister will be aware the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government referred to key priorities, including mandatory reporting of child abuse.  Has the Minister discussed his dramatic U-turn &mdash; turning his face against mandatory reporting &mdash; with his Progressive Democrats colleagues?  Will he acknowledge that the only circumstance in which reporting is mandatory is if legislation imposes an obligation on professionals to report?  In the absence of legislation, protocols have no mandatory impact whatsoever.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few months large numbers of jobs have been lost because of competition from low labour cost countries flooding markets with manufactured items leaving Irish companies vulnerable and unable to compete.</P>
      <P>I raise this issue specifically because in my home county of Leitrim we are about to lose over 100 jobs in temporary lay-offs next week and, if the markets do not improve, we could lose up to 310 jobs in ensuing months.  While that would be a serious blow to any large town or county, County Leitrim would be devastated by such an enormous loss of manufacturing jobs which would also result in the loss of an additional 100 jobs in service industries.</P>
      <P>Companies like WOCCO in Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballinamore Textiles are experiencing great difficulty in sourcing markets abroad and this is placing all their jobs at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> I call on the Minister, in order to give hope to the many people nationwide whose jobs are being placed at risk, to implement immediately a financial package to help save these companies and source markets for them.  Job creation is an important element of any Government policy but the retention of existing jobs is equally important.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Richard Bruton was Minister for Enterprise and Employment he introduced a scheme giving companies extra incentives to locate outside of Dublin and other large cities, which policy was most welcome and forward-looking.</P>
    <P>It behoves the present Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to devise a specific policy to save existing jobs, particularly those in the manufacture of textiles and other products which have been subjected to enormous pressure from low labour cost countries.</P>
    <P>Ballinamore Textiles established a manufacturing outlet in my home town 25 years ago and instead of celebrating that fact, unfortunately, it now finds that it must lay off 60 people temporarily. It is a company that always has been a great supporter of our local community, its management team all residing locally.  Its manager, Mr. Hugh Murphy, is one my longest and oldest friends who, unlike most of his contemporaries on finishing school in the late seventies, was not forced to board the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>Is it not ironic that at a time when our economy was never in better shape &mdash; described as the Celtic tiger &mdash; 160 jobs will be lost in Ballinamore if the Government does not take some immediate action to help such companies by way of financial assistance?</P>
    <P>It is also my understanding that if those companies want to diversify their operations and install different or additional plant and machinery State agencies are unwilling to help.  I find that incredible.  Such companies seek markets in other manufacturing sectors, yet State agencies are unwilling to assist them, something to which the Minister and the Government will have to devote their immediate attention.  They must introduce policies to give the people of Leitrim and other counties the help they need in creating additional jobs and retaining existing ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised here by Deputy Gerard Reynolds brings sharply into focus the need for Irish enterprise to both maintain and improve its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Through prudent management of the economy and better budgeting discipline, the competitive environment for Irish enterprise has been improved considerably, for example, business taxation has been kept at modest rates; competition law has been strengthened; our infrastructure has been significantly improved with financial support from the EU; our long-term investment in education is now paying off; and through consensus with the social partners we have a more flexible and competitive labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> However, we cannot afford to be complacent. We must continue the drive to improve our competitiveness to enable us to meet both the opportunities and the competitive challenges worldwide in an increasingly open and global marketplace.</P>
    <P>One of the first initiatives of the Tánaiste as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was to meet members of the National Competitiveness Council at their inaugural meeting in June and to set them, on behalf of the Government, the important task of ascertaining how we can realise our fullest potential and step up our competitive position in global terms.</P>
    <P>In formulating our programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, we set out our key priorities for the development of enterprise over the coming years many of which are aimed specifically at assisting Irish enterprise exploit the opportunities and meet the increasing competitiveness of the global marketplace.  These include progressive changes in the corporation tax regime to secure a standard rate of 10 per cent by the year 2010; the utilisation of the tax system, including capital taxes, to encourage entrepreneurship; delivering a client centred approach in the State's interface with business and streamlining structures and programmes to help deliver increased competition and jobs; keeping the concerns and growth potential of the small business and services sector to the top of the political agenda and the development of a new system of traineeships and the examination of the future role and structures of FÁS.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness is determined by a range of factors, both cost and non-cost based.  Securing an improvement in cost competitiveness, which includes a stable macro-economic environment, is essential but not entirely sufficient for maintaining long-term competitiveness.</P>
    <P>In the medium to long term competitive strengths require above all a capacity to innovate, develop new products, access new markets, apply new technology, introduce best management practise and develop skill levels across the labour force.  Building the capacity of indigenous enterprises is central to this important issue of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>Significant financial and other supports are available to Irish firms through the development agencies of the Department, across the range of firms' functional activities from marketing to training and production.  These are helping companies improve their performance and capability to meet competitive pressures whether from low cost countries or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>An Bord Tráchtála, whose total annual budget exceeds £40 million, provides assistance to firms for the marketing of Irish goods and services.  It provides a range of support services and in-market activities positioned to respond to the needs of client companies in growing their international business.  An Bord Tráchtála also provides direct financial assistance to companies with potential and commitment to substantial export growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> An Bord Tráchtálta recently launched new services to assist companies improve their competitive position in the marketplace.  A new products programme assists manufacturers to develop new products for export markets through financial support and sourcing.  Trend forecasting services assist manufacturers to keep up to date on clothing trends in Europe and the US and plan their production 12 months in advance.</P>
    <P>Options open to companies under competitive pressure arising from increasing competition from low labour cost countries which would enable them to remain viable in the medium to longer term range from identifying new market opportunities, including niche markets, where price is not the primary source of competitive advantage &mdash; assistance to firms in this respect is primarily the responsibility of An Bord Tráchtála; improving their own competitiveness by becoming as efficient and as effective as possible across the whole business system by developing new products and processes which enable them compete successfully in new and existing markets, and identifying new sources of competitive advantage based on innovation, services just in time delivery and design.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter and I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, for coming into the House to deal with it.</P>
      <P>This week is the 40th anniversary of the nuclear disaster at Windscale and it is appropriate that Ireland restates its non-nuclear status and renews its dedication to the closure of the THORP nuclear complex at Sellafield and also the closure of the aging Magnox reactors which are now well past their sell-by date.  Ireland should do this not only because of its objection to the nuclear power and arms industries but because of the real and measurable transboundary consequences for the health and wellbeing of the Irish people, with new evidence on this coming to hand this week.</P>
      <P>What do we get from the Government on this anniversary week of the Windscale disaster? First, the Government and the Minister refused to re-establish the ministerial committee on Sellafield or bring together the expert group from all concerned Departments set up by the previous Government which gave a focus and a clear agenda to Government actions concerning the nuclear threat.  Second, the Government decided to renege on its firm commitment to fully fund the legal case being taken by the Dundalk residents against British Nuclear Fuels and offered a paltry sum in final and total settlement which would not cover even one item of the required research.</P>
      <P>I have sincere sympathy for the Minister of State who has been saddled with the implementation of this betrayal of the people of Dundalk. This inaction by the Government on the anniversary of Windscale will send a clear signal to the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> British authorities and British Nuclear Fuels that Howlin and Stagg are no longer in office and that their old friends in Fianna Fáil will not cause them any trouble &mdash; they certainly never caused them any trouble before.</P>
    <P>To crown this disastrous week for Ireland in terms of nuclear matter, there was a nuclear incident at Dublin Airport yesterday.  Will the Minister outline the form and nature of the material involved, its place of origin, destination and purpose, if the authorities became alarmed and the action taken by them?  Will he agree that such highly dangerous and volatile material should be surface transported only given the danger of damage to large numbers of people in the event of an air accident?  In light of the latter point, will he review the safety regime of such transport and limit the entry to Ireland of nuclear materials to the type required for medical purposes only?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline his position on the over-flying of Ireland by planes carrying nuclear material or stopping over with such material? Will he put in train the mechanism to file a difference with the ICAO technical instructions which would prevent the carriage of nuclear materials in our airspace and give Ireland a legal basis for such desirable action?  Other countries have already done this.  I am sure the Minister agrees that, despite the best safety regulations and the most careful regime, as long as human beings are involved accidents will occur.  When nuclear materials are involved such accidents can have disastrous consequences.  The only way to ensure safety from such accidents is to disallow transport of the material into and across the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for giving me the opportunity to clarify for the House the position regarding the consignment in question.</P>
      <P>The carriage by air of dangerous goods, including radioactive materials, is governed by regulations laid down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  Under ICAO regulations, consignments by air of such goods must be packed, labelled, stored and loaded in accordance with the ICAO technical instructions.  These regulations have been adopted by all airlines and by national aviation authorities, including the Irish Aviation Authority which is responsible for regulating the safety of aviation in Ireland.  This includes regulation of the carriage by air of dangerous goods in Irish airspace.  Aer Lingus is approved in accordance with international standards set down by the ICAO for the purpose of carrying dangerous goods, including radioactive materials in limited quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On yesterday's incident, I understand that in the unloading of freight at Dublin Airport from an Aer Lingus flight from Paris a package containing a technetium-99m generator was damaged. As a result transit passengers to Cork were brought to the airport terminal to wait for the availability of another aircraft to bring them to their destination.  On being notified of the incident <Col N="576" /> an inspector from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland immediately visited the site.  The inspector carried out careful measurements of the package and was satisfied that the damage was only to the container and there was no damage to the device.  It was also determined that there was no radiation contamination of the area arising from the incident.  The incident occurred when the package containing the generator was placed on the flat area of the belt loader. Movement of the loader brought it into contact with the package which was damaged.  The packaging of the technetium generator complies with the regulations laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has carried radioactive materials on many of the scheduled services on its network of routes.  The overwhelming majority of such consignments have very low radioactivity and are used by hospitals in the treatment of cancer and other such illnesses.  At present 19 hospitals are licensed to use technetium generators which are used to produce technetium-99m, which is the most widely used radionuclide in nuclear medicine examinations.  It is used in these hospitals in the diagnosis of disease by enabling the imaging of internal organs.  The transport of such materials is a vital element in the medical treatment of some of the illnesses to which I referred.</P>
    <P>There are strict regulations governing the transport of radioactive materials and the clearly defined and tested packaging required.  I understand from Aer Lingus that there has been no incident of spillage of radioactive materials while they were being processed or handled by Aer Lingus.  Yesterday's incident demonstrated the benefit of the regulations because while the packaging was affected during the unloading of the shipment from the aircraft the damage only occurred to the outer packaging.  The inner packaging, which contained the radioactive material, was intact, perfectly safe and undamaged.  I am satisfied that the shipper, the airline, the airport authority and the RPII reacted promptly to this incident in accordance with procedures.</P>
    <P>Any such incident will generate public concern and the RPII is at present awaiting a full report from Aer Lingus and the consignee.  However, I would be disturbed if the incident were to cause undue alarm to such an extent that demands were made to prohibit the transport of such cargo. Such a response would be excessive in respect of material which is of such importance to medical procedures here.  I will follow up the matter with the RPII and the IAA when consideration of the incident by both bodies has been completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms M. McGennis</NameTxt>
      <P>The participation of GPs and, by inference, chemists in the maintenance <Col N="577" /> programme for recovering addicts is a vital component in the provision of support to drug users who want to kick the drug habit, but urgent action is required when that service appears not to ease but to spread the problem.</P>
      <P>I became aware of a number of cases in my constituency but one, in particular, that has got out of hand.  It concerns a chemist, Boles, in the Inchicore area, which has received a good deal of media attention during the week.  It appears that recovering addicts are travelling miles to that chemist to get their physeptone and methadone. Residents in the area claim that on numerous occasions they saw addicts come out of the chemist with litre bottles of methadone and pass it around.  They also claim that what was a very peaceful main street has now become a no go area and they are fearful for their safety.</P>
      <P>I brought this to the attention of the health board and the Garda, but that is simply fire brigade action.  What is required is the type of safeguards I presume the report will recommend. When I became aware of the position in Inchicore and in another part of Ballyfermot I wrote to the Eastern Health Board and the reply I received from its programme manager states:</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is concerned at certain aspects of methadone prescribing in the region at the moment and these concerns were brought to the attention of the Department of Health following a lengthy debate on the issue at the November 1996 meeting of our Board. A group has been sitting in the Dept of Health comprising representatives of the Dept of Health, Eastern Health Board, the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland with a brief to produce guidelines on the prescribing and dispensing of methadone that will enable badly needed services to happen in a safe and effective manner.  I have been a member of that group myself and our work is just completed. My understanding is that the report is being brought to the attention of the new Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>I support the programme manager's recommendation that the dispensing of methadone should be done in a safe and effective manner, but that is not what is happening.  Under the methadone maintenance programme in the nearby Aisling clinic in the Ballyfermot area, if an addict cannot prove by way of a regular urine test that he or she is still not using drugs, the health board will refuse to dispense methadone or physeptone.  I commend the health board and the staff of the Aisling Centre for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drug addicts have asked me to request the staff to allow them back on the programme when they have been found to have taken drugs again.  I fail to see how we can support such stringent controls, which is the correct way to run maintenance programmes, and at the same time allow GPs who are not part of the health board scheme to prescribe in excess of one litre of physeptone or <Col N="578" /> methadone.  It is inconceivable that anyone who receives that amount of methadone or physeptone will not either sell it to buy hard drugs or, as happened to a young man who was a good friend of mine, accidentally kill himself.  Unless the scheme gains credibility in the community, as had started to happen in some areas where those not involved in drugs were prepared to accept community based programmes for local addicts, and unless we can introduce controls which apply to the Aisling Centre in Ballyfermot to the GPs and pharmacists operating outside the scheme, we will not have any community based programmes. More crucially, I fear the drugs problem is being spread on a wholesale basis and I fear for the lives of those taking more than the required amount of methadone or taking it for the first time.</P>

      <P>In January 1997 in the light of the evaluation of a methadone treatment pilot programme in the Eastern Health Board and also arising from the major developments in the board in regard to the provision of treatment services for opiate misusers, my Department set up a review group to consider the arrangements in place for the management and care of heroin dependent drug misusers by GPs and pharmacists and to advise the Minister on the approach to be taken in the future.  The group was first convened on 13 January 1997, during the term of my predecessor.  Its terms of reference were first, to examine and define the role of general practitioners and pharmacists in the treatment of opiate dependent persons; second, to examine the working relationships between the various treatment centres and GPs and pharmacists and third, to outline protocols for good practice in the prescribing and dispensing of methadone, including appropriate controls which might be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main recommendations of the group were that methadone treatment should continue to be a valid treatment for opiate dependent persons; the protocol for the prescribing of methadone should be the basis on which the further development of services for opiate misusers is undertaken, subject to appropriate controls; methadone should be available free of charge to all persons undergoing methadone treatment for opiate dependence; the prescription and supply of methadone should be strictly controlled, a system of close monitoring of all elements of this scheme should be put in place immediately, and a special group should be established for this purpose; treatment for opiate misuse should be provided in the misuser's local area wherever possible, as recommended by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Medical Council and the Irish College of General Practitioners and regulations should be made under section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, to provide a statutory basis for a <Col N="579" /> scheme of monitoring and control of methadone usage.</P>
    <P>This report has recently been examined by me in great detail and I am satisfied with the conclusions and recommendations contained therein. My Department, in consultation with the Eastern Health Board and other members of the group, has now commenced implementing the recommendations of the report and will shortly be circulating it to all GPs and pharmacists.</P>
    <P>The question of the quantity of methadone to be prescribed in any individual case is a clinical decision for the medical practitioner concerned and one which would not be appropriate to regulation by statute.  It would be expected, however, that in prescribing methadone for any patient a general practitioner would have regard to good practice in this area as laid down in various practice protocols issued by professional organisations such as the Irish College of General Practitioners. It is also open to any general practitioner who is providing methadone treatment for a drug misuser to consult with the consultant psychiatrists working in the central addiction services in Dublin about the appropriate treatment regime for any individual patient.</P>

      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter which is of considerable interest to the local community. Coláiste Íosagáin is for sale.  This major landmark on the Cork-Killarney road, midway between Ballyvourney and Ballymakeera, was familiar to many people throughout Munster and further afield as an educational establishment up to its closure in 1989.  Since then, regrettably, it has remained vacant and is now being offered for sale.  I am anxious, as is the local community, that the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will sanction a request received from Údarás na Gaeltachta to allow it buy the property and proceed with its development with maximum benefit for the local community.  If that request is not sanctioned further dereliction of the property is inevitable and soon the magnificent former college may deteriorate beyond repair.  That would be a national loss as the college has links with the development of our education system going back almost to the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college, together with 40 acres of land, is being offered for sale.  These lands adjoin the industrial estate owned by Údarás na Gaeltachta and would provide for a perfectly logical expansion by Údarás na Gaeltachta as its present lands leave no room for further industrial expansion. There is considerable local community interest in the future of Coláiste Íosagáin and support for the proposal by Údarás na Gaeltachta to purchase the college.  Consultants have been engaged <Col N="580" /> in recent times at the behest of Údarás na Gaeltachta and the local community to determine the development potential of the property and there is widespread optimism about its commercial viability.</P>
    <P>I am not privy to the deliberations of the consultants, but on numerous occasions in the past I visited this issue with regard to the enormous potential of the site.  I still believe the premises could be used as an educational facility, most likely with considerable potential for post-graduate third level courses.  Situated as it is in the heart of the Muskerry Gaeltacht, cultural tourism and the revival of interest in the Irish language also offer interesting options for its future use. The asking price for the site is approximately £500,000.  For a site with such enormous potential, that is a pittance.  I ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the request by Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Teachta Creed as ucht na ceiste seo a thógáil liom.  Mar is eol don Teachta tógadh an cinneadh seo ag cruinniú d'Údarás na Gaeltachta ar 7 Deireadh Fómhair.  D'aontaigh an tÚdarás, faoi réir cead an Aire Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, talamh agus foirgneamh IárCholáiste Íosagáin a cheannach ar phraghas nach mó ná suim áirithe nach bhfuil ar intinn agam a lua go poiblí ag an bpointe seo ar chúiseanna a bheadh intuigthe don Teachta.</P>

      <P>Beidh ar mo Roinnse an togra a scrúdú anois i gcomhairle leis an Údarás d'fhonn moladh a chur faoi mo bhráid go luath glacadh nó gan glacadh le cinneadh an Údaráis sa chás.  Mar chuid den scrúdú sin caithfear an úsáid a bhainfeadh an tÚdarás as an maoin agus an teacht isteach ar infheisíocht an Stáit sa chás a chur san áireamh agus a bhreithniú go cúramach &mdash; ní hamháin an teacht isteach ar an tsuim a bheadh ag teastáil chun an mhaoin a cheannach ach ar an tsuim a bheadh de dhíth chun í a fhorbairt chomh maith. Caithfear deimhin a dhéanamh de go mbeidh luach a chuid airgid á fháil ag an Stát as an gcaiteachas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Beidh mé ag brú go gcuirfear an scrúdú seo ar an mholadh ar bun sa Roinn chomh luath agus is <Col N="581" /> féidir, ach go dtí go mbeidh sé sin déanta agus an t-eolas ar fad curtha ar fáil, tuigfidh an Teachta nach bhféadfar cinneadh a dhéanamh.

      <P>The health boards and the voluntary mental handicap agencies provide a range of services to assist persons with a mental handicap to continue to live at home with their families.  These services include respite, day care and home support services.</P>
      <P>The home support services were initiated in 1992 to help meet the needs of families with a mentally handicapped child or dependant.  The services work in a flexible manner and are specifically targeted at those persons who have no services, are awaiting a residential placement or require additional assistance to enable them to continue to reside with their families.  Since they were first introduced, the home support services have been expanded considerably and now provide a broad range of responses to meet the needs of persons with a mental handicap and their families. Examples of the services available include the provision of assistance in the home with the care of the family member with a mental handicap or arranging leisure activities for them in the evenings or at weekends.</P>
      <P>In individual cases where their parents have died and their siblings are not in a position to continue to care for their brother or sister with a mental handicap, the health boards and voluntary mental handicap agencies arrange for their placement in a residential setting.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the ongoing development of these services as outlined in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>

      <P>The interim report of the Task Force on the Eastern Regional Health Authority was presented to me on 30 June 1997.  I met the members of the task force shortly afterwards and brought their recommendations to the attention of the Government at the earliest opportunity.  On 29 July last, I announced the Government's agreement to the task force's recommendations; to the immediate publication of its interim report and to the preparation, as a priority, of draft heads of a Bill to <Col N="584" /> give legislative effect to the task force's recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that work on the draft heads of a Bill is now well under way in my Department and I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government in this regard in the near future.  Meanwhile, I understand that the task force, under the chairmanship of Mr. Donal O'Shea, is continuing its work on the administrative and organisational structures which will be required for the transition to the new structures, in consultation with all the various interests involved.</P>

      <P>The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Blood Transfusion Service Board, which was published in March 1997, made six key recommendations and the following is the current position in relation to their implementation.  The BTSB's development plan details a major renewal, reorganisation and investment programme over the coming years.  Implementation of the key elements of the plan is progressing as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>As regards the construction of new national headquarters at St. James's Hospital, Dublin, I understand that a detailed sketch design has been agreed with the board and an application for full planning permission will be lodged with Dublin Corporation later this month.  It is expected that the building contract will be placed for tender in November.  A new information technology department has been established at the BTSB and it expects to complete contract negotiations for a new software system shortly with a leading international supplier.  My Department will be making available approximately £2 million to support the accelerated implementation of this new IT system.</P>
      <P>Significant new appointments have been made recently in the medical, scientific and technical, and quality assurance areas.  My Department will continue to work closely with the board to provide support and rapid decision-making in relation to the implementation of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements have already been put in place to conduct more regular inspections at the BTSB as recommended by the tribunal.  In relation to the separate annual report to be prepared by the Irish Medicines Board, I understand that a report will be submitted to me by the end of this year concerning the outcome of these inspections and any reports of abnormal reactions to blood or blood product transfusion.  The Irish Medicines Board and my Department will have consultations <Col N="585" /> with regard to the appropriate format of this annual report which I will publish.</P>
    <P>In addition, the BTSB and my Department are developing proposals to establish on a pilot basis a haemovigilance programme to build on the current reporting of serious adverse reports by effective, timely and reliable co-ordination and evaluation of reports from hospitals.  Discussions have already taken place with the Irish Medicines Board on the most effective implementation of such a haemovigilance system.  The Irish Medicines Board already has in place a pharmacovigilance system for monitoring adverse reactions to medicinal products.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be establishing a Standing Committee on Transfusion Medicine to support the development of best transfusion practice in hospitals.  This committee will include consultants from major surgical specialties and will develop blood utilisation guidelines and key indicators of quality in clinical transfusion practice as well as having a role in understanding and informing patients' attitudes and concerns about transfusion. The tribunal report recommended that a major contribution to the maintenance of public confidence in the supply of blood and blood products could be made by the establishment of a Blood Service Consumers' Council.  In that regard my Department is currently preparing proposals on the role and function of this advisory council which will complement the separate roles and functions of the Irish Medicines Board, the Consultative Council on Hepatitis C and the Standing Committee on Transfusion Medicine.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recommendation concerning procedures for the recall of products, the BTSB has in place standard operating procedures for the recall of products and these are reviewed regularly by the Irish Medicines Board.  As an additional support to hospitals, the BTSB will shortly issue a revised protocol for use by hospitals to assist in the tracing of products to a named patient.</P>
    <P>The BTSB has arrangements in place, should the need arise, for the immediate replacement of blood components such as red cells, platelets and plasma.  As regards other blood products, the BTSB and the Irish Medicines Board are finalising arrangements for the alternate supply of licensed blood products.  In addition, my Department is currently preparing legislation to provide a statutory framework for the supply and use of unlicensed products where such use is considered necessary by clinicians to meet the particular needs of individual patients in special circumstances.</P>

      <P>The rate of payment of part-time home helps varies considerably throughout the country, determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that the underlying philosophy governing the operation of the home help scheme is that it is a community based good neighbour scheme which would attract volunteers primarily motivated by the desire to engage in community service.  The service does not come within the realm of conventional employment.  Income in respect of services provided is a payment which is not intended to compensate fully for the nature of the task undertaken.  Such income does not come within the scope of the PAYE code and is not taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a home help &mdash; or the spouse of a home help &mdash; is in receipt of a means-tested social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>This issue has been raised on many occasions in the House.  My Department, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, is considering a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the diversity of arrangements which exist within the health boards for the provision of this service.  My Department has arranged to have an examination of the operation of the home help services carried out by an independent body, under the supervision of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, which will advise on how the services can be developed in a cost effective way in tandem with the other community based services.  Work has commenced on this project and will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>When the results of this examination are made available to me, I will be in a better position to consider how best improvements may be brought about in the overall organisation and development of the home help service.  Related issues such as rates for home helps will be considered as part of this process.  In the meantime, my Department has allocated additional funding to three boards in 1997 for the purposes of increasing rates of pay to home helps.  It is my intention to facilitate the improvement of the provision of the home help service, including pay rates, on a phased basis as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 16 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients who are on waiting lists for a lung or heart-lung transplant and I am committed to improving the existing situation.  Under present arrangements Irish patients considered in need of a lung or heart-lung transplant are referred by their medical consultant for assessment to an established transplant centre in the UK and if suitable are put on a waiting list for a transplant. At present the number of patients on the waiting list exceeds the availability of suitable organs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.  My Department is now carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the issues involved in this area. This assessment will have particular regard to the experience of other countries, including those with a population size similar to Ireland, which have previously examined the feasibility of establishing a successful lung or heart-lung transplant programme.  My Department will be seeking the expert views of key professionals in this field as part of the assessment.  The immediate requirement <Col N="588" /> is to examine whether the existing service provided to Irish patients and their families in the UK can be improved, for example, through contracting work to a selected and proven site.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that the establishment of any successful transplant programme is an extremely complex and difficult task.  In preparing to introduce a lung and heart-lung transplant programme in this country the overriding objective must be to ensure that the results of such a programme at least match international standards.  One of the critical factors in the successful delivery of a quality transplant programme is whether the level of transplant activity in an established programme is sufficient to maintain the level of expertise required to achieve successful outcomes.  It is also essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multidisciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  We have previously gained valuable experience in this country in setting up a successful adult liver transplant programme.  The question of establishing a lung and heart-lung transplant programme is being considered in part with reference to the experience gained in establishing this programme.  A phased approach needs to be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients, whether it be at home or abroad.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department have had several very positive meetings in the recent past with representatives of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to discuss the issues involved in setting up a heart-lung and lung transplant programme in Ireland.  I welcome this collaborative approach and I am confident it will contribute to a major improvement in services for the patients involved in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 50 and 96 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following publication of Report No. 36 of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector on the pay and conditions of <Col N="589" /> hospital consultants in December 1996, the Government authorised my predecessor as Minister for Health to open discussions with the organisations representing the medical profession in the implementation of its recommendations. The medical organisations were initially reluctant to enter negotiations due to their unhappiness with the contents of the report.  The outcome of a series of discussions designed to find a basis for their entry to the talks was a formal commencement of negotiations on 18 March of this year.  A lengthy process of negotiation proceeded under an independent chairman until early June when one of the medical organisations withdrew from the talks.  Using the good offices of the chairman, contact was maintained throughout June and July in an attempt to reopen formal talks.  In early August agreement was reached to meet for five days in mid-September with a view to concluding an agreement.</P>
    <P>After 80 hours of intensive negotiations the management side, consisting of representatives of my Department, of health service management, and of the Health Service Employers' Agency, put its final position to the medical organisations. This package of proposals represented a balanced attempt to deal with the concerns of the representatives of the profession.  The medical organisations felt unable to recommend the package to their members.  It was subsequently rejected by the members of the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association at its annual general meeting held over the final weekend in September.  The Irish Medical Organisation has yet to submit it to its membership.</P>
    <P>Contract has been maintained at official level with the two medical organisations in an effort to isolate the areas in dispute and to identify a basis for a final agreement.  A meeting on this basis was held on Tuesday last and a further meeting is scheduled for tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I am obviously concerned that such a prolonged process of negotiation has not produced an agreement that meets the requirements of the parties.  I, and my colleagues in Government, have to bear in mind that the background to these talks is the report of the independent review body which received written and oral submissions from the parties involved.  Within the permitted parameters the management side has attempted to facilitate the major concerns of the medical organisations.</P>
    <P>The present package of proposals on offer is an honest and balanced attempt to deal with the problems identified by the medical organisations. They may require some further fine-tuning and that is now under way.  When that process is completed I expect the medical organisations to seriously consider recommending them to their members as the absolutely best offer available in the current circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope that no action, whether described as industrial action or not, would be taken which would result in disruption to hospitals and other health services.

      <P>Monitoring of the standards of care provided for patients in psychiatric hospitals is carried out by the inspector of mental hospitals.  The inspector carries out annual inspections of all psychiatric hospitals, including St. Ita's Hospital.  In his recently published report for 1995, the inspector notes the enhancement of the overall appearance of clinical areas and the improvement in staff morale in the hospital but acknowledges that further improvement in standards is necessary.  In his report for 1996, which will be published shortly, the inspector refers to the continuation of the upgrading and refurbishment of patient facilities.  In this regard, a total of £500,000 was spent on upgrading facilities in 1994 and 1995.  In 1996 my Department provided a further £250,000, while the board provided £60,000 from its own resources which enables further substantial upgrading to be carried out in all patient care areas throughout the hospital.</P>
      <P>The board's current development plans in relation to the St. Ita's Hospital campus provide for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with the reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service.  It is envisaged that the main hospital will be closed as a residential facility.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose-built residential facilities in the community for the mental handicap residents, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the board adopted a development plan &mdash;<i>St. Ita's Mental Handicap Service Development Programme 1997/1998</i>&mdash; which provides for the replacement of the older facilities in the hospital by the commissioning of four community residences and two village complexes providing a total of 85 places in the community. Implementation of the plan is under way with capital funding of £650,000 and revenue funding of £625,000 being made available this year by my Department.  This will facilitate 50 places in the community becoming available this year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of an epidural service is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  However, I have been advised by the board that, at present, there is a limited epidural service provided at both Erinville and St. Finbarr's Maternity Hospitals by consultant anaesthetists who have clinical sessions at both of these hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have been further informed by the board that it is conscious of the difficulties which have arisen in the provision of a comprehensive obstetrics service, including epidural services, which are due to the current structure of the service.  In 1993 the Southern Health Board drew attention to the difficulties which had arisen in the provision of a comprehensive obstetric service, including epidural services, because of the fragmentation of these services.  In 1995 a submission was made to my Department recommending that the maternity and neonatology services should be amalgamated on the Cork University Hospital site.  A project team has been established to prepare a brief for the amalgamated obstetric unit on the site of Cork University Hospital.  This brief is nearing completion and approval has been given for the appointment of a design team in anticipation of proceeding to the next stage of this project.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the Southern Health Board is examining the options available to enable the provision of an enhanced epidural service which will require the employment of additional anaesthetic staff at registrar level.  The board has stated that this development will have to be considered against the other competing priorities in its area.</P>

      <P>The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities, Towards an Independent Future, which was published in December 1996, set out the requirements for the development of these services, including residential and respite care services.  The  process of implementing the report is under way.  As a first step, the health boards are in the process of putting in place co-ordinating committees to examine and prioritise the future development of services at local level.</P>
      <P>An additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put existing physical and sensory disability services on a more secure financial footing.  In addition, £1 million revenue was provided in 1997 for priority developments mentioned in the report.  Furthermore, I recently approved a once-off grant of £600,000 towards the capital costs of Donamon Castle, County Roscommon, a centre providing residential, respite and day activity services for people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to the further development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities but I am not yet in a position to comment on the level of funding which may be available for any particular services in 1998.</P>

    <P>*Figures for 1993 to 1995 are provisional based on year of registration.</P>
    <P>Source: Central Statistics Office.</P>
    <P>The figures show the highest mortality rate occurring in the Eastern Health Board and the lowest rate in the Western Health Board.  In general, cancer mortality rates in urbanised areas tend to be higher than elsewhere and this is reflected in the figure for the Eastern Health Board.  The national cancer strategy notes these regional variations and indicates that further research will be necessary to determine the underlying cause.  While lifestyle and environmental factors are likely to be implicated, part of the explanation may also be due to a tendency to record a patient's county of residence as Dublin, particularly when the patient has undergone long-term hospice care in the city.</P>
    <P>My Department has been conscious for many years of the importance of identifying and addressing the causes of preventable deaths in Ireland.  Cancer is one of the principal causes of premature mortality &mdash; defined as deaths among those aged under 65 &mdash; and it must be emphasised that smoking is the single most important preventable cause of cancer and of lung cancer in particular.</P>
    <P>While Ireland is just above the EU average mortality for cancer of the bronchus, trachea and lung at all ages, it is well below the average for the 0 to 64 age group.  It should also be noted that trends over the last 15 years show a narrowing of the gap between the Eastern Health Board and other areas largely due to a steady fall in the mortality rate from lung cancer in the east.  This fall has been especially pronounced in the 0-64 age group.</P>
    <P>Given the significant impact of cancer in Ireland, the national cancer strategy sets a target of reducing the death rate from cancer in the under 65 age group by 15 per cent between the years 1994 and 2004.  The strategy includes such initiatives as reorganising cancer treatment services, developing medical oncology and specialist palliative care services and organising targeted national screening programmes to combat breast <Col N="597" /> cancer and cervical cancer.  These and many other developments under the national cancer strategy will be of benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to implementing the health strategy Shaping a Healthier Future and the national cancer strategy to best effect in all parts of the country.  It is expected that good progress will be made in reducing the rate of preventable mortality in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I am happy to assure the House that the special measures to reduce the numbers of people on waiting lists for hospital in-patient treatment will continue.  This year I have allocated a sum of £8 million to the health boards and selected voluntary hospitals.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current iniative commenced in 1993.</P>
      <P>In 1998 I propose to introduce changes to the waiting list initiative to ensure that the funds available are used to best effect.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that waiting list data accurately reflect the actual number of people in need of treatment.  Previous validation exercises indicate that waiting lists have not always accurately reflected the numbers waiting for treatment. I recently emphasised the need for agencies to validate their waiting list data carefully to provide a reliable and up-to-date picture of service needs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the application and selection process operated by the Nursing Applications Centre for this year's intake of student nurses to the nursing registration-diploma programmes.</P>
      <P>The Nursing Applications Centre was established on a pilot basis in 1995 to provide a national centralised application and selection system for applicants seeking places on the new preregistration nursing registration-diploma programmes. Price Waterhouse management consultants are currently carrying out an evaluation of the centre with the overall aim of ensuring that the most up-to-date application and selection procedures are employed, with continued maximum equity and effectiveness.  As part of this evaluation, Price Waterhouse project managed the application-selection process for the 1997 intake of student nurses.  It was assisted in this task by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of modifications to the procedures employed in previous years were introduced this year with the objective of streamlining the application-selection process.  These included the replacement of the preliminary interview by a written assessment test.  I am aware that concerns have been expressed in some quarters about this particular change in the selection process. However, my Department has been informed by Price Waterhouse that the decision to substitute a written assessment test for the preliminary interview is supported by a body of independent <Col N="599" /> research which indicates that carefully chosen ability testing programmes as a method of shortlisting candidates for the final interview stage from large scale applications is a fairer and more equitable system than using a large number of preliminary interview boards.  In this context, the Deputy may be aware that assessment tests are used for screening applicants for entry to the Garda Síochána, the prison services and the officer ranks of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The tests used this year were selected by Price Waterhouse in consultation with professionals from the Local Appointments Commission, and took account of the core competencies and characteristics required of student nurses, as identified in workshops attended by senior nurse managers and tutors.  The tests used were the subject of a prior validation study undertaken by Price Waterhouse in a number of schools of nursing around the country in which student nurses participated.</P>
    <P>The suitability of those applicants who successfully came through the written assessment test was subsequently decided by interview boards composed of a matron-director of nursing, a senior nurse tutor and an independent chairperson nominated by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>The 1997 intake of student nurses to the nursing registration-diploma programmes has now been completed and Price Waterhouse will shortly report to my Department on its evaluation of the Nursing Applications Centre. Decisions as to the future operations of the centre, including the procedures employed by it, will be made in the light of the recommendations contained in the management consultants' report, which will, no doubt, be informed by their experience of project managing this year's application-selection process.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The relocation of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater Hospital campus has been under consideration for some time by the religious orders which own the two hospitals concerned.  My Department supports the transfer of Temple Street Hospital to the Mater campus because of the need to improve the quality of paediatric hospital accommodation and the potential benefits to both hospitals of shared infrastructural support and complementary clinical services.</P>
      <P>While there is agreement in principle between the two orders to the proposed move, there are a number of issues still to be worked out which will have an impact on the phasing of the development. My Department is currently in discussion with representatives of the hospitals to progress this matter.  It is generally accepted that in view of the logistical and planning issues involved, the move to the Mater Hospital site would take a number of years to complete.  However, in the interim, it is vital that existing services for children on the north side of the city are maintained to a high standard.  For this reason, my Department recently approved the establishment of a project team for the refurbishment of Temple Street Hospital's accident and emergency department and the provision of a 20 bed ward.  Work is well advanced on the planning of this development.</P>

      <P>Personal assistance services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.  The FÁS scheme, which is designed to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, is not perfectly suited to the needs of a personal assistance service for people with disabilities.  However, any change in this scheme would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>The Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, Towards an Independent Future, which was published last December, set out the requirements for the development, <i>inter alia</i>, of personal assistance services.  On foot of the report, an additional £3.688 million was provided this year, of which £226,000 was allocated to personal assistance services. The further development of the services will be considered in the light of the resources which may be made available to my Department in 1998.</P>
      <P>An advisory group on personal assistance services set up by one of my predecessors explored the option of establishing an independent living fund as a means of funding personal assistance services for people with disabilities but considered that it would be too cumbersome to administer.</P>

      <P>In the VHI's case, at the beginning of last year, the board established a members' advisory council.

He pointed out that the existence of the council as an independent entity representing a high proportion of the membership of the VHI had proved extremely useful for discussing issues and proposed developments.  I am satisfied that the council continues to operate for the benefit of the members of the VHI.  I also wish to point out that the VHI is a member of the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland scheme.  The scheme provides VHI members with an independent avenue through which to pursue complaints, disputes or claims arising out of their policies.

      <P>Ten million pounds additional funding was made available to the mental handicap agencies this year for the development of day and residential services to persons with a mental handicap, of which £2.475 million was allocated to mental handicap agencies in the Eastern Health Board region, including the St. John of God services.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that in March 1997 the then Minister announced the introduction of a major action plan to implement the proposals contained in the national cancer strategy. Included in the plan were proposals for the development of a breast cancer screening programme. Since then there have been a number of important developments in relation to breast cancer screening.  Principal among these are: the establishment of a national steering group chaired by Dr. Sheelah Ryan, Programme Manager, North-Eastern Health Board, to guide the implementation of the national programme of screening for breast cancer; the passage of legislation, Health (Provision of Information) Act, 1997, to ensure the screening programme will comply with data protection requirements; the <Col N="605" /> establishment of a National Quality Assurance Committee, chaired by Professor Ennis, Radiologist, Mater Hospital, as a subcommittee of the steering group &mdash; the committee is representative of experts from all the relevant clinical disciplines; and the decision to appoint a project director for the programme.  This post has been advertised and interviews are to be held shortly.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1 million has been set aside in 1997 to meet the start-up costs associated with the programme. The steering committee has now identified priority resource requirements for phase I to be funded from this allocation.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the cancer strategy, considerable progress has been made in relation to the organisational structures and operational arrangements required for the implementation of the programme.  The national steering group had its first meeting on 17 April 1997.  The group has met on a monthly basis since and a decision is expected shortly in relation to an appropriate model for the delivery of phase I of the breast screening programme.  Work is also under way in relation to the compilation of a population register in conjunction with the relevant agencies. Once a decision on a model for delivery has been reached the development of the IT system can be completed and phase I of the programme can proceed without delay.</P>

      <P>I am aware of this report which is being studied in my Department at present.  The report, which was commissioned by the Eastern Health Board, is a challenging and disturbing document.  Many of its findings are in line with research undertaken on this topic in other jurisdictions.  The report identifies a strong link between homelessness and prostitution; it also identifies the routes by which children enter prostitution and it suggests possible ways of responding to the problem.  The report states very clearly that child prostitution should be seen as child sexual abuse and the perpetrator should always be seen as a child sex offender and it is important not to lose sight of this fact.  The question of taking action on foot of this report is primarily a matter for the Eastern Health Board and discussions will take place between the chief executive officer of the board and officials of my Department in regard to the findings and recommendations of the report.</P>

      <P>The report of the Eastern Health Board &mdash; IMPACT review group on child care and family support services referred to the separate placement of a number of sibling groups.  I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board about this matter and the board has reported that while this may occur from time to time it is its policy to place siblings together and it would be most unusual not to do so.</P>
      <P>The report also highlighted the need to create more foster care and residential places and following a recent Eastern Health Board fostering recruitment campaign, which yielded over 60 applications to foster, there is currently a backlog of fostering applications awaiting assessment. While a time-lag in processing applications is inevitable, I am anxious that the current lengthy assessment period for the approval of foster carers be shortened as much as possible and I have asked the board to submit proposals in this regard at an early date.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently met with the chief executive officer of the board to discuss the provision of additional placements for children requiring care.  I am happy to report that the board has immediate plans to open a ten bed emergency residential centre for children under 12 years of age.  The board also plans to establish an additional ten bed emergency residential centre for children over 12 years of age who are out of home.  Also, up to ten out-of-hours emergency carer families will be brought on stream during 1997.  These will be available to provide emergency care for children during the out-of-hours period.  I am confident that these measures will help to alleviate the situation.</P>

      <P>The long-term illness scheme entitles persons to <Col N="607" /> free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a specific schedule of illnesses.  The long-term illness scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to change the scheme or to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to those who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  In view of the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers to issue medical cards to those whose income exceeds the guidelines, I do not consider it justifiable to extend automatic entitlement to a medical card to any particular group without any reference to their means.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions, such as asthma.</P>

      <P>Amniocentesis is the term that refers to the sampling of the fluid around the foetus in the mother's uterus.  The fluid may be taken for a variety of investigations.  The two most common investigations that are carried out are: the assessment of bilirubin in the fluid to determine whether there is a risk of rhesus disease; and to determine the chromosomal make-up of the foetus. An amniocentesis service for the detection of rhesus disease is available at the following hospitals: The National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street; The Coombe Women's Hospital; The International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda; Letterkenny General Hospital; Sligo General Hospital; St. Munchin's Regional Maternity Hospital, Limerick; St. Finbar's Hospital, Cork and Erinville Hospital, Cork.</P>
      <P>The Rotunda Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway perform amniocentesis for this purpose and also to determine the chromosomal make-up of the foetus.  Since the latter service commenced, approximately two years ago, a total of 224 patients have availed of it.  My Department will examine any proposals from a health agency for the further development of this service, in the context of their overall priorities for new services and available funding.</P>

      <P>The Health Insurance Act 1994 was enacted on 30 June 1994 in the context of our obligation to open the market in private medical insurance to competition under the EU's Third Non-Life Insurance Directive.  The Act made provision, <i>inter alia,</i> for the Minister for Health to prescribe a scheme of risk equalisation.  Such a scheme was prescribed by means of Statutory Instrument No. 84 of 1996, Health Insurance Act 1994 (Risk Equalisation Scheme), 1996, made on 28 March 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme provides for the establishment of a risk equalisation fund into which insurers with a risk profile better than the market average will be required to make payments, and from which <Col N="610" /> payments will be made to insurers with a worse risk profile than the market average.  The regulations provide that the risk equalisation scheme will not become operational unless, and until, the conditions in the market require it.</P>
    <P>My predecessor initiated a review of the risk equalisation scheme by an independent advisory group.

      <P>Current arrangements to provide treatment for persons who contracted hepatitis C as a result of a blood or blood product transfusion encompass both secondary care hospital services and primary care services.  In the case of persons so infected, the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 provides statutory entitlement to a range of primary health care services, free of charge.  The services in place include general practitioner services and drugs <Col N="611" /> and medicines for all medical conditions, home nursing services, home help services, dental and ophthalmic services and counselling services. Each health board has appointed a liaison officer to ensure the smooth operation of the delivery of services under the Act, and to act as a contact point for individuals and for the various interest groups whose members avail of services under the Act.  My Department maintains contact with the representative organisations and the health board liaison officers to ensure that any issues in relation to service provision that arise can be tackled quickly and effectively.</P>
      <P>In relation to secondary care services, treatment for those who contracted hepatitis C from the receipt of blood or blood products is being provided at special consultant staffed clinics at six designated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital; the Mater Hospital; St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital in Dublin, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. These services, provided under the Health Act, 1970, are free of charge and include access to both in-patient and out-patient treatment, as required.  Special funding has been and will continue to be provided by my Department for these services, to ensure that the needs of hepatitis C patients are met.</P>
      <P>In addition, in November 1996, the consultative council on hepatitis C was formally established to advise and make recommendations to me as Minister on all aspects of hepatitis C, including health and counselling services and the funding, organisation and delivery of these services.  The council also monitors the healthcare requirements and other needs of hepatitis C sufferers.</P>
      <P>I understand that concerns have been expressed recently at the consultative council in relation to the services at one of the designated units and that the council will be making certain recommendations to me on this matter shortly.  My Department will address these concerns in association with the hospital involved as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>As regards counselling, it is recognised that both medical and non-medical counselling has an important role in assisting persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C who may require support. There is a range of such services available.  General practitioners provide a pre-test counselling service and a counselling service to persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C virus-antibodies. Counselling services are also made available by health boards under the Health (Amendment) Act, 1996 and provided by hepatology nurses in the six designated units.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of developments in the United States regarding litigation against tobacco companies which my Department is continuing to monitor.</P>
      <P>Individual states have used a number of legal bases in pursuing cases, some of which are based on specific US statutes.  As the outcome of the US litigation is also being considered by other EU member states, it is my view that we should also harmonise our actions with any initiatives which may emerge at EU level.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the issue has been discussed at health board level, but I understand that no decisions have been taken by the boards on taking legal action at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any initiative on this matter will entail a great deal of preparation and careful assessment of the strategy to be pursued.  I assure the Deputy that this matter will continue to receive a high level of priority in my Departments' work programme, in close consultation with health boards and other relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with the question of the establishment of a contact register within the context of the wider issue of access to birth records by adopted persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952.  Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and <Col N="614" /> birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the considerations and implications involved in such a step.  The increased volume of tracing requests to adoption societies and health boards in recent years is an indication of the strength of feeling and strong desire for information by the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for legislation on this issue in order to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system. However, it would be prudent to await clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July, before proceeding with legislation in this very sensitive area of human relationships.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post-adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of its birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality. It is expected that the Supreme Court will deliver its judgment in the case shortly.</P>
    <P>An adoption contact register is only one element of a post-adoption contact system and, on its own, will not provide a solution to those experiencing difficulty in tracing a birth parent or child given up for adoption.  Therefore, I do not propose to proceed with the establishment of such a register before finalising proposals on the structure of the wider post-adoption contact system.</P>

      <P>Phase 2A of the development at LongfordWestmeath General Hospital comprises a new accident and emergency department, X-ray department, out patient department and medical records department.  A new main entrance has also been provided.  Because of the improved layout of the facilities and the expected increase in usage, the Midland Health Board estimates that it will require an additional 80 staff at an annual cost of £1.5 million to make the new developments fully operational.  When other running costs are taken into account I would expect the facility to cost up to £2.5 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some progress has been made in bringing the new facilities into use.  The existing out patient <Col N="615" /> services have been relocated in the new out patient department and the medical records staff are providing support services to out patient clinics from the new building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 70 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means.  Under the Health Act, 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that these guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  Medical <Col N="616" /> cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision it is felt that it is not justifiable, on health policy grounds, to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to any specific group without any reference to their means or in the case of children, to their parents' means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these arrangements the Government has identified as a key priority a review of medical card eligibility for the elderly and large families in An Action Programme for the Millennium and my Department is currently making the necessary arrangements to advance this review with the health boards.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at present to provide mandatory medical screening for refugees for infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The report of the working party on tuberculosis published by my Department in September 1996 made recommendations in respect of the procedure to be followed for individuals living abroad in countries or areas known to have a high incidence of tuberculosis and arriving to spend at least three months in this country.  The procedure includes notification, screening, testing and provision of health information.</P>
      <P>In relation to HIV, the World Health Organisation does not recommend routine HIV testing for refugees.  This position is supported by the National AIDS Strategy Committee which recommended that testing for HIV should only be done for diagnostic purposes after consideration of recognised risk factors and with fully informed consent.  I have had inquiries made with the Eastern Health Board in relation to the second element of the Deputy's question.  The board advises that it provides a full general practitioner service for refugees at which all medical problems, including initial diagnosis of infectious disease, would be identified.  In addition, more public health medical staff are being recruited at present to carry out the routine contact tracing for both tuberculosis and hepatitis B among refugees. For refugees from certain high risk countries of the former USSR, diphtheria immunisation will also be provided.  These plans have been developed by the board in consequence of the large increase in the numbers of asylum seekers entering Ireland particularly in 1996 and in 1997 to date.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the Eastern Health Board's current and proposed actions in this area are sufficient to allay any concerns of general practitioners working in the inner city regarding infectious disease screening for refugees.</P>

      <P>The Department has been aware for some time of the need to carry out an overall assessment of MRI scanning facilities in the public hospital service.  Accordingly, an expert study of the existing arrangements for the provision of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities nationwide and likely future demand in this area was carried out by Professor David Banta, MD, MPH, an international expert in health technology assessment. Professor Banta identified the need to develop MRI facilities at University College Hospital, Galway, St. James's Hospital and the new Tallaght Hospital, with the Galway location as the top priority.  A timescale of three years is envisaged for the programme of enhancement for MRI facilities at the three sites.  Professsor Banta's recommendations have been adopted by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding waiting lists for MRI facilities, I have had inquiries made of the hospital authorities and understand that there are currently 923 patients on Beaumont Hospital's MRI waiting list and 114 patients on Cork University Hospital's list.  I have been advised that urgent requests for MRI scans are assessed by a consultant <Col N="620" /> radiologist in consultation with the referring clinician and given an immediate appointment.  I am confident that the location of the new equipment at the three sites will further improve the access to this important diagnostic tool for patients and consequently will impact positively on national waiting times.</P>

      <P>In the past three years 46 persons with cystic fibrosis have been assessed abroad for suitability for either heart and lung transplants or lung transplants.  The numbers involved in respect of each health board are as follows: Eastern Health Board, 18; Midland Health Board two; Mid-Western Health Board, four; North-Eastern Health Board, two; North-Western Health Board, three; South-Eastern Health Board, seven; Southern Health Board, five and Western Health Board, five.</P>
      <P>There are a number of variables involved in costing an assessment, such as whether the assessment is for lung transplant or a heart and lung transplant and whether the assessment is on a day patient basis or an in-patient basis.  Accordingly, the initial assessment can cost between £1,500 and £3,000.  If the person requires in-patient care in excess of five days, this excess is considered as a hospital admission and further costs will be incurred.  Many persons with cystic fibrosis will require more than one assessment prior to a transplant taking place.  When persons are sent abroad for assessment the health board in some cases receives an estimated bill from the hospital, which includes the estimated cost of the actual transplant itself.  Final bills presented to the health boards do not give a breakdown of the various cost elements.  Accordingly, it is not possible to determine exactly how much each health board has paid in assessment costs only.</P>

In the meantime he has had consultations with various interests in the drinks industry, including brewers, distillers, publicans and proprietors of off licenses, in relation to the introduction of a proposed code of practice for these drinks.  Such a code would aim to ensure that the alcoholic nature of alcopops is clearly brought to the attention of the consumer in a responsible manner and that alcopops produced or sold in Ireland are not promoted to or targeted at consumers under 18 years of age.  The code will go on to stipulate detailed rules on product description, labelling, packaging, point of sale material and merchandising of alcopops. The terms of the proposed code are now being finalised by the industry, in consultation with my Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State will announce details of the code within the next month.</P>

      <P>The operating licences granted to Irish air carriers by my Department in accordance with Regulation No. 2407/92 do not impose any conditions which oblige the licensee to provide any particular services or to operate on any specific route.  The question of the company involved being in breach of contract with my Department does not, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>The Single Market rules on air transport permit all appropriately licensed EU carriers to operate air services on any international route within the Community without any restriction on the type of air service, frequency or capacity.  The question as to whether an airline wishes to operate on a particular route and the type of services it wishes to provide is, therefore, entirely a matter for the individual airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>
      <P>I understand, however, that the company in question has ceased the carriage of cargo on all its services and not just those operating to Knock Airport.  The company has advised my Department that because of this decision, it no longer has the handling facilities appropriate to the carriage of human remains and, therefore, could not guarantee to handle such remains with the dignity and respect that would be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of installation aid for young farmers was one of the sub-measures operated under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99. The programme had an indicative budget of £17 million for the scheme and was launched in December 1994.  It was expected that about 3,000 young farmers would participate.  Due to the high level of demand the scheme was suspended with effect from 7 August 1997 in respect of new applications.</P>
      <P>By 1 October 1997 a total of some 3,240 young farmers had been paid about £18 million under the scheme.  In addition there are about 600 other applications being processed currently with a potential grant commitment of about £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>As part of the operational programme the independent analysis and evaluation unit carried out a detailed evaluation of the scheme.  They indicated that the scheme should be terminated as it was not meeting the main objective of encouraging the earlier transfer of farms.</P>
      <P>My Department as part of its submission to the mid-term review sought additional funds to enable the continuation of the scheme.  This was additional to the funds sought in other areas where the level of applications had already exceeded the level of funds available (CFP and Dairy Hygiene).  The mid term review took on board the views of the independent evaluation report and a report prepared by consultants on the operation of the first half of the operational programme, both of which recommended the suspension of the scheme, and accordingly did not make any additional funds available for the continuation of the SIA scheme.</P>
      <P>The scheme was consequently suspended, as already indicated, on 7 August 1997.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that there are currently in excess of 6,600 farmers participating in the scheme of early retirement from farming.  While this money is not going directly to young farmers the benefits of the earlier transfers along with other national aids (tax reliefs) have greatly assisted in the improvement of their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> In addition the Government in An Action Programme for the Millennium recognises the need to support young farmers by ensuring adequate provision for access to quota or production rights by qualified young farmers, and stamp duty exemption for young farmers taking over family holdings.</P>
    <P>I am considering the matter and will be closely monitoring progress of other large-scale projects in the CSF as a whole in early 1998 to see if savings are likely to be identified in any area.</P>

      <P>The report referred to by the Deputy comes from the National Cancer Registry Board which published its first set of national data earlier this year.

      <P>The project team for the development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is at an advanced stage in preparing the detailed accommodation briefs for the individual hospital departments.  To date briefs have been completed in respect of acute wards; intensive care unit; coronary care unit; and accident and emergency department.</P>
      <P>Briefs for the out-patients department, theatre suites and central sterile department are currently being drafted.  It is envisaged that the first phase of the development will include all of the above departments.</P>
      <P>The process of appointing the design team is being finalised.  Its first task will be to draw up a protective development control plan for the total hospital development.  It is envisaged that this work will be completed in the spring of 1998 following which the detailed planning and tender documentation for phase one will be drawn up.</P>
      <P>The development is being jointly funded by the Eastern Health Board and my Department.  The health board will be providing finance through the disposal of surplus lands at the hospital and it is planned that this land will be on the market in the current year ensuring that the momentum of the project is maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98, 100 and 101 together.</P>
      <P>The development of services for children and adults with autism in the western region is a matter in the first instance for the Western Health Board.  In 1997 an allocation of £310,000, full year cost, was given to the Western Health Board for the development of services specifically for persons with autism.  This is in addition to the allocation of £850,000 which was provided to the board for the development of generic services to persons with a mental handicap, including autism. Funding of £130,000 in 1996 and £62,000 in 1995 was also given to the board for the development of specific autism services.</P>
      <P>A range of care and support services are available to persons with a mental handicap, including autism, in County Mayo.  These include day, residential and respite services.  I have asked the Western Health Board for further details on the precise services available which I will supply to the Deputy as soon as the information comes to hand.</P>
      <P>The provision of educational services to children and adults with a mental handicap, including autism, is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science that children with autism have access to a range of educational and support services. The precise nature of the support provided depends on the severity of the condition in each individual case.  The following special educational supports are provided at present in County Mayo: two special schools cater for children with mild mental handicap; two special schools cater for children with moderate mental handicap; three special classes for children with a mild mental handicap in mainstream national schools; 112 national schools with the services of a remedial teacher; 19 national schools with the services of a resource teacher.</P>
      <P>The majority of children and adults with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services.  The Government is committed to the continued development of services for persons with a mental handicap, including autism, as outlined in An Action Programme for the Millenium.  Specialist services, which are required by a minority of persons with autism, are being developed in the Western Health Board.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities, as outlined in my Department's policy document on Services to Persons with Autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the Western Health Board in their overall consideration of the needs of children and adults with a mental handicap and autism in their region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 128 people with confirmed autism in the Western Health Board region, of whom approximately 90 per cent also have a mental <Col N="630" /> handicap.  I have asked the Western Health Board to provide me with a breakdown of this figure relating to County Mayo which I will forward to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Western Health Board that the board is satisfied that professional staff in their region have received and continue to receive training which is appropriate in providing for the needs of their clients.  Since 1995 the board has also allocated £12,000 annually to provide training specifically for staff working with persons with autism, as follows: introduction to using TEACCH, Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children methods; intensive training in TEACCH; working positively with autism and challenging behaviour; understanding and working with people with autism; assessment and diagnosis of autism.</P>
    <P>This training programme was planned on the basis of a survey of staff training needs undertaken by the board's Regional Autism Training Group in 1995-96.  The board is committed to providing further training on an ongoing basis over the next few years.  In addition to the training conducted at regional level, individual agencies have also conducted training at local level and aim to enhance the expertise within their own locations.</P>

      <P>The majority of persons with autism avail of the generic mental handicap services, including assessment and diagnostic services, day, residential, respite and home support services, which have been substantially enhanced in recent years.</P>
      <P>Specialist services, which are required by a minority of persons with autism, are also being developed.  Specialist residential and day services have recently been developed in the Eastern, North-Eastern, Southern and Western Health Boards bringing the total number of specialist residential places for persons with autism to approximately 140.  Planning for the development of further specialist facilities including the enhancement of diagnostic services as outlined in my Department's Policy Document on Services to Persons with Autism, which was published in 1994, is being included by the health boards in their overall consideration of the needs of persons with a mental handicap and autism in their regions.  The Irish Society for Autism, at the request of my Department, is also organising a number of training and information workshops for clinicians working in the area of diagnosis and ongoing care programmes and also for staff working with persons with autism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

      <P>The development plan for the Blood Transfusion Service Board provides for major re-organisation and redevelopment of the service to ensure that it is in a position to meet international standards in transfusion medicine.  Substantial progress has been made in implementing key elements of this plan as I have outlined today in an earlier reply. Specifically as regards the Cork centre, I am advised that the Blood Transfusion Service Board is fully committed to ensuring that it continues to meet standards of good manufacturing practice as required by the Irish Medicines Board.  Officers of the BTSB are arranging to meet with the representatives of the Irish Medicines Board to agree a refurbishment programme in respect of the Cork centre.  I expect this agreed programme to be finalised by the end of October and implementation to commence shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>Over and above the exercise referred to above, an option appraisal is required to assess whether the appropriate renewal of the Cork centre should be by way of major overhaul and extension of existing buildings, or by the provision of new premises.  Such an appraisal will be considered by the board following implementation of the more immediate refurbishment works which will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>As regards equipment and vehicle replacement, my Department has made available funding to enable the board purchase new equipment and replacement vehicles for the service, including the Cork centre.</P>

      <Quest>whether the agreement concluded with the Romanian committee for adoption is currently being operated by which it is envisaged that persons declared suitable to adopt by the Irish Adoption Board who wish to adopt Romanian children are to process their applications to adopt in Romania through the Adoption Board; and if not, the reason the agreement is not in operation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 the Minister for Health signed an agreement on working arrangements for the co-ordination of inter-country adoption with the Romanian committee for adoption.  This committee was dissolved earlier this year and a new committee established in Romania.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the new Romanian committee for adoption forwarded a new draft agreement to the Adoption Board.  No advance notification was received in writing or otherwise from the Romanian committee of its intention to withdraw from the original agreement.  Paragraph 11 of the 1994 agreement states that either party may terminate the agreement by giving three months notice in writing to the other party of this intention and that such termination will not affect the completion of adoptions already in progress. It would appear that the Romanian authorities have suspended all adoptions of Romanian children by Irish couples pending the signing of the new agreement.</P>
      <P>The new draft agreement was examined by both my Department and the Adoption Board and it was agreed that a number of minor amendments should be proposed.  My Department wrote to the Romanian Government in mid-September, 1997, enclosing a draft of the proposed amendments. The Romanian Secretary of State for Adoptions acknowledged receipt of the proposed amendments on 24 September 1997 and confirmed that they will be examined at the next meeting of the Romanian committee for adoption. I am hopeful that a new agreement will be concluded in the near future.</P>

      <P>Couples wishing to adopt children in China must forward the requisite documents to the Ministry of Civil Affairs in Beijing under cover of a letter from either a relevant government body or a non-governmental organisation recognised by the State for the purpose of assisting Irish couples proposing to adopt abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Adoption Board is the relevant government body in this instance and in April of this year the then Minister of State approved International Orphan Aid as a non-governmental organisation for the purpose of transmitting applications for adoption from China.  However, the final decision regarding approval of International <Col N="633" /> Orphan Aid is one for the Chinese authorities. Following my Department's initial correspondence with the Chinese authorities last May, a number of follow up inquiries were made through the Department of Foreign Affairs with a view to obtaining a response to our letter but no response was received.  Since taking up office as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, I arranged for the issue of a second letter to the Chinese authorities in late August 1997 and I took the opportunity to restate my Governments commitment to the adoption of Chinese children by Irish couples but again, no response has been received to date and the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to pursue the matter on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board, for its part, has formally transmitted documentation to the Minister of <Col N="634" /> Civil Affairs in Beijing on behalf of a number of Irish couples wishing to adopt children in China but the Chinese authorities have yet to process the applications and again, the Department of Foreign Affairs is doing everything possible to progress matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of registrars of marriages under the provisions of the Marriages (Ireland) Act 1844 is a matter for me as Minister.  However the administration of the registration system for marriages is a matter for An t-Árd Chláraitheoir (Registrar-General) of Births, Deaths and Marriages and appointments of registrars of marriages are made on the advice of An t-Árd Chláraitheoir. For a number of years the policy has been to make such appointments for a specified period to facilitate An t-Árd Chláraitheoir in the exercise of his functions in relation to standards of registration practice.  Each registrar of marriages appointed under the 1844 Act holds that office at the pleasure of an t-Árd Chláraitheoir. The registrar is required to maintain an office within his/her designated district and the duties of the registrar include the solemnisation of marriages in his/her own office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of the current Registrar of Marriages for the District of Dublin is due to <Col N="637" /> expire on 31 December 1997 and the arrangements for the solemnisation of marriages by the Registrar of Marriages in Dublin is currently under review.  That review has to have regard not only to the suitability of any person being considered for such an appointment but also the suitability of the premises in which marriages might be solemnised.  The Deputy may be assured that until a registrar of marriages ceases to hold office he or she is empowered to carry out all the duties of the office and also that a registrar on appointment would be obliged to recognise all validly issued licences and certificates for marriage issued by the previous registrar.  In addition if a person, other than the current holder of the office, is appointed Registrar of Marriages for the district of Dublin in January 1998 his/her office would be at a convenient location in the city of Dublin and would have to meet certain standards of suitability.  The new registrar would be expected to facilitate parties for whom dates for the solemnisation of marriages had been arranged by the outgoing registrar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>Cardiac surgery is provided at two centres, the Mater Hospital and Cork University Hospital, and there has been substantial funding made available to both hospitals in recent years in respect of the development of cardiac surgery facilities.  This year the Mater Hospital has been funded to perform 1,000 cardiac surgery procedures and Cork University Hospital has been funded to perform a total of 400 cardiac procedures. Specialty service budgets within individual hospitals are not a matter for the Department of Health.  An overall annual service plan is agreed with hospitals within the total budget. Both hospitals have confirmed that they are on target to meet their agreed cardiac surgery activity levels by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also wish to know that a sum of £1.6 million is being made available under the 1997 waiting list initiative specifically for cardiac surgery patients, adults and children.  As in 1996, <Col N="638" /> the main aim is to reduce the existing national cardiac surgery lists.  The Department's strategy for achieving this aim involves the purchase of additional cardiac procedures and the selection of suitable patients for medical cardiac therapies.  I must emphasise that high standards of evaluation and audit will be applied to the initiative.  Participating agencies will be required to demonstrate clearly how the additional activity has impacted upon existing waiting lists and a full report will be required from each hospital on the matter.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the number of persons currently awaiting cardiac surgery, within each health board area, this information is not routinely available.  However, I have requested the hospitals concerned to provide this information and I will forward it to the Deputy when available.</P>

      <P>The area in question is a priority habitat for the purposes of the EU Habitats Directive and as such the State is required to afford it the highest level of protection. There are a number of proposals for housing development in this area.  The proposal referred to by the Deputy has been assessed by my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service and I am advised that this development would have a significant adverse impact on the site.  Accordingly, my Department, which is responsible for nature conservation in Ireland including implementation of the Habitats Directive, had no alternative but to object to the proposed housing development.</P>

      <Quest>if the people of Briska, Bangor Erris and Ballina, County Mayo, should be eligible for a reduced television licence fee in view of the fact that RTE expects them to pay for the repairs of their transmitter when such a service is usually provided nationwide for free.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 416 of 30 September 1997 regarding the Briska area of Bangor Erris, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>The issue of television reception raised by the Deputy is the day-to-day responsibility of the RTE Authority and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, RTE informs me that it has a long standing policy of assisting local communities in fringe reception areas by way of capital grants/annual maintenance contributions towards self help schemes which are transmission systems installed and maintained by local communities. RTE states that there are 110 such schemes in the country, one of which is in Briska.  RTE has informed me that it authorised a payment of £300 towards repairs of this scheme on 6 May 1997 and has had no official contact since, other than a letter of acknowledgment and gratitude for the allocated moneys.  I, therefore, suggest that the promoters of the system should establish fresh contact with RTE.</P>
      <P>Under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988, a television set is defined as apparatus for wireless telegeraphy and the requirement to hold a licence, granted on payment of the prescribed fee, in respect of the possession of a television set is a universal obligation.  I have no plans to provide for reductions or rebates of the television licence fee as suggested by the Deputy and I consider that the operation of such a scheme would, in any event, be impractical.</P>

    <P>I am also informed that the current Garda personnel strength at Glanmire Garda station (as of 31 August 1997 is 15 members (all ranks).  The station is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday and from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sundays. There are two patrol units assigned to Glanmire station and these are utilised in patrolling the Glanmire area.  The Garda authorities report that, in addition to these two patrol units, the district patrol car based at Cobh patrols the Glanmire area as required.  They point out that generally resources at Glanmire, Watergrasshill, Glenville and Carrignavar stations are combined for the purpose of patrolling all four areas.  These <Col N="644" /> areas form the northern part of Cobh Garda District.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the local divisional officer is satisfied that the policing arrangements in place for Glanmire are adequate and there are no plans at present to have Glanmire Garda station open on a 24-hour basis.  However, they have assured me that policing pertaining to Glanmire will continue to be monitored and reviewed and changes made as necessary.</P>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children with more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools including schools dedicated to children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional/behaviourial disorders.</P>
      <P>The following special educational supports are provided at present in County Mayo: two special schools for children with mild mental handicap; two special schools for children with moderate mental handicap; three special classes for mildly mentally handicapped children in mainstream national schools; 33 remedial teachers, who provide a service to 112 national schools; and three resource teachers, who provide a service to 14 national schools.</P>

    <P>My Department is now commencing a review of the operation of a pilot programme of special education services for children with autism which was first introduced for the 1995-96 school year. My Department will be consulting the Irish Society for Autism as part of this process.
