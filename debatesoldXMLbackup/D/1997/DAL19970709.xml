    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, it is the practice for changes in the responsibilities of Ministers and Departments to be made by orders under section 6 (1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939, where statutory functions are concerned.  Where other functions are concerned changes are effected through administrative action.  Legislation will not be necessary for the changes to be effected on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Government made a series of orders yesterday to come into effect this week which implement most of the changes I previously outlined to the House.  They will bring into effect the changed descriptions of the Ministers for, and Departments of Agriculture and Food; the Marine and Natural Resources; Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and Islands; Social, Community and Family Affairs; Health and Children; Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Public Enterprise; Tourism, Sport and Recreation; Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>An order to create the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources will soon be made. Orders have also been made transferring responsibilities for forestry to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and trade to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Departments of Justice and Equality and Law Reform have been amalgamated. An order for the transfer of mining responsibilities to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is virtually completed and will, I expect, be made later this month.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will have full responsibility for marriage support services; family mediation services; births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and for progressing other issues, in particular initiatives in the community for children arising from the Commission on the Family due to report in a few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other areas where I indicated transfers of administrative functions &mdash; for example, in relation to rural development, western development and local development &mdash; involve a mix of activities.  These activities were undertaken variously under Statute or, in whole or in part, under European Union regulations.  Others operate on a non-statutory basis.  Since coming into Government I have arranged for the various activities involved to be clearly identified and for the legal basis of each to be ascertained so that the necessary action can be taken to allocate them to the appropriate Ministers within the next week or two.  Administrative action has also been initiated <Col N="103" /> to effect the transfer of functions in relation to sport and the islands.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to retain the office of science and technology on a broadly similar footing to that which obtains at present but I am taking steps to ensure the alignment distribution of responsibilities between the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education is redesigned.  By doing that we intend to develop a new science focus in the Department of Education, deliver a stronger technology focus at second level, streamline the wide research work of the third level institutions and devise an education response to any emerging skills gap in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, in addition to his Cabinet responsibilities, will deputise as necessary for the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the General Affairs Council and other European Union meetings.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence, as heretofore and as required, will attend meetings of the Western European Union as observers.  In regard to Northern Ireland matters the Minister for Defence will act as alternate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs from time to time at the request of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As Taoiseach I will continue to have a major function in European affairs and Northern Ireland.  As the statement of strategy of the Department of the Taoiseach states, the Taoiseach has a leadership role and a corresponding involvement in all major policy areas, principally Northern Ireland, economic, employment and social issues and European and wider international policy.  I intend to discharge this role to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach change his mind about allocating responsibility for European affairs to Deputy Andrews under the direction of Deputy Burke, the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Was this dithering on his part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to ensure that, unlike in the past, there would be a consistency in who would represent the Minister for Foreign Affairs at various meetings.  There were two ways to do that.  One was to have a Minister for European Affairs and legislate for it or alternatively, to designate the Minister for Defence when appropriate to take the position.  The latter is a satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.  It is also satisfactory that at either European or Northern Ireland meetings, which I hope will be held several days a week, there will be consistency in who represents the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not appointed a Minister of State to the Department of Social Welfare.  Why not, given that it is one of the largest Departments?  Does he believe it would have made more sense to allocate Minister of State responsibility for children to the Department <Col N="104" /> given that it delivers support primarily to families and children and the Commission on the Family will report to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs will deal with the Commission on the Family.  Responsibility for children will be shared by a number of Departments. Legislation will be dealt with by the Department of Justice while many other matters will be dealt with by the Department of Health and, as in the past, the Minister of State will have a co-ordinating role because the matter involves at least four Departments.  Given that point of view the Deputy is correct.  I discussed the issue of a Minister of State but for the foreseeable future the Minister is happy to engage himself in those responsibilities.  Given that some of the other issues such as local development and drugs initiatives are being linked to the Department of Tourism and Sport it will mean that the Minister of State will be involved in some of the issues raised by the Deputies.  As Taoiseach I will chair the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion.  I want to ensure the work initiated by the previous Government which involves five or six Departments moves forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach seek and obtain advice from the Attorney General prior to his announcement of the various responsibilities and, if so, will he indicate the advice of the Attorney General in that respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  Because of the closeness of the position I got a short briefing note from the Cabinet Secretariat on the functions.  I did not have access to everybody, as happened on previous occasions, to discuss particular functions. The briefing note I received from the Cabinet Secretariat was quite helpful.  On taking up office on the first day I went through each of the functions, whether orders or delegated functions, to see what was the best way to deal with these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that on the day of the Taoiseach's election &mdash; on which I congratulate him &mdash; the proposed allocation of responsibilities, which did not turn out to be operational or constitutional, was decided by him without the advice of the designate Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can take it that is correct.  When I checked out the matter the previous week, because of the position of the Government I had not got access to these issues in the normal way but I did get a briefing note. On other matters on which we sought advice from the outgoing Attorney General he was extremely helpful.  On the constitutionality question, Deputy Spring pointed out the last day that legislation would be required.  That proved to be correct. Therefore, it was a matter of dealing with it either by legislation or the way I sought to deal with <Col N="105" /> it immediately, which was adequate.  It had been pointed out to me by numerous parties that the concept of having a different person was not a good one.  This is not a criticism of anybody.  It was better to have the same person and in this case the Minister for Defence who is very capable and can stand in on these matters.  I am very anxious that he should do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept he made a mistake in the initial announcement in regard to European Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I could have dealt with it either way.  To avoid confusion I quickly moved to deal with it in the way I did.  I could have done it the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice from the Attorney General was that I could legislate for it.  That would have meant waiting until the autumn and I was not prepared to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did make a mistake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is proposing to change the name of the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Social, Family and Community Affairs.  What is the estimated cost of the proposed change?  Will it be borne by the Department and will an additional allocation be made available?  Given the size of that Department, the number of buildings it has and the amount of signage and documentation, etc.  which will have to be changed, will there be an additional allocation to cover the cost of such changes?  If the Taoiseach does not have the information, perhaps he will arrange for it to be conveyed to me.</P>
      <P>Is it intended that the Department will give greater emphasis than it already does to family and community affairs?  If so, will the Taoiseach agree this will require the appointment of a Minister of State to that Department to carry the burden of that work?  Does he agree that at the least the current Minister of State with responsibility for children's affairs might be allocated to the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly consider that. The Minister of State with responsibility for children will have a co-ordinating role.  If it makes more sense to make orders across Departments, I will arrange that.  Deputy Currie did that job successfully in the past.  I have no objection to that, because different matters relating to children are dealt with by different Departments.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that if all documentation, signs, etc.  were to be changed immediately it could cost up to £2 million.  The Minister has no intention of doing that.  Existing stationery and other data will be used, and that will minimise the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="106" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this really well thought out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs was extremely well thought out.  The document put forward by my party many months ago was an excellent document that well researched the issues of the family and built on the excellent work of the Department of Social Welfare which continued under Deputy De Rossa.  It was discussed with the relevant agencies throughout the country and looked at ways to expand the role of the Department, not diminish its responsibilities.  The title came from that document, and we were glad to incorporate it in the title of the Department and to work on the expansion of its role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this proposal was very well thought out, how is it the Taoiseach is proposing to allocate responsibility for children to one Minister and responsibility for the family to another? Could there be any more evidence than this that it has not been thought out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare always had responsibility for the family, although it was not mentioned in its title.  The Children Bill was prepared in the Department of Justice, matters relating to the education of children are dealt with in the Department of Education, and other issues relating to children are dealt with by other Departments.  What I hope to do is to co-ordinate these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that, because of the nature of the job of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who may have to go to another meeting at short notice, it is normal practice for the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs to accompany him to General Affairs Council meetings?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention that the Minister for Defence will accompany the Minister for Foreign Affairs at General Affairs Council meetings?</P>
      <P>Following setting up the Task Force on Communicating Europe, as recommended by the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and which was chaired by me, is it intended the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, will chair it, as we are to have a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty and it will be important to ensure that the task force continues its work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have responsibility for European matters. If he cannot attend meetings, his Minister of State will attend.  At certain meetings the Minister for Defence will act as an alternate.  On the question of the Task Force on Communicating Europe, I have already transferred its role to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach change his mind about the role of the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology? <Col N="107" /> While I welcome the change I am sure many people would like to be reassured as to the policy considerations that caused the change.  Will the Minister for Education still be known as the Minister for Education and Science &mdash; as announced on the night the Government was formed &mdash; even though he is now reposed in the Department of Enterprise and Employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be involved in both Departments.  As Deputy Rabbitte knows, there are many important considerations in this brief.  In the past week I have had a number of meetings with representatives from the Departments of Education and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Minister of State's responsibility in both Departments will ensure our education system responds dynamically to existing opportunities.  It is a matter for the Department of Education to ensure we produce graduates in the area of science and technology while at the same time the enterprise sector must harness new technologies.  The Minister of State will have responsibility in both those areas.  It would not make sense to take enterprise matters out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or to take educational matters out of the Department of Education.  Perhaps in the future they can be dealt with under one Department. For the first time in many years key people from the industry sector were invited to the Department of Education last week to discuss this matter.  I also held discussions with the Tánaiste.  The working group set up by Deputy Rabbitte last year suggested the Taoiseach should also be involved in this area.  It was suggested the matter should be dealt with by the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will implement the recommendation in that report to hold meetings with the people involved on a quarterly basis.  We are not changing what already exists.  We are trying to develop the educational aspect of science and technology because it is through education that we will produce people with the necessary qualifications to fill jobs in that area.  This sensible arrangement has the agreement of all the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>What about the Minister for Education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What functions in the Department of Education does the Taoiseach intend to delegate to the Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology?  Will he have responsibility for curriculum reform?  Will he develop a primary school curriculum in the area of science?  What role will the Minister of State play in the Department of Education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister of State will assist in the development of technology in first, second and third level education.  As pointed out in the report, much work needs to be done and <Col N="108" /> the Minister will have the necessary powers to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the role of technology in education goes way beyond what the Taoiseach has in mind for the Minister of State.  Technology is used in teaching practically all subjects.  What specific functions will be assigned to the new Minister of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He will have specific tasks but he should not have a direct influence in the curriculum. He can put forward proposals.  We have already given a commitment to develop technology in all primary and secondary schools.  We will designate to the Minister of State whatever functions are necessary to achieve that.  He has already started work on a number of areas identified as needing development.  Responsibility for the curriculum will remain a matter for the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach is in a mode of reconsideration, will he reconsider putting the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo; back into the ministry, which loosely replaces the ministry I had the honour to hold for a brief period?  Will he tell the House why the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; was dropped?  Given the gains made in advancing the case of Irish culture internationally, the work of the cultural council in Europe and that the drift of the title of such departments in Europe is towards culture ministries, why did the Taoiseach take the narrow British definition of the ministry?  For example, the word &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; could be excluded from the present title.  Would it not be more inclusive and make good sense for the reasons I put forward for the Taoiseach, even at this stage, to consider restoring the term &ldquo;culture&rdquo; to the ministry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made that point previously and I said I would look at it.  The role and functions of the Department are described in the document he prepared, statement of strategy in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. It states that the Department's main areas of responsibility may be brought together under the combined concepts of culture and heritage in the broadest sense as signified by the unifying word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; which incorporates the Irish language into our definition of culture in an explicit way as a major cultural force in our society.  The meaning of the word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; is heritage.  All the functions there are encompassed in that.  Having examined the Deputy's strategy document I do not see the point in changing the title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; was in two paragraphs in the Strategic Management Initiative document from which the Taoiseach quoted. If I were to use the word so frequently I would probably be criticised today for it.  The removal of the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; from the ministry was extraordinary.  It was included in the title of the <Col N="109" /> Department to make clear who had responsibility for cultural industries.  Who has responsibility for them now?  What will be the role of the Minister with responsibility for culture and diversity in arguments about broadcasting and the media? What will the person who attends cultural council meetings be called?  How will rural-urban demands, popular culture, contemporary culture and public culture be handled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence will look after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has decided that the word &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; recommends itself to it as a gesture.  When the Taoiseach reconsiders the full document will he bear in mind that the national and international interest will be served for many reasons by reconsidering the title?  I will leave it at that.  While I support and wish my successor well, it is a complete misconstruction of the ument and the term &ldquo;oidhreacht&rdquo; to suggest that it offers an opportunity to destroy the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; when everyone welcomed it and its inclusion followed the international direction.</P>

      <P>I note what the Deputy stated, but all the powers and functions that existed will continue to be held by the Minister, Deputy de Valera.  It is argued that the word &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; allows a broader definition and that argument was made in the Deputy's strategy document.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reference to my success as Minister with responsibility for children.  Will he accept that a large part of that success was due to the fact that I had a co-ordinating role in the Departments of Health, Education and Justice? How will a Minister based in the Department of Health co-ordinate activities in the other two Departments, particularly in relation to the Children Bill, without having a position in those two Departments?  The Children Bill was in gestation for more than 20 years.  The reason it took so long was precisely because there was not a co-ordinating role.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 22, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, on Thursday last.  I had earlier met the Secretary of State in Belfast on Tuesday, 1 July.</P>
      <P>Prior to my meeting with the British Prime Minister I met representatives of the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition and the Lower Ormeau Community Council.  I met them again today when I spent some time at their meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I have also had contacts with representatives of the Orange Order.  In all of my meetings I supported and advocated local dialogue and accommodation and expressed my support in good faith for the efforts of the Secretary of State to reach accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parades issue figured prominently in my discussions with Prime Minister Blair last Thursday. I was concerned to avoid a repetition of the disastrous events of last year, the effects of which have remained with us all year.  I had already, when in Belfast the previous Tuesday, indicated my understanding of the difficult situation confronting the Secretary of State and my support for her efforts to reach an accommodation &mdash; efforts which, I believe, were entirely genuine &mdash; but I had also advised strongly against forcing a parade through the Garvaghy Road, in the absence of an accommodation.  On and since Sunday, I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have expressed our deep disappointment and that of the Government at the decision that was taken and at the way in which it was implemented.  After two years in which the parade from Drumcree went ahead, it might reasonably have been expected that this <Col N="113" /> year, in the absence of agreement, the decision would have been different.</P>
    <P>In all our contacts, the Government called for the rule of law to be upheld, a position to which the British Government has also committed itself. It was, therefore, particularly disturbing that the Chief Constable of the RUC, in explaining his decision, essentially ascribed it to a more serious threat of loss of life among Catholics.  It is, however, also deplorable that there was such violence across Northern Ireland in reaction to the decision about Drumcree, violence that included shooting, bombing and arson attacks.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to condemn all acts of sectarianism as well as paramilitary attacks and threats, from whatever quarter.  I wish to express my sympathy to all the victims of the ongoing violence including, in particular, the two young boys from each side of the divide who were injured over the weekend.  I also condemn the recent attacks on trains owned by Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann, as a direct attack on an important link between both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>Dialogue and accommodation remain the way forward on this issue and have to be further developed.  The Government did not wish to see anyone humiliated in Portadown, nor do we wish to see this happen anywhere else in Northern Ireland.  We understand and sympathise with the concerns of Northern Nationalists about the expressions or connotations of dominance and triumphalism that can attach to parades by the marching Loyal Orders in Northern Ireland.  We understand and empathise with the concerns of Unionists and Orangemen who perceive that their identity and culture risk being suppressed or marginalised.</P>
    <P>The Government will stand up for and speak for the rights of Nationalists in Northern Ireland but we have no wish to do so at the expense of the legitimate rights of Unionists.  There are important issues of parity of esteem, protection of minority rights and the free practice of religion which have to be taken into account.  In our view it is fundamentally wrong and contrary to all the principles of good neighbourliness, in view of all the history of conflict and trouble it has caused, to force Orange marches through Nationalist areas where they are unwelcome, without agreement or consent.</P>
    <P>As the Prime Minister has emphasised, the principle of consent should be a two-way process. Governments all over the world will, sensibly, do everything to avoid a situation where a group marches through an area densely populated by people of a different tradition, where there is a history of communal antagonism.  Widespread public disorder is the almost inevitable consequence.</P>
    <P>In a situation of competing rights, the exercise of rights has to take place on a basis of proportionality and mutual respect for the dignity of the other person and, therefore, in a context of dialogue and accommodation.  I salute the considerable <Col N="114" /> efforts made by the Garvaghy Road residents to have direct dialogue.  I very much regret that this did not happen.  I acknowledge the efforts made by people in the leadership of the Orange Order but I would call upon them in regard to parades planned for the future to take that extra crucial step towards dialogue.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all in Northern Ireland to pursue such dialogue and accommodation in the days and weeks ahead and, above all, to turn away from violence and confrontation.  Beyond that it is essential that the opportunity is taken, in formulating and enacting the promised legislation on parades, for a far-reaching review of the whole parades issue so that it does not continue to overshadow the efforts to promote peace and harmony in Northern Ireland.  Our overriding priority must be to tackle seriously the wider political issue in Northern Ireland and to secure agreement, if at all possible on a fully inclusive basis, on a fair and balanced settlement, within which all the issues can be dealt with.  Last Thursday the Prime Minister and I agreed we have to keep the focus on this and aim to get an agreement within the timeframe already outlined by the British Government.  This timeframe may be ambitious, but the events of the weekend again underline the urgency of bringing about a settlement that will command the widest possible support.</P>
    <P>In this perspective, the Prime Minister and I discussed the talks process and the current situation there.  We agreed the joint paper on decommissioning recently tabled by the two Governments forms a good basis on which all parties should feel able to deal with this issue and to move forward to substantive negotiations in the three strands.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions on a range of issues relating to building confidence, we welcomed the commitments made by the new Government in Britain to building such confidence in Northern Ireland and encouraged progress on these issues. We stressed the enormous contribution to confidence building that could be made by taking appropriate action on Bloody Sunday and the importance of progress on issues relating to prisoners, an issue of concern on both sides of the political divide, as well as our concerns about the use of plastic bullets.</P>
    <P>I met the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday on Wednesday last.  I stressed my support for the relatives and their campaign.  The assessment recently submitted to the British Government is a compelling document and the Widgery report must be repudiated.  The truth of Bloody Sunday must be told and acknowledged.</P>
    <P>Concerning Irish-British relations, Irish Governments have always fostered the development of close and friendly relations across the Irish Sea.  They bring mutual benefit to both countries.  The previous Government also took some initiatives which, it was agreed last Thursday, should be pursued.  I am committed to enhancing efforts in this area.  East-West is of <Col N="115" /> course one of the three strands for the talks process and we will need to take it forward in that framework with the other strands, where we will be anxious to develop the North-South strand along the lines set out in the Joint Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Regarding meetings with the parties in Northern Ireland, my Government has already had bilateral meetings with a number of them in this framework.  We will continue to meet parties and I will respond positively to requests for meetings from parties exclusively committed to democratic and non-violent principles.</P>
    <P>The Government delegation to the talks at political level will comprise the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell.  In line with the arrangements made generally on Northern Ireland matters, the Minister for Defence will act as alternate for the Minister for Foreign Affairs from time to time, at my request.</P>
    <P>The Government is willing to go to great lengths to secure peace and to this end regards the maintenance of some channel of communication, direct or indirect, to all sections of the community as important.  The Government believes there is genuine potential to achieve an unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire and that it is crucial to realise this potential within a short-term perspective.  The Government believes that while genuine requests for clarification, whether from the British or Irish Governments, should be met, the essential basis is now in existence, in line with any reasonable expectations that may have been there prior to the calling of the 1994 ceasefire, and that it is now time for the Republican movement to decide definitively to embrace exclusively democratic and peaceful methods and to declare an unequivocal restoration of the August 1994 ceasefire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that in terms of political credibility it became more difficult for the Orangemen in Portadown to voluntarily abstain from the use of a right to march once a ban on the march in question had been called for by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Would he also accept that a public call by the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs for a particular approach to be taken to a march also made it more difficult for the Secretary of State to take that line of advice because the advice was offered publicly in advance of a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  Anything I or the Minister for Foreign Affairs said last week would not have surprised anyone.  Irish Governments have taken a similar position on this issue for a number of years.  The suggestion &mdash; I know Deputy Bruton did not make it but others did &mdash; that my comments were unhelpful and might in <Col N="116" /> some way have hindered the Orange Order from making a different decision is not tenable.  From all the information that was available to me, and from what I heard from the Orange Order and its local lodge, we are not talking about any compromise that would mean the march on the Garvaghy Road would not take place.  I believe my articulation of the Government's position was entirely appropriate at the time, particularly in the context of events which occurred in Drumcree last year and our belief that they would happen again this year.  I waited until the proximity talks and the initiative, which I fully supported, were out of the way before I stated anything, and of course I had been in direct communication with the Secretary of State.</P>
      <P>An hour ago I met the Garvaghy Road and Ormeau Road residents' associations.  Then and now I have continued, in so far as it has been possible, to urge them to try to continue to work in some balanced way.  All the Government wants to achieve is balance in these issues, that we try to seek dialogue and accommodation and that it is not just totally one-sided or perceived to be so. I make no apologies for expressing those sentiments.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach address his reply more specifically to Question No. 14, where I asked the Government's policy regarding contacts with Sinn Féin in the absence of an IRA ceasefire?  Is it proposed that there should be meetings between officials of his Department and Sinn Féin in the absence of such an unequivocal ceasefire?</P>
      <P>In the context of his meetings with the various groups in relation to marches, has he asked them to avoid counter demonstrations?  Will he join Mr. John Hume in calling for a voluntary moratorium on marches, counter demonstrations and street politics of various kinds given the very fraught situation which exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if there was not an insistence on so many counter demonstrations because it will lead to further difficulties throughout the summer.  We are trying to de-esca-late the incredible tension which has been generated. Some of the people involved directly are stating that it is worse than at any time in the past.  Whether or not that is an overstatement, it seems to be the consistent view of many of the community representatives, particularly on the Nationalist side, who fear that none of their considerations or efforts to reach compromise are being taken into account.</P>
      <P>Anything which heightens that pressure from any side is entirely unhelpful.  I have no difficulty in stating again, as I said to the British Prime Minister last week, the Secretary of State and all of the community groups on all sides with whom I have had a chance to talk, that they should try to ease things as much as possible, although there are some very difficult days ahead &mdash; there is no good in anybody denying that reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> All I seek to do, while we work through the British Government's <i>aide memoire</i> and other matters, is keep open some lines of communication to everybody.  That will last for a period of time.  Whatever the opportunities, it is now more difficult to keep the political process going but that is what we must keep doing, and that is what the British Prime Minister and I pledged last week.  We will continue to try to work through the assessment of the contents of the <i>aide memoire</i> and the decommissioning document. Any contacts in that context will be on points of clarification and that is useful as we see if we can work through this particular period.</P>

As Deputy Bruton said, in Belfast the Taoiseach publicly stated the Irish Government's position on Drumcree, while the UK's option paper of 20 June was apparently neither publicly nor privately communicated to the Irish Government. Does the Taoiseach accept that both these approaches are highly unsatisfactory and dangerous? What steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of this huge chasm in communications?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are attempting to ensure that whatever the British Government does and whatever decisions it makes are communicated. Last year it was communicated that the parade on Garvaghy Road would be blocked but it was not communicated that it would be pushed through.  I asked last week that, when the decision was made, it be communicated to the Irish Government in advance.  It was finally communicated to me at 7.40 a.m. last Sunday and a simultaneous communication was made by the Secretary of State to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We have asked that we be made aware of whatever developments are ongoing and I think we have established a good liaison on that.</P>
      <P>The question arises whether that will lead to a satisfactory resolution of the difficulty at the heart of this, which is that the Nationalist community feels its considerations are not being listened to.  We are still in communication with the British Government on that issue.  Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs had the opportunity to meet the Secretary of State again to restate those positions.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, when the Taoiseach met Garvaghy Road residents prior to his meeting with the British Prime Minister, he was specifically asked to request that the march would <Col N="118" /> not be forced down the road but would be re-routed. Did the Taoiseach raise this with the British Prime Minister and did he receive a reply at that time?</P>
      <P>The leaked document prepared for the Secretary of State is worrying and I assume the Minister for Foreign Affairs received some clarification yesterday during his meeting with her.  Given the existence of that document on 20 June, and given that meetings took place subsequently between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State, does the Taoiseach accept or otherwise believe that the British Government was dealing in good faith with the Irish Government on the matter of last Sunday's march?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the concerns of Garvaghy Road residents, publicly and otherwise.  It seemed, not from anything I read but from all the communications available to me &mdash; of which there are many, as Deputy Spring knows &mdash; that the likely security advice would be to push the march through.  I expressed our strong concerns about that, the ramifications which would arise from it and the difficulties it would pose for the other marches.  The Prime Minister replied that the matters were still under consideration and that he would inform us as soon as a final decision was made.  As I said, that final decision was communicated to me at 7.40 a.m. on Sunday, almost four hours after the British Army and RUC had moved into their positions.</P>
      <P>As to the document, yesterday the Secretary of State told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that these were scenarios and positions that were being looked at.  I think Deputy Spring and the House can take it that the intentions of the security forces, but not necessarily those of the Secretary of State, were to take this option, and this was the case for some considerable time.  In my view, the Secretary of State genuinely tried to get dialogue and believed she might succeed in doing so through the proximity talks.  As soon as that failed, the document and the aspirations of the security forces came into play.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach agree if there is to be a settlement in Northern Ireland both communities, Nationalist and Unionist, and both sets of political leaders will have to ask their supporters and followers to accept unpalatable compromises? Does he agree that is made more difficult <Col N="119" /> if the Irish Government avowedly takes the side of one section of Irish people against the interests of another section of Irish people?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to give equal respect and dignity to the identity and rights of both Nationalists and Unionists.  The Irish Government will argue for that continuously. There is also an absolute need to stick to the fundamental principles of democracy, which are non-violence and the advancement of political objectives through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>However, in trying to seek accommodation and dialogue on the march which has just taken place and the one due to take place in the immediate future, the strong feeling of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and its elected leaders is that its concerns and the arguments put forward are not being listened to by the British Government.  In fairness to the British Government, I do not believe it or anybody else was happy with the reasons given by the head of the RUC for pushing the marches through.</P>
      <P>Any Government must protect and balance people's equal rights.  I asked the other day if it was reasonable to allow people to march down Garvaghy Road from a church while penning other people in for ten hours and preventing them from going to their church.  That issue has been put forward.  As Deputy Bruton knows, under international law the right to assemble and march is restricted.  Restrictions have been put on that right in Northern Ireland over the years.  The Nationalists are not looking for victories; they understand there has to be compromise.  All we, as a Government, ask for is a balanced consideration of these issues.  That is the request we have put to the British Government.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach impress once again on the Northern Ireland Office, the RUC and the Orange Order the net effect of the decision in regard to the Garvaghy Road?  The effect was to sideline not only the leaders of the Nationalist community but also the peaceful community workers, whom Patricia McKenna MEP and I met.  They felt they had been used as a decoy and, as such, were redundant to the people who are more given to violence.  Could he use his influence in international fora to ban the use of plastic bullets which have been fired at people's heads in contravention of international law?  They are not the only way to contain violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the primary and fundamental importance of the relationship between the British and Irish Governments in seeking a solution to the conflicts in Northern Ireland, and also given the disastrous decision made at the weekend, does the Taoiseach accept the good faith of the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State in their dealings with him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept their good faith. The British Prime Minister said to me that, at the end of the day, he had to take a decision based on security considerations.  It was regrettable that some other alternatives available to him were not used but I do not believe he was involved in anything other than spelling out the position as it was.</P>
      <P>I am committed to working with him on the bigger question of moving the overall process on, which I believe is still possible.  The good work done on the decommissioning document and the <i>aide memoire</i>, two very substantial documents, form the basis of most of the objectives being sought by the conflicting parties.  Leaving aside the difficulties of the marching issues, those documents seem to address the aspirations of the republican movement and afford it an opportunity to make up its mind once and for all whether in favour of peace or a continuance of violence.  Those issues must be addressed.  Notwithstanding the difficulties of the marching season, acting with the British Government in total good faith I shall continue in the weeks immediately ahead to work on that crucial agenda.</P>

In the manner in which I intend bringing forward such proposals to Government I want to strike the right balance so that there will be no losers &mdash; that employment and workers rights both win.  It can be done.  It is a question of how we design the introduction of this commitment.  I am determined to do so in a way that will protect vulnerable workers and employment within our economy.</P>

As the Deputy knows, under the JLC, rates vary from £5.49 per hour in the case of a law clerk to £1.71 for general ancillary workers.  Clearly, it would not be appropriate to have the same rate for everybody.  We will have to take into account experience andlevel of skill but I am anxious that vulnerable workers should not suffer in the manner in which this will be done.  Emphasis will be placed on its introduction in a manner which will protect vulnerable workers, particularly those with low skills, and employment within our economy.</P>

If 75 per cent of members in each co-operative so approve, I will take into account the interests of consumers, suppliers &mdash; in this case the farmers &mdash; the need for rationalisation to ensure Irish companies can compete and the impact on employment.

I have not yet had two weeks to consider it.  I am aware of the difficulties involved because I read the files concerning below cost selling.  It is clear that the Attorney General's office has not finalised its view in that regard.  Without breaching the famous Cabinet confidentiality rule or the rules applying to Ministers, I must inform the Deputy that I am aware of the difficulties relating to this issue.

      <P>When the Competition Authority encouraged my predecessor, namely Deputy Bruton, to take certain enforcement proceedings he did not do so.  Therefore, he presumably believed that people were not abusing their dominant position. I have an open mind in respect of these issues.  It is clear that the closure of the Irish Press Group in recent years caused most damage to the newspaper industry.  I regret that different decisions were not made during the Deputy's time in my Department.  However, my mind remains open.  The Competition Authority has been given new powers which, in addition to other related issues, I want to examine in connection with this matter before reaching a final conclusion about how we can ensure competition and diversity in the Irish newspaper industry.</P>

      <P>Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to establish a high-level group, representative of interested parties, to consider proposals by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning trade union recognition.  This group is currently being established under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach.  I will be represented on the group through an official of my Department.  I will seek to give every assistance in the group to the social partners in their endeavour to arrive at mutually acceptable solutions. The group will report to me by end of 1997.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have such views and I will endeavour to ensure they are put forward to the high-level group by the officials of my Department who will represent me at its meetings.  I will not be drawn on those views at present because anything I might say could pre-empt the findings <Col N="126" /> of the high-level group.  It is important that we work to ensure that the social partners can reach a mutually acceptable agreement on this issue. That is my desire.</P>

      <P>This approach is at remarkable variance with the Minister's approach to a minimum wage, a topic on which she is happy to express her own views and proceed with her own approach before consultation with the social partners. She is not giving the House the benefit of her knowledge and views on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting what I said.  I did not say I was going to put forward views regarding how a national hourly minimum wage would be introduced without consultation with the social partners.  I said there would be full and widespread consultation on this matter. Regarding recognition of trade unions, there was a commitment by the previous Government - of which the Deputy was a member &mdash; in Partnership 2000 to set up a high level group to consider proposals from the ICTU.  I want to honour that commitment and establish that group which I hope will report to me by the end of 1997.  It will also report to the monitoring committee under Partnership 2000.  This is the appropriate manner for proceeding on this issue.  The Deputy knows there are many difficulties in this area.  Ireland has a very high trade union density with 48 per cent of the employee workforce belonging to trade unions.  This compares with 10 per cent in France.</P>
      <P>The trade union movement has played a significant role in the economy, particularly in recent years when our satisfactory state of industrial relations has been a major contributory factor to high economic growth.  In fairness to the ICTU we should established the high level group, the terms of reference of which are currently being drawn up by the Department of the Taoiseach. We hope to have it in place very shortly and to have the report by the end of the year.  We will act on the basis of what it recommends.</P>

      <P>The programme for the new millennium contains a commitment to establish 25,000 places which will pay the going rate for the job.  The action which I will take in this area will be driven by the need to ensure better opportunities for the long-term unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention is not to add to the existing 40,000 but to ensure that those engaged in the valuable work of community employment are valued for the work they do and that it is made more attractive for people to be involved in community employment by paying them a rate for the job.  The CORI pilot project which was in place for the past two years has been evaluated and we have to learn from that experience.  The intention is to have 25,000 people paid the going rate for the job.  This is an appropriate way to proceed.</P>

      <P>Is this not misleading for the general public who heard in the election campaign that this was a major issue and who will see that one of the planks in the programme for Government is the establishment of the 25,000 place programme?  Is it not a huge and dramatic let down for the long-term unemployed, allegedly a priority of this Government, to find that the system of working 20 hours for their £80 will be replaced by a system which will still pay £80 but on the basis of a notional rate for the job?  This is the only change envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term unemployed and those involved in community employment schemes will not feel let down.  During the lifetime of the Deputy's Government only 3,000 community employment scheme participants were paid the rate for the job.  This measure is a dramatic improvement on that record and many people will welcome that fact.  It is important that we understand the priorities and the concerns of the long-term unemployed.  In the first instance we want to give them valuable work and training opportunities and to ensure their dignity is returned to them by paying them the rate for the job.  This commitment seeks to ensure that 25,000 people are paid the rate for the job.  It is not merely a commitment in relation to this issue; we also want to look at other labour market interventions, many of which are operated from the Department of Social Welfare.  I have had preliminary discussions with the new Minister for Social Welfare and I intend to have further discussions with him to ensure that we provide worthwhile and valued work and training opportunities for those who are at the margins of our society, who are isolated and who have been stripped of their dignity and self-worth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>From a practical point of view, what does the Minister envisage the dramatic change will be for the long-term unemployed by being on this programme?  Is it not the case that they will receive the same amount of money?  In <Col N="128" /> most cases, they will be working the same number of hours and will be in the same programmes with the same sponsors.  How can the Minister present this as a significant development from the point of view of the long-term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, their contribution will be more valued and recognised.  The experience we have gained from the pilot CORI project, introduced by the Deputy's Government, is good and worthwhile and we want to build on that.  This programme is an acknowledgment by the Government that we wish to value, in a more meaningful way, the contribution made by people who engage in community employment.  As the Deputy is aware, paying people the rate for the job will give the individuals involved far more value than the current system.  That is one of the bones of contention and one of the reasons it is difficult for people to take up schemes.  I understand that as many as three in four people who are offered community employment refuse to partake in it.  That is very unsatisfactory.  The way the Government intends to proceed in relation to this issue and other labour market interventions is designed to encourage people to take up opportunities in community employment.</P>

What direction does the Tánaiste propose to take here? It is not enough to indicate that she will discuss this.  The House expects substance.

      <P>I intend to examine the existing regional structures at FÁS, IDA Ireland, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards.  We intend to have an open view with regard to delivering on this commitment, but I am determined to seek to deliver because it is bad for Ireland and for Dublin that so much happens in this region.</P>
      <P>Most industrial development in recent years has occurred in the five cities.  There are many aspects to this issue, such as infrastructural development, access and the availability of skilled labour.  When the Deputy was Minister he sought to redirect grant aid in favour of regions other than the larger cities.  The examination will include all of these matters and perhaps more. We are determined to make a serious effort to bring greater regional balance to industrial development in Ireland.</P>

In view of her expressed views <Col N="130" /> in the past with regard to county enterprise boards and the proliferation of development agencies, does she now intend to proceed with the abolition of these boards?  As a representative of a Dublin constituency will she agree that the greatest concentration of poverty and unemployment is nonetheless in urban areas, especially in Dublin, Cork and Limerick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great concentration of unemployment and marginalisation in the Dublin area, but many of the jobs located in Dublin have not necessarily gone to Dubliners; people follow jobs.  It is important, therefore, that we ensure balance so that there is a sustainable population throughout the regions.  In many cases the services in the Dublin region are unable to cope because there are too many people, while in other areas we cannot sustain services because there are not enough people.  As a small country of approximately 3.5 million we must be conscious of this.</P>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity to consider the role and future of the county enterprise boards. We want the most effective way possible of ensuring industrial development throughout the country, in the different regions and rural areas.  The Government will be committed to doing whatever is required to bring this about.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that in achieving such an objective it is necessary to aim towards a standardisation of the cost of goods and services with regard to the regions to avoid the present ludicrous situation where a telephone call from, say, Ballydehob to a Department costs five times as much as one from Ballyfermot?  This leads to extra location costs for Ballydehob.</P>

      <P>It is not the case that the policy has not been thought out.  It is something I have considered over a long period.  A range of measures is required.  Infrastructural development is needed and priorities must be agreed on this.  We need to ensure that there is an availability of skilled workers in the regions because they will not stay around in the absence of opportunities.  We also need to look at the grant aid package and the structures of Forbairt, FÁS and the IDA.  I have an open mind on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital for this economy, especially at this time, to look seriously at how we can develop the regions to ensure a sustainable population <Col N="131" /> throughout the country in so far as that is possible.

      <P>It is important, as the Deputy recognises, for Irish companies to be competitive whether they are small, medium or large.  In the global economy this is vital if they are to succeed or survive.  In my first day in office I was delighted to meet the National Competitiveness Council which Deputy Bruton established and I compliment him on its make-up.  I could not think of anybody better than Brian Patterson to chair it. If Irish companies are to be competitive a number of matters have to examined.  They must be innovative, examine their cost base and examine product development.  The council will play a valuable role enhancing the strengths of the economy which have brought such high levels of growth and drawing attention to any weaknesses that exist with a view to our remedying them.</P>
      <P>There are other matters involved and I wish to consult as many representative bodies as possible. I intend to be a Minster with an ear for those who work in exposed sectors.  That is extremely important.  There is a need to examine our tax system and there is a commitment in the programme for Government to do that.  There is also a need to examine our regulatory procedures, level of bureaucracy and other matters which often hinder enterprise and the development of an enterprise culture.  There are many aspects to my consultation and many of them come within the remit of other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are determined in so far as it is <Col N="134" /> possible to introduce appropriate policy responses to ensure the exposed sector of our economy is as protected as possible.  Through these responses and legislation, we will bear in mind the impact on competition and employment, particularly in relation to tax matters.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is speaking about the outgoing Government's White Paper which I read in Opposition.  There are many features of that White Paper I would like to have implemented but it would be premature at this stage to say what exactly I intend to do on this matter.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is a difficult issue and for some reason he was not in a position to implement its recommendations.  It is vital if our economy is to be competitive, if we are to have a skilled workforce and if the employment opportunities coming on stream are to be availed of by Irish workers that we have a training agency that is flexible and meets those needs.  So far as I can, I intend to bring that about but it will take some time.  I will give serious consideration to the recommendations in the White Paper prepared by the previous Government.</P>

It is a much wider brief than that which the former Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, had at the Department of Enterprise and Employment. The agencies under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will remain the responsibility of the Minister. <Col N="135" /> I will have widespread consultation, not only with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, and the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Smith, but with other Government colleagues because there are aspects of this matter that involve the former Department of Social Welfare and other Government Departments.

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks certainly did not strike a cord with the Deputy, so it is a bit much to have to listen to him putting forward such great ideas now.  I want to see women involved in work, in decision-making, fully involved in Irish life.  In so far as I can bring that about, that is what I will do.  I have an open mind on this issue. From time to time in the past FÁS had return to work schemes for married women, some of which were successful and some of which were not. There is a wide range of issues involved here.  The priority of this Government in relation to unemployment is to ensure that as many people as possible, including married women, single women, married men and single men have the opportunity and dignity of work.  We want, in so far as we can, to begin to move people from welfare to work and to training opportunities to bring that about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The workforce in Asahi voted yesterday to reject a management buyout proposal which would enable the operations in Killala to continue.  The company has incurred significant losses over many years arising from difficult market conditions for its product due to over-capacity and intensive price competition. The parent company in Japan has taken a strategic decision to withdraw some segments of the acrylic manufacturing business, including its Irish operations.  It is the parent company's strong preference that its withdrawal from Killala be effected through handing over the operations on favourable terms through a management led investment vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant support was on offer from the industrial development agencies and the company to assist with the restructuring of the business. The management buyout proposal involved substantial commitment from the parent company, local management and the industrial development agencies.  However, for the proposed restructuring to work this commitment must be matched by commitment and support from the workforce.  Restructuring inevitably means change.  Asahi has made it clear it cannot continue to operate in its present structure.  Cost reductions dictated by the market are fundamental <Col N="139" /> to the success of the management buyout proposal.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the importance of Asahi to Killala and the surrounding area.  The loss of the company would be a severe blow to the local economy.  It is extremely disappointing, therefore, that agreement was not reached on the proposal. I am ensuring the industrial development agencies continue to keep in close contact with the parent company and all the parties involved.  The agencies are meeting the vice-president of the parent company today.  I fear the Killala operation and the future of the 315 jobs are in serious jeopardy.  I urge all concerned to reflect carefully on the strong possibility of the closure of this company.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the economic devastation the loss of more than 300 jobs would wreak on an area such as Killala?  She stated that the commitment from the parent company must be matched by a commitment from the workers.  Does that mean she believes there has not been sufficient commitment from the workers?  She also stated she is seriously concerned about the future of the plant.  If that is the case, does she intend to speak to representatives of the parent company to stave off the decision which it stated is irrevocable following the workers decision of 7 June?</P>
      <P>When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Enterprise and Employment he travelled to Tokyo to deal with problems in Asahi some years ago.

As the Deputy is aware, 39 per cent of the workers voted in favour of the restructuring plan, so it was a relatively close call.  The unions are endeavouring to resolve the difficulties.

Is she prepared to meet the union leadership because the full merits of the MBO do not seem to have been properly appreciated?  From the details I have it would seem to be a relatively good deal, given the imminent closure of the factory and the possible loss of 325 jobs.  Is the Minister prepared to meet the union leadership to prevail on them in the interests of sanity and the salvation of the jobs to avoid the chaos that will ensue in the event of the factory closing and given there is a tight time frame within which to work?  Will she meet the union leadership immediately to impress upon them the merits of the case and the serious and disastrous situation?  Given that representatives of the Japanese management are in Dublin, is the Minister prepared to meet them and ask them to allow a longer breathing space so that an irrevocable decision will not be made on the closure until all aspects and possible solutions have been fully explored?</P>

This company, which contributes between £8 million and £10 million to the local economy, is the best example of regional policy in that area.  Having said that time is of the essence, will the Minister agree that it is up to her to intervene as distinct from being available because the package approved by the previous Government involves a significant commitment from the State and the parent company, Asahi?

The difficulties were apparent to the <Col N="141" /> previous Government.  If direct ministerial intervention would be helpful, it will be forthcoming, but it does not necessarily follow in all cases that it is the right procedure.  It may not be right at 4.30 p.m. today, but it may be the correct procedure two hours later.  If it is helpful and the right thing to do, I will do it.  I will take that course but only on the basis that it is the right thing to do and that it is not simply a public relations exercise.  That could be very damaging because there is a short time within which decisions must be made.</P>

The investment part of the package is the least difficulty.  As the Minister adverted to the narrowness of the decision when the workers voted for the package and the possible absence of information, is she happy there has been adequate consultation with the workers on the precise changes suggested in the management buyout package?  If she is less than satisfied, will she proactively seek to provide that information so there can be a break in the impasse?</P>

Efforts are being made to familiarise all the workers with the package on offer and the consequences of a positive decision not being made.  If I can play a role in that regard, I will be delighted to do so. There was extensive consultation in relation to this issue involving the workers and their union representatives.</P>

Forbairt and the trade unions are also involved and the labour relations machinery of the State is on standby to resolve the difficulties if necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said she is available to intervene and I ask her to do so immediately. This crisis represents the loss of 315 jobs in North Mayo, an area which has been devastated by unemployment for many years and which will find it hard to obtain substitute employment.  I <Col N="142" /> know the Minister said she is available to intervene but it may be too late in an hour's time. Now is the time to intervene.  Three hundred and fifteen jobs in the west is similar to a thousand jobs in Dublin.  I am asking the Minister to intervene immediately.  If anything should go wrong, a task force should be set up immediately, as in Dublin and elsewhere when there were job loss emergencies.</P>

      <P>I do not know how many times I have to say I am available if it is necessary or desirable.  As I said in response to Deputy Michael D. Higgins, ministerial intervention in matters of this kind is not necessarily always right.  If it is necessary in the next couple of hours, I am available to intervene and so are the agencies under the auspices of my Department.  The entire Government side is concerned about this matter, particularly the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Moffat, and Deputy Cooper-Flynn who both contacted me in this regard.  The matter has taken up some considerable time and will continue to do so.  I assure the Deputy we will do everything possible to save these jobs which are vital to Killala, Mayo, the west, and Ireland.</P>

Many of the State agencies and the unions have been involved in discussions on this issue.</P>

      <P>In the interval between the dissolution of the last Dáil and the assembly of this Dáil the deaths occurred of three respected former Members of this House &mdash; Flor Crowley, Noel Browne and Lionel Booth.  All of them contributed in their own way to make this country a better place for others.  May they rest in peace.</P>
      <P>Flor Crowley's active career in national politics began in 1965 when, against the odds, he was elected as a Fianna Fáil Deputy for the Mid-Cork constituency.  Serving in both the Upper and Lower Houses until 1982, Flor had a distinguished career.  He always served his constituency diligently and was most active in the Oireachtas, especially as a member of the Dáil Committee on Public Accounts.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil organisation and all the people of Cork are particularly saddened at Flor's passing in light of the tremendous service he gave to that county as a TD representing Mid-Cork and later Cork South-West and then as a Senator and for many years as a member of Cork County Council.  Flor was a larger than life figure who always had a genial smile.  He was a man of deeply held views and beliefs, in every sense a man of the people.  He was naturally thrilled in 1994 to see his son, Brian, elected so comfortably as a Member of the European Parliament.</P>
      <P>I am proud to say Flor was a personal friend of mine and that he enjoyed strong friendships on all sides of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Is trua linn go mór a bhás ach beidh sprid Flor Crowley linn i gcónaí.</P>
      <P>Dr. Noel Browne will be remembered for many and varied reasons.  Foremost among these was his courage to follow his beliefs.  He was fearless in taking on great causes and was most formidable in arguing his case with all those who disagreed with him.  He displayed something of Swift's &lsquo;savage indignation&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>Noel Browne was first elected to the Dáil in 1948 as a Clann na Poblachta Deputy and he was immediately appointed Minister for Health.  He quickly spearheaded a valiant and successful crusade to eradicate tuberculosis, a disease affecting thousands of families which had already devastated his family, claiming his father, mother and aunt.  Noel also suffered from the disease at that time.  In tackling TB, and his other famous work on the mother and child scheme, much of which had been pioneered by Fianna Fáil and was a watershed in Church-State relations, Noel Browne put the health and welfare of the people at the top of the Government's agenda.  As Minister for Health, he vigorously planned and implemented a hospital building programme and ensured that the dreaded scourge of TB was eventually banished from Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, he should not be remembered only for the many practical arrangements which he made, but for the challenging vision he possessed which brought about the introduction of many <Col N="147" /> innovations in health and social welfare services which we nowadays take for granted.</P>
    <P>Noel Browne also served the people and the Oireachtas well in Opposition, serving as an Independent and with the National Progressive Democratic Party, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Socialist Labour Party for Dublin South East and Dublin North Central between 1948 and 1982.  I am proud that for a few years at least he was a member of my party and in his autobiography he acknowledged his empathy with the rank and file of Fianna Fáil.  He also served as a Senator from 1973 to 1977.  In all his different roles he campaigned without ceasing for the people's good because he always was at heart a people's champion.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí sé réidh leis an pholaitíocht, chuaigh Noel siar go Connemara don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge, a chuir áthas ar a chroí.  Is trua linn a imeacht.</P>
    <P>We also recall the long, fruitful and dedicated life of former Fianna Fáil Deputy Lionel Booth. Born in 1914, Lionel witnessed almost every significant event in Irish history this century.  Prior to his career in politics, Lionel Booth served his country well as a captain in the Army during the Emergency.  Lionel's service at local level was evident in his membership of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation during the 1950s.</P>
    <P>Lionel was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1957 and he continued to serve his constituency of Dún Laoghaire most diligently for the next 12 years. His presence in the Dáil was testimony to his patriotism, though coming from a different tradition to the majority, and also demonstrated the more general desire present from the beginning that our political system should show tolerance and inclusiveness long before anyone began to speak about pluralism.</P>
    <P>A qualified solicitor, Lionel Booth will probably best be remembered as an astute businessman. He was both the joint managing director of Booth Poole and Company Limited from 1956 and managing director of the Brittain Group from 1970.</P>
    <P>On my own behalf, and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to convey our deepest condolences to the widows and families of those great Irishmen.  Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh an triúr.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the memory of three former Members of the House whom we have lost in a short space of time since the House last met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember Flor Crowley as a particularly close personal friend.  I met him first over a lengthy period when we were on business abroad which, as Members of the House will be aware, are occasions when one finds it possible to get to know members of other parties away from the normal antagonisms of political life in this House. I always considered him to be one of my close friends in politics.  He had a constant, and apparently <Col N="148" /> mischievous, twinkle in his eye but there was never any malice behind it.  He enjoyed good company.  He enjoyed his friends and family.  As the Taoiseach said, he was particularly proud at the success of his son, Brian, who followed him into the political arena.</P>
    <P>Flor Crowley was a distinguished sportsman in his youth.  He played rugby at a very high level and he carried the same robust good humour into politics.  He made friends in this House in all parties and he will be missed.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that I, as Taoiseach, was represented at his funeral by my <i>aide de camp</i>, who was able to convey to the Crowley family my personal feelings about the loss they had suffered.</P>
    <P>I also join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the memory of Dr. Noel Browne who was a doctor in the best traditions of medicine.  He put care for his patients and concern for their welfare at the top of his agenda.  He went into politics because he recognised his patients were affected by problems, notably tuberculosis, which could not be tackled without taking political action.  It was that concern for his patients' welfare &mdash; contained in the Hippocratic Oath, which he took when qualifying as a doctor &mdash; which drove him through his political career.  In my recollection he was one of the most eloquent speakers in this House.  He was at his most devastating when speaking most quietly.  When he spoke in an almost inaudible whisper, he vigorously flayed his opponents and those with whom he disagreed.</P>
    <P>I also had the privilege of knowing briefly the former Deputy Lionel Booth, who will be remembered not only as a Member of this House but as a successful businessman who gave substantial employment through his company, Booth Poole, on the west side of Dublin.  He was a man of unfailing courtesy and great dignity.  His work in this House was marked by a dignified demeanour which brought respect to political life.  He could have lived a comfortable and successful life if he had not entered politics and that he chose to do so in the interest of public service is a tribute to his memory and perhaps a small consolation to his family at this time of loss.  On behalf of Fine Gael, I express sympathy to the families of Flor Crowley, Noel Browne and Lionel Booth.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party I echo the remarks of the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton on the sad deaths of three former colleagues, Flor Crowley, Noel Browne and Lionel Booth.  Each of them made contributions to public life in different ways but served the people of their constituencies and of Ireland well.  I extend the deepest sympathy to their families.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Spring in offering my condolences and those of the Progressive Democrats to the families of the late Flor Crowley, Lionel Booth and Noel Browne.  Much <Col N="149" /> of what was said is true.  Noel Browne was a remarkable man, not just because of his contribution to public life but also because of the manner in which he sought to change attitudes.  The attitude adopted to the mother and child scheme shows the great progress made in the intervening years.  As the Taoiseach and Deputy Bruton said, he was a pioneer in many ways such as seeking to rid the country of tuberculosis and the manner in which he dealt with so many public issues. Until his death he was forthright in expressing his point of view.</P>
      <P>I served with Flor Crowley when I first entered the House 20 years ago and I knew him well. More recently he was proud of the outstanding victory his son Brian achieved in the European elections of 1994.  As the Taoiseach said, that brought him great joy.  His death is a sad loss to his family, his wife and his son and I express my sympathy to them.</P>
      <P>I did not know Lionel Booth but as Deputy Bruton said, we need to see more people from his professional and business background prepared to serve.  That he came from a minority religion is even more important in a country which is often dominated by majoritarianism.  I accept what others have said about his very distinguished career in this House, in addition to his distinguished career in business.</P>

I did not know Flor Crowley or Lionel Booth, except by reputation and from newspaper reports of Lionel Booth's business activities and Flor Crowley's work in the House.</P>
      <P>Noel Browne was a political inspiration to my generation.  Anyone who grew up in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s would know of Noel Browne and those of us on the left, especially, took great courage from his stances on a range of issues.  I do not know if many people remember when dogs were set on him and Jack McQuillan during an antiapartheid march, which resulted in a court case which he won.  That is a small demonstration of the kind of man he was.  He never dodged an issue or decision, although in many cases it meant a harder life for him.  We owe a great deal of gratitude to those three men, but particularly to Noel Browne for the stances he took and the courage he demonstrated in politics.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Green Party, I join with my colleagues in expressing sympathy to the family and friends of the late former Deputies Flor Crowley, Noel Browne and Lionel Booth.  I knew Flor Crowley to some extent, although not as well as other Members did.  I knew him as a legendary figure in west Cork politics when I was teaching in Dunmanway.  From a local perspective, there is no doubt the name of Crowley was synonymous with Flor Crowley in <Col N="150" /> that area.  Anytime I passed through Bandon on my way to Green Party meetings in Cork I saw the name of Crowley and that memory will live on for many years.  He left a legacy of hard work for the people of Cork and has an excellent successor in his son Brian, who is an MEP for Munster and of whom he was justly very proud.</P>
      <P>I have read a considerable amount about Dr. Noel Browne and, as has been said, he was an inspiration to many people involved in any form of radical change.  Is mór an cailliúnt é do pholaíocht na tíre seo.  Bhí clú air de bharr an chonspóid a bhain leis an scéim máthair agus linbh.  Many other things which he did so quietly will also be referred to many times after his passing.</P>
      <P>At this time we need, in particular, to reflect on his views on ethical investment.  He questioned the use of the Irish Sweepstakes money &mdash; he wanted it to be spent on health services rather than just being invested.  His example should be followed today in terms of ethical investment.</P>
      <P>I did not know the late Deputy Lionel Booth but I knew he was a TD for Dún Laoghaire.  I never heard a bad word said about his long years of service.  He was always respected and brought a level of respect to politics which needs to be maintained and enhanced today.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamn uilig.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. I wish to speak about the memory of Noel Browne, with whom I was acquainted.  Noel Browne was a socialist who detested the inordinate power and influence wielded by a small and powerful élite within society to whom he often referred as drawing their power from the economic interests and resources they controlled.  He attempted and did speak out on behalf of those ordinary people often at the receiving end of that power improperly wielded.  He attempted to voice their interests, views and feelings.</P>
      <P>The energy with which he pushed for the mobilisation of resources to tackle the terrible scourge of tuberculosis, then largely a disease of the poor, is that for which he will be remembered most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best tribute which could be paid to the late Noel Browne would be not to engage in the ritual of words of sympathy but rather to make every possible effort now to mobilise resources to end today's scourge on today's poor, that of addiction <Col N="151" /> to heroin, through investment and a sustained attack, with the requisite resources, to root it out. Communities are already taking action themselves to do so, because of the absence of political action in the past, pay a tribute to the memory of a fine socialist.</P>

      <P>If aspects are not dealt with in the report when presented to the House, the Government will be happy to consider the matter. I have an open mind on these matters.  Some of the issues of today and of the tribunal set up by this House are a matter of grave concern to me and to all those involved in the political process. I have consistently taken the view that these matters should be fully dealt with.  If under the terms of the present inquiry all the issues cannot be dealt with that will be clear in due course.  Witnesses have still to come before the tribunal and questions raised may be relevant to the issue referred to by Deputy Bruton.  The report will be debated in the House and if aspects are not covered we will consider the matter.  We owe it to the tribunal to allow it complete its work properly and if there are issues not completed in the public interest we will consider them.</P>

      <P>On the business of this House and how we intend to order business for the rest of this session, I recall the Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition, on 6 February 1997 when addressing this House, said that what matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available.  Today is an extraordinary day in Irish politics when the former Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil admitted receiving £1.3 million from Ben Dunne, having denied it over recent months.  As Deputy Bruton stated, it is obvious that contributions made to Mr. Haughey by other business people must be investigated as a matter of urgency by this House.  I ask that the House sit late to consider the implications of the admissions made to the tribunal today following many months of denial.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Progressive Democrats are disturbed by this morning's admission at the tribunal.  If Deputy Harney was sitting on this side of the House, its proceedings would not cease until she received answers in respect of this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring quoted from a statement I made in February last.  If we were to comply with Deputy Bruton's request, the inquiry would have to be extended to cover everyone's dealings during the past ten years, if not beyond. Are we becoming involved in a broad range of inquiries?  I suggest that fair progress could be made when the conclusions reached in the report of the inquiry are published.  Mr. Haughey must go before the tribunal to answer questions.  I am <Col N="155" /> sure he will be asked such questions and it is advisable to await the outcome of that process.  If there are obvious issues to be dealt with following publication of the report, we will do so at that time.  The report will be debated and dealt with by the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton and others have asked what action we will take.  I must inform them that we will obtain the report &mdash; which the chairman has asked to be allowed to conclude &mdash; and deal with its recommendations.

It has not happened anywhere in the European Union since its foundation or in any European country since the war.  This is very serious and the Taoiseach's suggestion that we cannot have an inquiry unless we investigate the affairs of all 166 Members of the House shows he does not understand the seriousness of the revelations.</P>

      <P>We have been discussing this issue over the past few days with the Whips.  It would be useful if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could be established tomorrow. That would allow discussions to take place on the review of the committee system carried out by Professor Michael Laver in relation to its possible reform.  The committee could examine that report during September and the remaining committees could then be established.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: Go gceapfar an Teachta Dinny McGinley mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGinley has been an effective Member over a number of years.  He represents a part of the country that is distant from Dublin.  As a native Irish speaker he is fluent in both languages. Given the importance of the language it is important that at least one of the occupants of the Chair on a regular basis should be a native speak er of Irish.  That is no reflection on the mastery of Irish by any other incumbrants of the Chair, or on you, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In occupying the Chair, Deputy McGinley would come in a long tradition of people from <Col N="160" /> County Donegal who have chaired the House. Examples include the former Cinn Comhairle Cormac Breslen and Joe Brennan.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree to the appointment of Deputy McGinley as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. On the last occasion 17 Ministers of State were appointed the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle was occupied by a member of the then principal Opposition party, Deputy Jacob.  The needs of the Government parties were adequately served on that occasion by the appointments of Ministers of State.  Given that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have 15 Ministers and 17 Ministers of State it would be inappropriate for them to grab the Office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle for one of their party members.  It is more appropriate that the House would decide that the office should be filled by a member of the main Opposition party &mdash; the Fine Gael Party.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I take pleasure, and am proud to nominate Deputy McGinley for that office.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;Dinny McGinley&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Rory O'Hanlon&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dinny McGinley is a good friend of mine.  I am sure he is as happy as I was that, for the first time in 27 years, I was able to appoint a Minister from County Donegal to look after the various needs of the county.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has been a Member for over 20 years and has served in a number of Ministries. He is respected by all parties.  He has worked on all cross-Border initiatives, has close personal connections with the SDLP and has been involved in parliamentary fora over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>The Government parties do not occupy the Chair; the Ceann Comhairle comes from the Opposition benches and long may you hold the position.  Following a long tradition of the House which has only been broken on a few occasions, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should come from the other side of the House, in this case the Government side.  Deputy O'Hanlon is a courteous man who has a knowledge of the House and his experience would add to the status of the Chair.  I ask Deputies to support the nomination of Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 (No. 29 of 1996), shall continue in operation for the period ending on the 31st day of December, 1998.</P>
      <P>This afternoon is somewhat historic.  I would not presume it to be so simply because it is my first opportunity to address the House as a member of the Government, but it is worth noting this is the first time the House has been addressed by a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is a wide and important brief and I am honoured to have been given responsibility for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is correct that at the first opportunity I should assure the House &mdash; lest there be any doubt on this score &mdash; that in the creation of the new Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform there is no question of any lesser priority being given to matters which were the responsibility of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I pay tribute to the work done by the staff of that Department in the past few years. The combined resources and expertise of the former Departments of Equality and Law Reform and Justice will be well placed to address the formidable agenda facing us.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the sterling work done by the former Minister, Mr. Taylor, when he was responsible for the equality and law reform brief. <Col N="165" /> I am delighted that in facing these challenges I will be assisted by the newly appointed Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, who will have special responsibility for equality and disability issues.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to my predecessor in office, Deputy Owen.  As Opposition spokesman on Justice, I was justifiably critical of the previous Government's record on crime, but it would be churlish of me not to accept that as Minister for Justice she gave a great deal of personal commitment to making improvements in the criminal justice system and together in this House we succeeded in bringing about considerable reform.  To that extent I feel I am continuing today where I left off.</P>
    <P>Turning to the very important resolution before the House, certain sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, primarily relating to extra detention powers for the gardaí, will under the terms of the Act cease to be in operation from 9 September 1997 unless a resolution is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas extending their operation.  The main section at issue is section 2 which allows persons suspected of drug trafficking offences to be detained for up to seven days.  The purpose of the resolution is to continue the relevant sections of the Act in force until 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>It is hard to imagine a more corrosive threat to the quality of life in our community than that posed by those who engage in the evil trade of drug trafficking.  Their activities have brought about death and destruction on an incalculable scale.  Families have been destroyed and communities have literally being placed under siege. There is probably no greater fear among parents rearing children today than that they will fall prey to drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to tackling drug abuse in a comprehensive way.  We will take steps to reduce the demand for drugs through education and community based initiatives.  We will offer our services to those who have become addicted to drugs to help them break their habit. We clearly recognise that a criminal justice system on its own cannot comprehensively tackle the problem of drug abuse.  However, the criminal justice system has a vital role in curbing the activities of drug traffickers.  This Government will ensure that role is played fully and relentlessly.</P>
    <P>One message should go clearly from this House today; there will be absolutely no let up in the fight against drug trafficking.  The fight will be intensified.  The full resources of the State will be deployed in this area.  Where those resources need to be enhanced, I guarantee the House and, through it, the people that they will be.</P>
    <P>Over the past year or so considerable progress has been made in taking on drug traffickers, but there is no room for complacency or defeatism. It is generally accepted that the proceeds of crime legislation, which I introduced from the other side of this House last year and which was taken on board by the then Government, has greatly assisted the Garda and other agencies in ensuring <Col N="166" /> that crime does not pay.  I place on record &mdash; and I am sure all Members will join me in this &mdash; our appreciation of the work which has been done by all the agencies involved, particularly by the staff of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  However, our ultimate aim is not to seize the profits of drug trafficking: it is to put drug traffickers out of business altogether.  To achieve this we need to ensure that the Garda have the necessary powers available to them to investigate fully drug offences.</P>
    <P>It is in this context that the resolution before the House today is being brought forward.  It is appropriate that the first substantive debate on legislative measures in the 28th Dáil relates to the fight against drug trafficking.  I know the previous Government intended to move a resolution along these lines and it is right that this House has taken the earliest opportunity available to it to proceed with this measure.  I thank members of the Opposition for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Having had the honour of being appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I have a very full agenda.  We will have many opportunities in the House to debate all the issues involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it would not be appropriate or possible during this short debate to deal with criminal justice matters generally in great detail, but in the context of this debate it would be useful to announce to the House that I hope to bring forward a Criminal Justice Bill in the autumn which will contain a series of strong measures to tighten the vice further on drug traffickers and other serious criminals.</P>
    <P>I intend that the Bill, as one of a number of measures to speed up trials, will include provision for the abolition of the preliminary examination system.  There will be improved procedures for going after the assets of people convicted of drug trafficking offences through allowing a court to initiate an asset inquiry.  It will deal with tougher sentencing so that those convicted of serious drug trafficking offences will know that they will inevitably face sentences of 10 years or more. This was an amendment I moved in this House and in committee on at least three occasions as Opposition spokesperson on justice.  My view then was that it should be introduced.  My view now, in Government, is that it should be introduced. I intend to be entirely consistent.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the technical details of the resolution before the House.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, provides that section 2, powers of detention, section 3, the amendment of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, section 4, rearrest, section 5, the application of provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and section 6, regulations regarding officers of customs and excise, shall cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months from the date of their commencement unless resolutions are passed by each House of the Oireachtas continuing their operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> All provisions of the 1996 Act were commenced by ministerial order on 9 September 1996.  Section 11 of the 1996 Act also provides that before such resolutions may be passed the Minister for Justice must cause to be laid before each House a report on the operation of the sections in question covering the period ending not more than 21 days before the moving of the resolution.  Before leaving office my predecessor laid such a report covering the period up to 16 June 1996.  However, in the light of the 21 day requirement I arranged last Monday to have a second report covering the period up to 27 June laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>When the 1996 Act was going through the Oireachtas last year it had widespread support &mdash; indeed, it followed a Misuse of Drugs Bill which I had introduced which would also have allowed for 7 day detention in drug trafficking cases. However, it was agreed that given the very strong detention powers which the measure contained it was right that the measure should be reviewed regularly by the Oireachtas and it is against this background that the House is being asked to continue the relevant provisions in operation until 31 December 1998.</P>
    <P>While they are already available in the report which I mentioned, it may be useful for the purposes of this debate to give some statistics provided by the Garda authorities in relation to the operation of the provisions in question.  These cover the period 9 September 1996 to 27 June 1997.  The total number of persons detained under section 2 of the Act was 145.  Of these 48 were held for a period not exceeding 6 hours; 50 between 6 hours and 24 hours; 26 between 24 and 48 hours; 10 between 48 hours and 120 hours; and 11 between 120 hours to 168 hours.  Of the 145, 97 were released without charge and 48 were charged.  Of that 48, three were convicted, four were acquitted and 41 cases are pending.</P>
    <P>It might be worth reminding the House that under the terms of the section detention for periods up to 48 hours can be approved by members of the Garda Síochána of specified rank; periods greater than that have to be authorised by the courts.  I should also mention specifically section 6 of the Act which enabled the Minister for Justice, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, to make regulations providing for the attendance of an officer of customs and excise at, and the participation of such an officer in, the questioning of persons detained under the provisions of the Act.  As the report points out, work is proceeding on the preparation of regulations under the section which will be the subject of consultations with the Minister for Finance and the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have indicated that the provisions of the Drug Trafficking Act have proved beneficial to the force in their investigation of drug trafficking offences.  In my view the operation of the relevant sections of the Act for the relatively short period in question has made a <Col N="168" /> substantial contribution to the fight against the drugs menace.  The continuation in operation of these sections together with other strong measures which I propose to take are necessary so that we can continue to tackle head on those who engage in drug trafficking.  That is why I commend this resolution to the House.</P>

      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I wish him well in the job.  I know from first hand that it is a difficult one and will bring him many sleepless nights.  I assure the Minister that I will put him under the same kind of scrutiny he exercised when I was in office.  It will be interesting to watch the Minister's progress because he was extremely vocal when in Opposition.  I wish him well in fulfilling some of the things he promised then but perhaps he will now realise it is not as easy as he assumed.  The Minister is entitled to a few weeks in which to learn the job but after that no mercy will be shown if he does not deliver on his promises.</P>
      <P>I also wish the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, well in her role with responsibility for people with disabilities.  That is an important part of the new Department.  I am confused, however, because when the Taoiseach announced the new Ministers he said he had appointed Deputy O'Donoghue to &ldquo;the Department of Justice and the Department of Equality and Law Reform&rdquo;.  I would like some clarification on this.  When I rang the Department of Justice recently, it was announced as the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, yet the Minister seems to have been appointed to the Department of Justice and the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Perhaps he could clarify whether he is in charge of two Departments or one.  What has happened to the staff of the Department of Equality and Law Reform?  Are they now under the Minister's Department? There may well be some internal problems in the Department.  I would like to know what the name of the Department will be in future.  It appears to be the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I will suspend my judgment on the amalgamation of both Departments until I see how the issues of equality and law reform are handled under the mantle of the Department of Justice.  I mean no disrespect to either the Department of Justice or the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Hitherto, the existence of a separate Department of Equality and Law Reform meant various groups could be sure their point of view on issues and problems would be highlighted.  The Department of Justice must handle so many issues that I hope those of equality and law reform will not become lost in the pressures and tensions that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this motion.  As the Minister rightly said, one of my last acts as Minister for Justice <Col N="169" /> was to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas to make sure we could extend the detention period specified in sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  The decision to extend it was the right one.  The experience of the Act thus far shows it has been a useful weapon for the Garda in dealing with drug traffickers.  According to figures provided by the Minister today, 145 people have been arrested under the Act.  Not many of them were detained for the extended period of seven days but, nonetheless, 11 people were held for between 120 and 168 hours.  There was a need for the gardaí to have that time to get information relevant to the charges being made.  I am glad I introduced that legislation which was a serious attempt to deal with a corrosive element in our society.</P>
    <P>When we talk about drug abuse and drug trafficking it is easy to concentrate on the horrors caused by the availability of drugs and the suffering of drug addicts.  However, behind every drug addict is a damaged family and community with sad stories to tell.  When I was Minister for Justice, we looked at a profile of 3,579 drug abusers who had been in contact with the gardaí in 1996. The preliminary findings showed that 89 per cent were heroin users, 5 per cent were ecstasy users and 6 per cent used a variety of drugs, including methadone.  Some 85 per cent were male, 80 per cent were aged between 15 and 30 years of age and 98 per cent were unemployed.  These people should have been at the pinnacle of their education, trying to gain employment or starting a new family.  These damning statistics, which profile the young people who become heroin addicts and therefore criminals and who end up in jail or dead, are an indictment of us all.</P>
    <P>I remind the Minister that Fianna Fáil stated in its document, A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug-Related Crime, that the last two decades &ldquo;have seen the menace of serious drug addiction spread its evil tentacles into cities and towns throughout Ireland&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil was in charge of the Department of Justice for 13 of those 20 years.  The Minister has a lot of work to do to make up for the failure to do anything during those 13 years when the drugs problem was growing. The figures show that from 1988 to 1992 there was a growth in the number of drug seizures and in the number of people looking for drug treatment.  There was evidence that this problem would overwhelm us if we did not do something about it.</P>
    <P>It is only in the past couple of years that substantial progress has been made to tackle the problems of drug trafficking and social exclusion, to give treatment to people and to improve the lives of those communities from which so many of these 98 per cent unemployed young men between the ages of 15 and 30 come.  Harsh laws which we might not have countenanced ten years ago, or motions such as the one we are discussing today, will not solve the problem unless we tackle it from both sides and provide drug treatment <Col N="170" /> facilities and job opportunities in affected communities and make environmental improvements. I hope the job started by the outgoing Government will be continued.</P>
    <P>I read a newspaper report yesterday that the Government announced the setting up of a Cabinet sub-committee on drugs.  We, in Government, set up such a committee and the Minister is continuing the one which was in place.  We found it was necessary to bring together a number of Ministers to tackle the problem in a multifaceted way.  I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery so I should be flattered that, according to the Minister's speech, so many of the measures which were started by the Government of which I was a part will be continued.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to maintain the progress we made with the local drugs strategy teams.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, will be in charge of the national drugs strategy team because we did not decide to set up those teams on a whim.  We recognised that it was only through bringing together all the agencies of the State in a multifaceted way that we could begin to make some impact on what was happening in communities.</P>
    <P>I am also glad to hear the Minister praise the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau because its creation, more than any other action, has had a huge effect on getting to the big drug barons who have been preying on the community as opposed to the small time addicts who turn out to be pushers. One never finds the former taking drugs, living in awful conditions or suffering illnesses as a result.  If one manages to locate them, one finds they live royally in fine houses at home and abroad on the proceeds of the products which they get other people to sell on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau has really got to work on those people and many of them are now before the courts or cases are being prepared so that they can be prosecuted.  Support for the Criminal Assets Bureau must be maintained and anything it requires should be made available to it by the Government.  The Minister can be assured that we, on this side of the House, will not stand in the way of additional resources or facilities being made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years we have seen increasing attempts to make these criminal activities respectable.  These people invest their money in pubs, restaurants, dancehalls, buildings, houses, cars, boats, etc., to the point where it is hard to tell with whom one may be communicating in certain strata of social life.  I hope that these people who are masquerading as decent upright citizens and who drive around in big cars and attend all the best social places will be found out through the efforts of the Criminal Assets Bureau and pursued relentlessly until they are convicted of their crimes because they are responsible agents in the loss of many lives.  They are murderers. They have broken up families.  They have had no compunction in peddling their evil goods for profit <Col N="171" /> and I hope we will see many more of them behind bars.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he will introduce another Criminal Justice Bill at the end of the year which will contain a series of strong measures which will further tighten the vice on drug traffickers.  He mentioned two measures, the abolition of the preliminary examination system and the introduction of ten year mandatory sentences for serious drug trafficking offences.  I can only refer to those matters because I do not yet know what else will be in that Bill.  I know that the preliminary examination system has given rise to delays from time to time but I would caution the Minister not to throw out the baby with the bath water.  A special committee is looking at the preliminary examination system but the Minister should not do away with the benefits of that system just because he feels he must carry that policy from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Second, I caution him about the mandatory sentences mentioned in his party's pre-election document.  He should be careful that, in his efforts to appear hard and macho and to fulfil his words on this side of the House, he does not create a law which leads to injustices.  I will reserve my judgment until I see what form the legislation takes.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  Far be it from me to make his first day in the Dáil as Minister more nerve-wracking than it usually is.  However, we will be scrutinising him closely and there will be no mercy if he fails in the job he has taken.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his first ministerial task in the 28th Dáil and wish him well.  Seldom has someone proffered so much advice and made such a major contribution from the Opposition benches.  We look forward to his being able to implement some of the approaches he suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I strongly support the extension of the key provisions of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act until 31 December 1998.  This was one of a series of measures taken by the rainbow Government which began, at long last, to turn the tide in the desperate struggle against the drug barons and the devastation they wreaked on our most vulnerable communities.  However, during many Governments this House was remiss in its duty and seemed reluctant to take the vigorous action necessary to deal with this horrendous social crisis which affects so many urban areas.  The rainbow Government, particularly the former Ministers, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Owen, must be commended for introducing this raft of legislation, including the Criminal Assets Bureau <Col N="172" /> Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act, which have finally given the State and the representatives of the people a major counterweight against the depredations of the drug barons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments about the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill.  We look forward to it and to the ideas he intends putting forward. He mentioned the number of people detained for questioning under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act.  Approximately 100 were held for less than 24 hours and 48 were charged as a result of the investigations, which is a significant number.</P>
    <P>The plague of drugs still devastates our communities. In central and north Dublin it remains the number one problem.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that communities had to respond themselves, out of intense frustration, and that it took the deaths of Veronica Guerin and Garda Jerry McCabe before this House got its act together.</P>
    <P>One of the most important tasks the Minister will have is the management of the Garda Síochána. The recent report of the Garda Commissioner showed that the unsatisfactory position still continues &mdash; 60 per cent of crime occurs in the Dublin area but less than 40 per cent of gardaí are based here.  It is still the case that in many constituencies which are seriously affected by the drugs menace, including my own, there are fewer than 200 gardaí for 80,000 to 100,000 people, only 20 or 40 of whom are available at any one time. The Minister must consider that as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We welcome the moves taken by Commissioners Byrne and King in relation to Operation Dóchas.  However, while community policing has a great tradition and record in Dublin and other urban areas, it is not allocated the necessary resources.  At any one time, only 8 to 10 per cent of the available manpower and womanpower is patrolling the streets and working with communities. If the Minister is prepared to act on his zero tolerance policy he must also be prepared to provide the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>New York is the home of zero tolerance and the Minister has been influenced by some of the police in that city.  However, the key to success in New York was the huge level of manpower devoted to critical areas.  Until 18 months or two years ago the most deprived areas, which suffered intensely because of the drug menace, were allocated the least Garda resources.  However, that situation has begun, at long last, to turn around.</P>
    <P>As the former Minister, Deputy Owen said, we still need a much more vigorous and proactive drug treatment policy.  We had a £14 million drug action plan but some areas, such as Darndale and Belcamp in my constituency, still do not have a drug treatment and referral service, although the local community and its representatives have struggled valiantly for the last four and a half years to bring that about.  The Minister has a great deal to do in the area of referral and treatment. He must also encourage his colleague, the <Col N="173" /> Minister for Health, and the other Ministers to work in that area.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's policy has consistently been to be tough on crime and on the causes of crime.  The amounts of money allocated by the Government to areas such as youth and sport are derisory.  I welcome the appointment of a Minister with direct responsibility for sport, but the paltry sum of £6 million or £7 million for youth and sports in local communities will not tackle the causes of crime or provide the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the measure being taken today.  I wish the Minister well but, as Deputy Owen said, we will be watching his every move very closely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, on his appointment.  I hope to be around to offer constructive criticism and support in the future, as I tried to do during Deputy Owen's period in office.  I remember saying to Deputy Owen in the House that if I were to judge her at the end of her term it would be on the basis of whether people such as the Boxer, Footballer and Penguin were still wandering around Dublin in their fancy cars, buying properties and businesses and being written about in the <i>Sunday Independent.</i> Unfortunately, since I said that the person who was writing about them has been murdered.</P>
      <P>Today, the Boxer is in prison in England.  The Footballer was in prison in England but managed to &ldquo;beat the rap&rdquo;, as they say, and is now running a number of businesses in cities in Britain.  The Penguin, a Mr. Mitchell, is, we are led to believe, running his operations from Amsterdam.  The logic of that is that while some of the measures and community actions which were taken have been successful to some degree, these people need to be pursued, a fact which I hope the Minister will take account of in his intended initiatives. I hope people like Derek Dunne, &ldquo;the Footballer&rdquo;, Thomas Mullins, &ldquo;the Boxer&rdquo;, George Mitchell &ldquo;the Penguin&rdquo; and others who wreaked such havoc, are not allowed live on the proceeds of the misery they created by setting up businesses whether in Manchester, Liverpool, Amsterdam or elsewhere.  The Garda, in co-operation with other relevant police forces, must pursue them, have them dealt with on the spot or seek their extradition and compel them to pay for the appalling crimes they committed.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Families have been destroyed; communities placed under siege.  There is probably no greater fear among parents rearing children in this country today than that their children will fall prey to drug abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in and represent an area where the reality of life is summed up in those two sentences. Unfortunately, this House and the Garda have failed people in this and similar areas for almost 20 years.  Parents in those areas engaged in a <Col N="174" /> battle against drug dealers at a time when nobody else, including Members of this House and the Garda, would do so.</P>
    <P>I mention that fact now because some of those parents &mdash; because of their very courageous fight against drug dealers &mdash; now find themselves before the courts charged on the evidence of individuals, themselves involved in drugs, who should have no credibility whatsoever.  Indeed, members of the Judiciary who have shown themselves over the years to be totally out of touch with the drugs problem, who handed out derisory sentences to heroin dealers, now treat these people as public enemy No. 1.</P>
    <P>I want to send a message to those members of the Judiciary that the parents now appearing before them charged with community action against drug dealers should be awarded medals rather than handed out sentences, because they were the only people who stood up to drug dealers over a long period.  I feel very strongly about that.  I know some of these individuals personally and witnessed their courageous leadership of some very frightened people.  It is outrageous that they be brought before the courts in the first place, based on the evidence of individuals known to the Garda to be involved in drugs and, having been arraigned before the courts in such manner, then to be treated like common criminals by the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment suggest that anybody who commits any crime should not be pursued but I find alarming the manner in which the Garda have pursued genuinely concerned parents in areas where the same Garda were totally neglectful in pursuing drug dealers who had been openly selling heroin on public footpaths a few hundred yards from their stations.  The Garda need to examine their consciences and scrutinise those witnesses approaching them levelling charges against certain individuals.  If the relevant Garda and members of the Judiciary passing judgment on these people examined their cases with much greater care than has obtained to date, we might have a much healthier community and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Broughan.  We can have all the policies and goodwill we want but if the manpower is not available to enable local drug units to go into the areas involved and make it impossible for drug dealers to operate, it will have no major effect.  That is critical, as is the point made by Deputy Owen that heroin in particular is responsible for poverty and social disadvantage. If we do not use the great strides made in the economy in terms of wealth created to give real equality and opportunity to the children in areas of disadvantage, we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out to the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, when he was on the other side of the House and promoted the ten year mandatory sentence, it is important when considering this provision to focus attention on heroin, the drug <Col N="175" /> that causes such devastation.  I could not agree more that mandatory ten year sentences should be imposed on those who are not addicts but are found dealing with a significant amount of heroin. By focusing on that drug we will send out the message that we will ruin the evil people who deal in heroin, destroying young children and communities in the manner that unfortunately has happened in far too many areas, particularly in Dublin.</P>

      <P>As a new Deputy, it is a great honour to be the first Member called upon by the <Col N="176" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle to address the House.  I wish him well during his tenure of office.</P>
      <P>I support the motion to continue the power to detain alleged drug traffickers for seven days. This is a small but important step in the fight against drugs which will allow for the detention of persons who would otherwise be in a position to flee the country prior to the application of the due process of law.  There is a need to speed up the court system from the present 18 months it takes to process a case to the 90 day drug courts proposed in the Fianna Fáil position paper. Offenders will be able to choose their court supervised drug treatment programmes or imprisonment. I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to bring forward a criminal justice Bill in the autumn and that one of the measures contained therein will be the speeding up of trials.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Flood on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy Team.  I assure him that I will support him fully in developing a radical approach to drugs and drug related crime.</P>
      <P>The use of drugs is most common in areas of economic and social deprivation such as the south and north inner city areas, the suburbs in the west and north of Dublin and areas of Cork and Limerick. The communities in the flats complexes where the drug culture thrives have been stubbornly denied the benefits of the economic boom. There is a need for higher incomes and increased educational opportunities, environmental improvements and job creation.  These communities have seen none of the dividends of the tiger economy and this will have to change.</P>
      <P>My goal in this 28th Dáil is to eliminate social and economic deprivation and to promote an inclusive society where no one is marginalised. The reality in Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House, St. Theresa's Gardens and Bridgefoot Street is an indictment on our political and economic system because these areas have not benefited in any substantial way.  The reality of the mantra &ldquo;control Government spending&rdquo; is questionable in a country which had a revenue surplus of more than £700 million in the first six months of the year.</P>
      <P>In some countries there is a compulsive military tour of duty.  I would like to see those who earn in excess of £50,000 per year go on a compulsory tour of Fatima Mansions and Bridgefoot Street.  I am sure Deputy Gregory could suggest an extension of that tour into the north inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1960s a small number of people became wealthy on the back of the boom experienced during the Lemass era.  In the 1990s a large number of people have become wealthy through tax sheltered investments which avoid the payment of income tax.  This creation of wealth continues to be aided by the increase in the value of shares, spiralling property prices and low interest rates.  I call this large group of people the &ldquo;ivory circle&rdquo;. This group includes high earners in the professions, <Col N="177" /> business, banks, financial institutions and the public service.  This circle of people has helped to build up the economy through the use of tax shelters such as accelerated capital allowances, finance backed business expansion schemes and section 23 on rental income.  Hotels are sprouting up throughout the country like mushrooms, Temple Bar is humming, designated areas such as the IFSC and Tallaght are booming and new apartment blocks are appearing every-where. All in all the country has benefited from the boom.  Jobs have been created and Ireland is now a much sought after location for quality foreign investment and along the way, the ivory circle has become wealthy beyond its expectations.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the members of that circle becoming wealthy but I want some justice in the system.  The State has foregone hundreds of millions of pounds in tax and this lost income has formed the basis for the wealth created in recent years.  The time has come for members of the ivory circle to pay their share of tax.  I suggest there should be a limitation on the amount of income one can shelter from tax through tax avoidance schemes.  There should be a special rate of tax on incomes over £50,000 which would reflect the State's contribution to the wealth that generated such income.  The additional tax raised should be allocated to those communities who until now have gone without, economically and socially, in the creation of this booming economy.</P>
    <P>What has this to do with drugs?  If the quality of life improves in these communities, the drugs culture will not thrive and we will live in a safer and more secure environment.  During the life of the Dáil I will work for all people, but with special regard for the marginalised and deprived.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who kindly offered their congratulations on my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I appreciate their kind sentiments.  I also thank Deputies for contributing to this important debate.  In the autumn we will have fuller opportunities to discuss the complexities that arise in tackling the problem of drug abuse.  The debate on the Criminal Justice Bill which I will introduce will be such an opportunity.</P>
      <P>My priority as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relates to the supply side of the drug problem.  Measures in this regard must be accompanied by effective measures in reducing demand.  In this context I am sure the House welcomes the appointment yesterday of Deputy Chris Flood as Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy Team. Deputy Flood has considerable experience having served so successfully under the present Leas-Cheann Comhairle as Minister of State at the Department of Health.  I extend my congratulations and best wishes to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable when it becomes necessary for a society to have statutory provision for up to <Col N="178" /> seven days detention.  It would be more regrettable if the State did not take every action open to it commensurate with the threat which drug traffickers pose to the community.</P>
    <P>Appropriate safeguards are built into the legislation. The statistics which I earlier outlined go a long way in answering fears expressed by some people last year that seven day powers would be used excessively.  Of the 145 people detained, 98 were held for a period not exceeding 12 hours. That period of detention was already permitted under the criminal justice legislation of 1984. Only 21 people were held for more than 48 hours.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity for the House to consider the operation of the sections on the basis of the report laid before it.  The statistics in the report are similar to those made available to me by the Garda.  I am open to suggestions regarding information which might be contained in future reports.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, should be aware that the Government made the necessary orders yesterday, the effect of which is that there is from today a Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of which I am Minister. I anticipate no difficulty in relation to staffing or other matters arising from the amalgamation of these two Departments.  I also wish to make it clear that I have always had an abiding interest in the marginalised and disadvantaged and nobody need have any fears about their voice not being heard in Government and in this House.  Deputies can be certain of this.  I want to assist as far as possible, irrespective of the position I hold, those who feel or who are socially excluded, marginalised or disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>I will not adjust my view that the Minister is probably correct in saying that the sincerest form of flattery is imitation.  If that is true, as I believe it to be, my own humility must be overpowering and engrained in the marrow of the bone because the Minister will be aware that most of the legislation she boasted of originated from the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
      <P>The former Minister spoke very eloquently about the opulent lifestyle of those involved in drug trafficking.  I would venture to suggest, with temerity and humility, that the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 which I had the honour of introducing on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party was perhaps the first real measure introduced to hit those involved in the drug trade and serious crime where it hurt, namely, in their pockets.</P>

      <P>I envisage that the Act will continue to be an extremely effective and efficient vehicle in the coming years.</P>
      <P>The abolition of preliminary examination which was raised by the former Minister is something which I intend to proceed with because of the hundreds of preliminary examinations which are heard in court.  Only a minuscule amount of these are ever discharged in the court of first instance.  I believe the court of trial can deal with these matters adequately and efficiently and that this will result in the elimination of unnecessary delays.</P>
      <P>The former Minister said that no mercy would be shown to me.  I assure Deputy Owen that no mercy will be sought.  A very fine poet once wrote that &ldquo;.the quality of mercy is not strained, it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven.&rdquo;.  If I want mercy I can get it elsewhere.  I am prepared to do my level best in this position and I expect nothing less than vigilant, effective and verbose opposition.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan mentioned the issue of additional policing.  There is certainly a need for additional numbers in the Garda Síochána.  The point was also forcefully made by Deputy Gregory whose involvement in the fight against drugs is well known.  In our policy document, I outlined Fianna Fáil's intention to increase the number of Garda Síochána over the lifetime of the Government to try to ensure that the pursuit of individuals involved in criminal activity, including drug dealing and trafficking, would be seen to be effective.  I am acutely aware that this cannot be done if the numbers in the force are insufficient.</P>
      <P>With regard to international co-operation, I wish to inform Deputy Gregory that it is my intention to publish a Europol Bill before the next session of the Dáil which will help to attain international co-operation in the fight to which we are all dedicated.  While I am unable to comment on court decisions I would emphasise the need for the Garda and the community to co-operate within the law in fighting the drugs menace.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ardagh on an excellent maiden speech.  I am restricted from commenting on it because of the lapse of time.

      <P>The decision to decentralise part of the Land Registry to Waterford was announced by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on 4 November 1992.  I am honoured that it falls on me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce the legislation to provide the necessary legal framework for this decision to be brought into effect.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to stress the importance of a proper system of land registration. The importance of proper legal title to land is something to which Irish people are greatly attached.  We have one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe.  For the vast majority of Irish people the purchase of their own home ranks as their highest priority.  In rural Ireland, the need for accurate recording and registration of holdings is of great importance.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to those who work in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds and the professional way in which business has been done over the years that public confidence in the institution has never wavered and that possession of title deeds verified by the Land Registry is accepted by all as valid proof of title.</P>
      <P>As a person who has practised as a solicitor I know of complaints of delays in the Land Registry in processing dealings and I was pleased to learn as part of an overall briefing on the operations of my Department that delays have been substantially reduced in recent years.  For example, in 1990 the average time for processing applications for registration was approximately six months, whereas in April 1997 the average time was down to two months.  When considering that since 1990 the annual number of transactions lodged in the Land Registry has increased from approximately 220,000 to approximately 300,000 the improvements can be clearly seen.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to place on record the appreciation of all users of the registries &mdash; solicitors and the public &mdash; for the work done by the Registrar of Titles and her staff and for the improvements which have taken place.  It is appropriate for me to pay tribute to the Registrar and her staff for the high level of expertise, efficiency and competence which they bring to bear on their work, which can sometimes be complex. The fact that 565 members of staff dealt with approximately 222,000 applications in 1980 and that today 515 members of staff deal with 300,000 bears ample testimony to their selfless dedication and commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> The service has not alone improved but it continues to improve.  These improvements have taken place with the co-operation and whole-hearted involvement of staff at all levels in the registries.  I would not want it to be thought that the improvements which have taken place represent the end of the matter &mdash; far from it.  The Registrar of Titles and her staff, together with the interim board, have plans and proposals in place which will bring about further improvements in the position and improve the service to the public.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to ensure progress is made in creating a customer driven environment in the public service generally and the achievements of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds will be a headline for others to follow.  The future status of the registries has to be considered by the Government.  The interim board, registrar and staff have done a great deal of work on proposals for a new status.  I will be examining these proposals with a view to early discussion with my colleagues in Government and as soon as a decision is taken I will make a public announcement of the Government's intentions.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry operation in Waterford will, in all, involve about 140 staff transferring there to deal with work concerning Counties Kerry, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Laois, Offaly, Carlow, Tipperary, Wexford and Kilkenny.  The transfer of staff will take place on a phased basis beginning during the month of August and will be completed in September.  Staff are being trained at present and I know that the professional standards to which I have already referred will be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some members of the legal profession are uneasy about the change and their concerns have been conveyed to me.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the Government's decision to reverse the proposals of the outgoing Government to empower local authorities to use motor taxation as a devolved funding mechanism designed to enhance local government in this country, and to substitute in its place a highly centralised system of funding.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey, on his appointment.  I wish him a fruitful term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This fledgling minority coalition Government, in an extraordinarily short time, has proved that it is an Administration of hypocrisy and U-turns. The few days of good weather we have enjoyed <Col N="182" /> has caused some of the Members on the benches opposite to change their minds on a number of matters.  While some of the recent reconsideration of previously entrenched positions is welcome, other decisions that have been made, induced by what the Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil might call sun stroke, are not only regressive and petty but potentially extremely destructive.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey, not content with his newly found power and the trappings of ministerial office, has decided to roll back the progress and good work of the last Government by aborting one of the most fundamental reform packages for local government.  In a press briefing last week the Minister said he would implement what is tantamount to a personal enabling Act when declaring that he had decided to reverse the reform package which gave independence, responsibility and resources to cash-starved local authorities.  In effect, he has indicated that he will bring the local authorities under the iron fist of the Department of the Environment in which he is the ultimate arbiter.  I understand he may have high political ambitions but this form of <i>una duce una voce</i> leadership went out of fashion more than 50 years ago in Italy, although, it could be argued, slightly more recently here.</P>

      <P>The hopes and ambitions of local authority members based on their newly found status as real public representatives have been crushed by this short sighted Minister.  If he carries out his threat it will be a mistaken instruction, to paraphrase a former leader of his party.</P>
      <P>The last Government was one of achievement. When it took office it set itself a number of key objectives for economic and social development, all of which were achieved.  One of the primary objectives was to develop an economy which would be the envy of Europe and this was achieved.  We left office with an economy which could meet the challenge of international competition and with a system which shared the fruits of efforts, initiatives and success.  The previous Government can be proud of its achievements in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new Government has inherited a country that is the envy of Europe with low inflation and interest rates which, with proper management, are destined to remain low.  The number of people at work is at an all time high and continues to grow while the national debt continues to fall.  Indications are that economic growth will continue into the next century provided there is proper management of the economy.  The last Government realised, however, that a strong economy is only one parameter by which a country is judged.  It knew that in order to achieve balanced economic development nationwide there was a need for strong local government and to promote social services, such as health and education <Col N="183" /> and it has an impressive record in these areas.  For example, it promised that public housing would increase to 7,000 units annually.  A sum of £400 million was spent on the social housing programme in 1997.  This represents an increase of almost 10 per cent over 1996 and will allow the realisation of its commitment this year.</P>
    <P>The previous Government has also achieved important targets in the area of the environment. The Government of renewal policy document set parameters in regard to the preparation of a national sustainable development strategy to address all areas of Government policy which impact on the environment.  These were met on leaving office.  It also introduced major legislation on waste management.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Howlin, for his work in office.  In the document three specific commitments were given on local government finance.  One was to limit the powers of local authorities to disconnect domestic supplies for non-payment of service charges.  The second was to grant a tax allowance at the standard rate up to a maximum of £150 in respect of service charges paid in full and on time. This was implemented in the Finance Act, 1995. The third commitment was to commission a professional study on local government funding to see how a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding could be introduced.  One of the key achievements of that Government was that these commitments were met in just over two years.</P>
    <P>In December 1996 the Government launched a major new programme entitled Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change.  It set out a series of policy decisions for the reform of local government.  It was, and still is, the most important local government reform measure in decades.  Its key objective was to build a new local government structure which was stronger, sharper, more powerful and independent.  The setting up of a proper system of funding for local authorities was at the core of the strategy because up until then they did not have the financial resources to meet the needs of their consumers. Therefore, the initiatives regarding local government were meaningless.  In publishing this major new programme, the Government recognised the vital role the local government sector had in assisting economic growth and in promoting social well-being and cohesion of society because it was aware of the extent to which local government touched the day-to-day life of many people.</P>
    <P>Local government has developed significantly in recent years with an annual expenditure of £2 billion and a staff of more than 30,000.  However, there were major questions &mdash; was it operating efficiently and effectively and was it meeting the demands of the late 20th and early 21st centuries? The document was published against the backdrop of serious financial difficulties faced by many local authorities with the level and quality of services being pared back to the bone.  In many cases services had been discontinued.  I recount the experiences of my local authority in Cork <Col N="184" /> where year in year out members and management were at their wit's end as they attempted to bring together different programmes and live within their budget.  One could see in recent years that many services in the Cork area were run down and some had been discontinued.</P>
    <P>The decline in the role of the local authorities had come about for a number of reasons: the abolition of domestic rates in 1977 had brought about a situation where their financial base had become too narrow, new functions were being conferred on local authorities by central Government without sufficient resources being made available to carry out those functions and local authorities were almost totally dependent on decisions of Government for financial resources, never being certain of how much rate support grant they would receive from year to year.  This uncertainty demoralised local authorities and resulted in some being bankrupt.  Because of the serious situation of local authorities, the Government knew immediate action was required.</P>
    <P>In the programme, a Government of Renewal, a commitment was given to carry out a professional study of local government's funding to see how the Government could introduce a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding.  The Government appointed KPMG Management Consultants in 1995 to carry out this major work which involved extensive consultation with officials with the Departments of the Environment and Finance and representatives of local government throughout the country.  As well as this work the consultants carried out a detailed analysis of local authorities' existing and future funding requirements.  They evaluated the effectiveness of the existing system to meet these requirements and also a wide range of funding options was examined by the consultants, including a local property tax, a local income tax, a local sales tax, a poll tax, a system based on Government grants, charges for services and a system based on assigning some existing taxation to local authorities.  All the options looked at had advantages and disadvantages but the decision arrived at was that there was no perfect way to fund local government which would be acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <P>However, the Government announced its decision and brought legislation before the Oireachtas.  The legislation provided local authorities with their own viable source of finance to allow them to effectively carry out the range of functions required as we approach the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, provided for a new system of funding for local authorities under which the power to levy domestic water and service charges was abolished, the rate support grant was terminated and the income from those three sources was replaced by assigning the proceeds of motor tax to local authorities which would allow them a more buoyant and a larger amount of finances than the three abolished incomes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> With these new powers the legislation ensured the best possible use was made of the resources provided to local authorities and that greater priority would be given to efficiency, effectiveness and economy.  The rate support grant was terminated with effect from 1 January 1997 with an interim arrangement continuing until the legislation was enacted.  This new income was to give local authorities full and sole ownership of the entire proceeds of a single tax which was being ring fenced to prevent interference from central Government which resulted in a direct financial relationship being established between local authorities and the electorate.  What was happening did not involve any new form of taxation but a change of arrangements in relation to an existing tax which, instead of being transferred from local areas to the Department of Finance, was being collected and spent locally.</P>
    <P>These new powers for the local authorities to raise and spend money locally ensured local authorities would not have the serious financial and administrative problems experienced up to recently.  Given that the motor tax source of income was seen as buoyant, especially between 1991-95 when the vehicle fleet in Ireland increased by 14 per cent and 1996 was a successful year for car sales, that success is destined to continue into 1997 and beyond.  Local authorities were being guaranteed financial viability because, based on the 1996 Book of Estimates, the income from motor tax for that year exceeded the combined income from domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant from central Government by approximately £12 million.  This allowed local authorities to participate in the current economic boom and to expand their role in their communities.  Local authorities were already collecting the tax on behalf of central Government and it was providing them with their own buoyant and locally collected source of income which was independent and protected by legislation.  This gave local authorities greater competence and the ability to plan and develop their services from a basis of financial stability and independence which they had sought for many years.</P>
    <P>The equalisation fund was aimed at ensuring that local authorities would benefit from the legislative changes.  The Government guaranteed the independence of the process by providing in the legislation that a local government equalisation council would be set up to manage and decide allocation of payments from the equalisation fund.  It proposed also that the equalisation council be established as quickly as possible to allocate money on the basis of ensuring that everybody gained from the new arrangement. This would be done by a mechanism separate from the Departments of the Environment and Finance through a process under which local authority officials, representatives of the General Council of County Councils, municipal authorities and management would make decisions about payments from the equalisation fund in accordance with the need and merit of each authority <Col N="186" /> as well as funding initiatives within the overall local government system.</P>
    <P>The principle of local discretion is important for the concept and practice of local democracy. It was important that local authorities have a measure of discretion over their own funds and be able to apply the income generated directly to the improvement of local facilities such as roads. The ability they were being given to vary the rate was important, enabling local authorities to respond to circumstances in their own area and be ultimately judged by the people of their area on their stewardship and performance.</P>
    <P>The proposals now in law allow national rates of motor tax to be set centrally while at the same time empowering local authorities to increase the national rates of taxation on cars and motorcycles to 6 per cent, subject to a maximum of 3 per cent in 1998.  The 6 per cent was a limit to the increase above the national rate.  The legislation also allowed consultation between county councils and urban district councils and between individual local authorities where one collects on behalf of the other on foot of an agreement in relation to the extent of any variation in rates.  The addition of a local variation element struck a balance between the need to give a measure of autonomy to local authorities and the requirement not to impose any significant new forms of taxation.</P>
    <P>The question of local government funding was but one of a number of major reform measures contained in the document on better local government.  In his press statement last week the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey, spoke about efficiency and effectiveness as though they were never thought of before.  Part of the reform measures involved encouraging local authorities to improve the manner in which they operate.  In particular, local authorities were to have greater regard to the important principles of efficiency, effectiveness and economy in their day-to-day activities.  It was important that local authorities be provided with the resources to do the job properly and that they be seen to make the best use of resources on a sound businesslike basis.</P>
    <P>The legislation put forward by Government and passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas earlier this year had a second major objective, the putting in place of a series of measures designed to ensure that local government should realise the best return from the proposed new funding scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the need to introduce performance indicators which would allow members of the public to compare how well their local authority was performing compared with others.  The legislation passed by the last Government had already dealt with this matter.  Section 14 of the legislation formally established a value-for-money unit within the Department of the Environment on a legal basis and provided for its role and function.  In keeping with the spirit of openness in the document on better local government, <Col N="187" /> the value-for-money unit would have been obliged to publish full details of the result of its work.  Section 15 of the legislation provided that in addition to the normal regulatory audits local authorities would be subject to value-for-money audits similar to those being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The value-for-money unit was earmarked to undertake a more comprehensive and in depth analysis of a wide range of local government activities which would assist local authorities with the use of resources in the delivery of their services and improve the manner in which they were managed generally.</P>
    <P>The last Government introduced comprehensive and well thought out legislation relevant to the needs and objectives of local authorities.  It provided local authorities with a source of finance which allowed them to properly undertake the range of functions for which they were responsible while at the same time requiring them to make the best possible use of the additional resources being made available to them.  Its underlying principle was that resources and accountability must compliment each other if taxpayers are to be satisfied that the best return is being got from their taxes.</P>
    <P>The initiative taken by the previous Government was historic in that for the first time in decades it gave local authorities a solid financial basis to enable them to realise their true potential and to meet the requirements of the public as we approach the next millennium.  It gave them a new independence and autonomy which is now under threat because of the Minister's statement that he has already given instructions to set in train the necessary changes in legislation on local government funding and that he will terminate the existing arrangements as soon as possible. Will the Minister outline his position on this tonight?  If it is true he intends terminating arrangements this is a black day for local authority management, its members and the public and represents a major U-turn on the principle of the devolution of power that will put local authorities, their management and members under the solid thumb of the Minister and the Department of the Environment.  I wonder if this is the only decision of the previous Government that will be reversed.  Will the Minister give a cast iron assurance tonight that he will not reintroduce water charges this year or in the foreseeable future and that he will not succumb to pressures from other sources in Government to introduce a system of water metering, as proposed by the Tánaiste prior to the general election?</P>

      <P>Under Standing Order 999, which can be implemented by the Minister for the Environment, all his surplus votes should be transferred to me well in advance of the next election in Carlow-Kilkenny because he will not need them.  I am sure that is agreed.</P>

      <P>I am not happy that the Minister has changed the plan introduced by the previous Minister.  I have been a member of a county council since 1979 and it is frustrating that we are not even messenger boys.  We do not have power to do anything.  If one does not have control over finance, one cannot pretend to have power.  A good aspect of the arrangement made by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, was that local authorities had an option in that regard.  A good deal of fuss was made about the fact that car tax could be increased by 3 per cent if local authorities considered it necessary.  That measure gave hope to all councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my youth at primary school I saw a statement written by the master when I went to his class for spellings from the junior class.  The statement read that the farmers of Ireland got courage and hope when Michael Davitt founded the Land League.  That statement always stayed in my mind.  The councillors of Ireland got courage and hope when the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, gave them the means of raising funds and having some control over their financial affairs.  I will not object if the Minister devises a scheme that will give councillors control.  However, that will not be the case if we are returning to the bad old days when the Department sent word that the road from Kane's house to Murphy's house will be surface dressed when all the councillors, who are full of their own importance, can do is agree.  They will not have power to do anything about, for example, a very dangerous bend two miles further down the road where a crash occurs almost every weekend.  I would not have any qualms at council level in proposing a 5 per cent increase on car tax if I could say to the people that the revenue is for a specific purpose, say, to remove a dangerous bend, the scene of three fatal accidents and <Col N="189" /> numerous other crashes.  At present councillors are in the worst of all worlds; they must take the blame but do not have the power to do anything about such problems.</P>
    <P>The road from Carlow to Tullow does not have the status it should have and the road from Killerig to Arklow which is considered more important as it carries heavy traffic has been resurfaced.  That work cost a great deal of money and the former Minister was very generous in that regard.  The road from Carlow to Tullow has some dangerous bends but as it is not categorised as a secondary or regional road money has not been allocated for its resurfacing.  Since l979 I have been asked by many people why work has not been undertaken to remove the bends on the road.</P>
    <P>The public are convinced that every county council has a bucket of money and all that is at issue is deciding where the money should be spent.  They do not realise that all the money received from the Department is earmarked for the provision of a number of houses, a treatment plant or some other project.  I admit the council will be permitted to make recommendations on an order of priorities, but it would be good to be able to tell people that funds raised through increasing car tax would be used to improve the state of a road or on some other project.  Increasing car tax might not be a popular decision, but we could stand over it if the funds raised were raised for the good of a county.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the guise this may come under, we seem to be returning to the bad old days when the Department decided on the amount of money local authorities received.  There may be a national crisis, the pound may come under pressure and interest rates may rise as we are only a small cork floating in a big ocean.  While everything is booming now we do not know what will happen in three years' time.  If there is a clampdown local authorities will be the first to suffer. The money that in theory might be readily available this year may not be in the future.  Once local authorities have to return revenue to the Department we are caught.  At local level a scheme similar to the rates system should be introduced. While that system had flaws at least if councillors spent all day arguing about increasing the rate by 1p in the pound they could justify the increase as long as they could tell the public they intended to use the funds to carry out certain work.</P>
    <P>County councils experience the worst of all worlds.  We are blamed for what is not done and we have no way of doing anything about that.  The current form of benign dictatorship under which money is allocated by the Department and one is told what to do with it does not help anyone.</P>
    <P>Ratepayers are asked to make up the shortfall. Under the old system at least we had scope to divide the burden.  Many car owners do not pay rates.  For that reason, the £3, £4, £5 or £6 extra they may be asked to pay in a year could raise a great amount of extra finance, depending on the <Col N="190" /> number of cars and allocate it to the running of local councils.</P>
    <P>Ratepayers are sitting ducks.  The county manager decides how much money he needs to run the county based on the amount received from the Department.  The ratepayers make up the difference. They give employment and this is another tax on them.  They are tax collectors and ratepayers and are sitting ducks when it comes to paying for the running of local councils.  That should change.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty of the rate support grant.  Everything was to be sorted out when rates were abolished.  VAT revenue was to be used to pay for this and that.  Some counties were fortunate enough to have spent a great deal of money at certain times and they received a substantial rate support grant.  The previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is aware of the fight that took place to increase the rate support grant for Carlow because we were far behind other comparable towns.  I pay tribute to the former Minister.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We spent a great deal of time talking about car tax in Carlow County Council.  Perhaps we were more alert and ahead of our time.  We said how stupid it was to send money collected in Carlow to Dublin and then receive a proportion of it back.  One good <Col N="191" /> aspect of the new changes was that we could keep the money we collected and the equalisation fund would look after the counties that could not match others because of the number of cars on the road.</P>
      <P>There will be no equalisation on rates.  There is no balance for ratepayers who keep the show going.  Equalisation was a very good idea.  It catered for counties that did not have enough cars to raise sufficient revenue.  We will continue to send our money to Dublin and the Department will magnanimously say it is allocating a certain amount to us.  We will be doing the same type of work &mdash; the road from Murphy's house to Ballin-acarrig and back.</P>
      <P>The Minister is shaking his head in disagreement. I hope I am wrong and that the scheme will give us control over finance.  This is not only about getting money from the Department but having control over how we raise revenue and how we spend it.  Without the power to raise finance, councils cannot do anything.  When times were rough &mdash; we had a few bad years &mdash; county councils suffered.  If there is no money in central funds and inflation and interest rates increase, county councils suffer.</P>
      <P>I hope the scheme the Minister will introduce will be different to the one I suspect he will bring in.  I am afraid my trust in the Minister's scheme has gone before I hear him spell it out.  However, from the Minister's confident smile I presume he has something up his sleeve.  I look forward to hearing him tell us he has replaced a good scheme with a better one, not one that returns to the bad old days when we all looked up to heaven and gave up in frustration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased, so early in my tenure in the Custom House, to have been afforded the opportunity to share with the House my thoughts on local government and how I propose to develop the system over the next few years. Deputy Howlin, who is present, last December launched his programme of reform entitled <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i>, and I was among the first to welcome it in principle. On Deputy Allen's point about being consistent, I am being consistent.  At the time I expressed strong reservations about the funding aspects of the programme.  I told the then Minister in no uncertain fashion of my opposition to the use of motor tax as the prime method of channelling funds from the State to local authorities for current expenditure.  I clearly spelled that out and believed there was no logic in that decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne made a number of points about tying motor tax to expenditure on roads.  It is entirely fitting to use motor tax funds to improve our road network.  There should be some link between motor tax and roads funds.</P>
      <P>There were many things in the document <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i> that I favoured; for example, the proposals on local government and the new local development initiatives.  The emphasis placed on quality services and the widening and deepening of local democracy through an overhaul of the local authority committee system are measures I supported at the time and will endeavour to put in place in the coming years.  I endorse the empowerment of local councillors and the approach where local communities will be able to closely identify with their local authorities and councils.  I welcomed these approaches in Opposition and am delighted to be in a position to advance them.  In addition, at the launch of our policy document and the joint programme for Government, I stated we would also put forward other proposals.  I am sure Deputies have read the Fianna Fáil policy document on local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister read the departmental analysis of it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt it will be put on the record of the House.  I will try not to read too many advices received by the previous Minister on other matters into the record of the House.  In the introduction to the policy document, I made it clear it was not drawn up to rewrite <i>Better Local</i><Col N="193" /><i>Government</i> but to be used as a basis, along with the KPMG report, for other proposals.  In it we outlined in general terms points of difference. The combination of <i>Better Local Government</i>, our policy document, <i>An Action Plan for the Millennium</i> and other individual policy documents will be good for local government in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Partnership has become a critical feature of the success of many initiatives and programmes throughout the spectrum of society.  At national level partnership between the social partners, as initiated by Fianna Fáil and promoted by successive Governments, has been the springboard for national regeneration and economic success over the past decade.</P>
      <P>At local level, local development bodies have shown what can be achieved by partnership.  Partnership will permeate the local government system of the 21st century.  Partnership between the local authorities and the local development bodies, between councillors and staff and between local authorities and their customers will be important.</P>
      <P>My definition of this partnership means local authorities working with others on the basis of equality and mutual trust for the betterment of the communities they serve.  Nowhere will this sense of working together be more evident than in the new relationship we hope to put in place between local government and local development systems by the year 2000.  It is difficult to imagine the strategic plan of any modern organisation, big or small, public or private, which does not focus on a quality customer service.  Local authorities are, and should be, no exception.  My programme of reform will reinforce the existing commitment of local authorities to quality service.  It will build on the work of local authorities to date and will map out a strategy for the delivery by authorities of a top-class service in all their operations.  The programme will deal with quality service measures such as one-stop-shops, co-ordinated actions, complaints procedures, service standards and performance indicators, all of which were adverted to in Better Local Government.</P>
      <P>I am the first to acknowledge the tremendous progress made by local authorities in recent years on the customer services front.  Despite this, we would all admit that more needs to be done.  The talent, commitment, hard work and public service ethos of councillors and staff alike is a great base on which to further enhance the customer service focus of local government for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course local democracy, local government and quality local services do not come free and they do not come cheaply either.  Local authorities spend about £2 billion pounds a year, that is, almost one twentieth of our gross domestic product.  The demands on local government are growing each year.  Each year new statutory functions are conferred on local authorities, often without additional resources.  More stringent quality standards, many of which are EU policies, are being demanded of local government each <Col N="194" /> year.  These improved standards, while generally welcome and desirable, nevertheless place a financial strain on the ability of the local government system to continue delivering.  The financial strain has in many cases led to a situation where local authorities have had to cut back, or to cut out altogether, some of the services they provide. This is not good enough.  If we are serious about local government and local democracy, then we simply must ensure that local authorities have enough money to get on with the job we both demand and expect of them.</P>
    <P>The previous Government commissioned a professional study of local government funding. The consultants, KPMG, produced a useful analysis of the future expenditure requirements of local authorities in June 1996.  The report concluded that on the basis of existing investment programmes current expenditure by local authorities is likely to increase from £1.22 billion in 1995 to £1.45 billion in the year 2000, an increase of £227 million or 18.5 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The consultants also looked at various ways of projecting future local authority revenue over the same period.  The most realistic revenue projections indicated that local authorities would be likely to be short some £33 million per annum by the year 2000 under the funding arrangements then in place.  This assumed a continued commitment to the roads restoration programme.</P>
    <P>KPMG went on to systematically examine existing and potential sources of funding for local authorities.  None of the potential funding options examined by the consultants was ideal and none of them was introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nor are they likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Each had its strengths and weaknesses.  That, I suppose, was only to be expected bearing in mind the way local government financing has developed over the years.  Had an ideal, faultless and painless solution existed, it would have been introduced long before now.</P>
      <P>In fairness to my predecessor, he took action on foot of the report.  He did not simply consign it to the library shelves to be looked at and referred to by local government historians in years to come along with the 18 or 19 other reports.  However, while commending the previous Minister and the previous Government on its commitment to tackle the problem of local government funding, I am afraid its response fell far short of what was required.  The decision to use motor tax as the primary central funding source for all local government current expenditure was no more than a short-term stopgap exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the reports down the years have put forward the view that the ideal local government funding system would comprise a separate system of taxation, specifically raised and collected by local authorities.  However, the reality of the situation today is that the principle of seeking a local source of finance was buried and abandoned <Col N="195" /> by the decision of the previous Administration to abolish domestic water and sewerage charges.  In practical terms, there is no going back on that decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision to use motor tax as the primary source of local government funding seems not to have been fully thought out, and it is flawed on a number of counts.  I believe it is wrong in principle to expect the motorist to finance local government.  It is wrong to expect any one sector of the community to fund the wide range of local services that are provided for the use of all.  Second and more pragmatically, I do not believe the motor tax option has the ability in the long-term to meet the growing demands of local authorities as identified by the KPMG report.  Simply replacing rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges with motor tax was little more than a cosmetic exercise designed to pretend that local government was being put on a much stronger footing.  The reality is that local government needed more than a simple shifting of funding sources.  It needed more money and a funding system with inbuilt buoyancy to meet the needs of local authorities into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Apart from a shortage of funds, a critical draw-back of the current financing structure &mdash; which was referred to by Deputy Browne &mdash; is the excessive control which the centre holds on how local authorities spend their money.  I hasten to add that I do not attribute this weakness to my predecessor, nor to one or two of his predecessors, but rather to the way the system has evolved over time.  Regardless of the history behind the current practice, I intend to introduce measures which will give greater discretion to local authorities in spending their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997 which Deputy Howlin steered through the Oireachtas, provision is made to allow local authorities to vary the rate of motor tax by up to 6 per cent &mdash; 3 per cent this year and 6 per cent next year and the year after.  This was supposed to be the element in the package which would conjure up local accountability, local democracy and local discretion.  The truth is that it was little more than a conjuring trick.  It attempted to create an illusion that the power of <Col N="196" /> local variation equated with real decision making power.  This is nonsense &mdash; the local variation was just a sop to democracy, a poor man's local government.  The average rate of tax on a car is £186 per year.  The local variation power would have allowed local authorities to raise, on average, only an extra £6 per car in the period up to April 1999, rising to £12 per car thereafter.  No further increases were allowed after that.  Not only was this a meaningless gesture to real local government, it again targeted the motorist.</P>
    <P>The local variation power also involved an unwieldy consultation process between county councils and urban authorities.  This purported to introduce an element of local accountability and decision-making power to the urban councils but it was another illusion.  At the end of the day, following the so-called consultation, the county council was given power unilaterally to decide the rate, irrespective of the urban council's views. That is not my idea of local democracy.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I am not sure the previous Minister fully considered the potential for confusion and cross-Border car taxing that would arise as authorities around the country levied different rates of car tax.  I have already said I will put arrangements in place to stand down the local variation consultation process which has just begun.  Needless to say, the only time I will revisit this issue will be when repealing section 9 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.  Anyone who served on an urban district council and a county council which levied different water rates will understand what I mean about varying rates of car tax.</P>
    <P>To address the weaknesses in current financing arrangements which I have identified, the Government's policy agreement, An Action Programme for the Millennium, sets out my key priorities in this area, which are: establishing a statutory local government fund to finance a range of expenditure programmes; allowing greater discretion to local authorities in spending priorities based on their performance and the value for money they obtain; and financing county road improvements from national motor tax receipts with suitable equalisation, such funding to take into account the findings of the national county roads survey.</P>
    <P>These priorities will be complemented by measures to improve efficiency throughout the local government system through, for example, the comprehensive value for money audits to which we referred when the legislation was going through the House.  A proper funding system would enable me to put an end to the existing unacceptable practice, to which Opposition Deputies referred, of placing an undue burden on the commercial sector, especially small businesses, through huge increases in rates.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, many of the State grants and subsidies allocated to local authorities are directed towards specific projects or schemes. While I am advocating increased discretion in how local authorities spend their money, I fully <Col N="197" /> acknowledge that the State has a function in some areas of expenditure by local authorities because some schemes may have national, as opposed to purely local, importance.  Furthermore, many projects are EU co-financed and, as such, require a degree of central co-ordination and control.  That said, there are a number of areas of centrally funded expenditure on which decision-making could more appropriately be made at local level without any loss of necessary central control.</P>
    <P>Such enhancement of local democracy and decision-making would be advanced by the proposed local government fund.  The local government fund will incorporate existing discretionary funds available to local authorities and, in addition, will replace some specific grants paid to authorities.  The fund will be financed by assigning to it a specified percentage of national taxation.  This broadly based source of funding is in sharp contrast to the targeting of the motoring sector to fund local government.  It is, thus, a fairer and more democratic proposal.</P>
    <P>Moneys from the fund would, as far as possible, be made available to local authorities as general grants over which they would have complete discretion as to their use.  However, in order to ensure implementation of certain national policies part of the fund can and will be allocated towards specific programmes.  Over time, the aim will be to move as far as possible towards general discretionary or block grants.  The extent to which this is done will be determined on an individual local authority basis, having regard to the efficiency of each authority in performing its functions as determined on the basis of value for money audits which will be carried out on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>I am talking about a carrot and stick approach to local government.  The rewards of local discretion will go to those local authorities which demonstrate their abilities to deliver the right kinds of services, serving their customers to best effect and who show an appetite and desire for responsibility.  On the other hand, the rewards of extended discretion will not apply to those local authorities who cannot demonstrate they are ready for a more autonomous role in the delivery of their services.  The &ldquo;stick&ldquo;' will be the continued detailed involvement of my Department in determining the use of resources within the local authority.  In effect, local authorities will decide for themselves which route to follow.</P>
    <P>My long-term goal will be to set the framework for the blossoming of local government.  A cursory glance at or a disingenuous representation of my proposals might prompt a suggestion that it advocates a centralised approach to local government. However, the reality is that as local authorities get to the stage where their financial performance and ability to deliver services influence their level of funding and the extent of their freedom to make choices, councillors will be asking questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of their authority compared with others.</P>
    <P>The new funding arrangements I propose will <Col N="198" /> place major emphasis on making the necessary resources available to improve our road network. In accordance with our programme for Government the proceeds of motor taxation will be directed towards the non national roads programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>All of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>This will involve the re-establishment of the road fund.</P>
      <P>The non-national road network is of particular economic importance in Ireland because industrial development is widely dispersed throughout the country, as are tourism and agriculture which are very important economic activities.  Therefore, the network of non-national roads provides mobility within and between local economies and provides vital links to the strategic national roads network and the ports and airports which are our links with the wider European community.  Rural regeneration will depend on the availability of good quality services such as roads to encourage necessary development.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important, therefore, for us to invest realistically in the network and generally to improve our non-national roads to an acceptable standard.  As my predecessor found and as we all know, that places a very heavy burden on each one of us since we have more than three times as many kilometres of road per 1,000 population as, for example, Italy and Spain.  That, combined with our low density of population and low level of urbanisation, means that maintaining our public roads system in general, in particular its non-national element, creates very major financial demands.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is much more wear and tear on our roads and heavier traffic.  Weather and ground conditions also adversely affect road conditions, particularly in winter and the increasing size and weight of the heavy goods vehicle fleet has played its part in the deterioration of our roads.</P>
      <P>We know, and certainly local communities know, the non-national roads network has deteriorated in many ways to an intolerable degree, due mainly to lack of investment over the years, which is unacceptable in terms of its economic and social cost.</P>
      <P>I am happy to acknowledge the constructive actions of the outgoing Government to improve our roads.  I shall endeavour to build on that work to benefit everyone.  It is difficult to think of any item of infrastructure, below acceptable standards, more to the forefront of people's minds than local roads.  The disintegration of local roads is obvious to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restoration programme already in place was a good start by my predecessor.  I intend to continue to transform the condition of our non-national roads network within the lifetime of this Government.  This will cost a great deal of money, which prompts me to mention a somewhat peculiar <Col N="199" /> position which has obtained to date.  The most basic questions to be posed in relation to non-national roads is the extent of the problem and, how much it will cost to remedy it.  Amazingly the answers to those questions were not available in the Department during my predecessor's tenure of office.  There were many reports in the Department but none that spelled out in detail the cost of such remedial work.  That information deficit is being rectified.  The report commissioned by my predecessor to determine the deficiencies of the system has just been received in the Department. A consortium headed by Ové Arup and Partners was appointed in May 1996 to undertake the road pavement conditions study.  Its report is being studied in the Department.  It shows that 55 per cent of the non-national roads network is in need of either surface restoration or reconstruction and confirms the huge amount of work remaining to be done before our regional and local roads can be restored.  The report does not cost the works identified as being necessary and that will be the next task of my Department.  The approach which will be used to apply the unit rate costing to the areas identified in that report as requiring remedial works will be based on average rates derived from local authorities' own multi-annual programmes.  This approach will give us a very clear picture of the cost of remedying the backlog of deficiencies in the network.</P>
    <P>There was little logic in using motor taxation to fund the provision of a free water supply for certain sections of the community.  It is important that there be a clear link between services supplied and payment for them by the customer or consumer.  Therefore, it is entirely appropriate that motorists, through motor taxation, should contribute to the development and upkeep of our roads.  It is also appropriate that motorists see that the money is spent in that way.  This proposal will not only make the payment of motor tax more acceptable to the general public but will ensure sufficient and significant funding is available to fund programme needs.</P>
    <P>Value for money has been mentioned and while I claim no credit for initiating this aspect, it is one in which I strongly believe.  The taxpayer deserves value for money and councillors need to know, when making decisions, that money from the Department or from the local government fund is spent effectively and efficiently.  I do not have time to go into this matter, which was raised by a number of Deputies, but value for money will be very much to the fore in my tenure of office in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin as the Minister ended by congratulating you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.  I did so privately and am glad to do so now publicly.  I also wish the Minister for the Environment well.  It is a great honour to serve in the Department of the Environment, <Col N="200" /> which has an impact on every parish and hamlet. It was my great pleasure and honour to serve in that Department for two and a half years.  I am sure the Minister has found a wonderful staff, amazingly adaptable to change policies and write scripts to suit those policy changes.  The Minister will have a very happy time there because making decisions and, almost uniquely, seeing them take shape around the country is rewarding.</P>
      <P>In whatever job I am given in terms of spokesmanship I look forward to monitoring the progress of the Minister for the Environment.  I regard the section dealing with local government as one of the most important.  The incoming Government, at least last week &mdash; many changes have been made in terms of policies announced last week &mdash; intended changing the name of the Department to the Department of the Environment and Rural Development, but it would be better to call it the Department of the Environment and Local Government because that aspect is such a heartland of the Department.</P>
      <P>I said two and a half years ago when I went into the Department that I would not have a full Dáil term before the election and I did not want to look beyond the election in terms of time to achieve objectives.  I wanted to focus on the two key priority areas of local government and environmental protection.  I hope the work achieved in my time in the Department forms a basis for improvements for the future.  I recognise the kind comments of the Minister in that regard.</P>
      <P>I am profoundly concerned at the first decision of the Minister for the Environment in regard to local government, to dismantle the new funding arrangements which took a long time to argue through.  That is a major and retrograde step. There are many vested interests, not in the Department of the Environment but in the Department of Finance, that did not want the ground-breaking changes the former Government managed to bring about.  I wanted to hear tonight from the Minister about the new programme he would put in place and how the important objective he has re-echoed of giving autonomy to local government would be realised. There is nothing in last week's press release in that regard.  There is to be established a new local government fund, but what is it?  Will it be made up of all revenues, all taxation?  Will it be a percentage of income tax or value added tax, or a combination of both?  What percentage will be used?  How does the Minister propose to arrive at a figure for equalisation?  We were not given this information last week and I thought we deserved to obtain it during this debate.  The Minister has worked hard in terms of developing policy and we deserve to be informed about the effective, buoyant, locally democratic system he intends to put in place.  However, we are no wiser having listened to his contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the new funding system, the Minister stated that he intends to establish &ldquo;a statutory local government fund to finance a range of expenditure programmes&rdquo;.  What does that <Col N="201" /> mean?  From what source will the fund be financed, what percentage of income will be allocated to it and to whom will the money involved be given?  What is the nature of the &ldquo;expenditure programmes&rdquo; to which the Minister referred? The Minister is informing local authorities that they cannot have the funding provided by the former Government but he has not informed the House or local government with regard to what will replace that funding.  The Minister's words are meaningless.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to allocating &ldquo;greater discretion to local authorities in spending priorities&rdquo;.  He should spell out what that means.  He used the totally meaningless phrase, &ldquo;financing county road improvements from national motor tax receipts&rdquo;.  What percentage of such receipts will be allocated?  As stated, the Minister's assertion is meaningless.  I could state that non-national roads were funded from motor tax in recent years because Exchequer moneys were used for that purpose.  If the Minister does not honour the decision of the previous Government to devote and ring-fence the proceeds of motor tax to local government, in whatever guise, he will return those proceeds to central Government.</P>
    <P>Some other gems appeared in the Minister's speech.  I do not understand the statement that the &ldquo;local government fund will incorporate existing discretionary funds available to local authorities&rdquo;. What &ldquo;existing discretionary funds&rdquo; will be subsumed into this fund?  We are also informed that, in addition, these funds &ldquo;will replace some specific grants paid to authorities&rdquo;. What grants are they intended to replace?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <P>I will see?  That is a case of &ldquo;live horse, get grass&rdquo;.  Today the Minister has announced the abolition of a good funding mechanism. He is aware that a substantial pool of money has been building up since 1 January.  This money was created by the former Government and is now being taken away from local government. Local authorities have not been informed about what will replace this funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During his contribution the Minister referred to his support for local government.  However, I have never come across a more patronising, big brother attitude, particularly when the Minister stated &ldquo;the rewards of extended discretion will <Col N="202" /> not apply to those local authorities who cannot demonstrate that they are ready for a more autonomous role in the delivery of their services&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never have put it in such patronising terms.  Local government deserves better.</P>
      <P>In December last year, on behalf of the then Government I announced the launch of Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change. Following 25 years of public debate, I announced action.  I stated that the Government's objective was to create a modern, efficient and properly resourced system of local government.  The proposals were balanced, comprehensive and radical but realistic.  I travelled the country following the launch of that programme and met every local authority representative at five regional meetings including members, officials, others involved in community development and those dependent on local government.  People across the political divide were genuinely excited by the changes and by and large they supported them.</P>
      <P>My objective from the outset was to build a political consensus because it is not a party political issue.  When in Government I said the parties in this House would change position &mdash; and looking at the events of today it may not be worth our while unpacking on this side of the House.  Local government is what is important and most parties want to enhance, support and develop local government, or at least pay lip service to it.  The opportunity was there.  They welcomed the empowerment of local councils implicit and explicit in the programme.  They welcomed the establishment of a strategic policy committee to deepen the democratic role of the elected member and to effectively redress the imbalance between elected members and officials.  By and large they supported the radical measures outlined and wanted them implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to debate issues such as value for money, the deepening of democracy, enhancing the systems and quality initiatives which are outlined at length in the programme.  I wrote the foreword and contents of it with great support from very efficient officials and I support every word of it.  However, it is all predicated on a proper funding system.  Having considered all the <Col N="203" /> issues in relation to funding and the KPMG study commissioned by the Government, we decided to opt for a new local revenue system to replace the centralised rate support grant and to abolish from 1 January 1997 domestic water and service charges, something that had become a bone of contention in local government over the past 15 years or more.  The new system meant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Only in some places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not speak out of the side of his mouth.  If his heart is not in this issue and if he believes that water charges are right, as he half suggests again and again, he should reinstate them.  If he is not going to reintroduce them then he should not say people only objected to them in some places.  He should decide on what is right and then do it.  He is not in a situation where he cannot undo something done by a previous Government.  He is the Minister now and he should act according to what he believes is right.</P>
      <P>From 1 January 1997 we abolished charges for domestic water and sewerage.  I believe this was right as it removed an issue of contention from local government and allowed it address real issues in a positive manner.  The new system meant the entire proceeds of motor taxation were ring-fenced for local government, providing their own revenue base.  Uniquely among any service in this country, local government was to have its own buoyant taxation base.  After a major battle an historic position had been arrived at.  For the first time local government had its own dedicated revenue base, untouchable by the Department of Finance.  It provided their own legally constituted tax base which was already collected by them.  It meant every local authority would be immediately better off.  The proposals were enacted by the Oireachtas under the local government financial provisions legislation.  It marked a new and positive beginning for local government.</P>
      <P>When in Opposition the current Minister broadly welcomed the contents of Better Local Government, a welcome reiterated by him tonight.  However, for the sake of opposition, he impaled himself on a promise to undo the ground breaking finance proposals contained in that document.</P>
      <P>No matter how he dresses the issue up now, the Minister's first decision on local government is retrograde.  As local authorities were about to shake off the yoke of central Government, Deputy Dempsey and the new Administration have decided to rein them back in.  Local government will get what the Minister decides it will get, no more and no less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a cry of delight at this decision in the Department of Finance in Merrion Street; the officials there lost out last year but they have won with this new Administration.  Once again, they have total control of tax revenue and local government is the poorer for it.  The liberating <Col N="204" /> proposal of a dedicated local tax, not subject to Merrion Street but going directly to local government, is now to be abandoned.  I cannot think of a worse start to the tenure of a Minister for local government and I predict the Minister will forever regret this ill advised reversal of a progressive, long-awaited and much welcomed reform.</P>
    <P>The legislation is there and the local government fund, for which I signed the order, is in place and is being built upon day by day.  Once the £100 million in rate support grant was reached, all subsequent motor tax revenues were to be distributed to local government by order of the Government.  Local government is hungry for that.  If this Minister is to take that away I would like him to answer some straight questions.  How much motor tax revenue, that will not now be distributed, is in the local government fund at the moment?  How much would be there by the end of the year?  Projections have been made by the Department.  How much do these projections show would be in the fund by the end of 1998? We had reached a stage where, at last, local government was to be allowed the freedom to reach its full potential.  The new Government will not allow that; it will not allow an independent local government system and will not countenance a dedicated, untouchable tax base to fund it. If the Government will allow that, it certainly has not been explained to us.  Unfortunately, for the supporters of local government it is a case of &ldquo;back to the future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is well meaning.  I know him as a formidable adversary across the floor of the House and he is well disposed to stronger local government but however well meaning he is, once the principle of a dedicated tax base is abandoned, it will not be possible to have anything other than a local government system sub-servient to the Custom House as it always was and, now, always will be.  The Minister can promise to make good the money this year but as Deputy Allen said, when the wind changes and there is pressure on the pound or when inflation rises and funding is required for something else it will be a simple decision to squeeze local government again unless we have a legislative wall between central and local government.  This decision is bad for democracy and local development.</P>
    <P>Part of Ireland's success over the past five or six years has been the empowering of local communities and the unleashing of their potential. We have only started, but we could do much more.  In my own county £5 million is being expended arising from the filming of a £50 million film on the beach of Curracloe because a local film commission was established, funded by the county enterprise board with local support.  This tremendous potential in so many areas is there to be tapped and unleashed, but it will not happen.</P>
    <P>I am not aware if the Minister has had the opportunity to read the conclusion of the report published by the Convention on Quality in Local Government that was held last year, one of the <Col N="205" /> most useful of its kind in which I was involved. For two days I brought together the recipients of services of local government to talk to the local government practitioners and to tell each other &mdash; they were always telling me &mdash; what was wrong.  The debate was most useful and stimulating. Tremendous ideas flowed from it which were subsequently incorporated in the programme for better local government.</P>
    <P>The ideas on servicing the customer, developing efficiencies and enhancing local democracies are predicated on an independent local government system.  The European charter on self government was approved by the previous Government and is awaiting the approval of Dáil Éireann.  I know the Minister will introduce a motion to the House to confirm that convention. Our obligations under it are predicated on the independence of a local government system.</P>
    <P>When attending the regional conferences I saw that we were on the threshold of a new confidence in local government.  It has been dealt a severe blow.  Many issues have arisen.  I hope, for example, that the co-ordination of local development will be preserved.  The plethora of local organisations that had emerged needed to be anchored somewhere and it was proposed that they be anchored in the democratic local government system.  I hope that is to be continued.</P>
    <P>The contentious issue of service charges has been touched upon.  We cannot be certain of the Government's position on this matter, despite the Minister's remarks.  Multi-annual budgets have been decided on for central Government.  Will similar provision be made for local government? Will we give local governments the ability to plan and make commitments to those who require services?</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the roads by the Minister and other Deputies.  I recognised the need for a major initiative on county roads.  This year we will spend virtually a quarter of a billion pounds on non national roads, the bulk from the Exchequer and £60 million from local authorities in matching funds.  That would have been unthinkable three years ago.  Will the Minister continue this and how will it be funded?  What percentage of the road fund will be given to it?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister maintain the housing programme that we brought to a high level or will he return to the housing policy of the early 1990s when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were last in Government and virtually no houses were built?  How will he deal with the challenge to local authorities of waste management?  Will he continue the policy of devolving to local authorities powers previously undertaken by the previous Government with regard to staffing and other matters?</P>
    <P>Other issues of great importance are destined to occupy tomorrow's news heads in all the newspapers. However, this debate is as important as any for the future of our democracy.  I appeal to the Minister to think again because he is making a grave mistake.  I also appeal to the Independent <Col N="206" /> Members, most of whom have long service in local government, to think hard before they vote on this motion tomorrow.  I wish the Minister well and I hope, for the sake of the future of local democracy, he will reconsider his views on this fundamental issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his election &mdash; nobody is more deserving.  We recall the trauma he endured in the late 1980s when he was Minister for Health and when he fought his corner bravely and ably. I also congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Byrne, on his appointment.  It is nice to see Deputies from maritime counties appointed to deal with maritime affairs because in the past appointees have often come from inland counties.</P>
      <P>The Bell Lines debacle has serious repercussions for Waterford, the south-east region and the whole country.  The Belview terminal served industry throughout the country and it was the leading container port in the country.  Indeed, it was rated as the second best container operation in Europe because of its low charges and its efficiency.  It handled 40 per cent of all container traffic in Ireland.  An examiner was appointed to the company and as a result of his deliberations it has gone into liquidation.</P>
      <P>I am reassured by the Minister for the Marine's statement of Friday last in which he commits the Government to supporting the terminal in the future to ensure it remains viable as a business entity.  I support his statement and I hope he can deliver on it.</P>
      <P>Waterford Harbour Commissioners are liable for repayments on a European loan of approximately £1.4 million per year.  They could not meet that from their own resources without the port thriving.  While Bell Lines was thriving until about a year ago it had become somewhat run down in recent times, partly due to the advent of the Channel Tunnel and partly to the horrific storm of last October which wrecked the terminal, damaging the cranes in particular.  In its heyday there were about 14 sailings per week &mdash; a considerable amount of traffic for the port. Without that container traffic Waterford Port will suffer considerably and it is essential that such a turnover is restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One hundred and sixty people were employed by Bell Lines in Ireland and overall the company employed 600.  This problem is not confined to <Col N="207" /> those employed in Waterford.  One must think of the ancillary activities generated by the port. Many hauliers have been in difficulty due to the liquidation.  I was glad to read in today's newspaper that they will be paid, hopefully in full, but dozens were involved.  Pilots on the river were extremely busy as were those operating trains to and from the terminal.  It is very important that these activities and the level of employment be maintained.  Will the Minister tell us what he will do to restore the status of the port?</P>
    <P>We wish to see the port trading profitably again and there has been a downslide.  Other ports have taken over Waterford's business but their charges are higher than those which pertain in Waterford. It is a distinct disadvantage to business in Ireland that people must pay more for the same service. It is not good for the country or individual businesses.</P>
    <P>Waterford people want answers to the following questions.  Why did the various consortiums which were in the process of taking over the port pull out at the last moment?  There were two, one led by Irish Continental Lines and another by a group called Imari.  Allegations were made.  Is it true that Bell Lines was not trading profitably for the past 14 months and, if so, is this allowed in law?  Why was it allowed to trade if it was not profitable?</P>
    <P>Local people wish to see a number of companies move in to fill the void that has been created. They do not want a monopoly as it might not be sufficient to carry out the work done in the past by Bell Lines.  We wish to see everything above board.  There is a great deal of uncertainty and the workforce is disenchanted.  There was a considerable breakdown in communications between it and management, particularly over the past 12 months.  I want the Minister to examine these matters and give as frank, succinct and definite a reply as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Byrne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment and wish you every success.  I have no doubt you are well suited to the post.  I thank Deputy Deasy for his compliments and, coming from a maritime county, I hope to do well in this post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter which is of considerable concern, particularly to those who live in County Waterford and other parts of the south-east.  This matter has been brought to my attention by my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and Deputy Kenneally.  Since his appointment as Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, has kept in close contact with developments in the Bell Lines group and Waterford Port.  He had been hopeful that the examiner would succeed in securing new investors for the company.  He assisted Waterford Harbour Commissioners in their attempts to ensure the success of the examinership.  We regret the collective <Col N="208" /> efforts of many were not successful.  Our deepest sympathies lie with the employees of the Bell group and those who might be adversely affected, such as the hauliers and others referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Bell Lines has been associated with Waterford Port since the 1960s and is its main customer.  I look into the estuary every other day and I have seen many ships pass with Bell containers.  They operate a freight transport service and their principal trading areas are Ireland-UK, Ireland-Continental Europe and UK-Continental Europe.</P>
    <P>Bell operates services between Waterford and the following ports: Bristol in the UK; Rotterdam in Holland; Radicatel in France and Bilbao in Spain.  This market is served by a large number of lo-lo operators with the principal competitors being ICG &mdash; Eukon &mdash; Lysline, Bugsier Line, Kersten Continental Line, Holland Ireland Line, Seawheel Rheinteiner and BG Freight.  Ro-ro operators, especially Irish Ferries and Pandoro, also compete for this traffic.  Bell is estimated to have a 1996 market share of 20 per cent of lo-lo traffic between Ireland and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>The Bell Lines shipping company and four related companies were wound up by order of the High Court on Friday, 4 July 1997 and a liquidator appointed.  It is a matter for the liquidator to realise the assets of the companies and, in the case of the Bell Group, it is likely the assets will be sold, as going concerns.  While it is early yet, I am confident the liquidator will be successful in securing the future of the core business of the Bell Group, thus saving the maximum number of jobs possible.  It is our intention to ensure it will be sold as a going concern and that shipping interests will maintain their interest in the area.</P>
    <P>Waterford port has a proud tradition in the provision of portal and shipping services.  Belview port is a modern container terminal with state-of-the-art infrastructure, good road and rail access, efficient handling equipment and an extensive well serviced compound.  The port can provide national and international carriers with direct and cost-efficient access to the UK and continental Europe.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the appointment of the liquidator, the Minister assured Waterford Harbour Commissioners of the Government's full support in maintaining and developing their businesses into the future.  With a view to guaranteeing and securing the future of Waterford port, the Minister has put the following action plan into place: the provision of top level, marketing and business development expertise to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in order to accelerate recovery; an assurance that repayments on European Investment Bank loans will be met without adversely affecting the financial position of Waterford port; his Department and Waterford Harbour Commissioners will give every assistance to the liquidator to maintain the maximum number of jobs and level of business in the port area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> The port's management is actively seeking alternative operators for Belview terminal.  It is likely Belview will become a multi-user terminal. Strong interest is being expressed in the routes out of Waterford.  Ongoing discussions are taking place with the port management.  The Minister and I intend to visit the port in the next few days to discuss at first hand the steps required to restore traffic to sustainable levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The DART network, which is a wonderful asset in Dublin's infrastructure for the people of Dublin and one we cherish, moves many people each day.  I welcome the moves by the new Minister to reassess the underground option for an extension of that network and to avoid what looked like disastrous damage to the centre city area if we proceeded with the original plans.  One of the most intense, frustrating and long-running causes of annoyance for people in my constituency, particularly people with a disability and parents of young children, is the total lack of provision on the DART network for people with a disability and mothers and fathers with buggies and children.  There has been no provision in that area over the past 10 or twelve years.  I have had many complaints from the Centre for Independent Living and other organisations who serve people with disabilities.  The DART network on the north side of the city runs through most of my constituency from Clontarf, through Raheny, Kilbarrack, Howth Junction, Sutton and Howth.  There are ungainly steps and gates, making access extremely difficult for active working people who happen also to be disabled.</P>
      <P>Recently major new funding has come through the Structural Funds to provide extra resources. A new station is being built at Fairview, there is the promise of an extension to Malahide, and most of the stations in my constituency are receiving a major refurbishment, including the awful Kilbarrack Station.  A significant amount of money, £80,000, is being spent on Bayside. However, outrageously, not one penny is provided for facilities to enable people with a disability to easily use the DART network.  A few months ago the Minister at the time, Deputy Dukes, came to my constituency and announced the provision of £80,000 for Bayside, but he was not prepared under any circumstances, even coming up to the general election, to meet the fair requests of parents and people with disabilities for the sort of facilities that are needed.  The only station on the network which has a viable plan to involve our disabled fellow citizens is Kilbarrack. In that instance most of the basic planning was done by Dublin Corporation, the local DART Action Group and Iarnród Éireann.  There is extreme frustration in my constituency about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until a few weeks ago we had a Department of Equality and Law Reform which is now sadly gone, perhaps a sinister move by the incoming Government.  I am aware this area has been <Col N="210" /> incorporated in the Department of Justice.  The new Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform said this evening he would carry on the vigorous approach of the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor.  However, as a recent report of the Department showed, the achievements of Mervyn Taylor in the Department of Equality and Law Reform over the past four and a half years under two different Governments were tremendous.  I fear this new Government is not prepared to sustain that effort and to show, in practice, that all citizens are equal.</P>
    <P>There was a major commission on services for people with a physical disability about a year ago, but no attempt was made by the outgoing Government, nor has any attempt been made by the incoming Government, to provide the resources necessary in that area.  It is obvious that a disabled worker approaching one of the stations in my constituency could easily be frustrated by having to get the help of friends and neighbours not just to get into the station but to get on and off the train.  If we are serious about equality, we should ensure that those citizens have access to exactly the same facilities as everybody else.</P>
    <P>I welcome the funding for the extension of the DART line and commend the Minister on her courage in being prepared to re-examine the plans for the extensions which are urgently necessary in the south, south-west and north-west of our city.  However, it is incumbent on the Minister to provide whatever funding is necessary to give full equality to our fellow citizens in Dublin city who have a disability and to parents of young children.</P>

      <P>First, let me congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The robes become you, and I have no doubt that you will shed lustre on the role.</P>

      <P>It is sparkling to note it happening so soon.</P>
      <P>When I read the files on the Luas project I knew we were embarking on a mission about which there is only one piece of knowledge, compiled from a particular viewpoint without the benefit of an objective study.  I thank the Deputy for his remarks and hope he will state them in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of practical initiatives to make the public transport system accessible to the widest range of passengers is essentially a matter for the suppliers.  The CIE group is aware it has been the policy of successive Governments to encourage the transport sector to make the greatest degree of progress towards the elimination <Col N="211" /> of barriers to the use of transport services and ancillary facilities.</P>
    <P>I am told Iarnród Éireann is extremely conscious of the needs of customers with disabilities and in the past ten years has made considerable advances to improve accessibility in all sectors of its operations.  The railway, operating on a fixed right-of-way between stations, offers the greatest potential for permitting independent movement by people who are mobility impaired.  On the other hand, most stations were built some 150 years ago and very substantial investment would be required to adapt some of them to meet today's accessibility needs.  Consequently, prioritising investment is essential but progress is also necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is concerned with the DART system which is the most accessible form of public transport in the country.  An increasing number of people with mobility impairments, including wheelchair users, travel regularly on the DART, unassisted in most cases.  Work was undertaken when the system was being built to adapt the majority of stations on the system for use by customers with mobility impairments.  Sixteen of the 25 DART stations are fully accessible to mobilityimpaired passengers.  The remainder are either completely inaccessible or accessible on one side only due to their geographical location and their original design situated in deep cuttings or because the sea is one side of them.</P>
    <P>It is Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new stations, and any major restructuring work on existing stations, should make provision for people with disabilities and other customers such as parents with buggies who have difficulty using the system.  In line with this policy the major upgrading work currently under way at Dún Laoghaire station at a cost of more than £1 million will include lifts on both platforms and the new station which will open at Clontarf in the near future will also be fully accessible.</P>
    <P>In addition to those major works, a number of system-wide improvements are also being implemented which will not involve full scale restructuring of the stations in question.  I am advised the cost of incorporating physical access features at locations such as Bayside where these works are going on would be prohibitive.  Nonetheless, the programme in question incorporates features which will have significant benefits for all rail users, including customers with disabilities.</P>
    <P>In regard to the future, Iarnród Éireann is working towards the goal of making the remaining DART stations accessible according as resources permit.  A public service should serve the people, not the other way round.  The company has formed a disability users group which has already carried out an audit of northside DART stations to identify issues that need to be addressed and a similar audit of southside stations is due to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>Despite the continuing Exchequer support for the railway, amounting to more than £90 million <Col N="212" /> in 1997 and the unprecedented level of investment now under way throughout the rail network, the use of resources will always have to be prioritised. I am convinced the objective of making DART and other rail services as accessible as possible is now firmly established as a major customer care issue.  I thank the Deputy who has long campaigned on this issue.  I heard him speak on it in this House before when we were in different positions.  His case is genuinely felt and was plainly made.  I would be eager to be able to help the process along and, if necessary, to give it political direction.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Cowen and I have been protagonists on occasions, I congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Health.  I welcome the fact that he is present to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports have now been confirmed by Glaxo Wellcome that the Wellcome pharmaceutical company used children in orphanages in Ireland in 1973 and 1960 for the carrying out of trials on new vaccines.  That is extremely disturbing. It appears from what has been reported in our newspapers and from a statement made by the Wellcome Corporation that it accepts that orphans were used as guinea pigs in drug trials.  It appears such trials were run in 1973 involving 57 children in two children's homes and in 1960 an unknown number of children were used in the carrying out of drug trials in five children's homes.  Even more extraordinary we have been told by Wellcome that the trials in 1973, whatever of the l960 trials, were approved by the National Drugs Advisory Board and then carried out.</P>
      <P>Children were put in orphanages or residential homes to be properly cared for and those running the homes exercised a very sacred trust over those children.  It is extraordinary that such a cavalier attitude was shown to those children. They were regarded as objects available to the medical profession for the testing of new pharmaceutical products.  That is entirely unacceptable. Tests of this nature were conducted on children in Irish residential institutions because multinational corporations would have fallen foul of the law in their home base if they had carried out such testing there.  If the Wellcome Corporation carried out such testing in the United States, what would have been the reaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This happened when none of us was in politics and no responsibility attaches to the Minister for what occurred.  However, there are a series of questions we are entitled to have answered.  Will the Minister arrange for a formal inquiry to be conducted into these events to obtain the answers for these questions?  The Wellcome Corporation admitted to such tests being organised and <Col N="213" /> funded by them.  How many other such tests were carried out on children in Irish residential homes in the sixties and early seventies?  Were such tests carried out on children in homes in the fifties? How many children were affected?  Were there any long-term implications for any of those children who were used as guinea pigs?  Was consideration ever given to obtaining permission from relations of the children?</P>
    <P>Those in charge of residential homes had no power to allow children in their homes to be used in that way; we must assume they assented to their being so used.  In my view they could not have done so without court orders, the children having been made wards of court.  I cannot see any circumstances in which our courts under our then laws would have sanctioned children being used in that way.  Are there any records remaining that may be held by the pharmaceutical company, the medical practitioners who carried out those tests or those who were in charge of children's homes of which children were so used?  Is there any way to follow up those who were subjected to testing who are now in the middle of their adult years to find out if what they were subjected to has had a detrimental impact on their health?</P>
    <P>There are a series of questions to be asked and the ones I am raising this evening are by no means exhaustive.  Are there any people currently living or born in this State who were in residential homes now suffering illness they suspect may have derived from something that occurred during their childhood because of such testing?</P>
    <P>Too often we hear that events which occurred in orphanages or children's homes in this State decades ago occurred in a different era and that we are now judging these events by the mores of today.  We have heard that excuse put forward, if not to justify then at least defend why some children were treated brutally in orphanages that operated in this State in the forties, fifties and sixties.  Some of these events took place in the early seventies when we were conscious of children's rights and aware of our obligations to children. In this House in the early seventies, there were debates about issues relating to children and the need to protect their rights.  However, what happened showed an extraordinarily cavalier attitude to children's rights and is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the current Minister for Health, Deputy Cowen, holds no responsibility for the events which occurred.  The Minister and the Government have a definite responsibility to inquire into what occurred, to get answers to these questions and to ensure that no child in a residential institution either run by a State agency or a voluntary group is ever again used as a guinea pig in the testing of pharmaceutical products for multinational corporations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, comhghairdeas on your elevation today.  I thank Deputy Shatter for allowing <Col N="214" /> me to raise this matter.  Before dealing with the Deputy's specific question, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify and put in context three issues relating to the vaccination of children which have been the subject of extensive recent media comment.</P>
      <P>There has been comment about the outcome of the work of the expert group which examined the cases of 93 children between 1977 and 1984 to establish if their condition was linked to the administration of the pertussis or whooping cough component of the 3-in-1 &mdash; DTP-vaccine. This is a separate and distinct matter from the vaccination of children in orphanages and I will return to it later in my reply.  Recent media reports have also referred to the vaccination of children in orphanages in 1960-61 and in 1973. These reports are not new.</P>
      <P>They were the subject of media comment in October 1990 and May 1991 and the then Minister, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, answered questions in the House on the matter on 7 May 1991.  Essentially, we are now addressing the same issues.</P>
      <P>Before giving all the information now available to me in relation to the 1960-61 and 1973 studies I want to clarify a number of very important points which are critical to a proper appreciation of the issues we are considering.  The administration of the vaccines to the children in the children's homes was not in any way experimental.  The children were due to be vaccinated in accordance with scheduled vaccination programmes at the time and the vaccines used were all approved under the regulatory framework which prevailed at the time.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the studies was to determine which of the approved vaccines was most appropriate for use in the national vaccination programmes. The 1973 study, as I will make clear, was the larger study and was not confined to children's homes.  The medical officers attending the homes gave their permission for the administration of the vaccines and were perceived to be acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in so doing.  All the information available to me indicates that not only were the studies carried out in accordance with the then prevailing ethical guidelines but that additional measures were taken on a voluntary basis to ensure the highest standards of safety and efficacy.  I would now like to provide the information available to me on both these studies.</P>
      <P>The 1960-61 study was the subject of a subsequent report in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 21 April 1962.  It described a comparative study comparing 3-in-1 &mdash; diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis &mdash; and separate polio immunisation with a 4-in-1 &mdash; all vaccines combined &mdash; carried out on 52 children resident in five orphanages.  The vaccines were administered to the children as part of the child immunisation programme.  The study was carried out in accordance with the then prevailing ethical guidelines and no adverse reactions occurred which were ascribed to the immunisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the House all the information that is available to me.  If the Deputy has any further questions he can table them and I will answer them in full.</P>
      <P>The immunisations were conducted with the consent of the medical officers attending the children's homes and this is acknowledged in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> article.  It is a fact that information on this study has been in the public domain for 35 years.  In addition to the facts set out in the BMJ article I have been informed, as a result of recent intensive inquiries by my Department, that a number of children who were adopted subsequent to the vaccination study were followed up to be given booster vaccinations for polio, as required, as it had emerged that the separate polio vaccination was more effective than the four vaccines combined.  I think this shows an impressive level of care and commitment, given the inevitable difficulties in following up on adopted children.</P>
      <P>I would now like to set out the information available to me in relation to the 1973 study.  In 1973, the Eastern Health Board noted above expected levels of transitory adverse reactions following the administration of DPT vaccine and discussed this with the pharmaceutical company. The health board co-operated with the company in carrying out a comparative study comparing four types of DPT vaccines, two of which were already in use and two of which were composed of the same basic components and which were approved.</P>
      <P>Prior to the study being undertaken, Wellcome, the company supplying the vaccine, submitted a detailed Protocol to the National Drugs Advisory Board, to which the board raised no objection. This was done on a voluntary basis as there was no statutory requirement to do so.  The study proceeded on this basis.  A total of 116 children were involved, 59 children being in the community and 57 children from two children's homes in the Dublin area.  The children participating in this study were due to be immunised with DPT vaccine as part of the national immunisation programme. The results of the study were inconclusive, in that no significant difference between the vaccines emerged.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any other similar studies or trials involving children in orphanages, but I have asked all health boards to report to the Department on the situation as a matter of urgency. When this information is received I will review the situation and decide what further action, if any, should be taken.</P>
      <P>It is inaccurate and extremely unhelpful to refer to the children vaccinated during these studies as guinea pigs and I hope the information I have given will help to reassure all those involved that nothing irregular was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to urge parents to continue to have their children immunised <Col N="216" /> against whooping cough.  The benefits greatly outweigh any risk.  Whooping cough is a serious and distressing disease which can have severe complications such as convulsions, pneumonia, brain damage and, in some cases, death. It is also essential that we increase our uptake level of DPT vaccine to eliminate the disease.  I would like to reassure parents that DPT is a safe and effective vaccine.  There are very few contraindications and these are advised in the recently published guidelines on immunisation which have been made available to all doctors involved in primary childhood immunisation.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer briefly to the work of the expert group.  The Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination was established in 1977 by the Minister for Health &ldquo;to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some 93 cases &mdash; and I am well aware that this means 93 children, indeed 93 families &mdash; presented themselves to that group.  The group found there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of these cases.  Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of that doubt to that person.</P>
    <P>Between 1982 and 1984 an offer of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £10,000 was made in each of the 16 cases, from the group of 93, where the expert medical group found in favour of the children. Thirteen families accepted the offer of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  One other case was processed through the courts.  The Supreme Court held in that case that the pharmaceutical company was liable for that person's brain damage.</P>
    <P>Since then, where requested, the Department of Health has made available to the families concerned the expert medical group's file.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.  You have been a Member of this House for a long time and the honour is well deserved.  I also wish the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, every success in his new position.</P>
      <P>To be appointed Minister for Health with special responsibility for children is a great honour, but it also confers responsibility to work with people of different views and ideas.  The Minister for Health must be able to take on board divergent views to help him and his officials in the formulation of policy.  This approach needs to be extended to each of the eight health boards so that management and staff can benefit from these ideas and views, whether medical, social, legal or political.  Irrespective of whether the Minister agrees with the views expressed, he has a duty to listen and assess them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> I had hoped the Minister would be generous. Regrettably, his actions have shown him to be covetous rather than generous since taking office. His actions in rescinding the appointments made by his predecessor, Deputy Noonan, to the eight health boards indicate that he wishes to stifle debate at health board level.  The Minister's party, Fianna Fáil, has a majority on many of the health boards and the Minister intends, by hook or by crook, to retain that majority.  He wants to use these majorities to push through policies and ideas and to have as little critical analysis or opposition as possible.  This aproach is unwise and will be seen to be so in a short time.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action in sacking Councillors Gallagher, Aird and Dollard from the Midland Health Board shows a negative and provocative approach by him to politics.  I would have expected his approach to be one of goodwill rather than confrontation.  I know he will state that Deputy Noonan made these appointments to the health boards before they became vacant on 1 July.  However, the Minister is aware of precedents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the situation in the Midland Health Board area.  At a Midland Health Board meeting on 19 June, Deputy Moloney formally resigned as the Laois County Council representative. At the same health board meeting, Councillor Marty Rohan resigned from the board as a ministerial nominee and was then nominated to the board as the representative for Laois County Council.  As there was a vacancy for a ministerial nominee to the Midland Health Board, why did the Minister sack the three councillors who were nominated, all of whom were workers with proven records?  He replaced Councillor Aird with Deputy Moloney and Councillor Dollard with Councillor Keegan.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of work to be done in the health care area in Offaly and Councillor Gallagher would have been able to speak about many of these health issues.  Regrettably, he has now been silenced and will not be able to make a contribution at the meetings of the Midland Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a political not a legal matter and the courts are not the place to solve such issues.  I recognise that people have the right to go to court if they wish.  Many appointments are made before vacancies arise.  This allows continuity.  Teaching appointments, for example, are made long before the person resigns.  The Minister will be aware that when the last Government came into office there was a vacancy for a Commissioner and it had been mentioned that the previous Government was appointing a former Member of this House.  The incoming Government could have changed that but it would not have been fair or right.  One must be magnanimous and generous in politics.  I hope the Minister will have learned from this mistake and that at the end of his period <Col N="218" /> in office, he will be seen to have been magnanimous and generous.  I regret saying that the Minister made a genuine blunder.  Such an approach is not good for politics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter so I can put some facts on the record. This issue has been discussed on local radio and a selective view of history has been put forward by Opposition politicians.  Deputy Enright will know from my record in this House, locally and nationally, that to suggest I have not been magnanimous on a range of occasions is to do an injustice to my record.  I will let the record stand and I will refer to the minutes of Offaly County Council and any other local authority body in which I have worked with Deputy Enright or others.</P>
      <P>I should like to start by expressly rejecting the contention that my actions in rescinding the purported appointments of the councillors named in any way amounted to, or could be construed as, &ldquo;sacking&rdquo; the individuals concerned.  In my view, the appointments purported to have been made by my predecessor were not valid and I had, therefore, no option but to act to regularise the situation.</P>
      <P>For the information of the House, I should like to explain clearly the situation in regard to appointments to boards by the Minister for Health.  In total, there are 40 boards under the aegis of the Department of Health.  The Minister for Health has the power under the relevant legislation to nominate members to 39 of these, including the eight health boards.</P>
      <P>Normal procedure is that, when a vacancy has arisen on a board, the Minister makes an appointment to the board following consultation with interested parties and having regard to statutory constraints and factors, such as gender balance and the need to ensure the inclusion on the board of as wide a variety of appropriate interests as possible.</P>
      <P>In the weeks from 1 May to 26 June 1997, prior to leaving office, my predecessor, Deputy Noonan, made two series of appointments.  In the first case he made 43 appointments to nine boards under his aegis where vacancies already existed. These appointments have consequently been validly made and I have no intention of challenging any of them.</P>
      <P>However, the purported appointments to which Deputy Enright refers which the Minister made to the eight regional health boards for vacancies which had not yet arisen at the time of the appointment are in a different category, and I challenge Deputy Enright to find any precedent since 1970 under the Health Acts for this attempt by the Minister to make such purported appointments. That which the former Minister did, and not that which I have done, is unprecedented. The former Minister attempted to fill a vacancy when one did not exist during his tenure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point Deputy Enright makes that, had those vacancies arisen on 25 or 26 June, on <Col N="219" /> the last day of leaving office, I could not and would not challenge those appointments, but I will challenge on a matter of principle any attempt by a Minister to make appointments when vacancies do not exist while he is Minister. That is the reason for the present situation.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Enright that I put the former Minister on notice on 11 June by way of a statement suggesting that were he to purport to make such appointments he would leave me with no option but to rescind.  That was before any individual was mentioned by the then Minister Noonan for such a purported appointment.  The suggestion by Deputy Enright's colleagues &mdash; and not by the Deputy, in fairness &mdash; that I acted vindictively is given the lie by the fact that I put the former Minister on notice of what I intended to do should he proceed on the road on which he was about to embark.  There is no question of any personal vindictiveness on my part and I reject that comment with contempt from whatever quarter it has come because the facts belie that. That did not happen because I said what I would do before any name was mentioned in relation to these purported appointments.</P>
    <P>When I became aware that my predecessor might purport to make such appointments, I made that clear.  I advised him on 11 June not to proceed with such appointments to the health boards and it was reported in the national media the following day.  I also said at the time that it would be unconscionable for the then Minister to even contemplate actions on appointments which did not fall vacant until 1 July.  I added that it would be a demeaning exercise for the purported appointees themselves as they would not subsequently be able to stay in office.  Deputy Noonan was therefore aware that the purported appointments would be immediately challenged by me.</P>
    <P>However, I regret to say he ignored my advice and made a total of 24 purported appointments, three to each health board, including the three appointments to the Midland Health Board cited by Deputy Enright.  On taking office, far from acting arbitrarily or covetously, as has been contended, I obtained the benefit of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and in the light of this advice I concluded that the appointments were invalid.  In the circumstances, I felt it was inappropriate and unsatisfactory to allow the situation to continue.  I had no option but to regularise the situation, otherwise the boards would have been improperly constituted and as such their actions might have been open to challenge subsequently.</P>
    <P>In the light of the advice I received I wrote, before the date of their purported appointments, individually to all 24 persons concerned, including the three councillors mentioned by Deputy Enright, rescinding their purported appointments. I explained in my letters to each of the individuals my reasons for taking this action.  I also expressed my regret that this situation had <Col N="220" /> arisen through circumstances beyond either my or their control and I assured them that my action did not in any way reflect on them, or my appreciation of their good standing.  Any suggestion to the contrary by any politician in my area is not true, the facts speak for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that question in a moment.  Deputy Enright has insinuated that I have behaved in a dictatorial fashion.  My actions were proper and correct in regularising a situation created by my predecessor.  It was my predecessor's actions that were dictatorial, not mine.  I have since appointed members to five of the health boards and will make the balance of appointments soon.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appointments I have made to the Midland Health Board, I have appointed Seán Keegan, James Coyle and John Moloney to membership of the board for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2002.  I am sure they will make a valuable and substantial contribution to the work of the board.  They will be responsible for issues throughout the health board area, not just County Offaly.  The appointment of board members is not a matter for parochialism.  The wider picture must be considered, and people in the whole health board area are entitled to full representation.  The criticism that I have not appointed an Offaly person to the board is a vote of no confidence in the four Offaly people who are currently on the board, including Deputy Enright's colleague Councillor Michael Fox, who has made an excellent contribution along with Councillors Moylan and Feighery and Deputy Flanagan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The wider picture must be considered. I believe these members will be supportive of my policies and the policies of this Government, which is why they have been appointed.  I ask Deputy Enright to check the records of members of his party who were Ministers for Health.  They did not appoint Fianna Fáil members as political appointees, not because they were not generous but for the valid reason that it would be naive of a Minister to appoint people who did not support his policies as they are appointed by him for that purpose.  Deputy Enright has experience of this House since 1969 and he knows that to be the case.  That argument falls by the wayside also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have fairness on all sides.  I acted within my rights.  I did not seek confrontation; I suggest that my silence locally on this issue in the last two weeks has been an attempt to bring some dignity to the matter.  Many undignified comments have been made by Opposition politicians who belie the facts and have not been prepared to look at what I faced.  I will not allow a selective view of <Col N="221" /> history on the matter.  The Minister from Deputy Enright's party sought to put people on the Midland Health Board when there was no vacancy. Whether it happened during my tenure or another person's time, no Minister for Health worth his salt would have allowed it to stand.  I have legal advice to that effect and would not have acted had I not received it.  I therefore make <Col N="222" /> no apology.  All three persons appointed have long records of excellent service and I am sure they will represent my Department, this Government and the people of the Midland Health Board area excellently.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 10 July 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the two reports produced by the ministerial task force contained a range of proposals for tackling the demand side of the drugs problem.  The first report dealt primarily with heroin abuse which is concentrated in areas characterised by high levels of social and economic exclusion and is undoubtedly the most pressing aspect of the drugs problem confronting us at present.  The second report dealt with, among other issues, the misuse of so-called &ldquo;soft drugs&rdquo; such as cannabis and Ecstasy, as well as the question of how best to deal with drug mis-users who come into contact with the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>The two reports proposed a range of measures for tackling these problems, especially in the areas of treatment, rehabilitation and education/prevention.  They also proposed the establishment of local drugs task forces in the areas worst affected by the drugs menace, supported at the centre by a national drugs strategy team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the broad thrust of the strategies outlined in the two reports, many elements of which are currently being implemented.  With regard to the proposed youth services development fund, which Deputy Rabbitte refers to specifically in one of his questions, I see the provision of amenities and services for young people as a particularly important strategy in the area of <Col N="224" /> drugs education/prevention and I would, therefore, endorse the establishment of such a fund.</P>
    <P>I have assigned lead responsibility for the national drugs strategy to the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, who will have the local development brief at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  I will chair a Cabinet committee which will oversee the implementation of the Government's comprehensive drugs strategy.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work carried out by Deputy Rabbitte and his committee.  It is our firm intention to build on this work and continue to develop strategies to tackle the drugs scourge.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I had the honour on Tuesday last of travelling to Belfast to address the ICTU biennial conference. It gave me the opportunity to make clear my Government's commitment to implementing in full the terms of Partnership 2000; indeed, this is stated in our Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My speech to the conference covered a wide range of issues, including that of union recognition. I referred to the fact that a working group is being established on which representatives of ICTU, IBEC and Departments are included, together with the industrial development agencies. This is in accordance with the terms of Partnership 2000.  The issue is a complex one which will require detailed study of both international practice and experience.  An important task for <Col N="225" /> the group will be to explore different approaches to recognition and what their implications might be in the Irish context.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement has played an important role in the success of the economy. Social partnership has provided a sound basis for the management of change which is at the heart of this success.  It is right, therefore, to address their concerns that the failure on the part of some firms to negotiate with unions representing a large proportion of their staff is acting to the disadvantage of these employees.  This can also undermine the competitive position of other firms, often the majority, in the same sector which are providing acceptable pay and conditions.  We have a long history of arrangements to protect the rights of individual workers.  It is right that we address the issue of collective rights in the same balanced way.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the concerns as regards competitiveness with regard to overseas investment which attach to this issue.  However, the working group has been set up under the terms of Partnership 2000 and given its context within the partnership, I am confident of a constructive approach being adopted by all those involved and that the issue can be moved forward on a consensual basis.  I intend to stay in close contact with the group's ongoing work through participation of my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats programme for Government, there are proposals to increase funding for specific programmes.  County roads, education and rural development in particular are areas where the Government intends to allocate extra resources.  This will permit the <Col N="226" /> speeding up of certain programmes and the bringing forward of some proposals earlier than planned.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with a number of Deputies, they indicated that certain issues are important to them.  It would be the intention, over the life of the Government, to deal with most of the issues, many of which will be on local authority plans in any event.  There are no proposals to exceed Government planned overall expenditure targets. However, within them we will be addressing areas of neglect which have been highlighted by the general election.</P>

Committees of the House are not and cannot be regarded as tools of the Executive.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that prior to the dissolution of the last Dáil the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on reform of Dáil procedure, as part of its adoption of formal positions on matters of common agreement, initiated a review of the committee system to be conducted by an outside consultant.  This review was carried out by Professor Michael Laver and a team from Trinity College, Dublin, and has now been completed.  An interim report has been presented and the final report will be presented shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the consultant's reports will be considered by the incoming Committee on Procedure and Privileges or by its sub-committee on reform of Dáil procedure if it is agreed to reestablish that sub-committee.  I consider it would be most appropriate that any Government proposals in relation to the establishment of committees should be presented to the Committee on <Col N="227" /> Procedure and Privileges or the sub-committee for consideration in the first instance, taking account of Professor Laver's report.  I hope that the principle of consensus which marked the workings of the sub-committee in the last Dáil will continue to operate in the current Dáil.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the issue of combining work, or indeed access to training initiatives, and family responsibilities applies generally to women with families and there are a number of initiatives already in place which seek to address the problems which can arise.</P>
      <P>FÁS is currently supporting a &ldquo;Local Action for Women&rdquo; initiative under the European Union NOW Programme.  This programme aims to develop and test flexible methods of providing training and employment services to women at a local level.  This involves the delivery of modular training in partnership with local groups for women who wish to return to work, including lone parents.  There is flexibility in both the timing and location of such training to suit the particular needs and circumstances of the participants. There are four pilot locations, Tipperary, Clonmel, Athlone and Portlaoise.  An example of such training for lone parents is the south Tipperary lone parent initiative based in Clonmel which focuses on the specific training needs of lone parents.</P>
      <P>On completion of the pilot phase of the initiative at the end of 1997, FÁS and my Department will be looking at ways and means by which its beneficial elements can be mainstreamed to other training and employment programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>FÁS is also very conscious of the need for child care facilities for women returning to work and contributes over £5 million per annum to community based child care provision by way of support for community employment projects.  Over 130 community employment projects have such a child care provision.  Many of these facilities provide community based child care for women undertaking training or education.  As stated in the recent White Paper on Human Resource Development, FÁS and the employment service will, in conjunction with area partnerships, further develop child care opportunities in order to increase the facilities available to women who <Col N="231" /> wish to enter training or education programmes or to take up employment.  These measures will be of assistance not alone to single parents but to all women in achieving equal access to training and employment.</P>

      <P>The taxation system has in the past played an important role in Ireland's industrial success.  It is my intention to encourage enterprise and increase the competitiveness of business using whatever means are appropriate.  In furtherance of this objective the programme for Government sets out this Administration's proposals as to how the tax code might provide a further stimulus in promoting a spirit of entrepreneurship amongst Ireland's young working population.</P>
      <P>In particular, it is the intention of this Government that the standard rate of corporation tax post-2010 should be a continuation of the current 10 per cent manufacturing rate.  The continuation of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax will send a strong and positive signal to both potential overseas investors and prospective Irish entrepreneurs of this Government's intention to maintain a tax competitive environment for Irish business.</P>
      <P>In considering the detailed changes that are likely to become necessary to the taxation code in implementing a 10 per cent standard rate of corporation tax post-2010, and bearing in mind the likely contraction of the volume of EU funding for Ireland from its current level after 1999, the Government proposes reviewing a number of the existing tax reliefs which are available for promoting business activity with a view to increasing their efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of this Government to examine the existing capital tax structures with a view to establishing whether a greater spirit of entrepreneurship might be promoted through modification of existing capital tax rates, and-or allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, as the Deputy will be aware, the policy document for this Government published jointly by both the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil entitled An Action Programme for the Millennium sets out the objective of reducing the basic rate of income tax to 20 per cent and the higher rate of income tax to 42 per cent over the next five years in addition to effecting significant increases in both the standard rate band and individual tax allowances.  This initiative will provide a further impetus to those who are employed as it will enable them to take home a greater proportion of their earnings.  As such these proposed <Col N="232" /> changes in the income tax code will provide an additional boost to the economy and give further encouragement to the spirit of entrepreneurship among Ireland's young men and women.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that this Administration will use every opportunity, whether through tax reform, education, or any other means, to foster and promote a sense of entrepreneurship within the population as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the urgent requirement to address the skills needs of the information technology industries.</P>
      <P>On 11 February last, the Government decided on a package of measures to address the skills needs of these industries.  The Government's action plan on skills included, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a bidding process with educational and training institutions, both in the public and private sectors, to identify the most cost effective way of providing an extra 1,000 software graduates per annum and 750 technicians places per annum in electronic, electrical, mechanical and production engineering.</P>
      <P>A steering committee, chaired by Mr. Noel Lindsay, Chairman of the Higher Education Authority, was established to oversee the bidding process.  My Department participated in the Lindsay committee in the preparation of its report which has now been finalised.  In this regard, I have been in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Education, and it is our intention to shortly announce the Government's response.</P>
      <P>Outside the higher education sector, to which the Lindsay report confined itself, further proposals are being developed.  FÁS is actively engaged with leading firms in the electronics industry in the design, development and delivery of innovative approaches to technician training, for example, traineeships.  FÁS has also been actively involved in delivering urgent responses to the need to train for languages requirements in the fast developing telemarketing sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the rapid development of the information technology industries and the important contribution which they make to the economy, I assure the Deputy that I will continue to attach the utmost priority to the training needs of these industries.  In this regard, it is accepted that there is a need to sharpen up the process of advance monitoring of the future numbers and types of skills needed by industry.  The platform for this will be the future skills identification group, under the aegis of Forfás announced recently in <Col N="233" /> the White Paper on Human Resource Development.</P>

      <P>The CORI part-time job opportunity programme is a three-year pilot programme which was scheduled to end in June 1997.  Given that there will be wind-down issues and that some individual projects did not start on time it will be the end of September before the programme is completely finished. CORI's involvement with the programme ceased at the end of May, as was its wish.</P>
      <P>An evaluation of the pilot programme has been completed and was considered by the previous Government.  The evaluation points to a number of positive outcomes from the programme, such as allowing participants to remain on projects for three years and the introduction of spousal swops.  These aspects have already been mainstreamed into community employment.  Other innovations of the CORI concept, such as the rate for the job approach, were the subject of detailed negotiations between officials of my Department and representatives of CORI and it was decided that the rate for the job should be applied to the community employment part-time job option on a gradual basis from September 1997, subject to a minimum participation period of 12 hours per week.</P>
      <P>At least 3,000 participants will be paid the rate for the job by September 1998, a further 3,000 by September 1999 and the remaining participants on the part-time job option by September 2000. The rate for the job approach has already been adopted in the pilot whole time job initiative programme.</P>
      <P>With regard to the existing sponsors-participants in the pilot programme, the position is that all suitable CORI sponsors who wish to convert to community employment will be allowed to do so; participants will receive special guidance and counselling before the project comes to an end to help them get employment in the open labour market, and that the option of allowing participants a further year on community employment be maintained if it becomes necessary.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 70 people working in animation studios in Ireland at present; this number tends to fluctuate depending on the number of contracts a company is working on at any given time.

      <P>Animation qualifies for Forbairt and IDA Ireland support under the media recording sector of internationally traded services.  While in recent years IDA Ireland has concentrated its marketing efforts on other areas of business with international services, such as telemarketing, Forbairt has supported a number of animation projects. For example, following the closure in 1995 of Screen Animation, previously known as Sullivan Bluth, Forbairt assisted two projects at feasibility stage.  These were promoted by two former employees of Screen Animation interested in developing pilot programmes and/or investigating start-up opportunities.</P>

The application was based on the contention that there had been an excessive delay in bringing the charges to a hearing and that as a result the defendant was prejudiced in the preparation of his defence and was, therefore, being denied a fair trial.  An appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Supreme Court was dismissed.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the society is understood to have left a deficit in excess of £1 million, of which about £800,000 was owed to savers/depositors.  A liquidator was appointed to the society by the High Court in June 1985.  However, I understand that there is no possibility of recovering any of the moneys lost and that the liquidator is anxious to bring the liquidation to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 69, 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised that these questions arise from a dispute between FÁS and a professional adviser acting on behalf of Irish Publishing Co-operative, IPC, whose application in 1996 for a feasibility study grant from the co-operative development unit, CDU, of FÁS was unsuccessful.  In the circumstances I propose to answer these questions together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with normal procedure, representations made to my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, in connection with the unsuccessful IPC grant application, resulted in officials of my Department making inquiries of FÁS.  At the time, the FÁS complaints co-ordinator was carrying out an investigation into allegations made against FÁS by the adviser acting for IPC. My Department was informed that this investigation was being finalised in or around the beginning of February 1997.  I understand that a comprehensive response issued to the adviser acting for IPC on 24 March, the final paragraph of which suggested that if the outcome was unsatisfactory the complaint could be referred to the FÁS complaints commissioner, now the FÁS client services commissioner.</P>
      <P>Arising from my predecessor's interest in this matter, a copy of the report of the complaints co-ordinator was furnished to my Department by FÁS.  This report has been the subject of extensive written and telephone correspondence between the adviser to IPC and officials of my Department over a period of five months and I am satisfied that any further review of the contents of the report is unnecessary and would serve no useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of FÁS has established arrangements for its client services commissioner to consider certain types of unresolved complaints from individuals in relation to services provided by FÁS with a view to the investigation of, satisfaction, settlement or withdrawal of such complaints. The main functions of the board of FÁS <Col N="239" /> in this regard are to appoint the commissioner, to pay for the operation of the scheme, to ensure the commissioner's independence, to monitor his terms of reference and to monitor the working of the scheme generally.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the appointment of the commissioner represents a major development within FÁS which will provide an independent structure for individuals who may be unhappy about the manner in which their grievances have been dealt with through the normal channels.  The scheme is a relatively new development and I am satisfied that the majority of individuals who would seek to avail of the service of the commissioner would come within the current claims ceiling of £5,000 as set out in the commissioner's terms of reference. However, the terms of the scheme, including the claims ceiling, are subject to ongoing review by FÁS.  The existence of this scheme in no way prevents any individual from pursuing the traditional methods of resolving disagreements between parties in dispute.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the work of the EU Structural Funds information unit which, I might add, operates under the Minister for Finance and has no connection with the ESF evaluation unit operating under my Department.  I confirm that my Department has recently received a request from the information unit for a list of feasibility study grant beneficiaries under the scheme operated by the co-operative development unit of FÁS.  This information has been supplied by FÁS and has been provided to the unit in the form requested.  Grant aid available from the CDU is provided exclusively from Exchequer resources and there is no element of European Social Funding involved in the current grant scheme.</P>
    <P>The work of the Co-operative Development Council, CDC, and the co-operative development unit, CDU, of FÁS is part of the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development 1994-99.  The membership of the CDC is as follows: Chairman, Mr. Bill Attley, General Secretary, SIPTU; Mr. Cathal Ó Finneadha, Department of Enterprise and Employment nominee; Mrs. Anne Forde, Irish League of Credit Unions; Mr. Stephen McCarthy, ICTU; Mr. Tom Redmond, Irish Federation of Workers' Co-operatives; Mr. Patrick Campbell, IBEC, and Mr. Gregory Tierney, Irish Co-operative Organisations Society Ltd.</P>
    <P>The CDC held eight meetings in 1994, six meetings in 1995, four meetings in 1996 and three meetings to date in 1997.  The terms of reference of the council, which was set up in 1988 under the terms of the Programme for National Recovery, are as follows: to stimulate greater awareness about co-operatives and their potential for development and employment; to identify the needs of co-operatives and worker co-operatives in particular; to identify and seek to correct gaps in current provisions, and to monitor the work programme of the co-operative development unit of FÁS.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> I am satisfied that the council and the CDU have developed and undertaken a wide range of successful promotional activities, business support, innovative training programmes and research under these headings and I have no plans at present to alter the functions or resources of the body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's responsibilities under the Operational Programme for Human Resources Development are several fold.  It provides the secretariat and chairman for, and is a direct participant on, the monitoring committee which has overall responsibility for managing and implementing the programme. The monitoring committee is a partnership structure between the European Commission and the Irish Administration, comprising representatives of the relevant Commission directorates, Government Departments and their implementing agencies and the social partners.  As the national authority for the European Social Fund, it has responsibility for drawing down and disbursing the European Social Fund component of the programme and for acting as secretariat to the monitoring committee in so far as accounting for expenditure and reporting on progress on the implementation of the programme is concerned. It has policy responsibility for the specific components of the programme which are delivered by FÁS in the domain of continuing training and other labour market measures.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for ensuring that measures under the programme are implemented in an equitable manner rests in the first instance with implementing agencies and their boards where relevant, for example, FÁS and the NRB, over-seen from policy perspective by their parent Departments &mdash; the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Health in the foregoing instances &mdash; or by Departments where they are the direct implementing agencies, for example, the Departments of Education and Justice.  The monitoring committee also provides overarching supervision of the implementation of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that the measures under the programme are delivered in other than <Col N="241" /> an equitable and proper manner and, given the arrangements outlined, I believe that they are sufficient to ensure that that remains the case.</P>

      <P>The employment regulation orders referred to by the Deputy are made by the Labour Court, following proposals submitted to it by the relevant joint labour committee, JLC.</P>
      <P>There are two JLCs for hairdressing workers; one committee covers workers in the county and county borough of Dublin, the borough of Dún Laoghaire and the urban district of Bray; and the other committee covers workers in the Cork county borough.  Each committee was established by the Labour Court following an inquiry into an application to establish such a committee.  The court when establishing a JLC specifies the jurisdiction of the committee.</P>
      <P>A decision on the extension of the jurisdiction of the JLCs, or establishment of a new committee, for hairdressing workers employed elsewhere in the State is a matter for the Labour Court in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 to 1990.</P>
      <P>I do not, at present, have proposals to seek an extension of these committees, or the establishment of a new committee, for hairdressing workers on a nationwide basis.  However, trade unions or other organisations claiming to represent hairdresssing workers may, if they so decide, make application to the Labour Court for the extension of the remit of the JLCs.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that the wage levels for all workers, including those in the hairdressing sector, should be fair and reasonable.  Accordingly, the programme for Government contains as a key priority, in promoting an inclusive society, the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage following early consultation with the social partners. I intend to bring proposals to Cabinet on this commitment at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the Agreement on Social Policy which is attached to the Protocol on Social Policy annexed to the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides for the adoption of directives on a range of issues in the field of social policy, including matters relating to workers' rights.  However, it is the European Commission which has the right of initiative, in consultation with the social partners, management and labour, at European level, as regards the making of legislative proposals in the areas covered by the agreement. I will carefully examine any such proposals which may be brought forward but it is not for me to pre-empt the Commission's thinking or the views of the social partners in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that two directives have already been adopted under the agreement, namely, the directive on the establishment of <Col N="243" /> European works councils, which was implemented in Ireland last year, and the directive on parental leave and leave for family reasons which is due for implementation by mid-1998.</P>
    <P>A common position was adopted by the Council of Ministers for Labour and Social Affairs at their meeting on 27 June, 1997 on a draft directive on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex, the legal base of which is Article 2 (2) of the agreement.  I can also inform the Deputy that the social partners at EU level recently signed a framework agreement on part-time work following negotiations on the issue under the terms of the Agreement on Social Policy. It is expected that the Commission will submit a proposal on the subject to the Council for a decision in the near future.</P>
    <P>The framework agreement sets out general principles and minimum requirements relating to part-time work with the aim of preventing discrimination against part-time workers and facilitating the development of part-time work on a voluntary basis, thereby contributing to flexibility in the organisation of working time.  The Commission also recently launched consultations with the social partners on the issues of information and consultation of employees at national level, that is, for companies not covered by the Directive on European Works Councils.</P>
    <P>I should add that the United Kingdom, which had opted out of the Agreement on Social Policy at the time of the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty, has now decided to accede to the social provisions contained therein and has indicated its willingness to accept the directives which have already been adopted under the agreement.</P>

      <P>The effects on the operation of our labour market of labour legislation, including that inspired by EU obligations, have been debated at length in recent years without the controversy ever being satisfactorily resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The personal views I have expressed on the regulation of the labour market emerged from my growing concern that the continued unquestioning extension of protective legislation &mdash; much of it emerging from the EU &mdash; could give rise to competitive disadvantages for Irish businesses both within the Union and in a wider global context. In this connection, I was particularly concerned about the possible effects of the UK opt out from the EU Social Protocol.  This concern is <Col N="244" /> relieved somewhat by the new UK Government's recent decision to end this opt out.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the process, over the past 25 years, of developing a balanced package of labour laws setting our basic social standards is now virtually complete and it is anticipated that the emphasis for the foreseeable future will be on consolidating, simplifying, and improving existing provisions rather than on introducing major new initiatives.  Nonetheless, I remain concerned that some of the existing laws or regulations may constitute an unnecessary administrative burden on business or industry and I propose to undertake a review of these requirements with a view to identifying any such burdens and the options for dealing with them.</P>

      <P>The Bell Lines Shipping Company and four related companies were wound up by order of the High Court on Friday, 4 July, 1997 and a liquidator was appointed.  It is a matter for the liquidator to realise the assets of the companies and, in the case of the Bell Group, it is likely that the assets will be sold, as going concerns.  The Bell Lines liquidator was appointed by the High Court and, in performing his powers, he is at all times subject to the supervision of the court.  While it is early days yet, I am confident that the liquidator will be successful in securing the future of the core businesses of the Bell Group, thus saving the maximum number of jobs possible.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the appointment of the liquidator, I assured Waterford Harbour Commissioners of the Government's full support in maintaining and developing their businesses into the future.  With a view to guaranteeing and securing the future of Waterford Port, I have put the following action plan into place.  I am making top level, marketing and business development expertise available to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in order to accelerate recovery; I have ensured that repayments on European Investment Bank loans will be met without adversely affecting the financial position of Waterford Port; my Department and Waterford Harbour Commissioners will give every assistance to the liquidator in order to maintain the maximum number of jobs and level of business in the port area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Waterford Port has benefited from a substantial State supported investment programme of over £35 million in the past six years, including substantial EU Structural and Cohesion Funds aid, and this investment must be protected as a basis for future growth and development.  Waterford Port has a strong state-of-the art infrastructure and a proud tradition in the provision of portal and shipping services.  Belview terminal is one of the most modern container ports in Ireland and can provide national and international carriers with direct and cost-efficient access to the UK and continental Europe.  Already, Waterford Harbour Commissioners are looking for alternative carriers to operate out of Waterford Port and <Col N="246" /> have received queries from some carriers as to availability of facilities.</P>
    <P>I will be working directly with the commissioners to secure the future of the port as a major strategic port.  I intend to review with port management on a regular basis over the next few weeks the strategic options open to them.  In this connection I will be visiting the port in the next few days.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Rail services between Kilcock/Maynooth and Dublin will benefit from an EU assisted investment package in the Dublin-Sligo line.  This includes a major upgrading of track and signalling currently being undertaken with assistance from the Cohesion Fund.  In addition an allocation of Structural Fund assistance under the Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 includes provision for new stations at Kilcock and Drumcondra. Iarnród Éireann has responsibility for implementing the individual elements of the package.  I have no direct responsibility in the matter.</P>
      <P>Plans for the upgrading of the Maynooth rail corridor are also being considered as part of ongoing discussions between my Department, CIE and the European Commission concerning the further development of Dublin suburban rail services.  CIE is currently undertaking a detailed review of development needs in this area which will provide the basis for future decisions on investment priorities.</P>

      <P>The United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East (UNTSO) was established in 1948 to supervise the ceasefire arranged by the United Nations Security Council between Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Israel.  It is an unarmed observer mission whose duties are to observe the ceasefire and report breaches thereof.</P>
      <P>The payment of an overseas observer allowance to personnel serving as observers with UNTSO was first sanctioned in 1971.  In the exceptional conditions arising from the war of June, 1967, it was decided to authorise payment of this allowance in respect of service in that particular mission area with effect from 1 June, 1967. Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force first participated with UNTSO in December, 1958. Twenty-seven officers served with this organisation prior to 1 June, 1967, accounting for 15,411 mandays.  The approximate cost of conceding retrospective payment of observer overseas allowance would be £185,000 at current daily rates.  In view of the very considerable time, approximately 30 years, which has elapsed since the personnel concerned served on this mission, I feel that payment of retrospective observer overseas allowance at this stage is not justified.  I am further persuaded in this course by the rationale adopted by my predecessors since the 1970s, in granting retrospection of the 1971 allowance to 1 June, 1967, viz.  the particular conditions of hardship occasioned by the Arab-Israeli war of June 1967 and subsequently.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package (which was paid out last October) provided for payment of top-ups in respect of animals which qualified for payment under the 1995 EU suckler cow premium scheme and 1995 EU special beef premium scheme.  The regulations also provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium scheme and the 1996 EU special beef premium scheme.  In effect the regulations required that when all balancing payments under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium schemes and 1996 EU special beef premium schemes were made a comparison was to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money was to be recouped from those farmers who had received a BSE top-up payment in respect of animals qualifying under the 1995 schemes but had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  The person named was paid 14 special beef premium top-up grants on 4 October 1996 under the 1996 BSE top-up scheme amounting to £267.12 (£19.08 × 14) based on her 1995 special beef premium entitlements.  As she was only paid on ten animals under the 1996 special beef premium scheme, the overpayment of £76.32 (four top-up grants) was recouped from her 1997 BSE/agrimonetary payment of £100.  The £23.68 balance of 1997 top-up payment due was paid on 26 May 1997.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1996 suckler cow premium on six animals and gave dates of last calving, as required, for five of them. The sixth animal was not shown as having previously calved i.e. no date of last calving was entered on the application.  A forward date of calving was, however, recorded.  The Department accepted that as the applicant openly declared an in-calf heifer which was an ineligible animal on his application, this could be regarded as an innocent error on his part.  As a result, this animal was deleted, without any reduction penalty, and an advance payment on five cows amounting to £560.92 was made on 2 December 1996.  The balancing payment of £140.23 was made on 23 April 1997.</P>

      <P>The person named applied for 1996 suckler cow premium on seven animals and has not yet been paid grants on any of them.  At an inspection carried out on his herd in early December 1996 only six of the animals listed were presented.  The seventh animal was absent and it was established, with the herdowner, that it was absent at application date.  The application was completed from cattle identity cards held at the time, even though a checklist which issued with the application form and terms and conditions instructed the applicant that the eartag number of each cow being applied on should be physically checked.  The applicant was informed on 11 December 1996 that the animal was being rejected and payment would be made on the other animals at a reduced rate.  He sought a review of this decision.</P>
      <P>His case was reviewed and the original decision was upheld.  He was informed on 11 June 1997 that he could appeal his case further to the headage and premia appeals unit within 21 days. Since he has not appealed within the relevant timeframe, his 1996 suckler cow premium application will now be finalised and payment in respect of six animals at a reduced rate will issue in the near future.</P>

      <P>Following an appeal the penalty was reduced to one year only.  He was informed of this on 9 September 1996 by the headage and premia appeals unit.  He was also informed that, if he had not lodged a 1996 suckler cow premium application form already that there would be an application period in October 1996 and that he should contact his district livestock office for an application form.

      <P>She applied on 170 mountain ewes and 35 hogget ewes under the 1996 sheep headage scheme. Clause 8 of the terms and conditions governing this scheme states that &ldquo;no applicant will be paid sheep/goat headage on more than 200 sheep and goats combined&rdquo;.  Accordingly, she was paid her full entitlement on 200 animals and received a part-payment of £1,630 on 11 November 1996 and the balance of £370 on 29 January 1997.  She also received her full entitlement under the 1996 sheep headage top-up; a part-payment of £198 was paid on 5 December 1996 and the balance of £37 was paid on 25 March 1997.</P>
      <P>She applied on 12 animals under the 1996 suckler cow scheme.  Her suckler cow quota is for 11.9 animals and she received her full entitlement of £1,668.73; an advance of £1,334.98 was paid on 11 November 1996 and the balance of £333.75 was paid on 15 April 1997.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package which was paid out in October 1996, provided for payment of a top-up of £22.40 per head in respect of suckler cows qualifying for payment under the 1995 suckler cow scheme and £19.08 per head in respect of steers qualifying for payment under the 1995 special beef premium scheme.  As this herdowner did not submit an application under the 1995 special beef premium schemes and was not entitled to payment in respect of his 1995 suckler cow application due to the number of animals rejected, he was not eligible for payment at those rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations governing the suckler and special beef premium top-ups provided for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium <Col N="257" /> and special beef premium schemes.  The EU Commission insisted that the initial top-ups should be based on the 1995 schemes in order to ensure that the payments could be made before 15 October 1996.</P>
    <P>The regulations require that when all payments under the 1996 suckler cow and special beef premium schemes are made, a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying under the 1995 schemes and the number qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money is then to be recouped from those farmers who, having received the top-up in respect of animals qualifying under the 1995 schemes, had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money so recouped is to be used to make top-up payments to those farmers who already received top-ups under the 1995 schemes but had more animals in 1996 than they had in 1995 and also to the farmers who had no entitlement under the 1995 schemes.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to carry out a comparison between the number of suckler cows and steers qualifying for premium in 1995 and 1996 with a view to recouping overpayments in appropriate cases from any 1996 entitlements still remaining to be paid and/or entitlements under the 1997 BSE/agrimonetary package.  When all of the overpayments have been recouped, the money available will be distributed to those farmers who had more animals qualifying under the 1996 suckler cow scheme and the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  The rate payable per animal to the farmers concerned will depend on the overall amount of money recouped.  When these adjustments are made later this year, this herdowner will be due 12 such grants in respect of his 1996 beef premium animals and 15 in respect of his 1996 suckler cows.</P>

When this documentation is received and if it is in order his suckler cow premium application will be finalised and payment will issue.  Payment of extensification premium is ongoing and if the person named is found eligible, after all of his 1996 applications have been processed, he will be paid in the near future.</P>

      <P>The person named applied on two equines under the 1996 equine headage scheme. However, as he failed to comply with clause 20 of the terms and conditions governing this scheme which requires that each producer must have submitted a 1996 area aid application he is not entitled to any headage grant under this scheme.</P>
      <P>He applied on 21 animals under the 1996 cattle headage scheme.  When an inspection was carried out on 20 September 1996, nine animals were absent.  Consequently, a 100 per cent penalty was incurred.  In any event, the person named would not have been entitled to any headage grants under this scheme since he failed to submit a 1996 area aid application as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He applied for the October 1996 cow suckler <Col N="259" /> scheme under his own herd number.  The application could not be processed as an application had already been received on 5 June 1996 for the May 1996 suckler cow premium scheme for small-scale milk producers under a different herd number of which the person named became one of the joint registered owners on 5 July 1996.  Only one application is allowed under the suckler cow premium scheme each year.  He and his mother received their full entitlement of £1,287.82 under this scheme on 16 May 1997.  An area aid application had been received in his mother's name.</P>

      <P>The person named will be paid 1996 special beef premium on 26 animals and 1997 BSE-agrimonetary grants on those 26 beef premium animals and also on 14 suckler cows shortly.</P>
      <P>The regulations governing payment of the 1996 BSE compensation package, which was paid out in October 1996, provide for payment of a top-up of £22.40 per head in respect of suckler cows qualifying for payments under the 1995 suckler cow scheme and £19.08 per head in respect of steers qualifying for payment under the 1995 special beef premium scheme.</P>
      <P>These regulations provide for adjustments, upwards and downwards, later on to take account of the number of animals qualifying for payment under the 1996 EU suckler cow premium and special beef premium schemes.  The EU Commission insisted that the initial top-ups should be based on the 1995 schemes in order to ensure that the payments could be made before 15 October 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations require that when all payments under the 1996 suckler cow and special beef premium schemes are made a comparison is to be carried out between the number of animals qualifying under the 1995 schemes and under the 1996 schemes.  Money is then to be recouped from those farmers who received the top-up in respect of animals qualifying under the 1995 schemes but <Col N="261" /> had fewer animals qualifying under the 1996 schemes.  Money so recouped is to be used to make top-up payments to those farmers who already received top-ups under the 1995 schemes but who had more animals in 1996 than they had in 1995.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently carrying out a comparison between the number of suckler cows and steers qualifying for premium in 1995 and 1996 with a view to recouping overpayments in appropriate cases from 1996 schemes entitlements and-or entitlements under 1997 schemes. When all of the overpayments have been recouped the money available will be distributed to those farmers who had more animals qualifying under the 1996 suckler cow scheme and the 1996 special beef premium scheme.  The rate payable per animal to the farmers concerned will depend on the overall amount of money recouped. It is expected that when these adjustments will be made later this year that this herdowner will receive four such grants on his 1996 beef premium animals.</P>
    <P>My Department has no record of having received an application for BSE top-up in respect of tag number CRA 179161.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture Ministers has agreed that overshoot penalties may be applied to individual producers responsible for excess production subject to the adoption of detailed rules by the Commission.  The new arrangements will involve the use of a growers register which has already been drawn up.  Discussions are under way on the new rules which will only be applied if the national base area is exceeded.  Present utilisation of the base area in this country is below that limit.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any formal proposal to cap cereal aid and the proposal to cut arable aid payments to cereal growers was rejected by the Council when agreeing the prices package for 1997-98.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grain quality assurance scheme is an initiative of the industry and it is not yet my <Col N="262" /> intention to provide specific grants for the upgrading of premises involved in the scheme. The provision of grant aid for grain assembly is covered in the food sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development. The provision of this aid is severely curtailed by EU Commission rules.  Assistance will however be available from my Department's inspectorate in the monitoring of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the declaration of ingredients by compounders is that EU legislation requires that the label on compound feedingstuffs shows all the ingredients in descending order by weight.  As an option, compounders may declare categories of ingredients which are prescribed. However, many of the major compounders are now opting for full declaration of ingredients in descending order by weight and most of the remainder are taking steps to do likewise.  I am most anxious that this should become the norm as soon as possible.</P>

Both applicants included significant proportions of leased commonage lands in their applications.  Owing to uncertainty as to the eligibility of leased commonage lands for REPS payment my Department, after consultations with the REPS planning agency involved, referred the matter to the European Commission for consideration. A response from the Commission is awaited.</P>

      <P>Departments and public service organisations under his remit.  The remit of the Ombudsman was originally confined to Departments and offices staffed by civil servants.  In December 1984, this was extended by Government order to cover, <i>inter alia,</i> administrative actions of health boards and health board hospitals.  However, under section 5 (2) of the Ombudsman Act, 1980, the Ombudsman is limited to investigating actions &ldquo;taken in the performance of administrative functions&rdquo;.  Accordingly, clinical matters remain outside his remit.</P>

    <P>A key priority for institutional reform set out in <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> is <Col N="267" /> the expansion of the remit of the Ombudsman to include legal, medical and other areas.

I hope to bring specific proposals to Government in relation to all these matters in the near future.</P>

      <P>Capital acquisitions tax, is due whenever a person receives a gift or an inheritance, subject to certain exemptions, thresholds and reliefs.  This tax is based on the concept of the relationship between the recipient and the disponer.  There are three categories of disponer &mdash; Class I, £185,550, transfers from a parent to a child, Class II, £24,740, transfers between certain other relatives and Class III, £12,370, transfers between strangers. Transfers between spouses either by way of gift or inheritance are exempt from capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>In addition to the three thresholds and the spouse exemption there is also a relief for elderly siblings who live together.  This relief allows the value of a house or part of a house which is inherited to be reduced for CAT purposes by £80,000 or 60 per cent whichever is the lesser. This relief, which was introduced in 1991, recognises the special circumstances of elderly siblings living together, and eased the tax burden associated with inheritances in such situations.  In this year's Finance Act the relief was amended to the effect of increasing the threshold from £60,000 to £80,000 in the case of relevant inheritances taken on or after 10 May 1997.</P>
      <P>Individuals who reside together and are neither married nor come within the remit of the elderly siblings relief are treated as strangers for CAT.</P>
      <P>The application of the CAT arrangements to various categories of recipients is kept under review in particular from the point of view of anomalies.  However the Exchequer cost implications of any changes in the current arrangements would have to be borne in mind.</P>

      <P>The highest general rate of VAT which existed was 35 per cent which reached this level on 1 March 1983.  A fundamental restructuring of the rate system took place with effect from 1 March 1985 resulting in the elimination of this rate and the goods and services which had previously been chargeable at this rate became liable at 23 per cent.  The 23 per cent rate was increased to 25 per cent with effect from 1 March 1986 and remained so until 1 March 1990 when it was reduced again to 23 per cent.  It was further reduced to 21 per cent with effect from 1 March 1991 and has remained at that rate since then.  This is now the standard rate.</P>
      <P>Adult footwear, previously liable at the zero rate, became liable to a positive rate of VAT on 1 March 1985 at the reduced rate of 10 per cent. This rate was increased to 12.5 per cent for a wide range of items, including adult footwear, with effect from 1 March 1991.  The rate was further increased to 16 per cent with effect from 1 March 1992 for a wide range of items, again including adult footwear.</P>
      <P>On 1 March 1993, the 16 per cent was removed and a number of items including adult footwear, became taxable at 21 per cent, that is the standard rate.</P>

      <P>Consideration is currently being given to the implications of restructuring deals completed under the PCW for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  The joint statement issued by the leaders of the parties elected to Government last month acknowledged the role played by public servants over the decades and undertook to &ldquo;resolve the problems surrounding the pensions of retired public service <Col N="269" /> staff&rdquo;.  The matter is also included in the Goverment's joint programme, <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium,</i> which states that public service pensions will be protected.  In addition I point out that the issue of pensions increased in the foregoing context has been the subject of ongoing discussions with the public services committee of ICTU.</P>
      <P>Against this background of protecting public sector pensions, I am considering options for uprating pensions in the particular circumstances of restructuring deals under the PCW provision and I expect to make a decision on the matter shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that with effect from the current tax year 1997-98, the taxpayer has been granted the income tax exemption limit appropriate to persons who are aged 75 years or over, that is, £5,200.  Although any income over this limit will be taxed at the rate of 40 per cent the taxpayer will pay less tax than if she were taxed under the normal tax system.</P>
      <P>However, the taxpayer's Department of Social Welfare pension had been underestimated by £500 when her original certificate of tax-free allowances for 1997-98 was drawn up.  When her tax-free allowances were amended to take account of the underestimation, and also of the increase in social welfare payments which came into effect in June, this resulted in her tax liability being increased.  She is now paying approximately £3 tax per month more than she has been paying.</P>

      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, it should be recognised that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowances and double rate bands is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems looked at, <i>inter alia,</i> the position of cohabiting couples generally.  The group's report was published on 27 June 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group has recently been set up under the Department of <Col N="274" /> Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by March 1998.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the decisions to end duty free facilities for intra-community travel, with effect from 30 June 1999, have already been taken by the ECOFIN Council and enacted into Community law as part of the agreement on the EU single market.</P>
      <P>This decision can only be reversed by unanimous agreement at Council, following a proposal from the Commission.  So far, the Commission has maintained that it is not prepared to put fresh proposals to the Council for any extension beyond the existing date.</P>
      <P>To help inform any future discussions of this issue, at both domestic and EU level, my predecessor announced the intention to undertake an independent study into the consequences for Ireland of ending duty free sales.  Following the open tender process started by my predecessor, I hope to be able to announce the award of a contract for this work shortly.</P>
      <P>I will then decide the most appropriate course of action after I have examined the results of the study, which should be completed by the autumn.</P>

      <P>As stated in <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> the Government's priorities include limiting net current spending growth to 4 per cent which is broadly equivalent to the 2 per cent growth in real terms agreed in Partnership 2000, and capital spending growth to 5 per cent on average up to 1999.  Net current spending comprises net current supply services and central fund services.</P>
      <P>Overall Government spending comprises net current supply services spending, central fund services, the Exchequer financed part of the public capital programme and non-programme outlays. The relevant definition of national output is gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>The 4 per cent limit relates to the annual average increase up to 1999, with the policy aim of not exceeding that limit, if possible, in any year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 161, 168, 204 and 209 together.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government, <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium,</i> includes a commitment to support the establishment of a heart and lung transplant facility in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the annual heart-lung and lung transplant caseload in this country would be between ten and 20 cases if a programme were to be established.  Information collated by the health boards indicated that up to 35 people were awaiting heart-lung transplants at the end of 1996.  Figures supplied by the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority show that four people from Ireland attended United Kingdom hospitals in 1996 for heart-lung transplant operations.  International research suggests that between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of recipients of heart-lung and lung transplantations are cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
      <P>It is difficult at this stage to accurately assess the cost of establishing a heart-lung transplant programme.  The capital cost of establishing a heart-lung transplant unit was estimated by one potential site, the Mater Hospital, at £2.6 million with annual revenue costs estimated at a further £2.4 million.  However, these estimates were prepared in 1995 and also included provision for the cost of additional cardiac surgery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Setting up a successful transplant programme for any specialty is an extremely complex and difficult <Col N="277" /> task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, infrastructure and back-up resources to ensure successful outcomes.  Apart from the surgery involved it is equally important to develop expertise in pre and post operative care and to develop a long-term after care programme associated with transplantation.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present carrying out detailed research into the establishment of a heart-lung and lung transplant programme in Ireland.  The strategy will be to approach the issue on a phased basis in the context of the need for an integrated national programme to develop cardiac care services.  Initially, it may be necessary to develop a formal link with a transplant centre in the United Kingdom which would treat Irish patients currently waiting for heart-lung or lung transplants and assist us in building up the necessary expertise required to operate a successful programme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My Department is working closely with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland to ensure the best possible service to patients now and in the future.</P>

      <P>I am aware of public concern regarding the possible adverse health effects of electro-magnetic radiation emanating from overhead power lines.  A considerable volume of research has been carried out internationally by various scientific and health authorities including the World Health Organisation. All significant research in this area is monitored here by the Department of Enterprise and Employment with whom my Department maintains liaison in relation to the human health aspects.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has pointed out that power line voltages and concentrations of power lines in Ireland are well below those in most industrialised countries.  In 1988 and 1992 that Department published major reports on the issue, covering the latest research developments and the assessments of this research by recognised international health advisory organisations.  The general body of evidence to date has not established an association between this form of radiation and ill-health. Research and studies in this area are ongoing and my Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment keep in touch regarding any significant developments.</P>

      <P>The home help service is operated as a &ldquo;good neighbour&rdquo; scheme and it is, therefore, not health board policy to pay relatives to undertake these duties.

      <P>Under EU Regulation 1408/71, persons taking up permanent residence in Ireland who are in receipt of a social security pension from another EU member state, who are not in receipt of an Irish Department of Social Welfare pension (as either a recipient or dependant), and are not employed or self-employed here are entitled to a medical card irrespective of means.  Otherwise, they are entitled to health services on the same basis as persons normally resident here, i.e., on means.</P>
      <P>In this regard as the person concerned is in receipt of a pension from the Department of Social Welfare and is therefore covered by the Irish social welfare system her entitlement to a medical card is based on means.  Any applicant who is not eligible for a medical card under EU regulations may apply for a medical card under Irish legislation.  Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.</P>
      <P>In addition these guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>

      <P>Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, is the national referral centre for paediatric heart disease. I am aware there has been concern over the waiting times for children in this speciality.  Paediatric cardiac surgery and cardiology services have been the subject of ongoing discussions between my Department and Our Lady's Hospital and the <Col N="281" /> Deputy may be aware that a sum of £500,000 has been committed from the waiting list initiative to address some of the pressures on these services.</P>
      <P>My Department recently asked the hospital to put forward proposals for the spending of this additional funding so that the problem of waiting times can be addressed in the most appropriate and effective manner.  These proposals have now been received and examined and are due to be discussed in detail with the hospital in the coming days.</P>

      <P>It has been agreed in principle that the Children's Hospital, Temple Street will be relocated on the campus of the Mater Hospital.  It has also been accepted that future developments at the Mater Hospital would <Col N="282" /> take into account the relocation of the Children's Hospital.  However, it is not possible to say, at this time when the move will take place.</P>
      <P>Pending relocation to the Mater Hospital site, a programme of improvements is ongoing at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street.  In the interim, it is intended that the hospital will be provided with adequate facilities to enable it to perform its important functions in the delivery of paediatric hospital care.</P>
      <P>In relation to the appointment of a paediatric surgeon, Comhairle na nOspidéal is currently facilitating a process involving the three paediatric hospitals, which is designed to deal with the question of the filling of this post as well as the broader issue of how best to structure existing surgery sessions across the hospitals.  The management of the three hospitals have now agreed to produce a joint analysis of these two issues and any further decisions on the matter will await the result of their work.</P>
      <P>The question of hospital security was addressed by a working group which was established in 1996 with a view to examining this issue.  The group, which comprised public representatives, members of the Departments of Health and Justice, the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and Temple Street Hospital made recommendations covering the spectrum of security issues.  These recommendations are currently being considered within my Department in the context of the hospital's overall priorities.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have been in discussion with the hospital's management for some time on the need to upgrade the hospital's casualty department and the development of a new 20 bedded day ward.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy, that as a result of these discussions, my Department has recently written to the hospital management to convey approval to the establishment of a project team to prepare a design brief for the development.  The estimated costs of the development are in the region of £2 million.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this development will greatly enhance the quality of service provided by the hospital to the children in its catchment area and will improve the working conditions for the hospital's dedicated staff.</P>

The brief for the second phase of the development includes provision for:</P>

      <P>&ndash; physiotherapy and occupational therapy facilities</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officers of the appropriate health board.  Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unble to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been agreed with the chief executive officers to enable persons who have been unemployed for at least one year to retain their medical cards for three years after entering employment.  These arrangements also cover participants on the schemes applicable to the long-term unemployed.  The intention of the measure is to facilitate the return to employment of those on the live register who previously would have been reluctant to do so, on the basis that they could lose their medical card entitlement and therefore could end up being worse off having taken up employment.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board concerning the case raised by the Deputy and have been informed that as the person in question had not been continuously unemployed for one year prior to taking up employment, the above arrangements would not apply. As the applicant's income is over the standard income guidelines used to assist determine eligibility, the health board has requested details of the person's medical expenses in order to consider the application on medical grounds.</P>
      <P>Given the statutory function of the chief executive officers of the health boards in determining medical card eligibility, and as the eligibility of persons taking up employment may change, it is appropriate that the eligibility of such persons be reviewed whenever this arises.</P>
      <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must of course receive one and I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special medical need when the circumstances warrant it.  I am also satisfied that the arrangements outlined above address the perceived disincentive which previously could have prevented the long-term unemployed from taking up employment.</P>

      <P>The Government has set out its commitment to develop services for persons with a mental handicap in <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium.</i> A key priority will include substantially improving services for persons with a mental handicap and autism especially in relation to the provision of adequate residential facilities over the period of the Government.</P>
      <P>The sum of £3.24 million revenue has been provided in 1997 to the Eastern Health Board for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap.  This funding will enable the health board to provide additional day care and residential/respite places, to improve services for persons with autism and to continue the ongoing programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate placements, including psychiatric hospitals, to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>Details of the precise services to be put in place with this funding is a matter for the central planning committee, which includes representatives of the voluntary bodies providing mental handicap services in the region.</P>
      <P>There are 54 persons with a mental handicap on the priority waiting list for residential services in the Daughters of Charity Services, St. Vincent's Centre, Navan Road.  The sum of £165,000 is being allocated this year to the Daughters of Charity Services in the Eastern Health Board region for the provision of additional day care and residential places.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 187, 188 and 200 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which came into effect on 1 September 1993 introduced <Col N="288" /> a new system of nursing home subventions so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The scheme is not intended to meet the full cost of nursing home care for those who qualify for subvention. The total annual cost of the subvention scheme currently stands at just over £17 million.  I am aware there are certain difficulties being encountered by some providers and persons seeking nursing home care.  <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> contains a commitment to increase subvention rates for private nursing home care.  I am having the position examined by my Department with a view to fulfilling the commitment in the Government's tenure of office.</P>

      <P>The national alcohol policy was launched in September 1996.  It is directed at reducing the prevalence of alcohol related problems through an emphasis on moderation in alcohol consumption.  Because alcohol problems are multidimensional the policy sets out multisectoral solutions requiring both environmental and individual strategies.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the policy, a number of elements of the action plan have been put in place.  The most significant of these are: the national alcohol surveillance centre has been established; tenders for a national lifestyle survey have been received and assessed and the contract will be awarded shortly; tenders for a new advertising campaign which will emphasise the message of moderation in drinking have been assessed, and the contract will be awarded shortly.  The campaign will run in the autumn.  Work is ongoing on a number of the longer term elements of the action plan, including developing the school curriculum to include a significant level of health as part of the curriculum, based on a life-skills approach, development of policies in relation to health promoting schools, hospitals, workplaces and campuses which would include policies in relation to alcohol use; discussions with the drinks industry on their response to the policy, with particular reference to the problems of under-age drinking and the consumption of &lsquo;alcopops&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>For the remainder of 1997, it is intended to continue with the elements of the plan already commenced, and to make progress in relation to initiatives involving other Departments.  Co-operation with industry groups will continue with a view to encouraging the industry to play its part in encouraging moderation in alcohol consumption. In addition, actions taken on the basis of the plan will be evaluated on an ongoing basis, so that the policy can be focused and effective.</P>

      <P>Since 1965 an arrangement has been in place whereby the Air Corps provides air ambulance transport to health boards for emergency cases.  This service is generally provided in emergencies requiring the removal of badly injured or very ill persons over long distances, particularly where they cannot be safely conveyed by road ambulance.  The service is also provided for the removal from the islands of persons requiring urgent hospital attention when weather conditions are such as to make boat transport impossible or hazardous to the patient.  Since August 1991, the marine search and rescue helicopter service of the Department of the Marine, which operates from Shannon Airport, is also available for air ambulance transport in cases of emergency.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the role which a dedicated air ambulance service could play in enhancing the effectiveness of the ambulance service.  This matter was examined by the review group on the ambulance service and, on foot of their recommendations, a standing committee on air ambulance services was established under the aegis of my Department and the Department of Defence. I understand that the standing committee will be submitting a report to me shortly and I feel that any developments in this area should await the recommendations of the standing committee.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 194 together.</P>
      <P>I will soon allocate the sum of £8 million, previously set aside for addressing waiting lists in 1997, to the health boards and selected voluntary hospitals.  I have no plans to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for waiting lists.  The allocation of £8 million for 1997 will be based on the following principles: the money will be directed towards a small number of selected specialties to achieve the maximum benefit; there will be an increased focus on waiting times &mdash; how long patients have to wait for treatment rather than primarily on waiting lists &mdash; the actual number of people on a list during any one period; the ultimate aim will be to eliminate waiting times of longer than 12 months for adults and six months for children in target specialties; the criteria for allocating waiting list money to individual hospitals will include: the extent of spare capacity in each hospital to carry out waiting list work; whether the hospitals with the longest lists have the spare capacity; the price quoted by hospitals for targeted procedures and their relative efficiency in the targeted specialties; and the track record of individual hospitals from previous years in delivering the reductions agreed upon.  My Department will continue to stress to agencies the importance of validating waiting lists so that we have an accurate picture of the situation at all times.</P>
      <P>Based on these principles I will shortly be making the full £8 million available to the health boards and hospitals concerned.  In doing so, my Department will discuss with each agency the number of interventions that can be performed with the money available and the target reduction in waiting lists and waiting times that can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I understand the decision of the BTSB not to admit liability for punitive, exemplary or aggravated damages in this case was also based on legal advice.</P>

      <P>I understand that settlement talks continued between the legal team for the plaintiff and the legal team for the BTSB.  After assuming office as Minister for Health, I was informed on 27 June 1997 that settlement talks were still ongoing.  I did not organise or co-ordinate the legal strategy on behalf of the different defendants in this case.</P>
      <P>On Monday 30 June 1997, I authorised State Counsel to settle the case in so far as the State was concerned.  As part of the settlement, I authorised that State Counsel should express regret to the plaintiff in court on behalf of the State.  I understand that a request by the plaintiff for such an expression of regret was not acceded to by my predecessor as Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>As to the other two defendants in the case, I understand that Mr. Liam Dunbar, chief executive officer of the BTSB, authorised the terms of the settlement on behalf of the BTSB.

      <P>In the light of the Government's concern to ensure the highest standards of food safety and quality, <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> proposes the estabishment of a statutory, independent science based food safety and quality authority.  Discussions are already under way between officials from my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to give effect to this commitment and I will make a statement on the matter once these discussions have been concluded. In the meantime I am reviewing, as a matter of priority, the position on the preparation of the legislation providing for the establishment of the authority.</P>

      <P>My Department together with the Department of Finance have been involved in extensive discussions regarding the matter of agreeing &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; Estimates for the health services for the years 1998 to 2000.  The Deputy will understand that the principal of a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; Estimate, while accepted as necessary for Government as a basis for determining future public expenditure parameters, is a difficult concept to implement in respect of the ongoing provision of <Col N="294" /> the health services.  The cost of delivering health services changes from year to year as a result of demographic factors, improvements in technology, drug therapies and other advances in the delivery of services.</P>
      <P>The issue of determining the effect of such developments on the delivery and cost of the health services in the context of the &ldquo;no policy changes&rdquo; Estimate has received sympathetic consideration from the Department of Finance. However final decisions regarding the level of funding will be taken within the context of the Government programme <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium.</i> To date significant progress has been made on establishing a &ldquo;no policy change&rdquo; Estimate, however no agreement has been reached by Government on a precise figure. I am confident that the Government will agree an appropriate estimate for the health services which will secure the continued provision of the existing level of services.</P>

My Department <Col N="295" /> does not have all the details of proposed bed closures in hospitals during the summer months but from the available information there is no indication that these closures will be greater than in previous years.  Bed closures are usually planned to coincide with periods when staff are on annual leave and to take advantage of a fall-off in demands during the holidays.  As in previous years, such periods provide an opportunity to refurbish wards or to carry out minor capital improvements.  For those reasons, summer bed closures have commenced and will continue during the holiday season.</P>

This process will complement initiatives identified in <i>Delivering a Better Government</i> where a programme of expenditure reviews in my Department is to be carried out over a three year period beginning in 1997.  I have not yet had an opportunity of considering the detailed arrangements for the conduct of the audits.</P>
      <P>The Department's strategy document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> published in 1994 and reinforced by the recent strategy statement also highights the need to evaluate economy, efficiency, and increasing effectiveness in the provision of a quality health service.

Structures are being put in place shortly to ensure that a more efficient materials management programme is delivered.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the enhanced role of the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General under legislation passed in 1993.  The Comptroller and Auditor General now has a role in auditing health boards and he also has a value for money remit.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 207 and 211 together.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services.  New regulations, the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations, 1996, which gave effect to the provisions of Part VII, came into operation in December 1996.  These regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, cre ches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  The purpose of the regulations is to secure the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children and to promote the development of children attending pre-school services.</P>
      <P>The preparatory work on the regulations and accompanying explanatory guide was carried out during 1996 by a working group chaired by my Department and representative of the Department of Education, the health boards, the Social Services Inspectorate in Northern Ireland and a number of voluntary organisations involved in pre-school provision.</P>
      <P>The new regulations apply to various sectors involved in pre-school provision, ranging from voluntary services for disadvantaged children through to full day care in the commercial sector. The health boards provide financial support to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged. This function is in keeping with the boards' overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children at risk and provision of family support services.  The policy of supporting certain pre-school services will continue in the future and may include financial assistance to upgrade premises associated with such services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that in order to develop a strategy which integrates the different strands of the current arrangements for the development and delivery of childcare and early educational services, there is a commitment under Partnership <Col N="297" /> 2000 to establish an expert working group involving the relevant interests.  This group will be chaired by the Department of Equality and Law Reform and will devise a national framework for the development of the childcare sector. The inaugural meeting of the expert working group is due to take place in Dublin Castle on 18 July 1997.  The financing of childcare provision by a variety of means in the interests of affordable and accessible childcare is part of the remit of the expert working group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year my Department collected information from each of the health boards in regard to social admissions to hospitals for the month of January 1997.  Eleven children taken into emergency care were placed in hospitals during that period.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board placed nine children in hospital as follows: one child was placed in Harcourt Street Hospital; two children were placed in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin; one child was placed in The Meath Hospital; five children were placed in Temple Street Hospital.</P>
      <P>The reasons for placement varied.  Seven of the children were under 12 years of age.  Four of the children, including the two children over 12 years of age, had complex medical histories requiring medical attention initially and four children from one family were placed in hospital by gardaí following the arrest of their mother.  The length of stay varied from five days to four weeks.  In those cases involving the longer stays, medical needs had led to the admission and medical treatment was required.</P>
      <P>The South Eastern Health Board placed two children aged eight and four in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny for one night as an interim measure pending their placement in suitable accommodation.</P>
      <P>In addition, a recent study conducted by a social worker in Temple Street Children's Hospital indicated that from June 1995 to May 1997, 135 children were admitted or remained in hospital for family or social reasons other than medical intervention: the number of days in hospital for this group exceeded 3,000.  A high percentage of children were admitted in an emergency situation and remained for less than one week but 20 children remained for more than 30 days and 6 children remained for more than 100 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="298" /> When children, particularly small children, are placed in the care of a health board it is sometimes appropriate to refer them to hospital for assessment and/or treatment.  When this assessment is completed, it is not always possible to find an immediate suitable placement for the children.</P>
    <P>I do not favour the use of hospital accommodation in inappropriate circumstances and the Eastern Health Board is taking all possible steps to provide suitable alternative accommodation in such cases.  In particular, the board plans to provide a residential unit for children under 12 years of age who need emergency placement out of hours.  The board is also recruiting additional foster parents exclusively for use by the out of hours service in and emergency at night and priority for these placements will be given to children under 12 years of age.</P>

      <P>The acute hospital service in Dublin has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period in the past number of years.  The cause of the problem is complex and the successful management of the accident and emergency difficulties involves tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled, and services provided by the acute hospitals which, when taken together, provide a comprehensive and integrated response.</P>
      <P>In this regard, a series of measures have been put in place since 1995 to deal with the continuing demands being placed on the accident and emergency services in Dublin.  These measures include the provision of additional staff and equipment in accident and emergency departments, additional convalescent beds for non-acute patients, and the development of GP services.  The present position is that each accident and emergency hospital and the Eastern Health Board has been asked by my Department to put forward proposals to improve the service for the coming winter 1997-8.  When these proposals are to hand, I will review the position in association with the Eastern Health Board which chairs a steering committee responsible for the co-ordination of the accident and emergency services in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The administration of the registration system is a matter for the Registrar-General of Births and Deaths and Marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar-General that there is no time frame specified in the question and there are several interpretations to this question ranging from false information in respect of a non-marital child, to a simple error in the given name of a child, corrected locally by a registrar on production of a baptismal certificate or form certifying name given not in baptism.</P>
      <P>In neither case would it be possible to answer the question, as in the former case no one would be aware of the inaccuracy except in exceptional circumstances, where the child or the qualified informant contacted the Registrar-General.  In the latter case these errors are not uncommon but could only be quantified by the physical examination of all registers in each of the 330 registration districts, which would be an impossible task.  I take it that the Deputy is referring to amendments to birth entries other than the registration of births under the Status of Children Act, 1987 and the Legitimacy Act, 1931.  The position is that the most frequent amendment to a birth entry is the correction of a forename on production of a baptismal certificate or a form certifying name given not in baptism.  As such amendments may be made locally by registrars in any of the 330 registration districts throughout the country in accordance with regulations and on production of the evidence referred to above, the specific authority of the Registrar-General is not required and no statistics of such amendments are maintained centrally.</P>

There is some doubt as to whether the terms of the convention apply to the release of birth information to adoptive adults.  It is expected that this issue will be clarified by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child.  The First National Report of Ireland under the Convention is due to be heard by the committee in Geneva in early 1998.</P>

    <P>*Rates of pay presently under review.</P>
    <P>The issue of payment for part-time home helps has been raised on a number of occasions in the recent past.  As the Deputy will be aware, the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  The rates are determined by the particular requirements and the type of task undertaken in individual cases.  It is a matter for each health board to decide on the level of home help services required and the level of payment to be made in respect of these services.  The chief executive officer of each board is in the best position to decide on these issues as my Department has no involvement in the day to day management of the service.  However, I would like to point out to the Deputy that my Department has allocated additional funding to three of the health boards this year for the purpose of increasing the rates of payment to home helps.  It is my intention to make further progress in this regard when resources permit.</P>

      <P>Draft regulations to provide for the application <Col N="304" /> of the Second Directive on driving licences, including the introduction of a theoretical test, are at present the subject of consultation with the EU Commission.  The proposed theoretical test will be introduced as a condition for the grant of first time provisional licences in respect of each of the main categories of driving licences.  It will be based on a bank of questions, which I will publish, and it will be administered by local authorities. The questions have been developed in consultation with the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Difficulties and the National Adult Literacy Agency.  In administering the new test, local authorities will respond to any special needs of applicants.</P>
      <P>Subject to the completion of the consultation process with the EU Commission, I propose to introduce the new test by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>Where a licensing authority makes a determination to grant new taxi licences or wheelchair accessable taxi licences, the assessment of the applications received is a matter for that authority and I have no direct function in relation to that assessment.  Where a determination is made and the number of applications received exceeds the number of licences which the licensing authority has decided to issue, the applications must be considered under the Sixth Schedule of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995, as amended by the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1997.  Subject to certain exceptions, points are awarded by licensing authorities to holders of hackney licences whose addresses are in the taximeter area in question or who can satisfy the licensing authority that they provided a hackney service in the taximeter area. Points are allocated for each full year in respect of which the licence was held.</P>
      <P>The renewal of a hackney licence is a matter for the licence holder, who has a period of six months, following the date of expiry of the licence, to renew it.</P>

      <P>Operation Freeflow covers the general metropolitan area of Dublin with particular emphasis on the key arterial routes into the city and the urban villages.  The overall operation is being co-ordinated by the Dublin Transportation Office which is also providing a specific financial input through the allocation of funds from the traffic management grants available across the local authorities areas covered by the DTI strategy.  Of the total of £7.572 million available under that scheme in 1997, the following grant projects are of specific relevance to Operation Freeflow:</P>
      <P>£2.234 million for quality bus corridors £508,000 for Dublin Corporation's CCTU system</P>
      <P>£100,000 for the SCATS traffic signal control system</P>
      <P>£240,000 to extend the variable passage system</P>
      <P>£250,000 for improvement measures on key routes.</P>
      <P>Financial and other resources are being imputed by the other organisations involved in the operation, in particular the local authorities and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The second phase of this initiative, which commenced last March, emphasises not just the ongoing need to improve the management of traffic and parking in the city and the urban villages, but also the need to critically analyse the key routes serving the overall area.</P>
      <P>The DTO has prepared an interim report on the progress of the second phase of the operation to date.  This report will form the basis for a review of the operation and the identification of areas which require a new or enhanced emphasis.</P>

      <P>Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain disabled people under that age.</P>
      <P>Entitlement is not contingent on the person's means.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July, the free schemes of electricity allowance, telephone rental allowance and colour television licence were extended to low income pensioners who did not previously qualify because they were not in receipt of a social welfare pension. The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension &mdash; currently £78 per week &mdash; plus any increases for dependants, plus £30. About 9,000 people benefited from this measure. Figures are not available regarding the number of former State or semi-State employees who retired <Col N="315" /> early due to illness.  This group would not, at any rate, be eligible for the free schemes on age grounds or, because of PRSI conditions, might not be entitled to a qualifying payment such as invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the fee schemes to include all widows and widowers would involve costs of about £30 million and this would have to be examined in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>There is no specific scheme in operation to cover the maintenance cost of a Phonewatch or similar system.</P>
      <P>Older people living alone who are in receipt of free telephone rental allowance are being indirectly assisted towards the running costs of a Phonewatch system, in so far as possession of a telephone is an essential part of the operation of these systems.  The FTRA scheme covers the rental costs on the telephone and thus makes it easier for the older person concerned to afford to install a Phonewatch system.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Department also operates a scheme of community support for older people under which funding is available through local voluntary and community organisations for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting; and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>Vulnerable older people living alone or in households made up exclusively of older people, or of older and other people who are dependent and vulnerable and who are unable to install or purchase the equipment concerned themselves, are eligible for assistance under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 253, 254, 264 and 268 together.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia,</i> have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people, including farmers, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject, of course, to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.</P>
      <P>However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's Social Welfare Act provision was made that self-employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were <Col N="317" /> already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee, would now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided that they do not quailfy for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>In 1989 it was estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988, would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance this was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  A review of these figures indicated that the estimated cost is now £500 million, based on numbers of some 20,000 people qualifying.</P>
    <P>These costings are currently being reviewed in greater detail in the context of the actuarial review of social welfare pensions being carried out by consultants for my Department.  Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive. The cost of providing partial pensions would also be very high.  A breakdown of the cost for those with seven to nine-and-a-half years' contributions is not readily available.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  Any person resident in the State can, of course, qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>In relation to a self-employed person who is unable to work for medical reasons, it is possible to claim a disability allowance from my Department which is payable subject to a means test.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies have particular cases in mind they may wish to give me the details so that they can be investigated to ensure that the people concerned are in receipt of their full entitlements.</P>

      <P>
        <Col N="318" /> From 6 April 1994, time spent working full-time in the home rearing young children up to six years of age or caring for an incapacitated person may be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the yearly average condition in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded for this purpose.  A person is also allowed to engage in part-time work outside the home and earn up to £30 a week and still benefit from this scheme.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for an increase in the age of children being cared for under this scheme from six to 12 years.  This improvement is effective from the contribution year 1995-96 onwards.  A provision allowing for the award of credited contributions in the year in which a person commences or ceases to be a homemaker is also included in the legislation governing the scheme.  These improvements will make it easier for married women minding their children and other homemakers to qualify for the award of an old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Improvements to the scheme have also been introduced with the aim of making it easier for homemakers to qualify for old age contributory pension.  All carers may be eligible, not just those in receipt of a carer's allowance.  A person receiving carer's allowance and-or child benefit may be awarded credits or a disregard for the period of caring.  However, if a person is not in receipt of a carer's allowance or child benefit then she-he may still qualify for disregard for the &ldquo;homemaking years&rdquo;.  She-he may also receive homemaker's credits in the year she-he commenced and the year she-he ceased homemaking.</P>
      <P>Any person who leaves the workforce on or after 6 April 1994 to care for a child or an incapacitated person may have these factors taken into account when the yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension is being calculated.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is a universal payment which is payable in respect of all children up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19, who are in full-time education or who have a disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the special difficulties faced by parents in the more exceptional circumstances of the birth of triplets, quadruplets, etc., child benefit is payable at double the normal monthly rate for each such child, so long as at least three of the children remain qualified.  In addition, a grant of £300 is payable on the birth of triplets, <Col N="319" /> while a grant of £400 is payable on the birth of quadruplets or more.</P>
    <P>While the birth of twins is a much more common occurrence than the birth of triplets, etc., the particular problems associated with rearing twins have, nevertheless, been acknowledged under the child benefit scheme.  A grant of £500 is provided for on the birth of twins and an additional grant of £500 is payable when the twins reach the age of four years and again at 12 years.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is currently payable in respect of an estimated 11,500 sets of twins.  Based on the increased payment rates due to take effect from September this year, the additional annual cost of paying child benefit at double rate in respect of twins is estimated to be in the region of £9.16 million.  The additional cost of paying one and a half times the rate of child benefit in respect of twins is estimated at £4.58 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>Given the substantial costs associated with paying increased rates of child benefit in respect of twins, any proposals along these lines would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of the other priorities and commitments contained in the new Programme for Government, An Action Programme for the Millennium, and in Partnership 2000.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide a financial incentive to long-term unemployed people who would not otherwise do so to return to the active labour force.

It is, therefore, a requirement of the scheme that an applicant must apply for the allowance prior to taking up employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned took up employment on 24 February 1997 but did not apply for the allowance until 19 May 1997.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of years the Conference of Religious of Ireland &mdash; CORI &mdash; has put forward a number of different proposals for the introduction of a basic income system in Ireland.  Essentially, a basic income system would involve a payment, made by the State, to all citizens, regardless of other income, family circumstances or labour force status.</P>
      <P>The idea of basic income is not a new one; many such schemes have been discussed in the past in both academic and political circles. However, the evidence to date for Ireland has suggested that the tax rates needed to fund such a scheme would make it extremely expensive. Various forms of basic income, including the CORI proposals, were examined by the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems which reported last year. The expert group rejected the idea of introducing a basic income scheme because the high tax rates needed to fund it would be likely to have a negative impact on employment.</P>
      <P>The most recent study on this topic published by CORI, entitled &ldquo;Pathways to Basic Income&rdquo; presents a detailed implementation plan for a basic income scheme.  This new study states that, as a result of the growth in the economy in recent years and the fact that this growth is projected to continue for the next number of years, the tax rates needed to fund a basic income scheme now appear to be considerably lower than previous studies have indicated.</P>
      <P>The current national programme, Partnership 2000, contains a commitment to carry out a further independent appraisal of the concept of, and full implications of, introducing a basic income payment taking account of the work of the ERSI, CORI and the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare as well as international research.  A preliminary steering group for this project has been set up under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach and is due to meet later this month.  My Department will be represented on this steering group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of issues need to be examined before any definite decision is taken on basic income.  First, the question of the tax rate needed to fund BI needs to be re-examined in the light of the CORI findings.  Second, the implications for some people on low incomes would need to be examined carefully as other research has indicated that here are people on low incomes who could lose out under basic income.  The effects of basic income on work incentives and its migration effects also need further study.  My Department <Col N="322" /> will be seeking to have all these issues examined in the context of the study referred to above.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to produce a Green Paper on the issue of basic income within two years.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme was introduced in October 1988.  The most recent rate increase was given in October 1995 when the allowance was increased from £4 to £5 per week.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas. This was later extended to Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to make the allowance applicable for the full 12 months of the year.  The scheme runs for six months of the year, from mid-October to mid-April, in recognition of the fact that it can be unpredictably cold in autumn and spring, even though there will also be periods when the allowance will be paid even though temperatures are above the seasonal norm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme is not temperature related and there may be a small number of occasions when the allowance is not paid even though temperatures are unseasonably cold.  However, as the scheme extends over six months of the year this is likely to be the exception rather than the rule. There is a facility available through the supplementary <Col N="324" /> welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under that scheme a person who may have exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating allowance.  An application for a heating allowance may be made by contacting a community welfare officer at a local health centre.</P>
    <P>Any extension to the rate of the fuel allowance or to the duration of the national fuel scheme would have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.  It is estimated that to extend the scheme from six to 12 months would cost £42 million.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy relates to the position of those workers who return to the live register after their period of community employment finishes and who, by virtue of having paid Class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of Class A PRSI to community employment workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension and treatment (dental and optical) benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other Class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or requalify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or Jobstart, etc.  As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, <Col N="325" /> medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to introduce concessionary arrangements for former CE workers at this stage, but I will keep this matter under review.</P>

      <P>The recommendations referred to by the Deputy are contained in the report of the Ombudsman in relation to three separate complaints which were made against the refusal by the Department to pay full arrears of pension to the complainants who, for varying reasons, were late in making their claims.</P>
      <P>Full backdating has been allowed and all arrears due on that basis have been paid in two cases.  In these cases, the persons concerned did not claim old age contributory pension in time but they were in receipt of other pensions from the Department.  In paying full arrears in these cases, the Department is treating the other pension claims as claims for old age contributory pension and will apply this principle in similar cases in future.</P>
      <P>In the third case, the late claim was allegedly due to incorrect advice being given by the Department.  The Ombudsman concluded on the balance of probabilities that the person concerned called to the Department on two occasions, that he was inadequately advised as to his pension entitlements and that his failure to claim pension at those times was partly due to this failure to adequately advise him.  The Ombudsman recommended payment of arrears from April 1986 in this case plus compensation for the delay in making this payment.  Arrears on this basis have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the Department's specific responses in these three cases, provision has been made in this year's Social Welfare Act for more general improvements in this area, including the maximum period for which arrears of old age (contributory) pension, retirement pension, contributory widow's and widower's pension and contributory orphan's allowance can be paid has been doubled from six months to 12 months.  This new provision applies to claims made on or after 1 January 1997; payment of arrears of up to six months are now being provided for in the case of late claims for family income supplement.  Under the former arrangements, there was no provision for the payment of arrears of FIS and power to <Col N="326" /> further extend the period for which arrears may be paid subject to such conditions and in such circumstances as may be prescribed.  Regulations for this purpose will be made later this year.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recommendations relating to the three specific cases, the Ombudsman made five general recommendations; the Department is responding to the first three as follows: the information services will continue to be developed with a view to maximising the public's awareness of the scope and application of entitlements and, in particular, the requirement to make claims in time and the effects on entitlements of not so doing; arrangements have been in place for some time now requesting claimants who submit late claims to indicate the reason the claims are late and the notification of potential contributory old age pensioners of a possible entitlement in advance of pension age has been identified as an important objective and is being pursued in the context of the redevelopment of the Department's pensions computer system.</P>
    <P>In relation to the fourth general recommmendation concerning the use of the existing extrastatutory discretion to pay arrears of pension, this is being exercised in cases where the Department is at fault, where hardship would otherwise arise and where the late claim is caused by mental or physical incapacity of the claimant.</P>
    <P>The fifth recommendation concerns the principle of proportionality in the application of provisions affecting late claims.  This will be considered, along with other issues raised in the Ombudsman's fourth general recommendations, when the regulations are made to further extend the period for which arrears may be paid.  These regulations are being drafted at present.</P>
    <P>The payment of full pension arrears in all claims to contributory pensions would give rise to significant additional costs.  The extent to which further progress is possible at this time will be covered in the regulations mentioned which will specify the circumstances in which further arrears will be paid and the conditions which will apply.</P>

      <P>Prior to the review of his insurance record, the person concerned had failed to qualify for old age contributory pension as his yearly average of 18 contributions was too low &mdash; a minimum of 20 contributions is required to qualify.</P>
      <P>A full review of his insurance record commenced in March 1996.  This entailed interviews with the person concerned with regard to his employment since 1953 and a thorough investigation, where available, of the employment records of his former employers.  This review was completed recently.  The investigation concluded that his original PRSI record was correct and that there are no additional contributions due.  Consequently, the decision not to award a standard rate old age contributory pension still stands.</P>
      <P>However, the person concerned will qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension under new legislation which comes into effect from 21 November 1997.  Based on his yearly average contribution of 18, he will be entitled then to a pension of £58.50 per week.  A pension book for this amount will be issued to his local post office in good time for payment by 21 November 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was refused a one-parent family payment because she and her family are being adequately maintained by her spouse.  The regulations specify that a person can only be considered as separated for allowance purposes if she and her child(ren) are being maintained at a rate per week which is less than the maximum rate of one-parent family payment appropriate to her family size.  The same rules applied under the former lone parent's allowance.  For adequate maintenance purposes both spousal and child maintenance receipts are taken into account.  In the case of the person concerned, the relevant adequate maintenance threshold is £143.50 per week, but she and her children are receiving weekly maintenance significantly in excess of this amount.</P>
      <P>However, any housing costs incurred by a claimant through regular payment of mortgage or rent can be deducted from the maintenance received in order to determine whether the family is being adequately maintained.  In the case of the person concerned, the information available to my Department is that she has a mortgage but there is no evidence of any regular repayments by her.  If she is actually making repayments under this mortgage she should notify the Department immediately and her claim will be reviewed on that basis.</P>

      <P>Persons arriving in this country as refugees have generally been invited here as part of a programme on foot of Government decisions.  Questions regarding those programme refugees are a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>As regards those who arrive in the State and seek asylum, the arrangements are briefly as follows: application may be made to an immigration officer by a person arriving at a port of entry, or directly to the Department if the person is within the country; an in-depth interview is arranged whereby the applicant, with the aid of an interpreter, where necessary, can give my Department full details relevant to the application.  Written material may also be submitted in support of an application; my Department may consult with UNHCR in any case, and does so in each case where it is proposed to refuse an application; the Minister makes a decision in each case in accordance with the 1951 Convention and 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees; where a decision not to grant refugee status is made, the applicant is informed of the right to appeal the decision to an interim appeals authority and a person is not removed from the State until there has been an opportunity to present a full case and a final decision has been reached on it.</P>
      <P>Since 25 June 1997, a modification of these arrangements is in place in relation to persons travelling from Great Britain and Northern Ireland who seek asylum on arrival in Ireland.  By agreement with the authorities there, such persons may be returned, following a decision in each case by an officer of my Department, and their applications dealt with there.  In each such case, the United Kingdom authorities and the UNHCR are notified.</P>
      <P>The rising number of asylum applications is a source of concern to me, in particular as regards the impact on State services dealing with welfare, housing, healthcare and so forth.  I am reviewing the entire situation, in conjunction with my Cabinet colleagues with responsibilities in these areas, with a view to taking whatever measures are required to deal quickly and fairly with asylum applicants.</P>

      <Quest>if the proposed remand prison at Cloverhill has provision for triple occupancy cells; and if such a retrograde step will be reviewed in favour of the more humane single occupancy cell.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new prison which is currently under construction at Cloverhill has been designed to accommodate 400 remand prisoners. The regime applicable to remands differs significantly from that of the sentenced prisoner population and this had to be taken into account in the design of all aspects of the institution, including the cell accommodation.  I can confirm that the accommodation will consist, in the main, of cells designed to accommodate up to three prisoners, as well as a certain proportion of single cell accommodation.  The mix of accommodation to <Col N="338" /> be provided has been decided with the particular characteristics of remand prisioners in mind. These factors include such matters as the average period spent in custody and other special needs and requirements.  On average, remand prisoners spend less than two weeks in custody and in most cases the period is much less than this, often not more than 48 hours.  The provision of single cell accommodation in every case and on such a short-term basis could not be justfied either in terms of the proper management of the institution or cost effectiveness.  In cases, however, where indivduals are remanded for longer periods, ample single cell accommodation will be provided.</P>
      <P>Regarding humane considerations, I am sure that the Deputy is aware of the fact that prisoners remanded by the courts, especially those imprisoned for the first time, are often in a somewhat distressed condition either mentally and-or physically on arrival at the prison.  In the circumstances, the risk of self-mutilation or attempted suicides must be borne in mind.  Experience has shown that shared accommodation is often the preferred option in such cases.  Furthermore, where more than one prisoner is being accommodated in a cell, it is preferable, in many cases, that prisoners be confined three to a cell rather than two or four to a cell.  I do not accept that this arrangement is in any way a retrograde step.  It is, indeed, in line with international modern penal thinking and is being introduced here now in Cloverhill following consultation with prison governors and other practitioners in this country.</P>

When the station is unmanned, a direct communications facility which is linked to the District Headquarters at Fermoy comes into operation.  The sub-district is, of course, also covered by mobile patrols.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the terms of the school transport scheme, my Department may only consider <Col N="343" /> special transport arrangements on medical grounds where pupils are severely medically handicapped, and their condition is such that it would prevent them from making their own way to school or to the pick-up point.</P>
      <P>Medical evidence in respect of the pupil concerned was forwarded to the medical adviser in April 1997.  On the basis of this evidence, the chief medical adviser determined that the appropriate medical conditions to provide a home pick-up do not apply in this case.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is regretted that it would not be open to my Department to extend the service on medical grounds, as requested.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Stanhope Street national school on 30 September 1996 was 442 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and fourteen assistant teachers for the 1997-8 school year.  This represents a reduction of two posts compared with the staffing levels at the school for the 1996-7 school year.</P>
      <P>However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have given provisional sanction for the retention of both posts to enable the school comply with maximum class size guidelines.  The sanction will be reviewed in September next in the light of the enrolment actually achieved at the school.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 318 and 328 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1995-6 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  The free fees initiative does not extend to students pursuing postgraduate or part-time courses.</P>
    <P>Students pursuing postgraduate courses at approved colleges can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance under the student support schemes, i.e. the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committee scholorship scheme.  In addition students pursuing courses approved under the ESF-aided advanced technical skills (ATS) programme, which must be at post-graduate level, do not pay tuition fees.</P>
    <P>The latest available figures are those in respect of the 1995-6 academic year which indicate that there were approximately 10,000 full-time post-graduate students in state funded third level institutions. On the basis of 10,000 students, it is estimated that the cost of extending the free fees initiative to students pursuing post-graduate courses would be in the region of £16 million. However, it is estimated that some 4,000 post-graduate students have their fees paid already under the ATS programme and the student support schemes.  Accordingly, the net annual additional cost of extending the free fees initiative would be £9.5 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to part-time students, the latest available figures are those in respect of the 1994-5 academic year when there were some 22,000 part-time students at third level.  Data are not readily available in relation to fee levels.  However, using an average estimated fee of £1,200 for 22,000 students the cost of extending the free fee initiative to part-time students would be in the region of £26 million.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the overall position in relation to eligibility for free fees.  However, any decision in this regard would have to have regard to the availability of resources and other competing needs in the education sector.</P>
    <P>I would point out that tax relief is available, at the standard rate, under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1996, for tuition fees paid by eligible students who are attending approved part-time third level courses.</P>
    <P>I have no details in relation to the proportion of part-time students who are aged 23 years and over.  Although the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education indicated that in 1992-3, the model age range for part-time students was between 23 and 26 years.  The report also indicated that almost 90 per cent of part-time students were in employment.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-8 school year and included the allocation of 26 resource teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.</P>

      <P>I would like to reassure the Deputy that the Breaking the Cycle guidelines are not being watered down in respect of the school in question.  Neither is the integration of traveller children being stopped on the instructions of my Department.</P>
      <P>A key element in the support package for urban schools under the Breaking the Cycle initiative was the allocation of additional teaching posts to facilitate an average maximum class size of 15:1 in all junior classes.  The number of posts allocated to individual schools, including the school in question, at the commencement of the scheme in 1996, was based on data supplied by the schools on the number of pupils enroled in their junior classes.</P>
      <P>The position of each participating school was recently reviewed to ensure that they would remain in a position to adhere to the guidelines for the junior classes.  As part of this review and in line with normal staffing arrangements, the number of Breaking the Cycle posts allocated to each participating school for the 1997-98 school year will be based on the number of pupils enroled in junior classes at September 1996.</P>
      <P>In the case of the school in question, it emerged from the recent review that the number of pupils put forward as enroled in junior classes in 1996 included the children enroled in its three special classes for travellers and in respect of whom the school has already been allocated three special class teachers.</P>
      <P>Given that the needs of the traveller children in question are already being addressed by a separate staffing allocation, they should not also be counted as enroled in ordinary junior classes for the purposes of attracting Breaking the Cycle posts.</P>
      <P>As soon as the above situation came to light, the school was notified of the necessary adjustment to its staffing allocation for the forthcoming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> It is not considered that this necessary staffing adjustment will impede the school's capacity to pursue a policy of integration of traveller children, a process which my Department continues to encourage.</P>
    <P>In the above circumstances, I have no proposals to review present staffing arrangements at the school.</P>

      <P>The enrolment policy of national schools, at any stage throughout the school cycle, is generally a matter for the board of management of each school. However, I expect that schools will cater for their immediate catchment area in the first instance.  If, after that, places remain available, schools may enrol pupils from outside their area, should there be a demand.  Where more than one school caters for an area or parish, it is expected that these schools will liaise to ensure that all children in the area can be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Individual schools should alert my Department, in good time, where the need for additional accommodation is anticipated or where alternative arrangements need to be made to provide extra pupil places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>To date, a significant amount of progress has been made to facilitate the introduction of relationships and sexuality education &mdash; RSE &mdash; into schools.  A training and support service has been established by my Department at the Drumcondra Education Centre and a national co-ordinator and an assistant co-ordinator for RSE have been appointed. All 21,000 primary teachers have completed a three day training programme in RSE and approximately 1,700 post-primary teachers have attended special training programmes.  Curriculum guidelines were issued to all teachers in the context of the training programmes and a policy <Col N="350" /> development pack on RSE for use by schools in preparing their policy in this area has recently been issued.  Copies of an information booklet for parents on RSE have been issued to schools for dissemination to all parents throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Support for the coming school year includes the retention of the RSE training and support service, the putting in place of a freephone helpline and the provision of seminars to assist schools and parents in the development of a school policy on RSE.</P>
      <P>A representative sample of schools was chosen to pre-test certain aspects of the RSE programme and classroom materials as they were developed. I have arranged for officials of my Department to forward details of the schools involved to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Overall, there has been a favourable reaction to the introduction of RSE from both parents and teachers.  All training events were evaluated as they were delivered and this allowed for concerns or difficulties raised to be addressed as training progressed.  A number of teachers and some parents have expressed apprehension about the teaching of RSE in the classroom.  These concerns centred mainly around the relative roles and responsibilities of parents and teachers in relation to RSE and the manner in which teachers and parents, having conscientious objections to the delivery of RSE in schools, could be accommodated.</P>
      <P>Minimising the apprehension of teachers and parents in relation to RSE is crucial to the success of the initiative.  In this context, the first task for each school is the development of a school policy on RSE which will outline how Relationships and Sexuality Education is to be delivered in the school, using a co-ordinated whole-school approach and involving extensive consultation with parents.  The values inherent in the school policy should, of course, be consistent with the core values and ethos of the school and the school's programme in RSE should be developed accordingly.  The majority of schools will be initiating this process early in the new school year, with a view to introducing an RSE programme during the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently finalising a programme of Social Personal and Health Education &mdash; SPHE. Following its introduction, RSE will form one module of that programme.</P>
      <P>An extensive process of consultation at national level, involving all of the Partners in Education through their membership of a special implementation group, is an important element in the introduction of RSE to schools.  This implementation group, which includes the management authorities of Catholic primary and post-primary schools, continues to meet regularly.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the training and support programme for RSE during 1996 was £1.8 million.  It is estimated that the cost for 1997 will be of the order of £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> I am aware, that RSE materials produced by a number of commercial firms, have been circulated to schools in recent months.  I wish to confirm that these materials have not been endorsed or promoted by my Department.  Neither did my Department make the addresses of schools available to the firms in question.  Schools who wish to supplement their RSE programme with commercially produced materials should satisfy themselves that the content is appropriate to their pupils' needs and in line with school policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 340, 341, 342, 345 and 365 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Action Programme for the new Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country.  A further 23 schools are due to become one-teacher schools from 1 September 1997.</P>
      <P>Since there are no teaching posts available to me from the 1997-98 demographic dividend for allocation to these schools, I am examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's commitments to one teacher schools, and especially to the 23 schools referred to above.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Shortall that over the lifetime of this Government I will work diligently to alleviate educational disadvantage in all areas, urban or rural, in order to ensure equal access and opportunity for all pupils to achieve their educational potential.</P>

Currently, junior infants are enrolled in the local convent schools and transfer to the CBS at first standard.  Having considered the matter in detail, my Department rejected the application, particularly in view of the effect such a decision would have on the enrolment and staffing in the convent school.  The board of management of the CBS school, having obtained legal advice in the matter, subsequently wrote to my Department requesting a review of the case.  The application was reconsidered but the Department remained of the view that it should be rejected.  The chairperson of the board of management of CBS was informed of the decision by letter dated 3 June 1997.</P>

      <P>In February 1994, former Minister Niamh Bhreathnach commissioned an indepedent agency, the Service Industries Research Centre of UCD under Dr. Michael Bannon, to assess the post-primary needs of the Knocklyon-Scholarstown area.  Having considered all relevant data, including demographic trends and proposed housing development, Dr. Bannon concluded that a new post-primary school for the area was not needed.  Rather, he recommended that additional accommodation should be provided at two existing schools serving the area, i.e., Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan, and Templeogue College.  The conclusions of the report were accepted by my predecessor, who had the document published in September 1994.</P>
      <P>The case for a new school was again reviewed by Dr. Bannon, who reported in January 1996 that developments since his report was prepared did not alter his original recommendation that a new post-primary school to serve the Knocklyon area was not required.  I am in the process of reviewing all the documentation in this case and am not yet in a position to make any announcement.</P>

In 1995, as an exceptional matter, a second set-down point, in the morning only, was introduced because the pupils had to climb up a steep hill to their schools. The revised arrangement ensures that they are set down at a point very close to their schools.  Since the present level of service in the afternoons is considered by my Department to be reasonable and adequate in the overall context of the school transport scheme, I regret that a further extension is not feasible at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 370, 371 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>There are three post-primary schools in the Naas catchment area, St. Mary's College, the Christian Brothers School and the Vocational School.  All three schools have applied for the provision of additional accommodation.</P>
      <P>In light of these applications and the extensive housing developments in the area, the planning section of my Department is undertaking a major review to determine the short, medium and longer term needs of the schools.  This review is ongoing at present and is expected to be completed by the end of the summer.  When the review is completed and the outcome assessed, my Department will contact the schools in the matter.</P>
      <P>In the context of the review, the schools in Naas were asked about their capacity and willingness to expand, in the event that this was considered necessary.  However, this inquiry was strictly a part of a fact-finding process, rather than a request to increase enrolment.</P>
      <P>The architectural planning of the building project for St. Mary's College has reached stage four of the Department's design team procedures. This is the detailed design stage.  The project was not included on the 1997 capital programme by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>The question of funding in 1998 will depend on the capital allocation for that year and on my Department's other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning for the new community school in Celbridge, County Kildare is proceeding and has reached stage II of the Department's design team procedures, outline sketch scheme.  The question of finance for building work will not arise until the planning process has been completed.  At this stage, it is not possible to give a starting date for construction.  However, every effort will be made to expedite the remaining stages of planning in order to ensure that building starts at the earliest possible date.</P>
