      <P>It is proposed to take: No. 6, Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997, Second Stage (resumed), and No. 1, Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 13, motion on legal case of the Louth Residents Group against British Nuclear Fuels (resumed).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob, last night that the Government is now funding <i>in toto</i> the legal costs of the Louth residents in relation to their case?  Will the Government reconsider setting up a Cabinet subcommittee for the management of this, as did the previous Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the related issue of the Cabinet subcommittee, from what has emerged in recent days, the Minister of State should be kept fully aware of Cabinet decisions and not placed in an invidious position.

      <P>Is legislation pending to require vitamin supplements and other preventative health care products necessitating a prescription?  The <i>Big Issues</i> has declared the legislation is already in place, yet as far as I am aware it has not been introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Taoiseach say whether it is the intention of the Government to endlessly shelve the implementation of the Refugee Act given that the Minister of State at the Department of Justice in the course of an Adjournment Debate last evening disgracefully prejudged the position of applicants for asylum here by stating that 80 per cent to 90 per cent of them are economic refugees?  Is the Government now denying applicants a fair hearing?  Will the Taoiseach state when the provisions of that Act <Col N="880" /> will be implemented since he is aware of its urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may or may not know there is a case pending in the courts which is delaying the implementation of several sections of that Act.  Nonetheless it is urgent legislation we should like to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I asked the Taoiseach whether he was satisfied that the presidential election and referendum regulations 1997 signed by the Minister for the Environment are in order which he said was a matter for that Minister.  Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss this matter with the Attorney General?  Can he confirm to the House that the matters I raised in writing to the Minister are in order?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly arises in the case of the people of the west.  Will we be given Government time and an opportunity to speak on the matters raised as I understand the Taoiseach proposed that there be a poll taken among Fianna Fáil Deputies?  Is that correct as I understand that was the lifeline he gave the west last evening?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Since the House is debating the very welcome Taxes Consolidation Bill, 1997 largely prepared by the previous Government and given that road traffic is governed by eight different Acts, will the Taoiseach state whether the Government has any intention of introducing road traffic consolidation legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the case before the courts the Taoiseach told the House last week he was awaiting proposals from the Minister for Justice in respect of the implementation of the provisions of the Refugee Act.  Has he yet received those proposals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to make any changes in the implementation of the Habitats Directive, as has been mentioned in the papers, that would change the force of the directive as signed?  Will the Taoiseach indicate when the related Wildlife Bill will be published?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation already exists and I do not propose to make any changes to that.  The Deputy may put down a question relating to any proposed changes but the legislation that was prepared is still in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify the matter?  The problem arises in relation to the Habitats Directive in so far as it was suggested that this instrument, which was signed by me on behalf of the last Government, had become a matter of negotiation with Independent Members of this House on the formation of the Government as it referred to Wicklow.  In relation to the second matter, the Wildlife Bill was ready for publication before I left office.  I was frequently asked when it would be introduced as it was major legislation dealing with directives for compliance with the European Union.  I find it inexplicable that we do not have a date for the publication of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Now that the Minister for Education and Science has arrived in the Chamber, may I ask the Taoiseach when the school attendance Bill will be introduced?  On a more serious note, the Taoiseach will be aware that in certain areas of the city we do not have a proper service for supporting school attendance.  This legislation is of some urgency and I ask the Taoiseach to indicate when it will be available and if he will expedite it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on any contact he may have made in the past few days with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on the proposed parades legislation due to be published later this week which may include reference to the GAA and other organisations and on which widespread concern has been expressed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter with the British Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. The British Government is well aware of the views of everybody in this House that if it were <Col N="883" /> to include GAA matches in this legislation as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for some other proposals, that would be entirely inappropriate and unacceptable.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I referred to the public servants involved in the preparation of the legislation.  I compliment public servants on the way they deal with representations made by public representatives on tax matters.  It is easier to deal with PAYE offices as the PAYE sector is the paymaster for all services and tax is deducted at source, unlike other sectors which have various arrangements with the tax office, for example, self-assessment.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of flexibility under some arrangements, particularly when genuine errors are made.  Although the Bill provides in Part 3, Chapter 2, section 39 for relief in cases where errors are made, there is inflexibility in some cases.  In a recent case a company which employs many people agreed to pay the outstanding tax immediately it was brought to its attention. However, it was cautioned that it would be included in a future list of companies which failed or refused to pay their taxes.  I do not understand the reason for this as the company agreed to pay the tax once the error was discovered.</P>
      <P>The arrangement under which publicans must meet certain tax requirements before their licences are renewed is generally acceptable but there are exceptions.  I am aware of a case where a publican who was ill could not renew his licence because his tax was not paid by the due date.  He applied to have his licence renewed and made an effort to pay his tax but there was a strict interpretation of the time factors involved.  Although he agreed to enter into a tax arrangement he has been unable to reopen his premises to help pay the tax bill which he has agreed to pay.</P>
      <P>While there is a need for more flexibility in some areas we must be careful not to be too flexible in other areas.  The PAYE sector has been very annoyed by recent cases involving former Members of the House in which no taxes were apparently paid or pursued.  I would like the Revenue Commissioners to adopt a fair play attitude to people who genuinely want to pay their taxes and stay in business.</P>
      <P>There are inequalities in the taxation system, for example, the tax on second hand clothing sold by charities.  These charities which collect clothing, repair and clean it before selling it are required to pay VAT.  However, VAT was already paid on this clothing when it was sold initially.  In addition the profits made by these charities are taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made direct representations on this matter but have not made any progress.  I asked the <Col N="884" /> Minister's predecessor to examine tax relief on corporate donations to charities.  The Minister should consider using the tax code as an incentive to trigger off additional income for legitimate charities by corporate donations and perhaps put a cap on the figure so that it would be possible to quantify how much it would cost the Exchequer by way of loss of tax income.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Perry in his maiden speech referred to urban renewal.  I agree with him on the importance of this type of tax incentive to towns and villages that must compete with larger towns which already have urban renewal status. For example, the town of Tipperary is caught between two stools, with on the one hand Clonmel benefiting extraordinarily well from the urban renewal scheme, which is welcome, and on the other Limerick city which also benefits from that scheme.  Those two areas receive special incentives and suck the life blood from the town of Tipperary which is unable to compete in the competitive world of industrialisation and the service industry.  The town of Tipperary has great difficulties surviving and that is a major source of concern to the town's newly reformed chamber of commerce.</P>
    <P>I put down questions to the Minister for Finance on the new scheme of urban renewal &mdash; there are no proposals for an extension of the scheme even though that was an election promise &mdash; and to the Minister for the Environment who has responsibility in this area.  If towns such as Tipperary do not receive additional incentives by way of tax relief they will be unable to compete and will become dormitory towns.  As an elected representative in that area I, with my parliamentary colleagues from south Tipperary, will fight against that.  I would not agree with a regime such as that predicted by Deputy Deenihan who said that only towns of 6,000 people or more would get urban renewal status.  Towns should be judged on their projects and plans for survival.  That aspect, rather than the population, should be the deciding factor.</P>
    <P>There are other anomalies in the area of taxation such as in the transfer of agricultural property. Under the farm retirement scheme a farmer who decides to transfer land to his son is taxed on every pound he receives from the transfer whereas if the property is transferred to any other relative the first £6,000 of income would be tax free.  Transactions between fathers and sons, which are registered in the tax office, the land registry and solicitors' offices, are bona fide transactions and there is no reason parents should be penalised for transferring land to their sons.</P>
    <P>We should ensure the PAYE sector, which is taxed at source, is aware of allowances that can be claimed such as health expenses and so on.  There is a problem with capital gains tax in that where people inherited land, it is valued at the date of the introduction of the tax in 1974.  I can understand why it was introduced and it would be part of our party policy to ensure this would be taxed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> However, this regime is now a disincentive for the owners of such lands to sell them for development. Such action is stymied by the tax, and the index linking is not good enough to indemnify owners against the huge escalation in property prices, especially in this booming economy which now has people prepared to invest.</P>
    <P>A point was made last night by Deputy Ardagh and supported by Deputy Rabbitte concerning the taxation of stallion fees.  This was examined by my party under the chairmanship of the Minister's predecessor, the late Deputy Joe Bermingham.  A committee, of which I was a member, was established to examine the bloodstock industry, its contribution to the country's economy and the employment it created.  It was agreed that this tax incentive should continue.  It does not exclude the taxation of the profits of the bloodstock industry and stud farms as implied by the contributors.  It only exempts the fee of the stallion.</P>
    <P>I remind those who have raised this tax as a possibility and something worth examining that the cost of some of these stallions is astronomical. They are so expensive that it takes four, five or six people to buy them.  It is a huge capital investment and the largest risk capital investment of all. The capital cost of insurance and the risks involved in the possibility of infertility are beyond our reckoning.  People should realise this is a special industry with a limited number of people prepared to sacrifice and risk that kind of capital for the enjoyment and benefits which will accrue to the area in which they live.  My constituency is fortunate to have many of these stud farms with stallions of the highest possible international repute.  This system has existed for some time and was the subject of a critical economic analysis last year which the industry commissioned to examine not only this aspect of the industry but the contribution it makes to lifestyle in rural Ireland.  If people have an interest in the bloodstock industry, they should read those reports.</P>
    <P>If we interfere with this system, nothing can stop the movement of these animals to another jurisdiction where similar facilities are available or to another hemisphere.  These animals are often sent to Australia and New Zealand in the off-season.  We are fortunate to have stallions in Ireland with a worldwide demand for their services. Animals attending these stallions are transported from all over Europe into Ireland, creating jobs and economic drive.  The number of animals attending each of these stallions is approximately 50.  Twelve men are required full-time to care for them as they are normally stabled here.  There is a continuing level of economic involvement in this country as a result of stallions.  If we interfere with that, the owners of these animals, which are not all Irish, will move them to a jurisdiction where similar facilities are available.  That would have disastrous consequences for employment in the bloodstock industry which creates employment in the racing industry which, in turn, gives so much enjoyment, employment and tax revenue <Col N="886" /> to the State.  The Minister understands the implications of this suggestion and I caution him against it.</P>
    <P>The tax incentive does not interfere with the consolidation of European tax law, unlike corporation profit tax.  The argument about the previous Government's efforts and agreement with their European colleagues on a 12.5 per cent rate and a political commitment to ensure the rate remains at 10 per cent is just reopening the problem.  I heard the Minister for Finance say that the current proposal of 12.5 per cent is the one the previous Government adopted.  Corporation tax at 10 per cent has been an incentive in attracting and establishing industry here and it is not good to promote it as something up for discussion because our European partners do not have the same rate.  We were given it because we have certain disabilities.  This is an offshore island and the only member of the European Union not linked by a tunnel or land to the Continent, so we need something to attract industry to set up here.  It is dangerous to open this discussion in Europe where there is now no sympathy for us because we are doing so well.  Our economy is booming as evidenced by the best ever economic statistics and all Members of the House and successive Governments can claim credit for various aspects of this improvement.  We should try to retain some of the incentives which make us more attractive, otherwise we, as an island on the periphery of Europe, could lose out.</P>
    <P>I put that in the context of the stallion fees because it needs careful consideration if there is a proposal it should be changed, which I hope it is not.  If it were politically suitable to have changed it, we would have suggested it many years ago.  We carried out our own investigation and my party agreed unanimously to the proposal of the late Deputy Bermingham that it would remain for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to fruition.  It is great work, its references are an assistance to us all and it will be appreciated by everyone involved in making the tax code user friendly.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, on his appointment to the Department of Finance.  I hope he does not receive the same type of injuries he received when defending our honour in London some years ago.  Keep the shoulder to the wheel but make sure it is not broken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Taxes Consolidation Bill.  It was imperative that the Government consolidate income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. I especially welcome the structure of the Bill which has been divided under six headings and has a more simple approach to language.  This is a first as we have had many Bills which were difficult to read and understand.  It is imperative to introduce Bills in the area of tax law which are user friendly, simple and easy to understand, and that has happened with this Bill.  It has been going <Col N="887" /> on for a number of years and I compliment Governments, Ministers and, specifically, the draftsmen and civil servants involved in preparing this Bill.  It will make it easier for tax law practitioners and the public to understand the complexities of the tax system.</P>
    <P>This is a relevant time to debate this Bill given that Deputies Harney and McCreevy are negotiating our tax policy for the 21st century in Brussels. The political expediency of the Fianna Fáil manifesto in suggesting a retention of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax has caused many difficulties. When Deputy Richard Bruton was Minister for Enterprise and Employment he said that corporation tax for both the manufacturing and services sectors would be increased to 12.5 per cent in the 21st century.  Deputy O'Rourke, who was Fianna Fáil spokesperson at the time, stated she was against this policy and that Fianna Fáil would retain the 10 per cent corporation tax when in Government.  That promise is now causing difficulties.</P>
    <P>The services sector has paid high rates of corporation tax for many years.  This showed a bias in favour of manufacturing industry.  This was important for many years to attract multinational companies, increase exports and assist economic growth.  However, we need to take a longer term view and introduce an economic policy which is fair to all sectors of business.  The largest number of jobs created by the Celtic tiger have been in the services sector, despite the high rate of corporation tax.  Deputies Harney and McCreevy have a difficult task but they should continue the policy begun by the previous Government of introducing a 12.5 per cent rate of corporation tax over the next ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Corporation tax has been reduced in the past few budgets but there is a long way to go.  Small businesses were pleased with the previous Government's decision to substantially reduce the tax on profits.  They were also pleased by Deputy Richard Bruton's announcement that corporation tax would be standardised at 12.5 per cent by 2010.  There are difficulties for the ongoing negotiations.  Many people considering going into business or expanding existing businesses are unsure of future tax policy.  Profit was a dirty word for many years and it was taxed to the extremes.</P>
    <P>There has been excellent growth in service industries in Sligo-Leitrim during the past number of years, creating many jobs.  Small businesses, including services, need Government backing and need to know what Government policy will be over the next few years so that they can plan for the future.  The Government should state its policy as quickly as possible and I hope Deputies Harney and McCreevy will do so after the discussions in Brussels.  In particular, I hope they will state their policy on corporation tax before Christmas.  I assume there will be some indication of this, given that the budget will be announced in December.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> Small businesses are doing particularly well but they have difficulty dealing with the number of tax forms issued by the Revenue Commissioners. One such form is the Intra EU Statistics Return. This sounds wonderful but anyone who imports over £140,000 of goods must return the form regularly.  For instance, the form requires anyone importing goods from France to state the value in French francs and pounds and the weight of the items.  I have received many complaints from businesses that this is another unnecessary form of bureaucracy.  I do not know what the information is used for.  The form must be returned to the Revenue Commissioners in Dundalk.  If they do not receive it within a number of weeks, they contact the businesses and put them under considerable pressure.  Businesses must also return this form to their auditors, incurring additional costs.  I have not seen any information resulting from this form which is of benefit to Government or Departments.  The Minister should examine whether this type of bureaucracy can be eradicated. The more overheads incurred by small businesses the more difficult it is for them to employ staff.  We should provide businesses with an incentive to make a profit and employ as many people as possible.  This is a negative rather than a positive bureaucracy.  One way of solving this problem may be to increase the threshold from £140,000 to a higher figure so that only large businesses qualify.  The figure of £140,000 is quite a small amount and should be dramatically increased.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal is also dealt with in this Bill and I wish to make the case for extending it to County Leitrim.  It is the only county without a town with urban renewal status.  The problem is that one of the guidelines states that no town with a population of less than 6,000 can have such status.  This is a mistake as I have seen the great benefit urban renewal status can give to large urban areas including towns such as Sligo, Castlebar and Longford.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance and the Government should reconsider rural renewal status.  Carrick-on-Shannon is the chief town of County Leitrim with a population of 2,000.  It is finding it difficult to compete with towns like Sligo and Longford which have developed due to their urban renewal status.  I do not see why small towns cannot be included in schemes.  Inclusion would greatly benefit the economy of the area and the Government in terms of tax buoyancy and revenue.  There are a great number of people living outside County Leitrim who, if given the tax benefits and incentives to invest in their county, would gladly do so.  I hope in the budget and the Finance Bill the Minister for Finance will look seriously at allowing towns with a population of fewer than 6,000 to be included in the urban renewal scheme or a renamed rural renewal scheme to include towns such as Carrick-on-Shannon, Ballinamore, Mohill, Manorhamilton, Drumshanbo, Tubbercurry and Ballymote, towns which are finding it very difficult to compete <Col N="889" /> with the larger urban areas which have received tax incentives.  No one should be discriminated against simply because he or she comes from a small rural population base.  Many of these areas have businesses and development plans which would benefit greatly from tax incentives.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government, the Department of Finance and others involved in producing this Bill.  It is progressive and provides an example of the manner in which we should examine legislation from different Departments.  It is user friendly and makes it easier for the public to understand tax law.  It also makes it easier for tax practitioners to advise their clients.  Pursuance of this type of consolidation would make our legislation more user friendly and relevant to the people we represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Dublin West) Mr. Higgins (Dublin West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: The legislation before the House is the Taxes Consolidation Bill but what should be before us is a justice in taxation Bill.  The tax system the Bill proposes to consolidate is manifestly unjust in its application. There is a huge discrepancy in the way the tax code bears down on PAYE workers as opposed to the big business element, financial institutions and the super rich.  The discrepancy has been highlighted for many years but has not been addressed.  It is an extraordinary and scandalous fact that nearly 20 years after the major tax marches of the PAYE sector in the late 1970s and early 1980s the proportion of income tax paid by the PAYE sector, at 85 per cent, is almost the same as it was then.  In recent years PAYE workers, under the so-called programmes of national partnership including the present programme, find that their income increases are pegged at about 1 per cent per annum while there is no such restraint on profits.  Against the background of the so-called Celtic tiger, profits are roaring ahead while the income of ordinary workers whose labour by hand and by brain make the profits, is being dramatically restrained while taxation levels remain at a punitive rate.</P>
      <P>It is amusing to hear the leaders of the main parties in this House disputing what the Government is doing about corporation tax and whether it should be 10 per cent or 12.5 per cent.  As far as major companies are concerned the reality is that for many years there has been an effective tax rate which is far lower than the face value tax rate because of the huge amount of loopholes and schemes and scams that can be employed by big business and financial institutions to save on their taxation bills.  They have the resources to invest huge amounts into saving on taxation while, by contrast, the PAYE sector is hit for every penny. Is it any wonder there is such anger and cynicism among ordinary working people regarding the blatant double standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that in recent weeks while the Government was claiming to be up front about investigating alleged corruption in high places, it resolutely refused to include a full-scale examination of the Ansbacher offshore accounts in the <Col N="890" /> terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal.  It is clear to everybody that those accounts were used for widespread tax evasion.  The Government refuses to investigate this matter.  Why?  Is the Government out to protect powerful individuals and businesses whom it knows to be involved in tax evasion equivalent to robbing PAYE workers, the State and society in general?  Does the Government think it can have any credibility regarding taxation justice when it stands over this blatant cover-up of tax evasion?</P>
    <P>The tax amnesties of 1987 and 1993, which wrote off £1,000 million in taxation due to the State from super wealthy individuals and big companies, have been the source of endless cynicism and anger among PAYE workers, the backbone of the tax paying public, the tax compliant self employed and small businesses.  This does not surface in the media and perhaps the Government is not aware of it, but the contrasts and double standards are being played out every week in District Courts throughout Dublin.  Hundreds of decent tax payers are dragged in front of the District Court for arrears of water charges which have now been abandoned as a discredited double taxation.  Incredibly the names of some of those householders are being entered in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> for the grand sum of £210 in an attempt by the local authorities to intimidate and frighten these decent taxpayers to pay the arrears of what they resolutely fought against as an unjust double taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government should be aware that at ground level &mdash; perhaps it does not reach into the hallowed chambers here &mdash; there is huge anger about these double standards.  Every week people are dragged before the courts while the Government is refusing to investigate an account totalling £38 million where it is probable that millions of pounds owed to the State, in due taxation, would be found.</P>
    <P>I warn the Government and the main Opposition Party, Fine Gael, that these issues will break cover publicly in the course of the two by-elections shortly.  Working people will take their anger out on the main parties who are protecting the unjust tax regime.  It is time the ordinary PAYE workers elected far more representatives to the Dáil who would stand unashamedly full square with them rather than in the camp of the big business sector, the financial institutions and the super-privileged.  Unfortunately the main problem has been that the parties in Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; and the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, represent the most powerful and wealthy sections. Undoubtedly the huge contributions they receive from those sections influence taxation policy in the State.  Tribunals have been set up to look at corruption but it may go unnoticed that some of the normal political activity between business and politics deserves to be looked at in an entirely different and more critical way.  I have no doubt the financing of the political parties by powerful vested interests is in the minds of the political <Col N="891" /> parties when it comes to the formulation of budgets and Finance Bills and they will not want to transgress unduly on them in regard to levels of taxation, levies etc.</P>
    <P>It is time the leadership of the trade union movement acted directly on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of its members who are extremely dissatisfied with the unjust taxation system.  Justice in taxation will have to be found by the PAYE workers and the compliant self-employed mobilising their own people power directly to bring to bear on Government and on the major political parties that they are not prepared to be ignored while the Taxes Consolidation Bill is being discussed.  By direct trade union action rather than the cosy partnerships, which have badly let down the PAYE worker in regard to wage increases and justice in taxation, there has to be mobilisation of the movement and far more people in the Dáil who represent unashamedly the PAYE sector, as opposed to the most privileged sectors.  Those are the principles of taxation justice that should be involved rather than simply a consolidation of the taxation regimes which are manifestly unjust.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who have contributed to this important debate.  I hope I will be able to deal fully with the various points raised by Deputies.  I concur with the general welcome for the Taxes Consolidation Bill and the efforts of all involved to bring this important legislation to the House in such a short time.</P>
      <P>During the past 24 hours there has been much comment on corporation tax.  As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, made clear on Monday, we are dealing with Brussels on the basis of the notified decision of the previous Government in May last to bring in a single low rate of 12.5 per cent on trading income from 2006 in the case of all companies, except manufacturing, and from 2011 in the case of manufacturing.  The Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance were in Brussels yesterday to discuss a number of points on the introduction of new rates which the Commission has raised.  Deputies opposite are fully aware that there are many eyes looking at our tax regime which, unlike the position in several other member states, is fully transparent and, thus, completely defendable.  The Minister at ECOFIN made it clear he would defend Ireland's interest and the House can be assured he will be doing just that in our current discussions with the Commission. As far as the Government is concerned nobody on this side is talking about a 15 per cent corporation tax rate, nor is anybody in the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the performance of the economy, <i>vis-a-vis</i> budget day forecasts, as Deputy Noonan said the revenue forecasting is not an exact science. I assure him, however, there is no systematic under-forecasting &mdash; all relevant information available is input at the time.  The Department of <Col N="892" /> Finance had one of the strongest growth forecasts of anyone for 1997 with a post budget GNP volume growth of 5.5 per cent compared to the average of seven other reputable public and private sector forecasts of 5.4 per cent.  Everyone in the House will agree that the extra revenue buoyancy is simply reflecting the sheer pace of economic activity.  Employment and activity generally are much stronger than envisaged at budget time. This is the reason more revenue is coming in.  The proof is available in the substantial falling numbers in the unemployment figures and the tremendous growth on the employment side. When Deputies comment on extra revenue coming in they should examine what is really happening in the economy: it is not an increase in intake from existing taxpayers, it is a growth in the number of taxpayers in the employment market and a decrease in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The Government has already indicated that the extra revenue this year will be taken into account in framing tax reliefs in the 1998 budget.  I have noted the comments by Deputy Higgins.  I assure him the philosophy underpinning the Government's approach to budgetary strategy is to seek to ensure, where benefits can be given, that all sectors of society would be the main beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan responded positively to the philosophy of running budget surpluses in time of plenty and made a number of interesting remarks on how we should plan our budget strategy in the next few years.  We are at one in regard to the need to plan on a multi-annual basis on budgetary matters.  This is the way the previous Government proceeded.  It is unfair to criticise the Minister on the Estimates process because he is proceeding on the same basis as previous Governments.  It is the Government's function to decide the Estimates and present them to the Dáil.  In regard to the address by the Secretary General of the Department of Finance to the former Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, it is open to the committee when it is reconstituted to invite the Secretary General to appear before it again.  The committee should issue such an invitation if it deems it necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke of the need to balance taxation with the need to ensure proper funding of public services.  He also set out his party's priorities as to how tax reductions should be implemented.  The Government is conscious of the need for balance in this area and to secure benefits for taxpayers.  Its proposals will be revealed on 3 December and I am sure I will be forgiven for not revealing them now.  It is important to note that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, was to the fore in implementing innovative and imaginative taxation polices that, without question, have lead to the economic growth we are enjoying.  They contributed significantly to the decrease in unemployment and the corresponding growth in employment figures. Fianna Fáil's track record in Government should leave people in no doubt as to its ability to deliver where it matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> Deputy Rabbitte also referred to the reliefs in the tax system and the purposes they serve.  I have no difficulty reviewing reliefs to ensure they are properly targeted.  Having been a member of Government, he will be aware of the difficulties in withdrawing reliefs once given.  He will also be aware that the last major reduction in tax relief occurred in 1992 as part of a tax reform package.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell sought greater distribution of information to taxpayers.  I am pleased he raised that point.  Revenue has made great progress in building a relationship with its customers, in producing readable leaflets and in providing information contact points for taxpayers.  It has firm plans to do more in that regard.  In the past few years it has endeavoured to make information available in an efficient and understandable manner.</P>
    <P>The question of consolidating customs and excise law was also raised.  This is old legislation. Customs law is contained in the EU Customs Code which consolidates that law.  Revenue has made a start on bringing together excise law and may be able to consolidate blocks of excise law in future Finance Bills.  Revenue is also examining VAT and capital taxes, a matter that was raised at a meeting of the former Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  We can take great heart from the progress made in the Taxes Consolidation Bill and be confident we have in place the capacity, the people and the mechanisms to deliver much more in terms of consolidation legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ardagh spoke of the need to simplify forms and procedures.  Revenue is working closely with representatives of small firms to further reduce red tape where possible.  It has received an award for its progress which is unusual in the case of Revenue.  This demonstrates the sea change in the past few years and the drive in Revenue to ensure all systems meet the highest possible standards and that best practice applies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds referred to EU statistical forms being technical.  I will examine the nature of the forms to which he referred, but the aim is to remove red tape and to ensure matters are dealt with simply and efficiently.  Deputy Ardagh also referred to the marginal rate of tax of 40 per cent on income just above the income tax exemption limits.  This special rate of tax is necessary for technical reasons to prevent those who exceed the exemption tax limit from losing out if they go back to the ordinary system of tax allowances.  I agree the rate is high.  The last decrease in the rate was made by the Taoiseach as Minister for Finance when he reduced it from 48 per cent to 40 per cent.  This matter is kept under review and I am sure the Minister for Finance will take it into account in his overall strategy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made a series of cogent points about capital allowances for hotels, computer software, film relief and so on.  While I have noted these points, they can be more appropriately dealt with in the Finance Bill, 1998.  It was also suggested that a non-statutory index could be <Col N="894" /> considered as part of Revenue's notes for guidance project.  While I cannot make a firm commitment on this matter because Revenue is anxious to produce the notes for guidance document as soon as possible, it will examine the matter.  As those notes will be valuable to all concerned, their production will be a priority when the Taxes Consolidation Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The notes for guidance will follow the format and style of the recently published Notes for Guidance on the Finance Act, 1997.  The notes will contain suitable cross references and signposting to the relevant operational instructions and precedents relating to the consolidated legislation the Revenue Commissioners are required to publish under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997.  By &ldquo;precedents&rdquo; I mean details of the various responses the Revenues Commissioners have made in recent years to requests for guidance on the interpretation of tax law.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised the question of an ongoing or updated CD ROM to reflect annual changes to the Act.  We do not want further consolidation of tax law to take another 30 years.  We should consolidate the law at least every five to ten years.  A number of commercial publishing firms are involved in tax publications, including one that issues an updated version of the tax codes annually following enactment of the Finance Bill.  The gap between consolidation can be covered by such publications.  The changes in each year's Finance Bill will be prepared in such a way that they can be readily slotted into the consolidation framework.  That may answer many of the concerns raised by Deputies.  Future finance Bills will be designed to facilitate the easy updating of tax consolidation legislation.  That will go a long way towards ensuring the body of law in that single Act continues to be a reference point.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the welcome all speakers afforded the Bill and the commitment to facilitate its speedy passage through the House by the principal Opposition speakers, Deputies Noonan and McDowell.  There is nothing new in it and nothing has been left out.  That should allay any fears Deputy Noonan may have had.  The Bill should not be held up by reopening issues which have been fully debated.  I sensed Deputies considered the Bill had been dealt with and are anxious to pass it and put it on the Statute Book.  I hope I have responded to most of the points raised by the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris raised a number of points about the bloodstock industry.  I know he has an interest in that area, but he can rest assured nothing will be done by the Government to deliberately damage the continued development of any sector through use of the tax laws.  When one gives reliefs and they become part of the currency of usage it is hard to remove them, but there is no suggestion of anything like that happening.</P>
    <P>I did not agree with much of what Deputy Higgins said.  One must be careful and circumspect when levelling allegations in the House.  They are <Col N="895" /> not helpful and they did not conform to the tone of this debate.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who participated in the debate.  I heartily congratulate the officials involved from Revenue, my Department and the private sector who put the Bill together in a short space of time.  The cost of this was a fraction of what it might have been if it was contracted out solely to the private sector to deliver.  It is worth noting our officials have the capacity to deliver great value.  I commend all of them and everyone involved in preparing the Bill.</P>

    <P>Bill entitled an Act to provide for the vesting of Dublin Airport, Shannon Airport and Cork Airport in Aer Rianta, Cuideachta Phoiblí Theoranta, the assignment to the said company of certain functions heretofore exercised by the Minister for Public Enterprise relating to the management, operation and development of those airports; to amend the Air Navigation and Transport Acts, l936 to l988, the Irish Aviation Authority Act, l993, and other enactments and to provide for matters connected therewith.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill about airports, but it covers much more than that.  It will be the framework document for the operation of the State airports into the new millennium and beyond.  Its main purpose is to provide for termination of the present State airport management arrangement and to set up Aer Rianta as a normal commercial State body.  This involves the transfer of the assets at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports to Aer Rianta and the assignment to the company of certain functions previously undertaken by me and my predecessors in relation to the management and development of the three State airports.  The opportunity is also being availed of to amend and <Col N="896" /> update miscellaneous provisions in civil aviation legislation generally.</P>
    <P>The previous Bill dealt with the consolidation of various tax Bills and this one is a type of mini consolidation Bill.  Although this is not as macroeconomic as the previous bill, it is interesting. The history of Aer Rianta spans the period from the mid-1930s to today.</P>
    <P>This is a long overdue measure to regularise the current agency position of Aer Rianta to put it on the same footing as other commercial State-sponsored bodies, such as the Electricity Supply Board and Bord Gáis.  The existing arrangement is out-dated and out-moded.  It involves Aer Rianta, which was set up as a limited company in 1937, became a public limited company in 1985 and whose shares are owned by the Minister for Finance, being the agent of the Minister for Public Enterprise and as such being merely a name under which the Minister acts.  The company has no assets, functions, activities or revenues in its own right in the field of airport management. While Aer Rianta has funded all airport investment since 1988, the company simply holds those assets in trust for the Minister of the day, who is their legal owner.  This Bill involves modernising the arrangements between the Minister and a commercial State body.</P>
    <P>It is correct on Second Stage to put the matter in perspective.  The company was originally incorporated in 1937 in accordance with the terms of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936.  The original purpose of Aer Rianta, as specified in that Act, was to serve as a holding company for Aer Lingus-Aerlínte and to promote aviation generally.  The company was then given responsibility for the management of Dublin airport from its construction in 1940 and has exercised that duty ever since.</P>
    <P>Unlike Dublin, neither Cork nor Shannon were managed by Aer Rianta when they opened.  The construction of Shannon Airport began in 1936 and, although interrupted by World War II, the essential facilities for aircraft and passenger handling were completed in time for the post-war travel age.  It is timely to remember the words of the then Deputy James Dillon who said in this House that he would live to see the day when the rabbits would run over the runways of Rineanna. I do not mean that in a political but in an alliterative historical sense.  All big new ventures carry that aura and people doubt if they will come to fruition.  They worry about the future.  It is correct that matters should be debated in that sense, but it is interesting that Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta which had their beginnings in the mid-l930s are now major success stories.</P>
    <P>The airport was managed by the then Department of Industry and Commerce and later by the Department of Transport and Power.  Cork from its opening in 1961 was also managed directly by the Department of Transport and Power while commercial activities were carried out by various concessionaires under licence from the Minister. In 1969 an administrative arrangement was <Col N="897" /> entered into under which Aer Rianta was given responsibility for managing Shannon and Cork as agents of the Minister.  In l969 the late Erskine Childers, the then Minister for Transport and Power indicated that it was his intention to regularise the status of Aer Rianta at the earliest possible opportunity and 28 years later &mdash; that says much for us and our predecessors &mdash; we are finally doing that in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Also in 1969 Derek Keogh, who was then a young man, left the then Department as a HEO and went to work with Aer Rianta.  He brought the company to great heights through the assistance of his board, management, workers and various chairpersons and at the end of this year he will relinquish his post.  I take this opportunity to wish him well in whatever further fields of activity he engages.  He remains young in heart, mind and body.  I hope he will gain fulfilment and success from whatever he chooses to do.  I thank him on my behalf and that of the Department.  He is a person of outstanding character, ability, probity and the essence of what a person holding public office should be.</P>
    <P>It can fairly be said that the company has come a long way in its 60 years history.  From what was, in reality, a close relative of Aer Lingus from the time it was set up until the companies were split by the Air Companies Act, 1966, Aer Rianta has now become a successful company in its own right.  I compliment the management and staff of the company on the success achieved to date.</P>
    <P>A successful business depends on the co-operation of both management and staff.  I wish to single out one innovation in industrial relations within Aer Rianta which epitomises this spirit of co-operation between management, staff and their trade unions &mdash; the Compact for Constructive Participation.  The compact involves staff and management on a partnership basis in all matters which affect the company.  It has the active support and endorsement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which is an indication of very progressive thinking.</P>
    <P>The core business of Aer Rianta is obviously the operation and development of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.  Through its subsidiaries and associate companies, however, it is involved in successful activities such as hotel ownership, duty free shopping and airport management and ownership from Parknasilla to Beijing.  In 1996 the company and its subsidiaries employed over 2,700 people, had a turnover of £231 million and a profit of £39.4 million of which it surrendered £12.9 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Last year Aer Rianta handled the awesome number of almost 12 million passengers and 146,000 tonnes of freight at the three State airports. This represents an increase of 13 per cent in passenger figures and 18 per cent in the freight carried, over the previous year.  The trend in 1997 continues to be upward.  The accounts for this will not be available until next year.  Each of the airports handled a record number of passengers in <Col N="898" /> 1996 and I expect that each will reach new record levels this year.</P>
    <P>The growth in both passenger and freight traffic has been such over the last few years that the facilities, particularly at Dublin Airport, are stretched to the limit.  For this reason, major development programmes are taking place at all three airports.  Five year programmes, costing £225 million, were announced by Deputy Stagg at Shannon last year.  The programmes are subject to periodic review by my Department by reference to traffic developments.  Based on figures so far this year and medium term projections, the development programmes at the airports need to continue apace and are doing so.</P>
    <P>Airport development, while much needed, does not come cheap.  One of the major tasks facing Aer Rianta in the medium term will be financing these developments.  I am confident the company is robust enough to undertake this successfully.  I visited Aer Rianta, as I did all the semi-State bodies, and met the chairman, Noel Hanlon and the board, whose statements and actions are robust and innovative.</P>
    <P>There is a misconception that all an airport management company has to do is sit back and wait for the customers to troop through its terminal building.  This is not true.  All airports compete with each other.  Internationally, Irish airports compete for long haul and hub business with airports in the UK and on the Continent. Aer Rianta has no God-given right to be successful. It is successful but has to work hard to be so.</P>
    <P>Since late 1995 responsibility for marketing all three State airports has been given to Aer Rianta. Prior to that the company marketed Dublin and Cork while responsibility at Shannon was split between Aer Rianta and Shannon Development. I am satisfied that responsibility for marketing the airports should rest with the company which operates and soon will own the airports.  While I am aware of the particular difficulties facing Shannon, a co-ordinated marketing approach, taking the particular circumstances of each airport into consideration, is best.</P>
    <P>With regard to transatlantic traffic, I am confident that developments such as the recent announcement by Aer Lingus that from next summer it will serve Newark all year round will succeed in increasing passenger numbers.  I also understand from Aer Rianta that it expects an announcement shortly from Continental Airlines of the introduction of daily services from Newark commencing next June, one to Shannon and the other to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am heartened by Aer Rianta's initial report given to me by the chairman.  It is Aer Rianta's job to make the formal announcement, which it will do next week.  I recently met the mid-western lobby, consisting of various people drawn from agencies and the community, who are worried about the development of Shannon airport.  They wish to see the mid-west continue on a progressive path and are worried at what they see as its decline.  The formal announcement and my initial <Col N="899" /> announcement today will be a considerable boost to that region.  I am happy to say it is a one for one arrangement.  There is no cherry picking and we are keeping in line with the commitment of the present and previous Governments that a flight to Shannon must be matched with a flight to Dublin and <i>vice versa.</i> This, combined with the recent Aer Lingus announcement, will mean that passenger numbers into Shannon will increase dramatically and have a knock-on effect on the region.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales represent an important element of Aer Rianta's current financial strength.  Intra-European Community duty free sales are scheduled to be abolished from 30 June 1999.  This will have a major effect on the profitability not only of airports, but also of air and sea carriers &mdash; particularly low cost, low fare carriers.</P>
    <P>In Aer Rianta's case, duty free sales help it to keep airport charges low, fund its discount schemes and finance development at the three airports.  The company is playing a prominent role in the international campaign to retain duty free sales or at least to further defer abolition.  At the same time, the company is pursuing other opportunities both to offset these possible lost revenues and, more generally, to assist in discharging the company's essential mandate from the shareholder of keeping Irish air access costs as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government includes resistance to EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999 as a key priority under the transport heading.  My own interest in the duty free issue is well documented.  In my three and a half months in office I have been vigorous in heading up the campaign and working with the other interests involved.</P>
    <P>I have called on the EU Commission to conduct an EU wide study into the economic and social effects on Europe of ending duty free.  I am pleased that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility in this area, has commissioned a study into the consequences for Ireland of the abolition of intracommunity duty free sales.  This study, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, should provide a useful basis for further discussions. At Question Time the week before last, in answer to a question put by Deputy Stagg, the Taoiseach signalled his support for the retention of duty free.  The previous Government has also worked on this issue.</P>
    <P>I recently visited Brussels for a conference hosted by Forum Europe which 350 people attended, representing all the interests who would be adversely affected if the abolition of duty free went ahead.  It was an enthusiastic meeting.  All of us were in the one ship, as it were.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there duty free on the ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was, we did not have time to avail of it.  Commissioner Monti issued a <Col N="900" /> press release which stated that he was very adamant the situation would not change.  One of the speakers was very dismissive of the whole duty free issue.  It was very interesting to hear his remarks which showed the unreality which sometimes prevades bureaucracy at European level.  I sometimes think that Europe has adopted an entire mantle of bureaucracy.  The argument continues to be advanced that duty free is something which must be done away with.  The proposition put forward by one of the speakers who did not favour the retention of duty free &mdash; the panel, as is proper in any debate was balanced, although the audience were in favour of the retention &mdash; was that only elitist people travelled by plane or ferry.  He asserted that only politicians, civil servants and their ilk benefited from duty free.  I wonder what dusty cupboard he took that argument from.  The idea that in 1997 &mdash; or indeed in many years past &mdash; only well-heeled, articulate people use ferries or planes is so outdated that one wonders how anybody could actually utter such a fatuous banality.  Quinnsworth and other supermarkets give out saving stamps which people can collect and use towards trips abroad. There are bargain holidays available and regular holiday competitions are run.  The idea that planes and ferries are peopled by elitist society is quite ridiculous.</P>
      <P>When duty free harmonisation was agreed in 1992, there was to be a harmonisation of other excise duties and matters within the finance remit in tandem with it.  That did not happen.  Europe did not live up to all the arrangements it made. A Europe-wide study was to be commissioned in 1992 on the possible effects of the abolition of duty free.  That was not carried out either.  I shall continue to make the case that we are fully entitled to seek the retention of duty free in the absence of the study which the Commission has now blatantly refused to carry out and the lack of harmonisation of other duties.  I can only assume that this is a bureaucratic decision which the Commission wants to insert because it wants to &ldquo;square an envelope&rdquo; so to speak.  By doing so, it would get rid of something which is affordable to people and very useful to air and ferry travel, enables access fares to be kept low, is competitive and employs a large number of people.  In a Europe of the citizens &mdash; which the Commission claims to want &mdash; where the majority of people want this facility retained it seems that bureaucratic procedures are being excessively used by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a transport council meeting last week in Luxembourg I raised this issue at the table under the issue of airport charges; there was no specific item on the agenda as the agendas for such meetings are set well in advance of the meeting taking place.  I spoke in some detail on the issue.  Over lunch, I met Gavin Strong, the British Transport Minister.  However, the person with overall responsibility in this area is the Deputy Prime Minister and Environment Secretary, John Prescott. I arranged a meeting for 10 November in <Col N="901" /> London with both MPs to encourage the UK to take up the baton on this issue in their six month European presidency which commences in January. The purpose of the meeting is to show solidarity on this issue.  I understand both men are very interested in the idea and want to give it a fillip during the British presidency.</P>
    <P>I will continue to work among the transport Ministers and we hope to form a coherent lobby on this issue if we can get all of our colleagues on side.  We would, in turn, lobby the Commission through the Finance Ministers.  I know I will receive support on this issue which I would like to see being a cross-party one.  I would like to be able to say that I speak with the mandate of Dáil Éireann.  I do not intend to deal with this matter in any divisive way.</P>
    <P>I have heard some criticism of the campaign to retain duty free sales on the basis that it is a subsidy to those who are better off.  When one analyses that argument, it is obviously outdated.  It used to be the case 20 years ago that air and ferry travel was the preserve of the wealthy few. However, today in the age of mass travel and package holidays, duty free can no longer be considered an exclusive perk of the elite.  We are a small open economy, one of the most open in the EU.  Our business, for the most part, is international trade.  We are also an island beyond an island with no land borders with our major trading partners.  Access costs to markets by sea and by air are an important element of our marketing costs.  They affect all sectors of our economy &mdash; imports, exports and tourism.  It makes sound economic sense, therefore, to keep access costs to our markets as low as possible.</P>
    <P>Airport charges are an important element of such costs.  Studies carried out in recent years indicate that airport charges at the three State airports are competitive when compared to airports in Europe.  I see the necessity to keep these charges under control and, where possible, to improve their competitiveness as being central to all strategic planning by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in regularising Aer Rianta's commercial and financial affairs, presents the company with the opportunities and challenges which will allow it to continue to be competitive and enable it to share the benefits of its competitiveness with its customers, airlines and travelling public.</P>
    <P>Before I turn to the main elements of the Bill, I remind Deputies that the general scheme of the Bill was approved by the previous Government late last year.  The text before the House follows closely on that general scheme.  I hope the Bill will not be controversial and I hope for the support of Deputies from all sides of the House.  I look forward to listening to what I know will be a progressive debate.</P>
    <P>The main effect of the Bill will, of course, be to transfer all of the assets held in the Minister's name at the three State airports to Aer Rianta's balance sheet.  Heretofore, because all the assets were vested in the Minister, neither corporation tax &mdash; an issue which was raised recently at Fingal <Col N="902" /> County Council &mdash; nor local authority rates were payable by the company, though a small amount of corporation tax was paid by subsidiaries. The position will, of course, change following the change of status and full corporation tax and rates will be paid by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>The Bill is in six parts.  Part one, which is the preliminary part, is made up of such standard provisions as the interpretation of terms used in the Bill, the making of regulations, the disposal of money received by the Minister for Finance, offences under the Bill and the power of the company to institute proceedings.  Part two deals with the issue of shares in the company to the Minister for Finance.  The value of these shares will be equal to the value of the assets on the company's balance sheet, less the liabilities.  It also provides that the Minister for Finance may transfer a share to one or more persons for the purpose of complying with the provisions of the Companies Act as regards the minimum number of members of a company.  This Bill has nothing to do with privatising Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I am also making provision in this part for the payment of dividends to the Exchequer by the company where profits allow, and for the regulation of the borrowings of Aer Rianta and its subsidiaries.  Controls of this type are fairly standard among semi-State companies and are useful in protecting the interests of the taxpayers who are the ultimate owners of the company.</P>
    <P>Part three transfers to the company all of the land and property previously vested in me as Minister.  Most of these assets were acquired by the company and are held in trust.  Some property, however, was funded directly by the Exchequer.  It is only fair, on the occasion of the transfer of that property to the company, that this fact be recognised.  I have included a provision requiring Aer Rianta to pay for the assets being transferred.  The amount in question will be a matter for consideration by me and the Minister for Finance, but I expect it will reflect the written down value of the property in question.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this part is concerned with ending the outmoded agency arrangement between Aer Rianta and me and transfers to the company a number of powers such as the right to establish airports and to acquire or enter onto land, which up to now were exercised by the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>Part four updates a number of provisions of existing legislation in regard to the administration of the company.  It sets down the powers and duties of the company, deals with the appointment and removal from office of the chairperson, directors and chief executive, with reporting procedures to me and with the conduct of directors and employees of the company and its subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>This is an important part of the Bill because it draws the lines for all concerned and reflects up-to-date thinking on corporate governance and responsibility.  Importantly, it also provides that I will retain the right to approve changes in airport <Col N="903" /> charges to ensure that all factors are considered in deciding on any adjustments.</P>
    <P>Part five relates to the regulation of airports including the making of by-laws and the appointment of authorised officers.  These provisions deal with issues of safety and security and again are mainly an updating and consolidation of existing legislation.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken to amend a number of other aviation related Acts.  These changes are necessary either because of the knock on effects of the provisions of this Bill or because some lacuna has been discovered in the legislation in question.  They are included in part six of the Bill.  This is a developmental Bill, it is important and long overdue.  It provides Aer Rianta with a measure of commercial freedom and responsibility, while at the same time regulating those areas in which the exposure of the Exchequer, and thereby the taxpayer, is greatest. It has, I hope, got the balance right.</P>
    <P>I have found Aer Rianta steadfast.  It is developmental in what it is doing, as evidenced by its success in buying into managing airports in other lands.  It is currently engaged in another such exercise which I hope will have a fruitful outcome. It is constantly innovative and constantly looking ahead, but with the national interest in mind and the bottom line of finance.  I thank all who work or who have ever worked in Aer Rianta.  I include the chief executive who has been with Aer Rianta since l969 and who leaves at the end of this year, to our great regret.  I am sure he will have a worthy replacement, but my remarks on the service he has given will be echoed by everyone in this House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is keenly awaited.  It is of great interest to Deputies who live in the vicinity of Dublin Airport. I freely acknowledge that Deputies on all sides of the House have a great interest in seeing this Bill come to fruition.  I look forward to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports this Bill.  I hope on Second Stage to cover some elements of airport policy here, air navigation policy, safety, and the future of our airports and the aviation business generally.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Bill, to provide a corporate structure for the assets and basis of operation of Aer Rianta, is something we support, not only because the heads of the Bill were approved by the previous Cabinet but because there has been a broad consensus for some time that we should move away from the agency structure to a singular corporate body that can trade as a public liability company in a totally commercial fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are elements of the Bill that involve great change for Aer Rianta and require close scrutiny.  Over recent weeks I met a number of chief executives and others connected to the various semi-State companies under the Department of Public Enterprise, and I find it difficult to find a coherent policy on dividends, growth abroad, <Col N="904" /> equity and gearing &mdash; all the things shareholders are normally concerned about.  I hope under the new Department there will be clear-sighted thinking on these issues.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly join the Minister in paying tribute to the staff of Aer Rianta.  Their performance since the establishment of the company has been quite remarkable.  Over the past two decades in particular, its growth, its successful development of business abroad, its successful management of the Great Southern Hotel Group, its pioneering approach, as well as its balance sheet performance have been excellent.  It certainly is a model among semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>However, if one were to cast a cold, critical eye on this Bill, one could see it as an attempt to grab £15 million per annum in taxation from Aer Rianta.  If in addition to that there is a loss of income from duty free sales, we could be facing a completely different Aer Rianta in two or three years' time.  While we can look at the present snapshot in time and be positive about Aer Rianta, it is important that we have a long-term strategic view for overcoming difficulties.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that corporation profits tax will be paid for the first time by Aer Rianta and that local authority rates will be payable on its three airports.  It is estimated that at Cork, Dublin and Shannon, some £4.5 million will now be payable in rates to the local authorities.  Taking the l996 balance sheet performance, there would be a minimal corporation profits tax liability in excess of £10 million.  If a similar policy <i>vis-a-vis</i> dividends is to be applied, as a cash surrender policy was previously applied, this would starve Aer Rianta of the necessary resources to finance its borrowings and to develop the airports appropriately given the phenomenal growth in aviation to which the Minister has referred.  If we put on top of that the loss of income from duty free sales, which in revenue terms within Europe is worth £100 million, a completely different picture emerges.  All the good work could be set at naught.  I will come back to some of these issues in detail.</P>
    <P>I have a series of wide-ranging questions for the Minister to which I hope she will take the opportunity on Second Stage to reply because some of them relate to clarification that I require. The first is in relation to the transfer of assets. These assets, the lands at the airport and so on, are owned by the Government, and they are to be transferred.  At what charge will they be transferred? This is relevant in the context of the vesting day of this legislation, because if the vesting day was 1 January l998, under the Companies Act the company would not be able to declare a dividend within that year but would have to wait until the following year.  Is it the Government's intention to obtain a return in 1998 approximate to the cash surrender dividend, <i>circa</i> £14 million, through the transfer of assets or will there be a double penalty whereby Aer Rianta will be required to pay a dividend as well as the value of the assets transferred?  These are important questions <Col N="905" /> for Aer Rianta in terms of its financial performance.</P>
    <P>On the question of duty free sales, there is deep concern among the staff of Aer Rianta.  While I commend the Minister to whom I offer my support, her efforts would be unnecessary if the Taoiseach, then Minister for Finance, had rejected the tax harmonisation proposal at ECOFIN in 1994.  That was the appropriate time to mount a vigorous campaign.  It is estimated that 40 per cent of Aer Rianta's profits and 400 staff will be directly affected by the abolition of duty free sales from July 1999.  This will result in higher charges to its customers, including airlines and those who use its car parks.  Car ferry companies will be affected in a similar way.</P>
    <P>I note the comments of Commissioner Mario Monti which are almost theological in terms of his approach to the Single Market which we support. This proposal was predicated on the basis that there would be tax harmonisation of duty and VAT rates but this has not happened.  His arguments are, therefore, not sustainable.  Within the European Union 140,000 jobs are directly or indirectly dependent on the continuation of duty free sales.  For peripheral locations access transport costs are linked to duty free sales revenues. Those involved in the production of duty free goods see their income under major threat. Approximately 130 million Europeans purchase such goods every year.  While Germany may be the driving force behind the Single Market, some of the ferry companies operating out of Baltic ports may become uneconomic because of the loss of duty free sales revenues.</P>
    <P>Some key committees in the European Parliament recently adopted resolutions calling on the Commission to review this proposal.  The Commission and ECOFIN have a vital role to play. The Government should engage in a diplomatic offensive and use all its charm to ensure this proposal is not implemented because of its serious implications for Aer Rianta and our car ferry companies.  We will be more exposed given our island status.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta International is one of the real success stories.  It provides as part of its core business duty free shopping facilities in Hong Kong and other diverse locations.  These must be retained. In 1994, 1999 must have seemed a long time away but the hour of reckoning is at hand.  The matter must be raised at the highest level and, if necessary, at the European Council by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I will table an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure the chief executive is a member of the board of Aer Rianta plc.  As the Minister is aware, her predecessor, Deputy Dukes, appointed Mr. Derek Keogh to whom she paid tribute to this position.  Both he and his team in Aer Rianta have been very successful.  If a chief executive is to function effectively he or she should be a member of the board.  It is impossible to run a company if one is not present when decisions are made and one does not have the same entitlements as everyone else.  No private or <Col N="906" /> publicly quoted company would operate in this way.  Given that workers are represented on the board through worker directors I support the introduction of primary legislation to ensure the chief executive is appointed to the board of Aer Rianta plc at the earliest opportunity.  Given that the chief executive is a member of the current board this would not mean that some other member would have to be shifted off it.</P>
    <P>I have discussed with Aer Rianta the terms of its capital development programme outlined in its annual report and other strategic documents.  It encompasses the provision of a new pier at Dublin Airport where there has been phenomenal growth.  Given that primary legislation is not produced every day of the week and legislation can act as an impediment there should be an enabling provision to allow the cap on borrowing of £250 million to be raised without the need for primary legislation.  Over £200 million has been invested in airport facilities, including the new terminal at Cork Airport and various facilities at Shannon Airport.  A further £200 million is to be invested over the next five years, including pier C, terminal west, Dublin Airport where the main terminal is to be extended at a cost of £60 million; a new passenger terminal at Shannon Airport and the development of freight facilities at Cork Airport. Aer Rianta also operates a hotel group and other subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the board or the executive team will act irresponsibly but if Aer Rianta is raped and pillaged by the Department of Finance for dividends and corporation profits tax the borrowing structure will change.  Unlike seaports and regional airports, Aer Rianta has not received Structural Funds and has funded all existing developments from borrowings.  This is the time to take a hard look at the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the liabilities will also be transferred.  This is normal practice.  What do these amount to?  I would like some account of the liabilities because I was at CIE yesterday and was quite shocked to discover that its fleet replacement was financed out of the cashflow of claims, which is extraordinary.  I am not saying it is wrong but it is extraordinary.  I would like to know the liabilities of Aer Rianta.  If somebody trips over a pavement at Dublin or Shannon Airport does it incur a claims liability we need to know about or are there other liabilities?  We have not had a clear financial picture of what they will be on vesting day.</P>
    <P>That takes me on to dividend policy.  We are now moving into a new structure within which the State will become a shareholder in Aer Rianta.  I note that in the case of some State companies, such as Telecom and the ESB, we are moving progressively from circumstances in which there was no dividend policy to a 10 per cent, 30 per cent, 50 per cent dividend over a set number of years.  I suppose there are other State companies, such as CIE, An Post and others where dividend dare not raise its head for different reasons.  I see some merit in endeavouring to put some shape <Col N="907" /> on these circumstances since we are in a rapidly changing era within which these public enterprises must operate.  Therefore, new management and boards should have a clear view of the requirement of the State as a shareholder.</P>
    <P>I do not note any clear policy in relation to gearing.  There are accepted norms in relation to the debt-equity ratio of companies quoted on the Stock Exchange and accepted norms for other types of small and medium enterprises.  In the case of Bord na Móna and other companies where equity has been injected, there appears to be no coherent approach to gearing which, at best, appears to be <i>ad hoc.</i> In endeavouring to pick up clues as to whether we have a transport policy at all, it appears one must revert to the 1980s when there was a green paper published but no white paper.  However, I will have other opportunities to deal with that and find any coherent thinking on an overall framework for transport policy in the context of macro economic policy and the various bottlenecks that obtain.</P>
    <P>I note that section 41 obliges Aer Rianta to do whatever the Minister or her Department tells it to do.  Circumstances may arise in which such a direction will be necessary but I do not know what the Minister has in mind in this respect. There spring to mind immediately our 12 regional airports at various stages of development and success. Is it the Minister's intention that perhaps Aer Rianta will be told to take over one or two of these?  One can imagine circumstances arising in which an Independent Deputy, someone in a pivotal position of influence, perhaps some minority party in Government, would require a major fillip for a particular constituency and poor Aer Rianta would be obliged to take over God knows what airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not any in Wexford so I am not in that invidious position.  It is opportune to review regional airports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since we have invested a lot of Structural Funds in them.  Some have developed services, through Ryanair and other smaller carriers, some are feeder services from Aer Lingus, but any such development has been very patchy. We need to focus investment on those airports which will yield a return in the future and perhaps grade or tier them.  I need to know whether it is the Minister's intention that these regional airports will come within the future remit of Aer Rianta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That takes me to the question of Baldonnel. Some people have argued that the growth of Dublin Airport has been so dynamic it simply cannot cope and that, as in the case of London, <Col N="908" /> we should develop another airport at Baldonnel. Of course, it is a military airport and the demarcation line between its military and civil usage has been clearly established, to put it at its kindest. Has the Government any proposal to develop Baldonnel or is it to be the exclusive preserve of Ministers, civil servants and the military?  What is to be its role?  In other words, what does the Minister envisage in relation to the provisions of section 41 and will Aer Rianta will be a three airport structure or more?  It would also be very helpful if the Minister would set out her policy in relation to these regional airports when replying so that we may have some clear view.</P>
    <P>Another very important question is the overall position of Shannon where there has been a change in the stopover.  For every one flight in and out of Dublin Airport there must be one flight in and out of Shannon Airport.  Within the context of the EU negotiations, bilateral negotiations between Europe and the United States and bilateral negotiations between Ireland and the United States can the Minister tell us whether it is intended to review this again?  Is it Government policy to retain the <i>status quo</i> or has it reviewed the position?  I understand that some people are lobbying for a two to one ratio.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the evolution of an open skies policy between Europe and the European Union.  These are very important questions for one of the three airports that come under the jurisdiction of Aer Rianta and should be addressed within the context of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not a policy one and can be fairly described as mechanical.  As such, I have no difficulty in supporting it.  Given that it was mooted in 1969 and only now introduced, perhaps there are some omissions warranting examination.  I refer to two EU directives.  The first refers to the obligation <i>vis-a-vis</i> handling, which also warrants examination.  This direction is now in place in relation to self-handling and other aspects.  I am not sure whether it necessitates primary legislation or can be effected by ministerial order.  Perhaps an enabling provision should be included in the Bill to meet that need.  I understand the purpose of that directive is to introduce competition, a level playing pitch, fair dealing in the case of baggage handling and so on, and to prevent airlines abusing a dominant position within an airport or a public utility applying a monopoly in some cases.</P>
    <P>An EU directive is in gestation in relation to charges at airports.  I have looked at a league table, kindly provided by Aer Rianta, showing that within the 40 European airports, we feature among the bottom four most competitive on charges, number one being the worst, which I think was Belfast City Airport.  This overall matter of charges is very important.  While the directive is only in draft form&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we discussed it last week at the Council of Transport Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="909" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is progressing.  It is a worthy directive but I am sure Aer Rianta is not ecstatic about it.  Notwithstanding that there are at present heavy discounts here and we are competitive in terms of airport charges, we need to ensure transparency, that charges are related to costs and that there is no discrimination.  These are all very important aspirations worthy of our support. When this directive is in place, perhaps the Minister would clarify whether it is her intention to put it into effect by ministerial order or primary legislation.</P>
      <P>I want to raise a number of other questions.  I understand one of the Minister's predecessors got a consultant's report into the establishment of a civil aviation authority &mdash; separate to the safety aspects of the IAA &mdash; to regulate all aspects of airline-airport charges and so on.  Will the Minister indicate if she is in favour of establishing a CAA?  Many of these functions are carried out by the Department and they exist in many other member states.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate what is intended in relation to the superannuation fund for the staff at Aer Rianta?  I understand the fund is currently combined with that of Aer Lingus but is it intended to set up a separate scheme?  I would like an assurance that there will not be any diminution of the pension and superannuation entitlements of the 2050 staff working directly in Aer Rianta and the 2700 wider staff involved.  I am not raising a particular fear in this regard.  The matter was not referred to in the Minister's contribution but was referred to in the legislation.</P>
      <P>We support the Bill which provides an opportunity to clarify a number of important areas in relation to aviation.  I note the Minister's comment that this Bill was not about privatisation.  I take a totally pragmatic attitude to this.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been enormous growth in overseas business, particularly that of Aer Rianta International which is involved in Birmingham Airport and has taken on franchise operations, consultancy contracts and so on.  My experience as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was that the future price of milk or meat would be sustained by the profits of these food companies abroad.  In many cases organisations such as CRH, the banks, Telecom and the ESB cannot grow their Irish market share which is at 100 per cent.  When companies like ESAT and various EU directives come into place there is only one way that market share can go, and that is down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must support these public enterprises and allow them grow, even if that means they will have to develop more skills as the shareholder.  I am in favour of allowing the ESB use its skills abroad.  I have no problem with Aer Rianta getting involved in a major joint venture deal abroad <Col N="910" /> involving such cross shareholding and an ESSOP deal to give the workers share entitlements.  This is a modern reality of the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>I see this legislation as facilitating a less strict Civil Service approach where ministerial sanction must be given for A, B and C and allowing the dynamism and success of our corporate semi-State companies to grow and flourish.  While I am spokesperson for my party, the Minister will have every encouragement for the dynamic development of our semi-State companies at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to everybody involved in the Aer Rianta success story and assure them that my contribution is towards enhancing that future development.  I do not want to see anything, be it a raid in the form of taxation or rates, a change in dividend policy, a pricing of the assets on the date of transfer, a cap on borrowings or the removal from the board of the chief executive, that will inhibit the future growth of the Aer Rianta success story.  I will support the Minister on the duty free argument but if she does not deliver I will be the first to consult her further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who was involved in the drafting and examination of the Bill in my previous incarnation in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, I welcome the Bill but I would not like to see it being pursued with undue haste.  Given that the gestation period of this Bill has been 28 years, we should take time to ensure that we do the job properly.</P>
      <P>In the short period since the Minister came into office, it would seem she has caved in to the Department of Finance on a number of aspects of the Bill and what appear to be small but significant changes were made to it in that period.  The Bill will establish Aer Rianta as a normal commercial State body.  That is to be welcomed.  The Bill will give a legislative framework to what is currently a <i>de facto</i> situation in Aer Rianta, but it contains a number of serious flaws.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is a highly successful State company at home and abroad.  It could be described as the jewel in the crown of the commercial State enterprises.  I join the Minister and the other spokespersons in complimenting both the staff and the management in Aer Rianta.  I cannot remember an industrial dispute at Aer Rianta and that is a tribute to the staff and the management in the way they carry on their affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta was incorporated in 1937 as the holding company for the Irish national airlines. It was separated from Aer Lingus in 1966 taking responsibility for the operation and management of Dublin Airport &mdash; Cork and Shannon Airports were added in 1969.  Since 1969 Aer Rianta has contributed £207 million to the Exchequer, £136 million since 1987.  Up to 1986 the Exchequer funded capital investment to the tune of £57 million <Col N="911" /> at the three airports.  Since 1987 all capital expenditure has been funded directly by Aer Rianta with a total of £224 million.  These figures are a tribute to the management and the staff of Aer Rianta.  Over the next five years further capital expenditure of £230 million will be invested in airport facilities at Dublin, Shannon and Cork from their own resources.  Passenger traffic in 1996 was 11.9 million.  Passenger numbers have doubled in recent years but the staff numbers in Aer Rianta have remained the same.  The productivity level from the existing staff has also doubled.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta International, which is highly successful, operates airport management and duty free shops abroad as well as the management of some airports.  Aer Rianta is now operating in 14 countries outside Ireland including a 40 per cent stake in Birmingham International Airport.  The successful operation and management of our airports has meant that airport charges have not increased since 1987 and in some instances have been reduced.  The successful operation of Aer Rianta has also seen profits rise to £42 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the duty free issue which was referred to at some length by the Minister.  Aer Rianta developed the whole concept of duty free and has made it a huge commercial success.  It exported the idea abroad and it is now an internationally popular facility available at airports throughout the world.  Over half of Aer Rianta's £42 million profits comes from the duty free operation which amounted to £26 million in 1996. Because of the success of the duty free operation we have one of the lowest systems of airport charges in Europe, additional customers have been attracted and there has been an increase in the number of jobs in manufacturing, sales and tourism.</P>
    <P>Why would we agree to give all that away?  At the ECOFIN meeting in 1992, the then Minister, Deputy Bertie Ahern, voted for the abolition of duty free.  That decision amazes me.  He was aware of the consequences of that decision for jobs, commerce, tourism, the ferry companies, Ryanair, Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  That decision has been described by the Minister as having serious effects.  Even though he was aware of all these consequences the then Minister voted for the proposal to abolish duty free.  He knew at the meeting that he could not be outvoted as a unanimous decision was required.  He had a veto but by failing to use it he voted for the abolition of duty free.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been given the near impossible task of recovering that position.  I have no doubt about her concern and enthusiasm and the genuine nature of the campaign she has mounted and I assure her of my full and absolute support.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he voted away the duty free industry.</P>

The Minister has the difficult job of getting us out of this mess and while I will support her in every way I can we should not underestimate the difficulties in doing this.  We require unanimous agreement to force the Commission to re-examine this matter. It will be very difficult to reach unanimous agreement and Aer Rianta must be ready to deal with the reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party fully supports public enterprise and wants to see it developed and expanded.  We do not want to do this in a straitjacket system of State ownership or State dictation to companies.  Rather companies should have freedom, as decided by the Dail, to operate in a commercial sense.  The Dáil represents the owners of these companies and this is where decisions should be made on the degree of freedom companies should have.  Companies should have a very large measure of commercial freedom and I would be supportive of joint ventures or partnerships, as required, while retaining the core business within public ownership.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria we should use in determining this is the level of service provided by companies to the public and customers and the best mechanism for providing it.  This is the type of criteria which should be used rather than any ideological criteria.  If the formalities and format are to be changed it is a matter for this House and no one else.  Any legislation which gives power to a future Minister to make that decision will go too far.</P>
      <P>I do not have full confidence in her party but I have full confidence in the Minister on this issue. I have regularly heard her speak on the issue of public enterprise and I have full confidence in her support for this area.  Fianna Fáil has traditionally paid lip service to the commercial public sector.  I am sure the Minister will disagree but the real agenda seems to be to prepare this sector for sale. We have already seen this happen to various public enterprises.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party, which has probably more authority in Government than its numbers indicate, has an ideological hatred of anything public, co-operative or community.  It is almost a mirror image of the shadow of Maggie Thatcher in that it regards the words &ldquo;community&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; as a sin and the idea of public enterprise as a mortal sin which should be confessed not to the local parish priest but to a bishop.</P>

      <P>The Bill is typical of the old Fianna Fáil <i>modus operandi</i>, what you see is not what you get.  The Minister praised the public sector but sections of the Bill will allow it to be set up for the slaughter.  I will deal with this point in more detail later.</P>
      <P>The Bill will enable the Minister, or more likely her successor, to sell the company without further reference to the Dáil.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Minister from disposing of his or her shares.  Under the Bill all the rights of a shareholder are transferred to the Minister without the strictures contained in similar legislation.  Equally there is no core activity of the company or any restrictions on the sale of assets by the company. This means that Aer Rianta could sell the airports; there is nothing in the legislation to prevent it from doing this.  The Minister's consent is not even required for a subsidiary set up for Cork Airport to sell the airport.  It could flog the airport without the Minister's consent.  This is a colossal change from the legislation dealing with other commercial public bodies.  There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the sale or alienation of shares by the main company.  The Minister has full shareholder rights and does not have to refer to the Dáil in future.  The Minister is not seeking this power but it is contained in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Despite the Worker Participation Act, 1997, there is no reference to worker directors in the Schedule.  The issue of worker directors is watered down.  The Bill prepared by the previous Government contained an excellent section on this matter.  Perhaps the advice was that it was a duplication of the 1977 Act, but it fortified the Bill and indicated clearly our intention to ensure workers were properly represented on the board of the company.  There is no provision for worker directors on the boards of subsidiaries, and that is a major flaw.  Perhaps the Minister will address that matter.  Why have those provisions been excluded?  Does it demonstrate the real agenda of the Government or does it demonstrate the real agenda of the permanent government?  I do not wish to attack public servants, but there is an agenda in the Department of Finance to privatise the commercial public sector. I am aware the Minister is experienced and well able to deal with these matters, but I warn her to be aware of sections being slipped into Bills to facilitate that in future.  Otherwise, why are the detailed provisions on worker directors, which we had included in the Bill, withdrawn? The Minister can send a clear signal to the workers on how they are perceived by the Government by ensuring clarity on the worker directors' position on the main board and the boards of subsidiaries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates referred to the provision that on the handing over of the assets from the Minister to the company a charge would be imposed on the company.  Section 14(5), which deals with that matter, is extraordinary.  The Minister will own the whole company, including the assets.  It is proposed to transfer the assets to Aer Rianta, and the Minister will be the sole shareholder.  Under section 14(5) the Department of Finance will be allowed to do a smash and grab raid on Aer Rianta, grabbing £12 million, £15 million or £20 million for the notional value of the assets to be transferred.  There is not a whit of justification for that.  The company will pay corporation tax, rates and dividends as available.</P>
      <P>With 1999 looming and the Taoiseach's decision hanging over the company's head, it will be raided for an extra £15 million to £20 million. The Department of Finance should not be let away with that.  We did not let it away with it when we were drawing up our Bill.  If the Minister tells the Department she will not agree to it, there is nothing the Department can do, and Aer Rianta will continue as it did for the past 28 years. The Minister has power to prevent the Department from getting the money.  This smash and grab by the Department of Finance is extraordinary and unacceptable and I ask the Minister not to surrender to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline briefly the important changes made from the original draft of the Bill.  Under section 7 the provision that a confiscation order shall not have effect until after an appeal has been deleted.  Under section 10 the provision that the Minister shall certify the value of the company's property for the purpose of share issue has been deleted.  Under section 10 also the provision <Col N="916" /> relating to the issue of one share for the Minister for Public Enterprise has been deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, very detailed heads of the Bill. Under section 13 the provision for guarantee of the company's debts has been deleted.  Under section 18 there is a new paragraph for the purposes for which land may be acquired, and that is welcome.  Under section 21 the general power for Aer Rianta to construct roads, approaches, bridges and tunnels has been deleted.  That section is now very narrow.  Under section 22 the provision defining a director as including the chairperson has been deleted.  Under section 24 the provision that the Minister may stipulate financial targets and set the amount of dividends has been deleted.  Under section 29 the provision that the chief executive shall be a director has been deleted.  I will support Deputy Yates' amendment in that regard.  If the Minister looks at the files she will see why that provision was included and will agree to the inclusion of the chief executive on the board.</P>
      <P>Under section 10 the detailed provision dealing with worker directors has been deleted.  Under section 30 the provision for annual reports of the company as opposed to the chairperson has been deleted.  The section 30 requirement that the auditor be approved by the Minister has been deleted.  Most of section 32 is new and deals with superannuation schemes.  Under the sections dealing with the disclosure of confidential information to staff, it is provided that a breach of these sections is an offence, with no regard to the Freedom of Information Act.  Under section 41(1)(b) the term &ldquo;national interests&rdquo; has been replaced by &ldquo;interests of the State&rdquo;.  That is a most unjustifiable change.</P>
      <P>Under section 42 the provision relating to by-laws for private airports is new.  The Minister may make by-laws in regard to private airports.  Under section 47 the provision restricting the use of land in the vicinity of the airport has been deleted, which is amazing.  Under section 50(1) the provision prohibiting nuclear materials, which was recently debated inside and outside the House, has been deleted.  The Schedule dealing with the election of worker directors has been deleted.</P>

      <P>I have not dealt with all the changes made.  I would nearly compliment the Minister on the number of changes made in a short time, but many of them are dictated by the Department of Finance which has its own agenda.  The Bill has been fundamentally changed.  Most changes are because of the actions of the Department of Finance, the fact that the Minister did not have enough time to resist it and the pressure the <Col N="917" /> Government would naturally be under coming into power to introduce legislation.  I appreciate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill fulfils the agenda of the Department of Finance to tidy up and sell off.  I ask the Minister not to allow herself be clawed into that.  The Bill as it stands is a charter for privatisation. I want the Minister to change that because I do not think it is necessarily her agenda.  I will table amendments on Committee Stage which will do the following: remove the power of the Minister to privatise the company, core activities or core subsidiaries of the company; require the company to carry out core activity and retain assets for that purpose; clarify the position on worker-directors and their place on subsidiaries; allow for worker shareholding; prevent the Department of Finance raiding the finances of Aer Rianta on handover; ensure the terms of the Freedom of Information Act apply to employees and others; and delete a reference in a Schedule to an Act already repealed by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of this Bill.  It is not an earth-shattering matter.  If it were never introduced, Aer Rianta would continue being as successful as it is now.  However, it does tidy up the matter and 28 years is a long time to wait for it to happen.  We have all been involved in that delay and two of us here are involved in bringing the Bill to fruition.  I compliment the staff who worked on this under a number of different Ministers who regrettably failed to introduce the Bill and I compliment the Minister, therefore, on having introduced it.  There are flaws in the Bill and dangers for the future of Aer Rianta, its shareholder and its customers.  I ask the Minister to examine the points I raise.  I see this Bill as a charter for privatisation and I do not think that is the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on presenting the Bill today and the way she made it easy to understand, which was useful for me as a new Deputy.  Deputy Yates and I are of like mind on Aer Rianta.  On Second Stage, there are arguments and counter-arguments which will be taken in the form of amendments at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an effort by the Minister to further remove the operation of Aer Rianta from State control by transferring its assets, liabilities, obligations and duties to a normal commercial State body.  This is done with the intention of setting up a company which will be self-sufficient, self-supporting <Col N="918" /> and a contributor to the State's coffers by way of dividend.  It is good legislation which I wholeheartedly support.  The company will be master of its destiny but will also be under the direct control of the State, should that control need to be exercised.  I am pleased the Minister has retained a degree of control of the affairs of the company, that she is the final arbiter of important issues, such as disposal and acquisition of lands, and is the 100 per cent shareholder of the company.</P>
    <P>A concern for us who represent the areas in which the regional airports are located will be to ensure Aer Rianta promotes the use of and activities of the regional airports.  Heretofore, services in Cork have traditionally lagged behind those provided in Dublin, both in the quality and cost of the service.  It is well known that the cost of getting to London or to any European city from Cork is far in excess of making the same journey from Dublin.  The cost of the fare from Cork to</P>
    <P>Dublin is also excessive.  These are matters I would like to see addressed by the new company. However, I compliment Aer Rianta on the improvements over the years in the services provided at the much improved Cork Airport facility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the nicest airport in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I hope the new company will continue to improve standards, service and cost efficiency.  It is gratifying to see that from the vesting day the property will cease to be exempt from local authority rates and will bear its fair share by contributing funds to Cork County Council in no small measure.  I hope such increased costs will not be passed on to the travelling public and other users of the airport facility as an easy option.  I would like to see an amendment to the Bill ensuring the company is a net contributor to the State by way of dividend and that, as it becomes self-sufficient, it will in future repay to the State the cost of the facilities now being handed over to it.  I do not wish to see this commercial State body relying on subvention, grants or State aid for survival.</P>
      <P>That said, we should have no fears of the commercial transformation of Aer Rianta.  Its management and staff at both national and regional level have shown in the past the initiative to encourage us in relation to the future.  We should not forget that the Shannon duty free zone and shops have been a model for others in the world. Aer Rianta's expertise has been called on to advise in the transformation of travel shops worldwide, from the emerging Third World nations to the eastern bloc countries and the duty free management of the Channel Tunnel.  Aer Rianta is a model of a company which needs to be allowed more freedom.  We should not forget that many of the top management of hotels in this country and worldwide have been trained in the Aer Rianta-operated Shannon hotel management school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> There are still aspects of the travel industry which frustrate the development of inward tourism, business and even holiday travel.  A new style Aer Rianta must lead the way in encouraging more competitive air fares and, as one based outside Dublin, fairer fares.  Why should Dublin have the pick of the services and fares?  Why should a business person travelling from Cork, Shannon, Knock or even Farranfore be penalised for living outside the capital?  Why should almost all continental links be directed through Dublin, which has already benefited from creaming off much of the Shannon transatlantic business?  If Aer Rianta is to be a commercially-driven operation, it must also be seen to ensure that, wherever we live, we are offered equal rights in air travel.</P>
    <P>I am confident Aer Rianta will be a success.  I look forward to the growth of Cork Airport, the development of related business in the immediate area and investment in projects which will not alone create jobs in the area but generate the business which will keep the airport successful, as it is under the excellent management team and staff based there.  I want us to learn from others. Airlines are offering special deals out of this country to airports near London, Brussels, Paris, New York and better fares to smaller airports less central to the major city.  Is it not ironic that, if one wants to fly into or out of Cork rather than Dublin, one pays more?</P>
    <P>We must support a campaign to retain duty free.  It is the core of Aer Rianta income and will be crucial as the support funding for a new style organisation based on this legislation.  We should be excited about the development for we are in a booming economy in a country which is seen as a model environmental and investment nation.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs can administer all of the functions which arise in this area without the assignment of a Minister of State for Family Affairs.  The Minister enjoys the co-operation and support of the entire Government team in his work.  As I explained in this House on the appointment of the Government on 26 June, the change in ministerial and departmental titles to Social, Community and Family Affairs reflects the fact that social inclusion means more than just income support, vital though that may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> The family unit is the foundation of social cohesion and needs to be supported at a policy level.  The implications of decisions for the family need to be taken into account at the Cabinet table.  This perception of the fundamental importance of the family underlies the assignment of the functions to the Minister for his attention.</P>

      <P>We said we would look at the policy options of making sure that family matters were dealt with properly.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just stated that rather than having a Minister of State, I moved a step further to ensure that a Minister was responsible for these issues.  The Commission on the Family will soon issue its report with all its implications and recommendations.  It would be inappropriate for these issues not to be handled by a Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that, in the same manifesto, there was already a commitment to broaden the function and role of the Department?  There was a commitment to change the title and yet, despite there being two Ministers of State attached to four other Departments, the Taoiseach found it advisable to break a clear and specific promise and to withdraw the Minister of State from this Department.  Does it not debase politics when clear and specific promises are broken with such impunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, the research documents which Fianna Fáil prepared in Opposition clearly showed that the issue of the family should receive more attention.  Through the Commission on the Family, with which Deputy De Rossa as Minister was involved, there is a mechanism to ensure that family matters are dealt with at ministerial level.  It seems the Deputy is opposed to family affairs being the responsibility of a Minister.  I find that extraordinary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not only involved in the Commission on the Family, I established it. Does the Taoiseach not accept this is a broken promise?  A Minister of State for Family Affairs was promised yet has not been appointed.  The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has precisely the same responsibilities as the former Department of Social Welfare, all we <Col N="921" /> have is a change of title.  That is the only measure the Taoiseach has taken on family affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in stating the Department has the same responsibilities. The responsibilities for marriage counselling and other related areas, formerly handled by the Department of Equality and Law Reform, are now with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs.  That is as it should be.</P>
      <P>I am happy to correct my earlier statement, Deputy De Rossa established the Commission on the Family.  However, the commission's terms of reference and the work in which the Deputy was engaged shows the appropriateness of having responsibility for family affairs within the remit of the Minister.  I have been anxious to move away from the position in which there are Ministers of State across half a dozen Departments. That only worked in some cases.  Deputies are aware provision was made to move away from this situation in the Public Service Management Bill which came into effect on 1 September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has traditionally had the role of providing financial support for families and has done an exceptionally good job over many administrations. To suggest the transfer of marriage counselling to the Department encompasses the responsibility for family affairs is a misrepresentation of the situation.  Other Departments have huge responsibilities in relation to children, housing and so on.  Virtually every Department has a responsibility for family affairs and a Minister of State for Family Affairs could cross each Department and draw policy together, particularly as we are soon to have the Report of the Commission on the Family.  Without doubt, that report will include recommendations which will require drawing together policy across Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  The Minister has full responsibility for family policy.  I have quoted only one aspect of this, but all issues relating to marriages, registration, counselling and so on, previously handled by the Department of Equality and Law Reform, are now the responsibility of Deputy Ahern.  The recommendations in the commission's report will stress new reporting relationships for officials in various Departments to be co-ordinated by the Minister and he will have the functional responsibility of dealing with that.  From the earlier research carried out by Fianna Fáil, it was seen as desirable to have a Minister of State dealing with some of these issues.  However, the consequences and implementation of the report will require a Minister at the Cabinet table who is able to present the recommendations and fight for their implementation with the Department of Finance and other Departments as well as co-ordinating housing, health, education and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting the Taoiseach's view that responsibility across Departments sometimes works and sometimes does not, will he accept that in the context of children it is very difficult to compartmentalise responsibility within one Department?  Does he accept that in a situation where child abuse is increasing &mdash; perhaps he listened to the news today when the details of one horrific case now in court was discussed &mdash; there is serious concern about the manner in which the Government has gone back on its commitments? Today the Government has gone back on a commitment relating to family affairs.  Last week it did the same in relation to mandatory reporting.  There is now to be another broken pledge in relation to an ombudsman for children. Will the Taoiseach accept that this is unfortunate given the present circumstances?  Before the Fianna Fáil commitment to an ombudsman for children is finally broken, will he raise the issue with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State to ensure that there is more than symbolic protection and fostering of children's interests and that the Fianna Fáil commitment is honoured?</P>

      <P>The explanation given by the Taoiseach is spurious.  He knows that whether there is one or two Ministers of State, it is not them but the Minister who represents the Department in the Cabinet.  Instead of an advance being <Col N="923" /> made, things are going backwards.  Prior to the election there was a Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and a Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, in that Department.  There was a promise to have a greater focus on the family by means of changing the name of the Department, broadening its remit and appointing a Minister of State with special responsibility for family affairs.  This change is entirely cosmetic and the fact that it is accompanied by a reduction in ministerial representation means it is a backward rather than a forward step.

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government established a Cabinet Drugs Committee in October 1996 arising from a report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.  The purpose of the Cabinet committee was to give overall political leadership in the fight against drugs; to review all trends in the drugs problem; to assess progress in the strategy in dealing with both the supply and demand aspects and to resolve any policy or organisational difficulties which may have inhibited an effective response to the problem.  The committee was chaired by the former Taoiseach and comprised the Ministers for Health, Justice, Environment, Education and the Deputy himself as Minister of State to Government.</P>
      <P>When the present Government came into office, and recognising the links between social exclusion, drug abuse and alienation, the Taoiseach decided that the most strategic way to tackle the problem of social exclusion was to reconstitute the drugs committee into a wider Cabinet committee which would address disadvantage in the broadest sense.  The particular elements which were closely linked were the work being done under the Local Development Operational Programme, the National Anti-poverty Strategy and the National Drugs Strategy. Therefore, to deal with all these factors in a more comprehensive way and as part of our strategy of crime prevention, the Government decided in July to establish a Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs, including Local Development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The committee will deal with all the elements of the problem in a holistic manner and will build on and advance the good work of the former Cabinet Drugs Committee.  With enhanced representation at ministerial level it will be possible to focus action across all relevant Government Departments, agencies and programmes.</P>
    <P>The committee comprises the Taoiseach, as chairperson; the Tánaiste; the Minister for Finance; the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs; the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation; the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Education and Science and, of course, myself.</P>

While considering the broader issues, will the Minister of State and his colleagues take immediate action to appoint more councillors, outreach workers and liaison personnel between health boards and the community so that the Eastern Health Board's target of eliminating waiting lists by the end of this year can become a reality?

Has anybody asked the corporate sector about their contribution?  It was also intended the fund would include moneys equivalent to those seized from the drug barons by the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I understand it is not feasible to allocate moneys directly seized from them.  Does the £20 million fund exist, are <Col N="929" /> moneys being leveraged against the corporate sector and does the commitment of the previous Government to allocate moneys from the Criminal Assets Bureau towards this fund still stand?

      <Quest>his views on the fact that self-employed contributors to the social insurance fund currently attaining the age of 66 years are denied contributory old age pension; and whether he will introduce pro rata pensions for those who are unable to make the necessary ten years of contributions from the introduction of the scheme prior to reaching pension age.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to all insured people.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension. They may be covered for widow's, widower's and orphan's pensions subject to satisfying the normal qualifying criteria.  However, self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56, could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than <Col N="931" /> ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  In this year's Social Welfare Act provision was made that self-employed contributors who entered insurance in 1988, but were already over the age of 56 at that time and who had previously paid social insurance contributions as an employee would now be able to receive a refund of the pensions element of their self-employed social insurance provided that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  Heretofore, their earlier contributions precluded them from receiving such a refund.</P>
    <P>In 1989 it was estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988, would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned. The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance this was estimated at 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period.  A review of these figures indicated that the estimated cost is now £500 million, based on numbers of some 20,000 people qualifying.</P>
    <P>Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.  The cost of providing partial pensions would also be very high.  I have arranged for these costings to be reviewed in greater detail by consultants in the context of the Actuarial Review of Social Welfare Pensions which I launched recently.</P>
    <P>I recently announced the introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> pensions so that, in future, people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. From November of this year a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will give a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between ten and 14 will give a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>While we will continue to ensure the broadest possible contributory pension cover to as many categories as possible, I regard the principle of a reasonable record of contributions as essential. As any proposals would have a major cost implication they would fall to be considered in a budgetary context.  Any person resident in the State can, of course, apply for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

To date in my tenure I have had a number of meetings with interested groups and with a number of Deputies on all sides of the House who have made this valid point but, as has been the case in previous Administrations, the figures as presented are astronomical.

      <P>Some progress has been made if the Minister accepts there is an anomaly to which we should try to find a solution.  On the question of the cost involved, is there not a De Rossa precedent for a <i>pro rata</i> pension where people with a previous employment record can come in?  Will the Minister accept that many of those who fall into this category will qualify for a non-contributory pension and that we are only talking about those who do not qualify for that type of pension?  Will he accept the figure of £750 million quoted by the then Minister when the Bill was introduced and to which I, as the then Opposition spokesperson, tabled an amendment on this issue, has been slashed to £500 million?  Will he show goodwill by agreeing to pay <i>pro rata</i> pensions to those who are caught by this anomaly if some reasonable way can be found to do so?</P>

      <P>I could not commit myself in advance of considering the broad issue of the alternatives.  <i>Pro rata</i> pensions is one of them, but despite the fact that the figures may have come down and have probably come down further since the figure of £500 million was arrived at, if we were to allow this to happen ultimately it might benefit many more people than those envisaged in the figures the Department have given.  The estimate is in the region of 20,000, but it is possible that many others, who might not have indicated their interest in this type of pension, might come forward which would put the figure way in excess of 20,000 and increase the overall cost of the scheme over a lengthy period.  People are suffering because of this anomaly.  It has been an ongoing problem since the scheme was introduced <Col N="933" /> and I am attending to it.  I will endeavour to make an amendment within budget parameters but that may not be possible.</P>

      <P>The main finding of the study is that there is a significant reward for unemployed people when they move into paid employment, while it also draws attention to the fact that the complexity of the tax and social welfare systems means that it can be difficult for unemployed people to assess accurately the value of returning to work.</P>
      <P>The main finding of the study is valid and substantial progress has been made in making the social welfare system more employment friendly and in dealing with disincentives to employment. The introduction in recent years of substantial PRSI free allowances; the continued enhancement of the family income supplement scheme; the reform of unemployment assistance to make it more attractive for recipients to avail of part-time or casual work opportunities; the continued development of the back-to-work allowance scheme; and the substantial improvements in child benefit which tackles child poverty without creating employment disincentive effects, can be cited as clear examples of the progress made to date in providing real opportunities and incentives to the unemployed, and particularly the long-term unemployed, to make the transition from unemployment into the active labour force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the difficulties faced by unemployed people in assessing accurately the value of returning to work, my Department is continually seeking to reinforce the message that it pays to work.  In this context, my Department joined the INOU, the Small Firms Associations and the National Social Service Board earlier this year to produce practical information booklets for the unemployed and for employers.  These publications have been made widely available and outline the range of supports for employers who are <Col N="934" /> considering taking on new employees and for the unemployed who are seeking to make the transition from unemployment to employment.</P>
    <P>Among the recommendations contained in the INOU study is that the family income supplement scheme should be calculated on the basis of net income rather than gross income as at present.  The Deputy will be aware that a commitment to this effect is contained in the Partnership 2000 agreement and I share the view expressed in the study that this measure will make the scheme easier for people to understand as well as increasing the value of the scheme to low income families.</P>
    <P>Our Programme for Government is designed to ensure that we develop an inclusive society where everyone is given the opportunity and the incentive to participate in the workforce and to share in the benefits of our economic growth.  It is my intention to give effect to that commitment through the continued development and enhancement of the social welfare system.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my constituency colleague on his appointment as Minister.  Having shadowed a number of Ministers over the years, I look forward to doing the same with this Minister.</P>
      <P>I am glad he has accepted the main thrust of the report as valid.  I assume what he means by that is that he, the Department and the Government accept that people are not better off on the dole.  I hear this statement made constantly and any of those involved in trade unions do not accept it.  The covering letter from the INOU clearly outlines the complexities the unemployed face in dealing with different agencies &mdash; up to five in some cases &mdash; before their situations can be assessed.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that people are not better off on the dole?  What positive steps does the Department intend to take to co-ordinate local activity between FÁS and employment exchanges and to provide information to aid the long-term unemployed in returning to work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague for his kind words on my appointment.  It is a fallacy to say any public representative knows people who would rather stay at home and claim dole payments than go to work.  I do not accept those anecdotes.  Most of us know people who want to work.</P>
      <P>I have high regard for the INOU which I have found to be an extremely responsible organisation in my dealings with it.  It has been complimentary to the Department which is a testimony to the work done by my predecessors and staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key issues regarding whether people are better off on the dole than working is the dissemination of information.  Over the years my Department has built up its contacts with groups such as the INOU to ensure the proper information is made available.  The Department funds a number of groups, including the INOU, to assist <Col N="935" /> them in the dissemination of information to the people they represent and this should be encouraged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree the main disincentives for the long-term unemployed returning to the workplace are the low level of gross pay and the high level of taxation?  Does the Minister support the implementation of a national minimum wage which would be a good incentive for the long-term unemployed to return to work, particularly to employment currently paying ridiculously low wages.  These employers are not answerable to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some validity in what the Deputy said.  Unfortunately there are employers who do not pay a reasonable wage. Most political parties, including my own, have committed themselves to investigating the provision of a minimum wage.  A working group has been set up to investigate the area of basic income.</P>
      <P>The connection between the local employment offices and FÁS needs to be addressed and is one of the issues which both I and my counterpart in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Tánaiste, have already discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  In the past, the problem was a lack of co-ordination between the two Departments namely, the Department of Labour &mdash; which was virtually eliminated as a separate Department &mdash; and the Department of Social Welfare.  These two Departments operated under two separate Ministers, in two separate directions and with very little co-ordination between them.</P>
      <P>People contact my constituency office to complain that they cannot get a carpenter, a plumber, an electrician or whatever.  At the same time, a sizeable number of people with such skills actually sign on for unemployment benefit.  Will the Minister consider making available a list of people who are unemployed, especially those with certain skills or crafts, through FÁS and the social welfare system?  That would allow people seeking to secure the services of unemployed people access to some form of list system which would be preferable to spending huge amounts of money on advertisements urging unemployed people to take up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are job facilitators in my Department who endeavour to assist people looking for employment. Ultimately, however, the responsibility lies with FÁS to do this.  The fact that unemployment levels are still relatively high given the state of the economy is a key issue which must be addressed.  Yet, we still hear the anecdotal evidence to which Deputy Bell referred where people are experiencing difficulty in getting people to work for them.  That is an issue this <Col N="936" /> Government will address seriously; we will ensure co-ordination between Government Departments. That is why the Tánaiste and I have had discussions over the past weeks and, hopefully, we will bring forward proposals to address any logjams there may be on this issue in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>Proposals were made in the past in relation to one-stop-shops which would house all job facilitation advice under one roof in local areas.  That was a good idea and one which should be looked at again.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether the fall in the live register figure of over 26,000 in July 1997 was mainly attributable to the impact of the anti-fraud campaign introduced in 1996; and the further measures, if any, he proposes in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16561/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The decrease in the live register in the 12 months up to the end of September 1997 was over 29,000.  The drop in the month of September alone of over 9,000 is the highest September drop on record.  It is also significant that it was the first time since 1990 in which the live register for the month of September was below 250,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increased employment arising from the improvement in economic activity, the programme of measures to combat abuse of unemployment schemes, which has been in place since the end of 1996, is undoubtedly a major contributing factor to the fall in the numbers of unemployed.  Features of this programme include the more effective application of the conditionality requirements for entitlement to unemployment payments, more targeted reviews of the entitlements of claimants on the live register, better co-operation and exchange of information between FÁS and the Department in directing unemployed people to available opportunities and greater publicity in relation to fraud and to the opportunities available to unemployed people.  Better co-ordination of control activity at local level through the local area control teams has also contributed to the development of a more effective control programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effectiveness of the control programme can be further improved in this connection and I will be giving particular attention to the following areas: specific measures to identify more accurately the extent of fraud and abuse and the areas in which it is most prevalent; modernising our systems, using information technology to enable payments to be made more efficiently and to provide more effective control and cross checking systems.  Tighter systems provide the most effective controls; ensuring that procedures at all stages of the claiming process are such as to minimise the potential for fraudulent claiming.  In this connection a major review of these procedures <Col N="937" /> has been undertaken and I am making arrangements for an independent assessment of the effectiveness of current arrangements; maintaining adequate and systematic review and investigative systems to detect fraud where it occurs, giving particular attention to areas of greatest risk.  A number of specific control exercises are being put in place at present; applying the full rigours of the law where fraud is detected, including prosecution and effective arrangements for recovering amounts wrongly claimed; measures to assist people wishing to make the transition from unemployment and potential fraudulent claiming to legitimate activity through using the various employment support schemes which are now available.</P>
    <P>I intend to put an increased emphasis on the positive measures to encourage and support people moving from unemployment to employment. While there are a number of very good initiatives in this area the areas of training, retraining and educational opportunities merit more attention if we are to provide the unemployed &mdash; especially the long-term unemployed &mdash; with the necessary skills and ability which are essential for the current labour market.  I will explore this matter further in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The team of job facilitators in my Department will have a major role to play in this.  Their task is to ensure that the unemployed and employers are fully aware, at local level, of the Department's wide range of pro-employment, educational and training programmes.  They also have a significant part to play in assessing the needs of the unemployed, supporting them in seeking job opportunities, informing and directing them towards the wide range of initiatives and options provided by various Government Departments, agencies, voluntary bodies and community groups.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged that the trend in the live register continues to be downward and I assure the Deputy that everything possible will continue to be done by my Department, by way of initiatives both to combat abuse and help unemployed people get back to work, to ensure that this trend continues.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that the Minister agrees with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he attributed the drop in the live register figures to the impact of the measures introduced by the previous Government last year?  Does the Minister recognise there may be a problem in relation to the control officers who have been appointed, some of whom have, apparently, been grounded due to inadequate resources and prevented from following up trails they believe would lead to the discovery of further fraud?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General was dealing with a particular period in that report.  His comments on the Department were, by and large, quite helpful.  With a budget somewhere in the region of £4.7 billion the figures in relation to overpayments and the clawback of same, while a big sum, must be seen in comparison with the overall budget.  It is a figure which must be looked at in future.</P>
      <P>One of the first issues I addressed as Minister was whether sufficient funds were made available in last year's Estimate to ensure that people involved in control throughout the country had sufficient resources to allow them to do their work.  I asked the Department to redirect its efforts from one area into another to ensure the correct approach was being taken in relation to fraud.  I am actively looking at that issue on an ongoing basis.  Such redirection can be defended because of the good work which has been done.</P>
      <P>All the Department's staff are obliged to ensure that taxpayers' money is disbursed a proper way and that it goes to the people it should. Unfortunately, it is a fact of life that there are people who will endeavour to defraud the system. That is why 600 out of a total employment complement of 4,200 are specifically designated in the area of control to investigate fraud.  There is an obligation on every staff member to ensure, when dealing with claimants, that the information they receive is correct.  Department officials are keenly aware of that.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether family income supplement should be payable on net income and apply also to the self-employed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The family income supplement scheme is designed to provide an incentive for <Col N="939" /> low-paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.  It is crucial that there should be a reward for working and that barriers to the transition from unemployment to employment should be removed from the social welfare system.  In this context, I fully support the commitment made in the Partnership 2000 Agreement that FIS should be reformed to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages as at present.  This reform will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme and thus act to increase the rewards from work.  As an initial step in this process, provision was made this year for FIS to be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions, levies and pension contributions paid. An increase of £10 at each point in the income thresholds governing entitlement to FIS was introduced this year, ensuring that virtually all current FIS recipients are better off by at least £6 a week.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim unemployment assistance.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the extension of FIS to self-employed people with children would cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost would be in addition to the existing expenditure involved in providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances.  In view of the very significant additional costs involved, the question of extending FIS to self-employed people would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that my two proposals on payment on net income and payment to the self-employed were approved at all-party level by the All-party Committee on the Family chaired by Deputy McGrath?  Would he also accept that the family income supplement is a vehicle which has cross-party support and should be developed?  The uptake on it is quite low, and we should make every effort to improve it to encourage more people to be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important scheme. All parties when in Government have supported and extended it as much as possible.  Paragraph 4.19 of the Partnership 2000 agreement recommends that family income supplement should be calculated on the basis of net income rather than gross as it is at present.  Small changes were made last year.  The total expenditure of FIS for 1997 is estimated to be £28.8 million.  There are approximately 12,300 families in receipt of FIS at an average <Col N="940" /> weekly payment of £39.53. Family income supplement is currently calculated on gross income and so fails to take account of the effect of taxation on that income.  This gives rise to a situation where a FIS recipient's disposable income may be reduced as a result of entering the tax net.  That is why it has been recommended by all parties that it be calculated on net income.  I accept what the Deputy said about Deputy McGrath's committee.  In my first days in office Deputy McGrath kindly gave me a copy of the report of that committee which dealt with issues like this.  I thank him for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, while in principle we would all support the idea of the assessment of FIS on the basis of net income, to implement that immediately would be extremely costly and the benefit would go to those on the higher end of the low income scale because of the manner in which tax impacts on income, particularly for single people with one child or families with a smaller number of children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the overall context of budgets, it will be extremely costly to extend the family income supplement.  The cost of assessing eligibility on net income will be about £30 million. However, it is a commitment in the Partnership 2000 agreement that the Government is bound to honour.  The family income supplement is a scheme to help people on low pay.  The more one tinkers with the threshold levels the greater possibility of coming up with a result that was not intended.  This has been looked at keenly by the Department and by the social partners who are fully behind the suggestion that eligibility should be based on net income.  I intend to honour the Partnership 2000 agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Government should not comply with that commitment, but that it reduce the cost substantially if a minimum wage were in place.  Will the Minister ensure that while FIS is being converted to being assessed on the basis of net pay a minimum wage is put in place also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Based on the figures the Minister gave, it would cost £30 million to implement this scheme for the self-employed.  Does that not indicate that the self-employed do not get wages that are high enough to keep their families and that they need this supplement to give them a living wage?  Is it not also the case that by not paying family income supplement to the self-employed the Department is, in effect, not accepting for <Col N="941" /> family income supplement purposes figures that the Revenue Commissioners accept for tax purposes? Does this not constitute a major policy difficulty? The self-employed, even if they are on low income cannot qualify for the family income supplement.  The Minister mentioned that they could get unemployment assistance, but there is a difference of about £60 a week between the threshold for FIS and the threshold for unemployment assistance, which is a colossal difference. This is a colossal sum.  The matter should be looked at urgently.</P>

      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last August 9,753 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £36.4 million.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of improvements in this payment since its introduction in 1990.  In this year's Social Welfare Act a change was introduced to the rule which required that the carer must provide full-time care and attention to cater for those situations in which recipients of care attend approved rehabilitation courses.  Under the new arrangements, the person may attend a recognised non-residential rehabilitation training or day care centre.  An additional payment of 50 per cent of the basic rate was introduced for carers who take care of more than one person.</P>
      <P>In its Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's allowance to ensure more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.  In line with these commitments, I will consider the further development of the scheme in the context of an overall review of the provisions for carers which is being carried out by my Department and in the light of budgetary considerations.</P>

A review of the carer's allowance scheme is being carried out in which the reports of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights on long-term support for female carers of older people and people with disabilities and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be taken into account.  We will be tick-tacking with the carer's association, the health boards and a number of other agencies to consider ways by which the scheme may be <Col N="943" /> extended.

All aspects of the carer's allowance will be examined in conjunction with its review and the reports made available to us.

Will he specifically examine the circumstances that arise when a widow who had been caring for her husband and in receipt of the carer's allowance prior to his death is then disqualified despite the fact that she may have to continue to care for her husband's elderly father or mother in her home, thus creating an anomaly within an otherwise good scheme?

Within the forthcoming budget will the Minister exempt at least the first £60 of income as a recognition of the valuable work undertaken by a man or woman caring for somebody in the home, bearing in mind that if the person being cared for was in a nursing home or State institution it would cost the State a massive amount?  Will the Minister take up this matter <Col N="945" /> with the Minister for Finance, ensuring at least exemption in the case of those barely above the income limit?

I have noted his comments on any extension of the existing scheme being considered within the context of the forthcoming budget on which I have differed with successive Ministers. The Minister will be aware that local authorities have withdrawn wardens from senior citizens' complexes in the Dublin region and various health boards are funding the elderly by way of nursing home subventions to the tune of £120 per week, according to each individual's level of dependence.  Rather than viewing this allowance in a blinkered fashion, surely the Minister and his colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children and the Environment and Local Government should together address the potential of elderly people to continue to enjoy their independence within their communities.  Will the Minister, with his ministerial colleagues, place a timeframe on broadening such cover, by way of the carer's allowance or otherwise?</P>

      <P>Rather than write to the Deputy, the review will consider the purpose and development of the carer's allowance scheme, the potential for its future, both in terms of its current operation and in the wider context of health care provision in the home generally.  It will also examine the potential for the development of provisions for carers through the social insurance system and the role of the private sector.  All of us who deal with elderly people living in the home will be of the view that, rather than have them continuously shunted off to nursing homes, it would be preferable if governmental policy was such that we could reach a stage at which all State efforts were geared at ensuring they could remain <Col N="946" /> in their homes.  No doubt that would be an aspiration of all Members.</P>
      <P>The review of the carer's allowance will take all aspects and circumstances into account and is being examined by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children.

Will he agree also that there is no real incentive under the home help scheme operated by the health boards, some of which pay less than £2 per hour, and that carers are limited in the number of hours they spend providing care to the elderly?  In the context of the review, will the Minister consider examining the question of carers <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Department of Health and Children?</P>

      <P>In the context of the overall budgetary situation &mdash; a phrase used consistently by the Minister this afternoon &mdash; will he agree it would be cheaper to give the carer's allowance to all the people concerned rather than provide nursing home subvention or fund State run homes?  It would be cheaper to giver the carer's allowance to these people and scrap the means test rather than fund these nursing homes.</P>

      <P>We do not have any estimate of the cost of that but I believe it would be grossly excessive and could not be countenanced.  The carer's allowance already costs a considerable amount of money.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to 30,000 people who require care but that does not include the thousands of elderly people being cared for in the home by their extended families and who might ultimately have to be cared for in a nursing home or other care institution.  That is a huge cost not only to the family involved but also to the State.</P>

      <P>In 1994 special arrangements were introduced designed to ensure that home makers do not suffer a loss of pension entitlement because of time spent full time at home looking after a child or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person.  From 6 April 1994, time spent working in the home rearing young children up to six years of age or caring for an incapacitated person is disregarded for the purpose of calculating the yearly average condition in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension. A maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Social Welfare Act provided for an increase in the age of children being cared for under this scheme from six to 12 years.  This improvement is effective from the contribution year 1995-96 onwards.  It is estimated that up to 250,000 people could qualify for disregards under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently announced the introduction of new <i>pro rata</i> pensions so that in future people who pay social insurance for a reasonable period of time will qualify for an old age contributory pension. From November of this year a yearly average of between 15 and 19 contributions will give a pension of 75 per cent of the maximum rate, while an average of between 10 and 14 will give a pension of 50 per cent of the maximum rate.  To qualify a person will also need to have a minimum of 260 paid contributions.  This measure will be of benefit to many women contributors who have gaps in their insurance due to working in the home looking after a child, or caring full time for an elderly or incapacitated person and because of this have a diluted yearly average.</P>
      <P>The payment of a pension to all women, regardless of their social insurance record, would be very costly and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The general question of pension provision, both social welfare and occupational, arises for consideration in the context of the national pensions policy initiative.  A report from the Pensions Board, including recommendations, is expected by the end of the year.</P>

The <i>pro rata</i> pensions to which he referred were introduced in the last budget by the previous Government yet the Minister is on <Col N="948" /> record as promising pensions for all women.  Evidence has been produced by the ESRI that there is a growing number of elderly single women living alone in poverty.  Will the Minister agree there is an urgent need to address the question of pensions for women, particularly women living alone, and that the current disregard scheme is completely inadequate and will not come into effect for many years?

      <P>Since the time Sean Lemass proved that rabbits would not run across the desolate runways of Shannon airport, as predicted by the then Fine Gael leadership, Fianna Fáil has shown that it can deliver.  We can be proud of our nation which was born out of the brilliance of Lemass.  What we are doing today is offering a successful State agency the freedom to go forward, to expand into new horizons and to continue its success.  We will deliver fairly to all airports and ensure competition in the air industry.  This will guarantee that the current scandal of the inordinate and totally unfair levels of fares and services out of Dublin is ended.</P>
      <P>Will Cork airport be put on an equal footing with Shannon and Dublin airports as regards marketing support for new and existing business? What will be the valuation system after the assets are transferred to Aer Rianta?  Infrastructural investment in Cork airport was minimal for many years relative to Shannon airport and many of its assets are in a very rundown condition.  These assets should be transferred to Aer Rianta at zero value.  At present, route subsidies are paid by the EU via the Government to specific routes, for example, Dublin-Kerry, Dublin-Sligo and Dublin-Donegal. Will a similar arrangement be implemented for Cork airport which badly needs investment in infrastructure to assist it in exploiting the major opportunities which growth in traffic has presented?  Passenger traffic has trebled over the past ten years and continued growth is inevitable.  Will the Government consider purchasing additional land on a once-off basis to enable Cork airport to continue developing and contributing to the region's economic success?  Cork airport will have a throughput of 1.2 million passengers this year.  At least one of Aer Rianta's directors should be from the Cork region.  The board should have equal representation from the three regions, Cork, Shannon and Dublin.</P>
      <P>On section 55, given the contribution by the then Department of Transport and Power towards the cost of providing a water supply to Cork airport in l960-1, from which the city and county benefit, a proportional rebate in rates should be agreed with the local authority.  On section 58, it is unfair to compel Aer Rianta to accept liability for personal loss or injury claims which relate to events which occurred prior to vesting day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the same criteria applied to investment in each airport?  I understand £35 million was invested in Shannon airport which is four times <Col N="951" /> the size of Cork airport and has a passenger throughput of approximately 1.3 million per annum, if one excludes the 400,000 passengers who do not leave the aircraft.  I am not opposed to investment in Shannon airport but Cork airport needs investment with similar incentives to those enjoyed by Shannon airport.  The Minister must address how European Regional Development Fund grants are allocated among the airports. Duty free profits of approximately £2.5 million account for the total Cork airport surplus annually. If this money is lost after l999 there will be no further development at the airport unless funding is raised from other sources.  Increased fares could adversely affect passenger numbers and there is, therefore, a special case to be made for retaining duty free at Cork airport, the most peripheral airport in Europe.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Bill there are a number of important points I will bring to the attention of the House.  We do not often discuss air navigation and safety and when we do the importance of air travel needs to be recognised by all Deputies.  Flying is no longer the preserve of the so-called jet set, it is now a routine method of transport for many people.  People who fly frequently and holidaymakers are particularly concerned about air safety issues, while business people are concerned about ease of access to different regions.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to terminate the present airport management arrangements under which Aer Rianta operates as an agent of the Minister and to put new arrangements in place. The Minister is also availing of the opportunity to update a number of provisions of airport related legislation, some of which dates back to l936.  Aer Rianta is being established as a semi-State body and will assume ownership of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports which up to now it has managed on behalf of the Minister.  The Minister said the current arrangement is outdated and needs to be modernised and streamlined.  I anticipate that greater cost effectiveness and the more rigorous commercial climate in Aer Rianta to which the Minister referred will result in a reduction in landing fees and a greater level of service to Cork airport.</P>
    <P>Cork airport has a throughput of approximately 1.2 million passengers per year.  However, the level of service to the airport, particularly by Aer Lingus, has not changed for several years. For example, the connections to Dublin are inadequate. There is much dissatisfaction among frequent business travellers about the 6.25 a.m. flight which does not arrive in Dublin in time to enable them make connections to most European destinations. It is unacceptable that they should have to fly via Heathrow at the peak time of 9 a.m. when there are long stacking delays over London. There is also a changeover time from terminal 1 to terminal 2 at London Heathrow of a minimum of 17 minutes.  The last flight from Heathrow to Cork leaves at 10 p.m. which means people often have to fly out via Heathrow and back via Dublin, <Col N="952" /> thus precluding them from availing of cheaper fares and often necessitating a third flight on the homeward leg of the journey.  These points are relevant to the debate in that the routing of significant volumes of Cork-continental traffic over Heathrow means a loss of landing charges at Dublin.  I hope the newly constituted Aer Rianta will be pro-active in stimulating the improvement of services at the airports under its control.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the poor connections to destinations other than Dublin and London.  I put down a marker that the people of Cork will no longer tolerate an airport which is treated as an outlying branch of the Dublin and London international hub airports.  We want direct connections beyond England.  I do not understand why more airline companies do not make use of the so-called fifth freedom rights to pick up passengers in a third country.  A little imagination might promote more air travel in Europe.  For example, Iceland Air runs flights for shoppers into Cork on certain weekends and carries tourists back.  It also runs a daily service from Reykjavik to London.  It might be possible to make a service to Paris or Brussels via Cork into a paying proposition.</P>
    <P>It is also time we promoted better domestic services. At present a tiny plane operates a direct service between Cork and Belfast.  However, many people only fly by jet.  The one domestic jet service which has the potential to beat rail and car travel in terms of time is the one from Belfast Aldergrove to Cork.  An addition to this service to the Continent would pay.  For example, a Belfast-Cork-Brussels route could pay for itself.</P>
    <P>There are frequent aircraft changes in Dublin on the so-called direct flights from Cork to Paris and Frankfurt.  This annoys passengers who believe they have chosen a direct flight and makes a farce of the claim that Cork Airport has direct connections to the Continent.</P>
    <P>Another concern is the decision by Aer Lingus to purchase a number of Airbus 321 aircraft for the Dublin-London route.  Cork is not the poor relation but an important economic region acting as a counterbalance to the Dublin metropolis and its centralising forces.  A larger aircraft should be assigned to the Cork-London Heathrow route, specifically to work the business flights in the morning and evening.  The present Boeing 737 400 aircraft on this route is filled to capacity and has limited room for the large amount of hand luggage of business passengers.  The Airbus 321 aircraft has more space and would be more comfortable for passengers.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter of deep concern to me.  I have been advised that 260 passengers were left stranded by Ryanair at Cork Airport last Sunday. They were left in limbo for up to eight hours and were not told the reason for the delay or about the flight cancellation.  The company has a duty to relieve the anxiety of passengers and advise them as quickly as possible of alternative flights or the provision of accommodation.  No one can disagree that passenger safety is paramount in air travel.  Passengers are entitled to <Col N="953" /> information regarding planned flights.  Contingency plans must be put in place by Ryanair to deal with breakdowns and delays.  Information, food and accommodation are the basic rights of air passengers.  The Minister should order an inquiry into last Sunday's incident because the tourist industry could be damaged by justifiable comments from irate passengers.  The Minister should insist that Ryanair puts in place a strict code of practice on passenger care in the event of delays.</P>
    <P>As a Cork Deputy, I cannot leave the subject of air transport without referring to the Aer Lingus Tuskar Rock disaster on 24 March 1968 when the St. Phelim mysteriously crashed into the Irish Sea with the loss of 57 passengers and four crew. People in Cork are no more satisfied with the answers given in the 1970 report than people in Derry are with the official reports of the events of 1972.  I hope, with a new British Government in office, which appears to be opening files kept shut by the Cold War mentality, the Minister will ask her British counterpart to disclose all military aircraft and missile actions in south Wales and over the Irish Sea on the day of the crash.  It is almost 30 years since that event and there are persistent suspicions of a cover-up on the cause of the crash.  Only a full disclosure of documents on the event, which should have no military sensitivity at this stage, will answer the questions about this incident.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, I look forward to a better and safer level of air transport for my region as a result of the legislation.  We should show confidence in the achievements of Aer Rianta and give it the mandate to seek new partners, investment and projects so that in years to come we will look back at this measure as a giant step forward in the ongoing success of Aer Rianta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill which addresses the establishment of Aer Rianta as a semi-State company, I wish to put on record my admiration for the exceptional contribution by the management and staff to Aer Rianta and the facilities it controls.  Aer Rianta provides excellent management of services and facilities for the air travelling public throughout its airport network. There are a number of points of concern which the Minister may wish to address.  If this is to be a strong, vibrant company ensuring a smooth flight into the next millennium, there must be a progressive view as to how it is managed and developed so that it attracts the best people and rewards them for their work and efforts.  It is reasonable that an element of the shares of the company should be set aside in the interests of the staff, providing a system of reward for their contribution over and above that covered by basic salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 gives wide power for the acquisition of lands for the protection, development and extension of the company.  While that is acceptable and reasonable, that power must not be <Col N="954" /> allowed to be used to the detriment of property owners in the area.  Aer Rianta must not be allowed now or in the years ahead to create a monopoly for itself or its ancillary businesses in the vicinity of the airport.  It would not be in the public interest for local job providers to be refused the opportunity to develop business and employment because the company may at some time wish to undertake development.  There is a great deal of property around Dublin Airport and the company has, from time to time, tried to negotiate with the people who own that land.  I would not like to see it with a monopoly on all the land around the airport because other businesses could be developed there, ensuring competition in the area.</P>
    <P>Section 21 gives wide powers to the company to impact on the local community.  Those powers, which allow for road network interference or alteration, while necessary, must be granted only to the good corporate citizen.  In the past when a new runway was constructed it required the diversion of traffic, imposing considerable extra travel on road users and involving considerable cost to the people living in areas around the airport. If it is deemed that a new road network would reduce travel distance, the local authority must make a contribution to its construction, yet when there is a cost in the long-term the people and the local authority bear the cost.</P>
    <P>As a result of the provision of a new runway, the people of St. Margaret's, County Dublin, were adversely affected by a change in flight paths.  The noise of planes penetrated houses, severely upsetting the lives of people living in the village.  It is regrettable Aer Rianta had to be forced to resolve that problem.  Aer Rianta must not only accept the principle of good corporate citizenship but put it into practice.  Residents in the Howth peninsula, Baldoyle, Sutton and other areas have complained in the strongest possible terms about the appalling nuisance and upset caused to their communities by over-flying aircraft. There seems to be a gradual change in flight paths in an easterly direction, with aircraft over-flying settled communities and built-up residential areas.  The position has deteriorated rapidly in recent years, with the creation of appalling noise and nuisance levels.  The communities affected insist the offending flights cease immediately.</P>
    <P>Duty free changes which will come into effect in 1999 will have serious consequences for the long-term cost-effectiveness of the airport operated by Aer Rianta.  The benefits derived from promoting duty free shopping at the airport include low cost charges to flight operators, a benefit which is passed on to the public by way of reduction in the cost of air fares, which is a major factor in attracting tourists here.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the United Kingdom are different from other European countries in that they are both islands.  Apart from our beautiful coasts, we have other tourist attractions, many of which are situated in the Fingal area.  There is the Howth <Col N="955" /> peninsula with its excellent walks and fishing port.  Tourists from all over the world visit that area in the summer season.  The Malahide demesne is another excellent attraction as is Newbridge House and Ardgillan House which should be a priority on any tourist agenda.  There are excellent coastal drives and rural landscapes within the Fingal area.  Aer Rianta and Fingal County Council should work together to promote this area which could attract many tourists.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a special case which the Taoiseach forgot when he had the opportunity to defend it. The removal of duty free will cost jobs in tourism, shops, restaurants, filling stations, bed and breakfasts and hotels.  It will have a major negative effect on our economy.  We must help Aer Rianta build on its success.  I welcome the fact that the Minister said there would be resistance to the EU directive from her and the Government.  I hope they are successful and that the duty free facilities our airports enjoy will not be damaged.</P>
    <P>The company must promote low service costs, generate good employment and establish first class customer facilities, and the company has to date been very good in these three areas.  The company should establish an enterprise development task force to address the job losses arising from TEAM, a company which increased co-operation between Aer Rianta management and other agencies, including Fingal County Council, the IDA, FÁS and CERT, and created real job opportunities for the community of north County Dublin.  However, the Government must set out for the board of Aer Rianta the objective of real second generation jobs.  What is used in the airport should be produced in the airport.  Management must ensure these products are made in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>Section 55 ensures local authorities will now receive the full value of the rate due on Aer Rianta properties.  It will give it much needed funding of approximately £2 million at an important stage in the development of Fingal County Council.  That is in addition to the £500,000 provided under the rates support band. I welcome this because Fingal is a new council, only three years old, trying to establish itself while giving a good service to its people.  It was a bone of contention for years that there was a marvellous facility at the airport which paid no rates, yet the council was providing and maintaining the infrastructure &mdash; the roads.  This money is welcome because the council has received much criticism in the past three years for imposing a water charge which yielded approximately £2 million per year.  If the council had had that money from Aer Rianta over the past three years, it would have been spared such criticism.</P>
    <P>Like other councils, Fingal also has a housing problem and £6 million over three years would have gone a long way to helping to relieve it.  To this end, a seat on the board of directors should be set aside for members of the local authorities in whose area these airports are located.  This <Col N="956" /> would be of great assistance in ensuring the company acted in the best interest of those with whom it interfaces.</P>
    <P>For too long, the Legislature set upper limits and defined amounts on the financial aspects of Bills rather than incorporating an inflationary factor.  This is relevant in respect of the maximum amount of fines which may be imposed.  Where the figure of £1,500 may be reasonable on summary conviction, this would be eroded over time and sooner rather than later.  Surely we have learned enough to ensure the continued relevance of these amounts to the offences they are designed to punish.  The same difficulty may arise under section 13 where the borrowing requirement is capped at £250 million.  Other speakers have mentioned this and I agree that the company directors' hands should not be tied by capping the amount of money that can be borrowed. More leeway should be given because the company is working abroad and involved in many deals which cost a large amount of money.  Finance should be made available to it when it is needed.  We are enacting this Bill to create the basis of a company which will have a real degree of independence and not one which will be at the mercy of the Minister at a time when inflation has eaten into the true value of this figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune" hpid="Ms Clune Ms Clune">
      <NameTxt>Ms Clune</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome as it establishes Aer Rianta as a normal commercial semi-State body.  It removes it from the direct control of the Minister, and the Minister's assets at the airports &mdash; Dublin, Shannon and Cork &mdash; will be transferred directly to Aer Rianta.  In future, the board of management of Aer Rianta will be responsible for the investment in and the development of Cork, Dublin and Shannon airports.</P>
      <P>As Cork is the smallest of these airports, I ask the Minister to implement special arrangements to ensure the new board will have representation from the Cork region, by ministerial nomination and at elected director level.  At present, there are two directors elected to the board and, because of the limited constituency of Cork, it has been an issue that worker-directors there could never be elected to the board.  This is an unsatisfactory situation which should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the passing of this Bill, Aer Rianta must ensure it generates enough revenue to cover costs and remunerate its capital.  The proposed abolition of duty free sales within Europe by 1999 will have a detrimental effect on the airport revenue. Duty and tax free shopping plays a major role in keeping down the cost of air travel.  Without it, airport charges could increase by 50 per cent, with ticket prices rising for all travellers, including visitors to Ireland.  This is at a time when we are launching a major initiative to attract tourists to Ireland.  Our tourist industry could not sustain an increase in airline charges to this country.  Non-EU destinations would become more attractive from a price point of view.  Low cost airlines would be the most seriously affected in this situation. Ryanair, which has championed the case of <Col N="957" /> the low cost flyer, would be forced to increase its fares.</P>
    <P>To promote regional airports and attract different airlines and routes, Aer Rianta offers an incentive scheme to airlines.  These schemes would not now be viable because of the serious lack of revenue from duty free sales.  It has been stated that it could result in the closure of regional airports.  This would be unsatisfactory at a time when the world is getting smaller because of air travel.  We need to provide more regional airports in Europe, not to close them.  Ireland, as a small island nation, is at a serious disadvantage from an access point of view.  We are dependent on our airports and we need to invest in them further to recognise their importance in our infrastructural development.  Ireland is the only European country without a direct connection to the Continent.  It is vital the Minister demand special consideration.  If one travels from Paris to Brussels and one cannot fly for some reason, one can always use the fast train service or the motorway. One cannot in Ireland; we are dependent on our airlines and, therefore, cannot afford to do without the revenue from duty free sales.  If this revenue is abolished, a special case should be made for Ireland and air fares to Europe and other destinations should be subsidised.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that Cork Airport does not have any transatlantic traffic and is dependent on duty free sales within Europe.  Aer Rianta's report last year showed Cork would have suffered a financial loss if it had not been for the revenue generated from duty free sales. Under this Bill, Cork Airport and others will be liable for local authority rates which will add to Aer Rianta's bills next year.  Cork needs its airport and direct access to European destinations if industry is to be attracted to the area.  If we want to promote Cork as an integrated part of Europe with easy access to the Continent, we must recognise the importance of Cork Airport and the essential part it plays in promoting the south of Ireland.  It will require a special commitment from Aer Rianta to ensure the development of Cork Airport and I urge it not to lose sight of its responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>Investment of over £200 million in airport facilities is due to take place over the next five years.  This consists of a Pier C Terminal West development at Dublin, a 60 per cent extension to the main terminal, a new passenger terminal at Shannon and the development of freight facilities at Cork.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed investment in Cork airport.  It should be designated as an airfreight gateway to Europe and the rest of the world as Munster is the capital of food production in Ireland.  This may be a way forward for Cork and such investment should be considered by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>More should be done to develop Cork-Dublin air services.  This is a regular commuter route which is quite expensive and restrictive.  From Cork, one can fly to London cheaper than to <Col N="958" /> Dublin.  A shuttle service should be investigated similar to that operated between London and Belfast where one turns up and buys a ticket, there is no check in or other formality.  If one is travelling from Cork to continental Europe, one invariably has to travel through Dublin, flights are restrictive and one must overnight in Dublin or London.  This is contrary to the idea of opening up the airways.  A rail service from Dublin city centre to Dublin Airport would greatly enhance the facility and make things much easier for commuters travelling to the airport from Cork and other regions.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  However, I re-emphasise the importance of Cork airport to the economic, industrial and tourism development of the region. I hope Aer Rianta will give special consideration to Cork and will not let a potential loss of revenue from duty free sales influence its investment in Cork airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have often heard the saying that all politics is local.  Having listened to Deputies Cosgrave and Clune and living a few hundred yards from Cork airport, which is in the middle of my constituency, I hope I am forgiven for being a little parochial.  The Minister pointed out that this Bill is long overdue.  It is important in the context of our commercial base.  The Bill provides Aer Rianta with a level of commercial freedom and responsibility.  At the same time, it retains the company's answerability to the Exchequer and the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>By any yardstick, Aer Rianta has been a hugely successful company.  By virtue of its activities abroad it has been able to invest in upgrading our airports.  This is the age of air travel &mdash; it is not just the elite who now travel by air.  We need to look at expanding rather than contracting the service. This Bill will enable Aer Rianta to move forward.</P>
      <P>As one who worked in a semi-State company for much of my adult life, I am aware of the restrictions imposed which force them to compete with one hand tied behind their back.  The original capital funding and social commitments, such as providing a public transport service, have inhibited many of these companies.  They are the nearest we will get to socialism and this is accepted by the public.</P>

      <P>I have been unreservedly committed to the concept of semi-State companies.  It is one of the primary reasons I joined Fianna Fáil as it was instrumental in establishing the majority of these companies.  They have worked under a handicap and this legislation is necessary.  Most of it was prepared during the previous Government but this Minister will steer it through to the Statute Book and ensure it is implemented.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta is a classic success.  Some people have been concerned that the company might be moving towards privatisation as a result of the chief executive's comments on the need to raise capital funding.  However, the Minister has assured us that that is not the case.  We wish to ensure that the company can compete and move forward.  It has been said that it must move forward in an even handed manner.  That was not the case in the past.  Shannon had its own fund which some described as a slush fund.  SFADCo marketed Shannon worldwide.  It also had certain restrictions built in such as the compulsory stop-over which other regions did not have.  Dublin had the benefit of being a capital city, so there was almost no need to market the airport as people wish to fly into the capital.  Cork airport had no marketing budget despite the fact that £2.5 million was available to Shannon.  The playing field has been levelled since but we wish to ensure that there is an even handed approach to the future marketing of the three airports.</P>
      <P>The political lobby has been part of Shannon airport's success.  When Shannon was threatened, people from all parties in the various constituencies in the region came together.  I advocated this for Cork before this Government was elected.  I appreciate that Aer Rianta is a national company in an international business.  The situation in Cork was so bad that a group was established called CASE &mdash; Cork Airport Seeks Equality.  These people's jobs were under threat because of lack of financial input for capital works and marketing. This has changed but it needs to continue changing and this requires the Minister's assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this Bill will allow Aer Rianta to develop lands other than those it currently occupies.  Deputy Cosgrave seemed to object to this.  Aer Rianta already owns six acres adjacent to Cork airport.  There are proposals to develop a business and technology park on the site which would be the largest project in Cork for many years.  The project would cover 600,000 square feet at an estimated cost of £35 million. Aer Rianta is taking a 25 per cent stake in the company.  Work on the site will involve software development, data processing, internationally <Col N="960" /> traded services and telesales.  Hopefully, a hotel and leisure complex will follow.  This would mirror what has happened internationally.  I am happy that restrictions on Aer Rianta's involvement in such a venture are being removed.  I commend those involved and wish them well.</P>
    <P>While painting a bad picture of the past, I wish to paint a very positive picture of the local staff of Aer Rianta in Cork.  Despite impediments and the threat to its future, they persisted and have been most innovative.  Up to three or four years ago there was a huge rate of diversion of flights due into Cork airport and the staff persisted in their efforts to get improved landing facilities including lighting, runways and communication systems. The results of the perseverance by workers and management in Cork is that flights are now rarely diverted.  They have proved themselves to be the best and they deserve and need support.  I am sure the same is true of the staff and management in Dublin and Shannon.  International travellers will not tolerate second class service.  They will simply find another venue.  The success of Dublin and Shannon airports must be related to the respective staffs.</P>
    <P>We have worked under other handicaps and the question of future funding is important.  In the European context, INTERREG I and II provided billions of pounds to assist with border controls, border crossing and water boundaries.  Airports have not benefited sufficiently from these programmes. We need to make a case for them, especially in the context of the threat to duty free sales.  I commend the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for her very strong defence of duty free sales.  She deserves and needs our support.  References to previous situations is not good for Ireland.  Neither is slagging of any benefit.  We should be united in strongly defending duty free sales.  Traders and shoppers have said duty free sales affect them, but in the national context it is a very important scheme.  It provides funding which is being ploughed back into shipping and air services. Funding would have to be provided by the Exchequer in the absence of such revenue.</P>
    <P>Marketing, the sole preserve of Aer Rianta, is of critical importance.  It will decide the future not just of the airport staff.  Regional airports are important as they influence the enterprises, tourism and related services and businesses that come to an area.  One of the first questions of business people wishing to locate or do business in an area concerns air access.</P>
    <P>The present situation in Cork is deplorable under a number of headings.  This is a problem for Aer Rianta, but also for the air companies. Aer Lingus has let us down in this context, but Aer Rianta will be able to encourage other companies to come to Cork, something that will become easier with the deregulation throughout Europe.  We need to market Cork.  The demise of SFADCo has evened the pitch a little but there are still a number of flights diverted to Shannon <Col N="961" /> which would not go there by choice.  This needs to be balanced.</P>
    <P>There are no international schedules operating from Cork to Europe and the US.  The EU is committed to the regional concept.  It wants to see programmes based on the regions and funding being dispersed on a regional basis.  It wants services to be regionally based.  Therefore, Cork will have to get its share of European and US flights. I do not know how this will be managed because we do not want to give too much direction to the board of Aer Rianta, but it should be advised to look at the whole country and try to service each of the regions.</P>
    <P>The directors of Aer Rianta were mentioned in this context.  A previous chairman of the board was from Cork, but it is almost an impossible mission to get one of the Cork staff elected as a worker director.  There is need for a quiet word in somebody's ear to say that if possible there should be representation from the three regions on the board of Aer Rianta.  I know this cannot be dictated to them.</P>
    <P>That Cork business people are required to fly to Dublin to link with Aer Lingus services has been mentioned.  In this context it is Aer Lingus we should knock and not Aer Rianta with whom I sympathise.  The general manager of Aer Rianta in Cork has made many representations to Aer Lingus to improve its service.  We need to pursue Aer Lingus on this matter, on the US service and on the general marketing of the area because it concerns so much more than the staff of the airport. In the context of deregulation, there are small airlines more than willing to operate continental flights at a reasonable fare.</P>
    <P>Fare costs have been mentioned and it is an issue Aer Lingus has to sort out.  Its offers are out of Dublin and this is not good.  If challenged it may be found to be contrary to some regulation, something we can perhaps examine.  Aer Lingus should be encouraged to take an even handed approach to its fare structure because Cork is disadvantaged by it at present.  It can make a difference for business people and for tourists.</P>
    <P>The primary work of Aer Rianta is to promote investment and development at its airports, something we can lose sight of.  It is now involved in business world-wide and I commend it for this because there was a need to diversify.  This is why I welcome the further deregulation by the Minister which gives Aer Rianta more autonomy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that when these companies were established Cork airport was under the Department of Transport.  It was labouring because the necessary investment was not present.  Any pay back now should be <i>pro rata</i> to what was invested in the airports because Cork did not get the investment it needed to keep up to standard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said Aer Rianta expected an announcement shortly from Continental Airlines of the introduction of daily services from Newark commencing next June, one to Shannon and the other to Dublin.  This highlights the point I am <Col N="962" /> making, namely, that there is a different approach to the three airports when there should be no difference. They are regional airports of national significance.</P>
    <P>In Cork there has been an over reliance on Aer Lingus to provide suitable services.  The new regional authority has already met Aer Lingus on a number of occasions and there is a widespread feeling that the airline has never had a true commitment to the development of Cork.  This has disadvantaged Cork in comparison to Cork and Shannon.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Aer Rianta on its new venture in Cork and I wish it well.  I am sure the Minister and everybody else will be supportive.  This is the kind of money that can be attracted as international mobile investment but certain criteria are laid down.  The IDA supports the idea of people moving into technology parks and so on but if there is not an airport and a reasonable schedule of flights people will not be interested. International business people will not waste time driving to and from Dublin for three or four hours to transact business.  If we do not have a well equipped airport and regular schedules we will not get the business that should be available to us.</P>
    <P>On the question of the compulsory stop-overs we in Cork took a mixed view and did not object. The compulsory stop-over at Shannon probably benefited the region.  However, we did object to the marketing back up of £2.5 million available to them which made the playing pitch so uneven. Some of that problem has been sorted out but I am concerned that ways may be found of providing extra money which will not be available to us.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my call to copy the activities of the very effective Shannon-based lobby.  We have 20 Deputies in the five Cork constituencies and we must unite to ensure Cork gets a fair deal.  In the past there was some faction fighting and we may have lost out.  Good luck to those who won their case.  Now it is our time.  I ask the Minister to ensure that in taking the cash from the company there is sufficient left to plough back in.  One of the difficulties in semi-State companies was that they had to give back money and did not have enough for reinvestment or diversification.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, including our spokesperson, Deputy Yates, I welcome the legislation. It reminds me of one of our well known singers, Val Doonican, who said when he made it into the big time that he was an overnight success after 20 years.  He had been ploughing his own furrow through the clubs and eventually somebody discovered he was a huge success.</P>

      <P>It has taken 28 years to bring this legislation before the House.  The chief executive, Mr. Derek Keogh, who was a higher executive officer in 1969 when he did some work on the preparation on the draft heads of this legislation, <Col N="963" /> is at the point of retiring as he sees that work coming to fruition.  Some officials in the Department of Public Enterprise who have waited a long time for this legislation must be pleased it is ready to be enacted into legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish the chief executive well in his retirement which will take place before the end of the year. As one who represents the constituency in which Dublin Airport exists he has proven to be an exemplary chief executive and has helped the Aer Rianta company to grow from strength to strength but more importantly to grow with quality. This company is one of the jewels in the crown of semi-State endeavours.  I do not think anybody will dispute that.  Having listened to the speeches today everyone is in agreement that Aer Rianta is one of the companies of which we are most proud.</P>
      <P>The staff too in Aer Rianta have taken an active and personal view of their company.  I remind the House of some of the records the company holds as firsts.  It was the first State company to introduce constructive participation by the workers which dates back over ten years.  This means every section of the workforce has a say in any changes being proposed in work practices, work rules, time, etc.  Aer Rianta was the first State company to introduce a crèche in 1984. How many times have we heard other companies talk about introducing a crèche?  It was the first State company to introduce an equality officer. Ten years ago I recall discussing with Derek Keogh and other senior staff in Aer Rianta ways in which positive action was being taken to ensure women participated fully in the management structures and young people also got the opportunity to make progress in the company if they showed the necessary promise.  It was the first State company to introduce job sharing in any real way.  It was the first international airport to start an arts festival.  As Minister, Deputy Stagg had the honour of opening one of those arts festivals. This is a week long festival with free entertainment, a free cultural occasion for people not only from north county Dublin but from all over, including the many passengers who can while away some time while awaiting their flight, watching bands, dancers, singers, jugglers and all types of artistic endeavours being carried out.  It is a most exciting place to be during the week of the arts festival.</P>
      <P>What we have all grown to love about Dublin Airport is that at Christmas time such a huge effort is made to ensure it is attractive.  This is such a poignant time when so many of our young people come back to spend Christmas at home with their parents and then have to depart.  The festivity within the airport is helpful in making people less sad at that difficult time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot stress enough how beneficial Aer Rianta and its success has been to so many thousands of people who have worked in the company or depend on people who work in the company and who purchase from or supply services to Aer <Col N="964" /> Rianta.  I pay tribute to the company today.  It has had great patience in waiting for this legislation to give it the possibility of becoming a fully commercial State body similar to the ESB, Bord Gáis and Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The growth in the airport is evident from the statistics.  In excess of nine million people travelled through Dublin Airport in 1996, there were 59 destinations and 26 scheduled airlines.  As the company grows and develops it is heartening that there is no diminution in the service it provides. We may have to walk a little longer on the travelators to get to our gates, due to the expansion of the airport.  Even then the management at the airport tries very hard to make life easy for people.  They provide minibus services from the car parks.  Greencaps, a work scheme for people in the Ballymun area, has been extremely successful in that regard.  It helps people to get their luggage to their cars or to other transport services and facilitates the movement of trolleys from the airport.  This helps to keep the airport as tidy as possible, having regard to the large volume of people who use it every day.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has been successful in branching out into the wider world.  It secured a contract in Beijing earlier this year and operates the first western-style duty free shop in China.  It also has contracts in the international airports of Damascus, Beirut, Kuwait and Moscow.  Its efforts know no bounds.  It is willing to go as far as possible to offer its expertise.  It recently won a contract for the Channel Tunnel.  As Aer Rianta takes its rightful place among the commercial semi-State bodies, it will continue to make development part of its name.  Duty free shops provide jobs for those working in them and for those supplying the products.  They act as a front for the best of Irish food, jewellery, knitwear and clothing.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales are under threat in 1999.  I am disappointed that in 1992 Ireland did not use its power to prevent the phase out of duty free in 1999.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, failed to use his power as a Minister around the Council table to prevent that decision being taken.  That has created much cynicism in my constituency, particularly as Fianna Fáil issued leaflets prior to the last election stating it would do its best to restore duty free services, having participated in the decision to abolish them.</P>
    <P>The abolition of this service will have adverse effects for Cork, Dublin and Shannon.  Approximately 2,000 people earn a living through duty free shops.  Their abolition would be the equivalent of closing Clerys, Arnotts and Brown Thomas which employ approximately 2,000 people between them.  I am sure there would be an outcry if those stores were shut down.</P>
    <P>Those working in duty free shops have no say over this decision.  The say will rest with the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  At every available opportunity the Government should stress to the Council and the Commission that the <Col N="965" /> decision made in 1992 was crazy and was made at a time when it was proposed to harmonise taxes. As that has not happened, the decision should be overturned as soon as possible so that the companies running duty free shops throughout our European partners can get on with their jobs. When I recently travelled through Stansted Airport the anti-closure group was handing out leaflets and some aeroplanes flying out of Stansted are screened stating &ldquo;Save our Duty Free&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Approximately £100 million is generated every year in the duty free outlets at our three airports, with a profit of about £26 million to £30 million. If that money is lost to Aer Rianta and a substitution is not found, air travel costs will increase. As a result non-EU destinations will benefit.  A high percentage of travel from Ireland is to EU countries, whether to holiday destinations in Spain, Portugal, Italy or France or business traffic between Belgium, France or Germany.  Flights to those destinations are full with civil servants every day.  It is essential that we protect the cost of travel.  If the cost of travel increases it will damage our tourist industry which has been going from strength to strength and creates many valuable jobs.  It would be a disaster if, while riding high on the back of the Celtic Tiger, a decision made by the Leader of this Government slowed its progress or even killed it off.  That would be regrettable at a time when so many Irish people are benefiting from the prosperity and many others are returning to work here.  This debate presents an opportunity to raise this issue and to make sure that there is no doubt in the minds of the Taoiseach or the Ministers, Deputies O'Rourke and McCreevy, that they will be held accountable by Members of the House and by the thousands of people who depend on duty free services for their livelihoods.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that the chief executive officer must be a member of the new board. It is extraordinary the legislation does not provide for that when that person is currently a member of the board.  During our time in office we ensured that the chief executive officer was a member of the board of any service we set up. Before leaving office we commenced legislation for the courts service, which I hope the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is continuing.  Although the courts commission group did not recommend it, the Government decided the chief executive officer should be on the board of the courts service. The chief executive officer should be fully aware of the thinking of the board.  It is not enough for that person to be handed down an edict.</P>
    <P>In regard to Part III of the Bill the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I think it only fair, on the occasion of the transfer of that property to the company, that this fact be recognised.</P>
    <P>I have included a provision in this part of the Bill requiring Aer Rianta to pay for the assets being transferred.  The amount in question will be a matter for consideration by myself and the <Col N="966" /> Minister for Finance, but I expect it will reflect the written down value of the property in question.</P>
    <P>I have no idea what cost will be levied on Aer Rianta when it has to pay for the assets the Minister is transferring to it.  As the company has returned many assets to the State, the charge should be nominal and it should be given the assets to continue its work.</P>
    <P>I hope when the Minister responds to this debate she will give us some idea of what she and the Minister for Finance have in mind.  I have warm memories of the Department of Finance and it will take what it can get and more from anybody.  I hope the company will not be bled and raided for the cost of these assets to the point that would jeopardise its investment plans.</P>
    <P>Regarding what Aer Rianta has done, up to 1986 the Government spent £57.1 million on capital investments in the three airports.  The written down value of those assets is at present £14.5 million, but Aer Rianta has contributed a total of £207.5 million in cash surrendered to the Exchequer since 1969 and £136.5 million was surrendered since 1987.  Since 1987 all new capital expenditure has been funded directly by the company out of its resources totalling a figure of £224.6 million.  Capital projects undertaken by Aer Rianta since it started to fund its capital programme include the new runway at Dublin Airport, a major extension to the terminal building at Cork Airport and the extension of the pier at Shannon Airport.  Members will know that upcoming projects include pier C terminal west development at Dublin Airport, a 60 per cent extension to the main terminal at Dublin Airport, a new passenger terminal at Shannon and development of freight facilities at Cork Airport. There is a broad sweep of investment planned by Aer Rianta.  That is why I want the Minister to assure the House that the avaricious hands of the Department of Finance will not jeopardise any of those developments.  It is important we leave this company in a healthy state when it is being turned into a commercial semi-State body because investment of more than £200 million is planned for Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports in the next five years.  At present the staff numbers in Aer Rianta are 2,050.  Those jobs must be protected and allowed to grow.  It is essential that the Minister gets that message.</P>
    <P>Section 41 deals with the giving of directions by the Minister to the company.  I would like clarification on what that means.  The section states that the Minister may give direction in writing to the company, not asking it to consider but requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind made by the Minister in relation to the functions assigned to the company by or under this Act.  If the Minister of the day were to take a flight of fancy and require Aer Rianta to close Shannon Airport, according to my reading of this section Aer Rianta would have to comply with that direction, even if it considered it foolhardy in that it would jeopardise development in <Col N="967" /> the Shannon area.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is smiling as if to say no Minister would do that.  I want the Minister when she responds to this debate to clarify what this means.  I do not want the Minister to be able to direct Aer Rianta to accept, for example, that a new airport should be built in Baldonnel for passenger services.  That would not be a good decision as it would jeopardise the investment made in Dublin Airport.  The Minister should not take on those penal powers under section 4l which might jeopardise Aer Rianta.  I hope the Minister will be forthcoming about what 41(3) means.  It states that the company shall comply with a direction under this section.  What does that mean?  It could mean anything or nothing and we need clarification on that.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Owen had read section 41 properly she would see it provides that the Minister may give a direction in writing to the company requiring it to comply with policy decisions of a general kind.  I will pass on to the Minister Deputy Owen's comments and I have no doubt that if there is anything untoward in that section or anything which we do not intend she will be open and amenable to amending it.  I note the other points made by Deputies Stagg and Owen concerning the position of the chief executive and whether he should be a member of the board.  I also note what Deputy Stagg said about copperfastening the position of worker directors and the other matters mentioned, including how much Aer Rianta will be expected to pay for the acquisition of the assets at written down value.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister, on her initiative on bringing the Bill before the House.  It has been about three decades in gestation and we are all delighted it is before the House today.  The principal issue in the Bill is the proposed change in the status of the company from being an agent of the Minister to being a fully fledged State company which owns its own assets.  As the Minister for Public Enterprise stated earlier, this will put Aer Rianta on a proper modern footing.  The basic philosophy underlying the Bill is to regularise the status of Aer Rianta and from that point of view at least it should command support from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>As Members know, at present Aer Rianta operates and manages the three State-owned airports on an agency basis on behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise.  This means that the Minister owns the airports and Aer Rianta acts on her behalf.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has outlined in some detail the origin of this arrangement. The intention of the Bill is to vest the airport lands in the Minister for Public Enterprise and to issue shares in the company which will be transferred to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> A second aspect to the Bill, which is also of vital importance, deals with updating and modernising the controls the Minister exercises over Aer Rianta.  It is a separate company in its own right incorporated under the Companies Act. From that point of view the relationship that applies between the Government and Aer Rianta should be the same as that which operates between the Government and other State sponsored bodies.  The same controls that apply to commercial State bodies must apply to Aer Rianta.  The Bill provides for such controls, particularly in relation to the level of airport charges, borrowing powers, payment of dividends, expanding the range of business activities, compulsory acquisition, appointment of directors and remuneration of the chief executive.  Very often these types of controls have been criticised as being overly restrictive and unduly constraining the business initiative of the companies involved.  That is not the case, as any objective study will show.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises fully that State-sponsored bodies must be assured of freedom from interference in their day to day operations so as to enable them to operate effectively.  That is the purpose of establishing State-sponsored bodies in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In today's fast moving competitive business environment the ability to react swiftly, to take quick business decisions is a <i>sine qua non</i> to success, but it is equally important to recognise that the Government owes a duty to citizens to monitor and control the operation of State-sponsored bodies as semi-State bodies and there are a number of good reasons for this.  First, semi-State bodies are in public ownership.  They were established or acquired with taxpayers' money.  Their shareholders are the community as a whole.  It falls to the sponsoring Minister or Department to represent the interests of the community at the Cabinet table and to be accountable to the Oireachtas for the operation of the semi-State companies.  Second, there is a substantial proportion of total national resources under the control of State bodies.  Therefore, it is vital that they be used in a way which will contribute to overall national objectives of sustained economic growth, increased employment and wealth creation.  The Government decides these priorities and it must direct the commercial State bodies to pursue these objectives.  Third, a number of State enterprises enjoy a monopoly or near monopoly in strategic areas of the economy.  The Government is obliged to regulate their activities in the public interest in the same way as it would in regard to any other company which enjoyed a monopoly or a substantial amount of control in an important segment of the market.</P>
    <P>Some commercial State bodies have a public service obligation and have to undertake activities which might not make commercial sense but have a social and developmental function.  The State must ensure those activities are carried out and that the company continues to meet its public <Col N="969" /> service obligations in a cost-effective way for the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill regarding public enterprise control are driven by the following laudable objectives: the desire of this Government to see that public moneys invested in State bodies are safeguarded and used to their best effect; to ensure that State bodies conform generally to overall Government policy and to make the public sector operate efficiently and in a way which serves the best interests of the community.</P>
    <P>There is no intention to stifle the initiative and the entrepreneurial spirit that has characterised Aer Rianta's approach to its job which has made it the success it is today.  That spirit is recognised and valued very highly, especially by those from the mid-west region where Shannon airport is the linchpin in our economy.  We appreciate it too much to put it at risk through excessive regulation. What is proposed in the Bill is no more than the minimum which is prudent and wise.  It is the minimum required of us as stewards of the public purse.</P>
    <P>The close association between Aer Rianta and Shannon airport is well known, especially in the context of the development of the mid-west.  This Bill is of particular importance to those who represent the greater Shannon area and have its economic prosperity as their priority.  The success of Shannon airport continues to be seen as an important contribution to the economy of the mid-west.  The desire of successive Governments to favour balanced regional development has led to different interventionist policies in the different regions.  For us in the mid-west, the Shannon stop requirement has been the policy instrument on which the economic success of the region has been largely built.</P>
    <P>There was a fundamental change in the Shannon stop policy some years ago in order to save Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>The mid-west paid the price to save Aer Lingus.  It would be gravely dishonest of me, <Col N="970" /> just because I am in Government, to pretend the decision taken at that time did not have a detrimental effect on the region &mdash; it did.  Any objective observer will say it has hindered the development of Shannon airport.  The situation is not as bad as the worst prophets of doom forecast at the time.  Nevertheless the region has paid a price.</P>
      <P>I thank successive Ministers and local interests for the aggressive marketing and initiatives they have undertaken since then to preserve the situation in the best way possible.  However, the position is delicately balanced and any further dilution of the Shannon stop policy would shatter the fragile confidence which has been painfully re-established and have devastating economic implications for the mid-western economy and consequently the country.  Any diminution would not only encounter the opposition of those at the coalface &mdash; tourism and business interests &mdash; but also the entire mid-western community and the public representatives they have chosen to represent them, of whom I am proud to count myself one.  Deputy Carey is another.</P>
      <P>The EU-United States multilateral negotiations which commenced last year are expected to result in the creation of a common aviation area spanning the two largest trading blocs in the world.  These negotiations are at an early stage and have run into difficulty, particularly because of the understandable desire of various member states to protect their own interests, including regional ones.</P>
      <P>It is true that if an agreement is reached, Ireland cannot stand aside.  We are the most open economy in Europe and must be in a position to do business with both sides in whatever trading arrangement emerges.  The latest report is that the French Government see the negotiations concluding in nine years' time.  They are at an early stage and there is no compulsion on us to discuss the Shannon stop policy in the context of ultimate agreement.</P>
      <P>If agreement is reached, traffic rights may be on the agenda.  However, under whatever regulatory environment is proposed for the future, we should seek an expansion in the number of links between Shannon and the United States as the bottleneck is limiting and adversely affecting the number of American tourists coming to the mid-west. At present, Irish airlines are confined to flying to New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles. Over 50 per cent of US visitors to Ireland arrive via UK or European points.  Many of these visitors could be attracted to the idea of starting their European visit in Shannon rather than having to backtrack to Ireland after landing in London or Paris.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key to exploiting these new opportunities is the marketing of Shannon airport to the travel trade overseas and to airlines.  Highly focused, direct marketing is particularly needed at this time to counter the opportunities for US airlines to start new services into the UK and continental European cities under their existing bilateral open skies agreements.  Aer Rianta has, in the <Col N="971" /> past year, been given responsibility for the marketing of the airport.  The Bill copperfastens that role by citing as a principal objective of the company the taking of all measures for, <i>inter alia</i>, the marketing and development of its airports.</P>
    <P>The company has expertise and experience in marketing all the State airports.  At Shannon, it is ably assisted by a consultative committee which is drawn from local tourism interests.  The committee has an important role in advising Aer Rianta to ensure that whatever moneys are allocated by the company to marketing Shannon airport are used effectively.  I am confident the committee can be relied on to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill also sets out, as an objective of the company, to provide such facilities at airports for aircraft, passengers, cargo and mail as it considers necessary.  Air cargo has become the Cinderella of the air transport business.  However, although air freight currently accounts for about 1 per cent in volume of cargo exported from Ireland, it accounts for 18 per cent in value.  Almost one fifth of the total value of air transport is due to freight. The original concept of the Shannon customs free area was built around the idea of air freight.  This is an idea we must now revisit.  It makes sense that air transport of high value goods be fostered.</P>
    <P>The growth of the computer industry makes air freight access an important marketing advantage. The ability to access markets speedily and easily and to ensure timely delivery of goods is a modern business requirement.</P>
    <P>Transport of goods by air parallels, in many aspects, the advances in the field of communications. Air transport gives business the degree of responsiveness vital for survival and growth.  In relation to duty free sales, the House will know that an agreement made in 1992&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Forty one per cent of sales in Shannon Airport are EU-related.  That airport is less reliant on duty free sales than Dublin or Cork where I understand the position is very serious.  Nevertheless, 41 per cent is a substantial figure.  Incidentally, I want to compliment Aer Rianta on the measures they are taking in anticipation of the abolition possibly occurring in 1999.  They have started to manage other duty free areas and airports in non-EU countries and have increased the level of non-duty free sales.  Nevertheless, it would be catastrophic if duty free was abolished or not, at the very minimum, deferred in 1999. The revenue generated by duty free sales helps to keep airport charges down thereby reducing the costs of access to airports.  From the point of <Col N="972" /> view of Ireland's dependence on tourism that is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a necessary measure to enable Aer Rianta to operate as a commercial semi-State body in the modern business world.  What is proposed is good for Aer Rianta and good for Shannon. This House should progress this legislation as quickly as possible in order to bring the control and management of the civil airports of this State into an effective modern framework to serve a modern economy.  For those reasons I commend the Bill to the House without hesitation.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary to witness the crocodile tears of a Fianna Fáil Minister, a Minister led by a Taoiseach who, when he was Minister for Finance in 1992, went to Brussels with a clear directive from this Dáil to fight, fight and fight again for the duty free sales of our national airports company.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, let us down on that occasion and did not defend Ireland's case.  The primary responsibility which an Irish Minister has &mdash; and which a Taoiseach certainly has &mdash; is to defend this country's interests.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, did not do so in 1992; he sold us out in relation to duty free.  That is the reality.  We now find ourselves, five years later, desperately trying to undo his mistake.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is trying to pick up the pieces smashed to bits by Deputy Ahern in 1992.  We are faced with a catastrophic situation whereby our national airports company, half of whose profits derive from duty free, is in an incredibly difficult situation due to the incompetence of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1992.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it will, at long last, give basic semi-State status to Aer Rianta.  Since 1966 this semi-State company has done us proud.  The 3,000 or so workers employed by it have expanded business sales across Europe, Asia and many other places.  They deserve enormous credit for that.  They have also run the three State airports with efficiency and distinction during that period.  While the State has only funded Aer Rianta to the extent of approximately £57 million, it has returned profits of more than £200 million to us.  We should salute the workers and the management of Aer Rianta for their tremendous achievement.</P>
      <P>In the north Dublin region which I am proud to represent Dublin Airport and all its companies &mdash; Aer Lingus, TEAM Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta itself &mdash; represent the very fulcrum of our economic well-being.  More than 8,000 workers are engaged in a wide variety of activities in the airport, principally in bringing tourists and business people in and out of this country.  The airport provided a lifesaver for the whole northside of Dublin &mdash; which is perhaps one of the most deprived areas in the country &mdash; over the past decades.  We are very proud of all of the work which has been achieved there.</P>
      <P>We are glad that Aer Rianta is associated with NORDUBCO which my colleague on the Fianna Fáil benches, Deputy Carey, is also involved with. The major partnership companies of the northside area led by the Ballymun, Finglas and Northside partnerships work together in close liaison with Aer Rianta to provide additional jobs directed at the most deprived sections of our community and at the long-term unemployed.  I salute Dublin Airport and its workers &mdash; specifically the Aer Rianta workers &mdash; for their great achievements over the past three or four decades.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea referred to the Shannon stopover.  Since Dublin Airport was released from this straitjacket, the staff there have brought the airport close on the heels of Manchester airport.  It was our ambition that, after London, Dublin Airport should be the major international hub of these islands.  The Aer Rianta staff in Dublin have pursued that goal relentlessly over the past three or four years and we are now hot on Manchester's heels, our major rival in aviation terms.  We will surpass Manchester if the proper land planning and supports are given to Aer Rianta over the coming years.  If one compares the territory Dublin Airport has in comparison to an airport like Stockholm, one can see the great necessity for major land holdings to be made available for airport development.  I am glad that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has recognised this in relation to Dublin.  The same probably applies to Shannon and Cork airports also.  We need that kind of freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt to smother Aer Lingus's and Aer Rianta's development in a rezoning move to the south-east was utterly obnoxious and detrimental and could only have been intended to enrich the <Col N="974" /> pockets of private individuals at the cost of Dublin Airport's and Aer Rianta's development.  That went against the public interest.  I see no merit in allowing a second terminal to be developed by any private interests.  I share Deputy Stagg's fears that sections of this Bill may be used by the Progressive Democrats, in particular, to try to influence Fianna Fáil to allow privatisation of Aer Rianta.  If any such attempt were made, it would be bitterly opposed by the Labour Party.  Aer Rianta needs the fullest flexibility in the territory around Dublin Airport.  I welcome the fact that the Bill will give control of assets and the powers of a commercial semi-State body to Aer Rianta and enable it to develop in a normal way with the normal kind of freedoms which will enable it to continue its successful contribution to our economy.</P>
    <P>On the question of duty free sales, this House has to use all its resources to try to claw back the failures of the past four or five years. In particular the Taoiseach has to try to remedy the grave error he made five years ago when he made no serious attempt in Brussels to prevent damage to Aer Rianta and to the country generally.  Almost half of Aer Rianta's profits derive from the duty free area which provides a critical part of the income of the companies concerned, not just Aer Lingus, the public company.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general tenor of the Bill in terms of the extra freedoms of directors and staff.  I referred briefly to terminal development and to the attempts to restrict Aer Rianta's freedom of action in the general territory of the airport.  On the Ballymun-Coolock side and on the Swords side residential development has probably approached as closely as it can.  In the context of Dublin Airport we have to keep the territory of the flight path as easily accessible as possible for safety reasons and general airport development.</P>
    <P>On section 10, I am worried by the powers the Minister will have in relation to the future development of the company and the selling of shares.  It might be possible under this Bill for the Minister to simply announce in the House that he was selling a portion or majority control of Aer Rianta to a private concern.  That is something the Labour Party will bitterly oppose because, given the track record of the company, there is no justification for it and it cannot be supported in relation to the general development of this part of the economy.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Fianna Fáil Minister has reneged on promises relates to the appointment of worker directors.  Some of the basic provisions of the 1977 Act are fulfilled here but there is a real fear that major subsidiaries which may end up running Cork, Shannon or even Dublin Airport would not have the facility of worker directors.  In the semi-State bodies we had to fight over many decades to give the large workforce in these bodies some say in the administration and direction of their companies.  In this Bill, the pass is again being sold by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Democrats coalition and the way is left open for the privatisation of subsidiaries without reference to this House by the total failure to have the workers and staff represented.  That is something we will try to amend in committee, but I would like the Minister to look again at the matter, particularly in view of the commitments that have been made.</P>
    <P>During the general election many of us spent a great deal of time interacting with shop stewards and the trade union leadership of the workers of Telecom Éireann, particularly in relation to the employee share ownership project in that company. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats, the three conservative parties, are bitterly opposed to the whole concept of employee share ownership, despite the fact that in many countries, including the most capitalist economy of all, the United States, some of the greatest companies are employee owned.  When one speaks to the steward on American Airlines one is talking to one of the owners of that very successful and efficient company.  A whole range of companies across the United States is very successfully owned by employees and they have had a long and successful history.  By the refusal in this Bill to countenance employee participation or to give any consideration to the proposals relating to the Telecom Éireann workers, once again the capitalist, greedy face of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is revealed, as it is in relation to Fine Gael &mdash; during the general election there was an unofficial consensus between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I do not know why the two large parties do not form a Government and have done with it because they represent the same economic views in relation to employee participation.  In the negotiations in which I was deeply involved, there was antagonism from the Minister at the time, Deputy Dukes, from Fianna Fáil and from the Progressive Democrats.  The only major party in this House that is remotely interested in pursuing the ideal of employee participation is the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Fianna Fáil not doing another U-turn.  The media are currently interested in how many U-turns Fianna Fáil has done since 6 June.  The count at the moment is five major U-turns. We will be coming back to one of them relating to Sellafield in half an hour.  The whole area of employee participation represents another U-turn.  There was yet another U-turn in relation to the minimum wage, a refusal to live up to promises that were made in the election campaign that concluded on 6 June.  In relation to trade union recognition, the trade unions were told that certain things would happen, but they are not happening.  As we heard last week at the SIPTU conference in Ennis, there will be no further national agreements unless workers and their representatives get their fair share of the national cake that is expanding by 8 per cent or 10 per cent per annum.  Speaking as one of their representatives, we want our fair share, and we <Col N="976" /> will have our fair share, no matter what it takes. Fianna Fáil representatives should remember the promises they made particularly to Telecom and CIE workers.  In this Bill they have once again sold out in relation to the workers of Aer Rianta. That is something we will also approach when tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I also share the fears expressed by Deputy Stagg about the possibility that, because of the extensive powers given to her under this Bill, the Minister might pull out cash from Aer Rianta and dilute the asset base of the company as happened over the years to Telecom Éireann, despite the large loans it has had.  Esat Digifone seems to have great friends in Fianna Fáil and in Fine Gael.  There is a worry that the Minister could pull out moneys that are needed to fund the £200 million programme and the expansion of Aer Rianta in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I generally support the proposal by Deputy Yates regarding the chief executive.  It is useful for any chief executive to be on a board in order to monitor developments and set the tone and direction of a company.</P>
    <P>In general terms I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the management and staff of Aer Rianta on their wonderful achievements over the past three or four decades.  I warn Fianna Fáil in relation to the matters to which I have alluded this evening, particularly the question of appointing worker directors, employee participation, the possibility of utilising this Bill for outright privatisation and the general attempt to put restrictions on the development of this very successful semi-State body, that they will be facing a very vigilant and determined Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy Broughan, a person for whom I have a high regard and respect, appears to be suffering from political amnesia.  His party was in Government with Fianna Fáil between l992 and l994.  It is claiming credit for everything that Government did right while Fianna Fáil is being blamed for everything that went wrong. How then is the agreement with TEAM Aer Lingus coming off the rails?  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Enterprise are involved in seeking a solution.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputy Broughan that it was Fianna Fáil which pioneered the concept behind ESSOP and that it was the Taoiseach, when Minister for Labour, who extended the body of labour law. Deputy Broughan mentioned worker directors. Some of the partnerships with which his party was involved during the past 20 years did not crown themselves in glory when it came to worker participation.</P>

      <P>Why are people along the east coast seeking the assistance of the Government which is being given freely?</P>
      <P>I welcome this worthwhile Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction.  The last significant legislation dealing with this matter was brought forward by the Minister's late brother 30 years ago.  I support the provisions of the Bill dealing with worker directors.  The Minister will however have to provide for the disposal of assets.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta plays a significant role in the economic life of the east coast region.  As Deputy Broughan and others said, it has been pro-active and is to be admired for the way it has co-operated with the industrial and commercial sector.  It has worked with the partnership companies, the chambers of commerce and the big new industries on the north side of the city and facilitated the creation of employment within Dublin Airport. With the Ballymun partnership it has established the Green Caps company which provides a trolley service at the airport.  In the duty free area it has provided a showcase on favourable terms for small entrepreneurs to display their wares such as cheeses, crystal, clothing, designs and other high quality products.</P>
      <P>On the thorny issue of duty free sales, insufficient consideration was given to the social and economic implications before the decision to abolish them was made in l991.  This decision should be reversed in the interests of the economic well being of the community.</P>
      <P>The impact of the abolition of duty free sales to 2005 was addressed in a recent report by Cranfield University.  It states that a number of the sample airports will no longer be able to fund their investment programmes from internal sources and that some airports will become lossmaking at current airport charges levels.  To offset the fall in profitability, airport charges will have to be increased by between 20 per cent and 40 per cent if airports are to be able to finance their continuing expansion from internal sources. In an extreme case an airport may have to double its charges if the increase is applied to intra-EU flights only.  None of us wants to see huge increases in landing charges.  It is possible that some airlines will decide to take their business elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Passengers stated that if duty free sales were abolished their purchases would drop, leading to a fall in liquor sales of between 71 per cent and 85 per cent.  As a non smoker, I have no sympathy for the tobacco smoking lobby and could not care less how low tobacco sales fall but I understand that sales could drop by between 63 per cent and 89 per cent and perfume sales by between 61 per cent and 83 per cent.  It will come as no surprise therefore that I oppose the proposal that intra-EU duty free sales should be abolished from l999. This proposal is based on the principle that in a single market duty free sales should not be permitted. The relentless pursuit of the principle of a single community should not be allowed to <Col N="978" /> impinge on successful business practice.  A blinded bureaucracy should not badger business.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta estimates that the loss of duty free sales would have cost it £25 million in profits foregone in l996.  I represent the constituency of Dublin North-West which encompasses the areas of Finglas, Ballymun and Santry in which thousands of Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus employees live.  I shudder to think of the consequences, economic and social, if this proposal is implemented.</P>
    <P>Dublin City University, in co-operation with the partnership companies and the chambers of commerce, is seeking to ensure the economic well-being of the east coast region.  There has been much talk about the North-South economic corridor.  Nothing will be possible if the vital hub of Dublin Airport is not allowed to thrive and develop.  In not opposing the proposal that duty free sales should be abolished we would be sending the signal that there is no point in providing a rail link to Dublin Airport.  Despite what Deputy Broughan said, around Dublin Airport there is a large land bank, comprising some 66.5 acres, including a technology campus, which to be perfectly fair to the outgoing Government and former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was deemed to be a tax incentive area and available to attract a significant employer.  Therefore Dublin Airport needs to thrive and Aer Rianta needs it.</P>
    <P>Intra-EU duty free sales account for almost 80 per cent of our total duty free sales, abolition of which would undoubtedly result in a significant increase in operator charges and fares.  I caution against any attempt on the part of any Minister in any Government to devise a mechanism for increased charges as a method of clawing back some of the company's assets when in a profitmaking position.</P>
    <P>Increased operator fares would have a devastating effect, first on international trade and, second, on tourism.  With regard to international trade I must remind the House that more than 70 per cent of our merchandise and exports go to European Union markets and &mdash; it can almost become a mantra &mdash; that ours is the only EU member state without a land bridge to the Continent. The sooner we realise we are a peripheral country on the western limits of Europe the better. Despite projects like INTERREG which benefits those of us in Dublin and North Wales, we remain at a significant disadvantage with regard to economic development and international trade.  Increased operator charges would directly affect the cost of exporting our produce to our main markets.  I would argue that it could be construed as anti-competitive because contrary to our will, costs of entry to the European marketplace for our products would inevitably increase.  Whereas other EU exporting states can switch to road and rail if shipping or air freight prices increase, in the absence of a land bridge to the Continent our exporters do not have the same choice, which is inequitable and unfair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> The abolition of intra-European Union duty free sales would reverse the recent welcome reductions in access fares which have contributed enormously to the inward movement of tourists here.  Today I received a brochure, as no doubt did other Members, from Dublin Tourism highlighting the fact that in 1992 there were of the order of 1.55 million visitors to the Dublin region, which figure had risen in 1996 to in excess of 2.25 million.  Anybody living here or visiting this city will realise its vibrance if only through listening to the multi-lingual tourists on our streets.  Without the low airfares policy being promoted with the assistance of the airlines and Aer Rianta, we would not benefit from that year round tourism trade so important to our economy and of benefit to all sections of our community.  It will readily be appreciated that any increase in fares would reduce if not reverse that growth, in addition to diminishing the buoyancy of our Exchequer's substantial tax take from foreign visitors.  A reduction in numbers of tourists means a corresponding reduction in passenger numbers, thus compounding airline and airport difficulties.</P>
    <P>While our general economic climate is very healthy, our very high rate of unemployment remains our greatest concern.  Since tourism is a labour-intensive industry we must vigorously oppose any European Union-enforced proposal which would have a negative effect on this already very serious position.  On the one hand the Commissioner for Social Affairs, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, a former Member of this House, tells us how innovative our economies need to be to cater for the employment needs of our growing population while, on the other, another EU Commissioner tells us we must close off this perceived loophole of duty free sales or tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Proponents of the abolition of duty free sales argue that, while revenue from sales is lost to airports, airlines, ferry operators and so on, the Exchequer gains from the duty on sales previously foregone.  I believe that to be a very weak argument.  It would be fair to say that a very large proportion of duty free sales, are extra sales not merely a substitution for normal high street sales, a fact confirmed by most of the research undertaken on this matter.  There can also arise the anomalous, quite ludicrous position in which passengers travelling to non-EU countries passing through duty free shops could shop there freely while ours and other EU citizens would be precluded.</P>
    <P>My constituency of Dublin North-West is dependent on a healthy, vibrant Dublin Airport to generate direct employment within its confines in addition to indirect employment through the development of the surrounding infrastructure.  I cannot over-emphasise the need to provide for the longer term expansion of that airport.  I am one of those who believes that Aer Rianta is the appropriate vehicle for that development because sooner rather than later we shall have to confront the issue of a second terminal at Dublin Airport, <Col N="980" /> which Aer Rianta is best equipped to provide.  I must cite the &ldquo;Green Caps&rdquo; co-operative development between the Ballymun partnership and Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>I cannot support any EU proposal that would commercially harm a successful entity.  Being committed Europeans does not mean we should blindly accept what I regard to be a fundamentally flawed proposal.  I must reiterate that, as the only EU member state without a land bridge to the Continent, we should seek exemption from this proposal to abolish duty free sales on intra-European Union travel from 1999 onwards.</P>
    <P>Judging by some briefing information I have to hand, some significant if not startling facts need to be emphasised &mdash; such as that duty free shopping directly generates approximately 140,000 wealth-producing jobs within the European Union and almost 2,000 here.  They play a major role in keeping down the cost of air and sea travel, without which airport charges could increase by as much as 50 per cent &mdash; while that may be an exaggeration, a significant increase is likely &mdash; with ticket prices rising for all travellers, including visitors here, with low cost airlines most seriously affected.</P>
    <P>If duty free shopping is abolished within the European Union the cost of travel here will inevitably increase, thus seriously threatening the current successful drive to develop our tourism industry employing over 100,000 people, and non-EU destination states will have a price advantage. One does not need to be an economic guru to realise that fact.</P>
    <P>Revenue from duty and tax free sales supports investment by airports and ferry companies in new infrastructures, vessels and facilities.  We are told Aer Rianta will need to invest £200 million over ensuing years.  Even within the restricted environment in which the company must operate, we can already witness the great expansion that has taken place at Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports. Because the majority of traffic at the EU's airports is intra-European, those airports will be hardest hit by the loss of duty and tax free sales and could well lose many of their airline routes through having to increase airport charges.  This may well pose a threat although I am not certain it is as strong as it sounds.</P>
    <P>Duty and tax free shops provide a first class international showcase for quality Irish products. How often does one pass through a duty free shop and see Irish art and craftsmanship displayed in the best possible position?  It would be a shame if that showcase were no longer in existence.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, the purpose of which is to allow Aer Rianta act as a commercial semi-State company and be competitive for the future.  The Bill is necessary in that regard.  Despite the constraints previously placed on Aer Rianta, it has shown great foresight in the development and management of our airports and other subsidiaries such as hotels and airport duty free shops around the world.  The excellent development at Dublin and Shannon Airports over the past number of years, with which I am familiar, is a credit to the management and staff of Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the assistance.  I suggest the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Deputies who are concerned about this issue should cajole the Taoiseach to ensure his Minister, who is currently in Brussels trying to solve the problem, succeeds in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a hopeless case, as Deputy Stagg suggests, enormous difficulties will be experienced here, particularly in regard to jobs that might be lost as a result of abolishing duty free sales.</P>
      <P>The EU directive to abolish duty free sales will have an enormous effect on the financial well-being of Aer Rianta and, more importantly, on the large number of staff employed in duty free sales.  It is imperative that the Government uses every option open to it to veto the EU directive on duty free.  In her Second Stage contribution the Minister said that the programme for Government includes resistance to the EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999 as a key priority under the transport heading.  I hope she does not change her mind in that regard.  She has already changed her mind on Sellafield and her other ministerial colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance, have foregone what is stated in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government.  I know my former colleague in the Seanad, Deputy Wright, will ensure that the Minister does not change her policy on duty free shopping, although he will have a difficult task. The decision has been taken and it will be extremely difficult to have it changed.</P>
      <P>One effect of the abolition of duty free shopping is that Aer Rianta will probably decide to increase ground charges for planes flying to their airports.  Deputy Pat Carey indicated that charges could increase by 50 per cent.  That would have a detrimental effect on low cost airlines coming into the country.  Air fares have been dramatically reduced between Europe and Dublin and between Britain and Dublin but if ground charges were dramatically increased, airlines would be forced to charge higher prices resulting in a detrimental effect on business and tourism interests here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that all politics is local and the Deputies who contributed to this debate live close to Dublin, Shannon or Cork Airports. There is a small regional airport in my own constituency in Strandhill in Sligo.  The management and airport committee of Sligo Airport and many other airports have played a significant role in the past number of years in increasing passenger <Col N="983" /> numbers to regional airports.  However, they have not been given adequate incentives to develop regional airports in a proper way.  That issue should be given favourable consideration over the coming year.  There is only one flight in and out of Sligo Airport, for example, which makes it difficult for people wanting to make connecting flights from Dublin to Europe.  If a second service were in operation it would greatly increase tourist numbers and encourage much needed industrial development in the area.  Aer Rianta has a major role to play in the development of regional airports which has not been referred to in the Bill, and I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this.</P>
    <P>This Bill is necessary as it will enhance the way airports are developed.  Cork, Dublin and Shannon Airports should benefit greatly from making Aer Rianta a semi-State body.  I compliment the management and staff of Aer Rianta for the work they have done over the past 30 years.  If they are given a freer hand, I am sure they will be more progressive in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Patrick Carey spoke well on behalf of his constituents in Dublin North East and I compliment him on that, although I did not agree with all he said.  He forgot to mention the action of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on duty free but I will go into that later.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta deserves our support in its transition. It is proper that this power be given to it because it has had an uneasy relationship with the Department of Finance over the years. Additional funds were not provided on occasions when Aer Rianta was most in need of them.  I refer in particular to the time the change was made in the stopover at Shannon Airport.  In that year, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, drew down much more funds from Aer Rianta than was necessary, funds that were needed for the development of Shannon Airport, which was delayed.  We badly needed a vote of confidence at that time.</P>
      <P>In addition to the great conglomerate which is Dublin Airport, Aer Rianta has roots in the country at Shannon and Cork.  This company mirrors some of the economic and social difficulties we experience as a nation.  As a result of great expansion Dublin airport is choked with traffic, while it is very easy to gain access to the international airport at Shannon.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, is present in the House as he represents a western constituency.  The structural development programme sent to Brussels by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, neglected to include a western corridor which would have provided easy access to Shannon airport and the airports in Kerry and Galway.  A six or seven mile tailback of traffic into Newmarket-on-Fergus and Clarecastle reduces the attractiveness of the area not only to tourists but also to industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Shannon Airport plays a very important economic and social role in the midwest and west.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, confined his remarks on Shannon Airport to the midwest. However, it should be remembered that the airport is very important to the entire western sea board.  Shannon Airport was an experiment in decentralisation which we fully supported. Deputy O'Flynn referred to the statements about rabbits on the runway at Shannon Airport. Fianna Fáil used to remind its members of this statement at election time and warn that all the advantages of the airport would be lost if any other party was elected to office.  However, it was a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Cowen, who ruthlessly did away with the Shannon stop-over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>International agreements were drawn up and I am sure the Minister would want us to honour them.  I am not cribbing about that decision but I am concerned about the lack of long-term planning by the then Government in regard to problems which might arise after these structures are taken away.  The previous Government made a capital investment of £15 million in Shannon Airport, the first time this was done for more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>I am not making political points but rather am trying to ensure a unified interest in the west.  I presume the Minister of State who represents a western constituency has an interest in the west and has read in local newspapers the views of hoteliers about the tourism figures for the west this year and the number of continental tourists who used Dublin Airport which offers cheaper fares.  Fianna Fáil Deputies boasted about the cheaper fares for passengers flying into Dublin Airport.  However, there are no cheap fares for passengers flying into Shannon and Cork airports. Galway airport, which is owned by a private company, also needs to be developed further if it is to attract industry.  Yet the Government is neglecting these airports.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was making his ministerial appointments he conveniently ignored the people of the west.  He took the Western Commission out of his Department and parked it in the Department of the Environment and Local Government for a few weeks.  However, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, did not want it and he sent it to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh.  I now hear that the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who comes from south Tipperary is looking after matters in the west. The Taoiseach thinks that the difficulties in the west relate only to agriculture.</P>

      <P>We will get an idea next Thursday at Question Time about what he intends to do and the progress he has made.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the powers being given to the Department of Finance.  I do not understand what section 41 is about.  Why does the Minister want to have these powers?  Surely the chief executive and the Minister's representative on the board will look after matters.  The Bill should provide that Shannon and Cork airports are also represented on the board of directors of Aer Rianta.  This was not always the case as appointments depended on who was in power.  In some cases the selection process left much to be desired and many of the people appointed had no real expertise.</P>
      <P>People in the west believe everything is being done to develop Dublin.  While one may regard a seven or eight mile tailback of traffic in the west as a sign that the economy is doing well, it is not right or good for the area or industry.  I recently received a letter from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, in which he said I should address inquiries about national roads to the National Roads Authority, not his Department.  However, he neglected to say that he and his Department formulated the criteria on which national road developments may go ahead.  It is Fianna Fáil interests who are preventing Newmarket-on-Fergus, Clarecastle and Ennis being by-passed.  This lack of road development means that Shannon airport will not be able to compete with other airports.  Deputies Dennehy and O'Flynn are confident that Cork airport will be expanded.  If international flights use the airport it will create further competition for Shannon Airport.  Even though the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, sold Shannon airport down the river, it fought back and had record growth in 1996-7.  If there is further competition the airport will continue this fight.</P>
      <P>There is apprehension in regard to Shannon and the mid-west and positive political decisions are required.  I am glad the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, has intervened to retain duty free sales.  The Taoiseach did not put forward opposition at the Council meeting to the ending of duty free sales.  While the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, went to Brussels to make representation to the Commission, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has yet to issue a statement of support for the permanent retention of duty free sales.  Such a statement should be demanded of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> Aer Rianta employees are model employees. On the industrial relations front, they have behaved in a positive way and there have been very few breakdowns in industrial relations.  The development of Aer Rianta in Shannon ensured an increase in wages, providing for the same level of wages in Shannon as in Dublin Airport.  There is a necessity to make solid decisions for the future of Aer Rianta.  I await with interest the reaction of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to the existing problems. Some of her Fianna Fáil predecessors sat on their hands and made no firm decisions on Shannon Airport.  I hope that does not happen in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I had the opportunity today to speak to the chief executive of Aer Rianta who said it is 30 years since he was involved in the heads of the Bill.  It is a very important day for the board, management and staff of Aer Rianta that we are discussing the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  The history of the Bill goes back over many ministries, joint Oireachtas committees and so on.  Deputy Donal Carey gave his view on the problems facing Shannon and I will give my view on Aer Rianta's management of Dublin Airport since I came to public life in 1985.</P>
      <P>Part of the objective of the Bill is to officially put Aer Rianta on a semi-State footing.  The staff, management and board of Aer Rianta have been very professional in their work, and the annual reports of the company are evidence of that.  As a politician, I am happy to speak about Dublin Airport, an integral part of the constituency of Dublin North.  Aer Rianta has been successful in terms of profits, marketing its airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon and the relationship between management, staff and board.  It is an example for other companies.  There are many reports to confirm those comments.</P>
      <P>I wish to cite the 1996 annual report of the chief executive who stated that the company continues to place major emphasis on its core values of excellence, consumer service, humanisation of the airports' ambience and open management systems, including a commitment to equal opportunities. I reiterate that has been my experience of Aer Rianta in the past 12 years.  We are all aware of semi-State bodies that approach the Minister of the day on a monthly basis seeking subvention for capital investment, but since 1987 Aer Rianta has handed over to the Government cash from profits to the tune of £135 million.  It funded its total capital programme over the years. It spent £225 million of its own resources to bring the airports at Shannon, Dublin and Cork up to the highest standard and intends to spend a further £200 million in the next five years to ensure the facilities warranted by an international airport are available to its passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Deputy Pat Carey referred to the possibility in the past year of opening a second airport in Dublin. Those of us committed to the north side of Dublin have our own views on that.  It is vitally important we continue to invest in Dublin Airport at Collinstown to ensure we have an international airport of the highest standard for national and international passengers.  The decision of the Government not to support the idea of a second airport was the right one, as will be proven in time.  At present ten million passengers are catered for at Dublin Airport and future investment will ensure 14 million passengers can be catered for.</P>
    <P>In the chief executive's report he states that Aer Rianta operates on a partnership basis in dealing with all matters which affect the company. He said that constructive participation will underpin its success in the future and provide the company with the basis for implementing such an approach.</P>
    <P>TEAM Aer Lingus experienced great difficulties in 1992.  I had the opportunity to speak in the Seanad on 5 November 1992 when I was one of the first politicians to recommend, as part of a restructuring programme, an employee shareholding option scheme.</P>

He had no other choice as a firm commitment had been made by him and the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to STAD and the Louth residents. They were honour bound to pursue this case and the course the Minister of State has taken is the right one.  It is unfortunate it took the intervention of the Independents, especially that of the Minister of State's constituency colleague, Deputy Fox, threatening to bring down the Government, to ensure that justice began to be <Col N="988" /> seen to be done for the campaigners against Sellafield from Dundalk.</P>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Stagg, for his vigorous action.  He was the first Minister in the Irish Government to take on the issue of Sellafield.  He was the first to go to the UK and seek to be actively involved in the public inquiry into NIREX.  He played a strong role with our civil servants whom I also commend for their role, and helped bring about the defeat of NIREX.  He deserves enormous credit and it is good to see him take this brief for the Labour Party.</P>

My belief has always been that, under Article 170 of the EU Treaty and Article 147 of Euratom Treaty, we should have taken the British Government to court 35 to 40 years ago or at least 20 to 25 years ago.  An appalling list of accidents and incidents at the Sellafield complex has made the Irish Sea the most contaminated in the world and has led to the release of dangerous emissions.  It has resulted in a situation where the residents of County Louth and County Dublin are vindicated in what they are doing.  The correct approach now is to fully support those who are taking the action and I commend the Minister of State for making a U-turn.</P>

      <P>I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague Deputy Broughan.  I am glad my colleague, the former Minister of State, has joined us because I hoped to have the opportunity to pay tribute to the work he has done.  I agree with Deputy Broughan that he approached this case in a strong way and pulled no punches. He went to the UK, took on the British authorities on their own ground and largely won the <Col N="989" /> argument he put forward.  It was the first time any progress was made and it was made by my two colleagues, Deputy Howlin, as Minister for the Environment, and Deputy Stagg.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to people on this subject for 40 years in County Louth, at local authority level and at Dáil level.  I have listened to speakers at meetings and to numerous experts telling us what we should and could not do.  I refused to attend the conference organised in Drogheda because I did not believe and still do not that British Nuclear Fuels should be given a platform to tell us lies about the situation in Sellafield, because it has been doing so for 40 years.  We in County Louth are the nearest neighbours to Sellafield as the crow flies and nearer than many cities and counties in the UK.</P>
      <P>During the election campaign, I listened every day of the week to people who told me that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil had an agreed arrangement that they would underwrite all the costs of the residents' group in Dundalk. They would pay for all the research and legal fees.  They would give them an open cheque book. My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, led the charge in that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> That is what they will do from now on.  Every time a U-turn is attempted, the Government will be caught with its pants down.  That is what happened last night in this House because of the Fine Gael motion and the attitude taken by the Independent Members.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Howlin was Minister for the Environment, he set up a series of meetings with the residents' group and kept us all advised as to what was happening.  He did not tell them lies; he told them the truth.  They had a good understanding. He appointed a senior official in his Department to liaise with them and they had an open door to the Department at all times.  He only promised them what was possible within national and international law.  There was a fair relationship and understanding between the Dundalk group and the former Ministers, Deputy Howlin and Deputy Stagg.  That was all smashed to pieces within a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister to tell the people of County Louth the truth.  What is happening and what will he do?  From 7 October until now, the situation has changed about five times.  The people of County Louth are confused about this Government's position.  What will the Minister do?  What is the Government prepared to pay? Will it pay for the research and how much will it allocate?  Will the Minister join them in the case or let them take it themselves?  Will the case be taken with the inclusion of the State?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to resume and to be uninterrupted.  What took place here earlier was a disgrace.  I apologise if I, in any way, answered the far side of the House and not you.  I and a number of other people in my party wanted to contribute to this debate without interruption but unfortunately Deputy Stagg has not covered himself in glory.  That follows on from the way in which he behaved when in Government.</P>
      <P>I reiterate we have inherited a legacy of indecision and inaction by the previous Government. This Government is fully committed to the principle behind the motion.  The Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who has responsibility in this area, and I have worked tirelessly since the formation of the Government to reconcile the difficulties in this case.  The Cabinet has met on at least three occasions to discuss this case in detail.  There have been constant meetings between Ministers in the intervening period and constant contact with the residents.  Unfortunately a legacy of suspicion has been engendered over the years because of their dealings with various political parties.  It is high time we knuckled down and did not play politics with this issue.  I do not question the view of any Member in relation to Sellafield and I would expect they would not question mine.  My record in this regard is second to none and I challenge anyone to say otherwise.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister I have endeavoured to do my utmost to assist these people as much as possible and even they would acknowledge that, although relations between the Government and themselves are strained.  The Government is prepared to meet them next week in an effort to work in a spirit of co-operation so as to properly establish the research necessary to ground a case against BNFL.  A case should have been taken by the previous Government if there was evidence against BNFL but the State and all political parties neglected to take that case.  The residents have taken it upon themselves to take that case and we have to assist them.  I would be willing to assist them 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motion and am pleased the Government has agreed to accept it. So long as I am a Member, this Government will be totally committed to protecting its citizens from the potential harmful effects of radioactivity. This is not an issue on which anyone should wish to score political points.  It is a critical issue which is a threat hanging over all our heads and which, without warning, could tragically devastate our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> I reinforce the views of the Government as expressed earlier by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Jacob.  The Government wishes to be co-operative and supportive of the County Louth residents in respect of their efforts.  We must be mindful that we are here as a body to represent the views of the public.  To the best of my ability I have always attempted to represent accurately the views of my constituents.  I have done so on this issue and in the past number of days I have taken the opportunity to speak with constituents on their views on the nuclear industry and, in particular, their views on Windscale, Sellafield and THORP or whatever other derivative British Nuclear Fuels has put on activities at this location.</P>
    <P>No one person to whom I have spoken proffered support for THORP or British Nuclear Fuels' efforts to develop that part of Britain as some kind of a nuclear trash can.  We as a nation examined the nuclear power option in the past. We conducted feasibility studies and concluded that the risks associated with such an approach so far outweighed any possible benefits, that as a concept it should be banished, never to be resurrected. Yet within 60 miles of our coastline and less than 30 minutes flying time of our capital city sits one of the greatest monsters of Europe.</P>
    <P>We should not be lulled into the false sense of security that BNFL is a highly experienced and professional body that can ensure a disaster will not occur.  Accidents occur in all businesses and walks of life on a regular basis.  Why should Sellafield be different?  The nuclear industry is not. The consequences of a simple accident in the British nuclear industry could have a more tragic impact on the people of this country than the famine of l847 which, even with the recent apology from the British authorities, still leaves a scar on the nation.  I am not scaremongering or being over dramatic.  Numerous previously unreported serious accidents in the British nuclear industry on Britain's west coast were uncovered only by the BBC and <i>The Scotsman</i> as part of investigative journalism.  We are being asked to trust the people in charge of this lethal industry when they regularly cover up mistakes.  We cannot stand idly by.  We must show tangible support for the four people who have taken this fight to the courts and succeeded.  They have shown BNFL that there is legitimate resistance here to the nuclear fuel industry.  Fianna Fáil spelt out its commitment on this matter in its position paper of April l997.  The Government has started the ball rolling with its commitment to research.  We must now be prepared to fund further action as required.</P>
    <P>To take on BNFL and eliminate once and for all the threat of nuclear fallout, especially from plants on Britain's western seaboard, STAD has won the right to substantive action against BNFL. There are complex legal and technical issues involved.  I would welcome the views of the Attorney General on this issue and on the strategy necessary to win the case on behalf of the <Col N="1000" /> Irish people.  Until now the people of STAD in Dundalk have fought alone against enormous odds.  They have carried a torch for this nation when past Governments failed them.  They deserve our acknowledgement and support.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been unambiguous in its objectives regarding Sellafield and her sister stations. We want them closed forever.  The acceptance of this motion is the start of the first serious support by any Government for the group concerned.  It is my earnest wish that we will see the closure of these potential lethal plants by the end of this millennium, if not sooner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Miss Fox Miss Fox">
      <NameTxt>Miss Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I thank the Government for accepting the motion and by doing so acknowledging that the Dundalk residents are justified in taking legal action against BNFL.  I do not believe it was ever the intention of the County Louth residents to attract so much political attention. They have stated on many occasions they are not aligned to any political party or person.  That is the only position such a group could take.  They did not ask Fianna Fáil to specifically refer to them in their environmental policy printed prior to the general election in which it stated that in Government it would ensure the case taken by the Dundalk residents would be fully funded and, if necessary, taken to the higher courts.  Fianna Fáil took it on itself to give that pledge and it should now honour its commitment.</P>
      <P>The Opposition who tabled this motion can only now afford to make the type of demands it failed to implement during its terms in office. Deputy Gormley, who raised this matter on the Adjournment last week and kindly shared time with me on that occasion, has not been acknowledged in this debate.  It was at that point the attention of the main Opposition party was drawn to this matter.</P>
      <P>This should not be a political issue.  Sellafield is a grave public concern.  It affects all our citizens and, more importantly, future generations.  I visited Sellafield and the THORP reprocessing plant last August.  BNFL is a profit making company which reprocesses nuclear fuel from other countries. It takes nuclear fuel from approximately 30 reactors located in nine countries worldwide and reprocesses their fuel.  In other words, it brings the spent nuclear fuel of the world to our doorstep in the interest of making a profit.  During this process it ships nuclear fuel up the Irish Sea to the port of Barrow where it is unloaded and taken by train to the THORP plant.  It is stored and monitored at Sellafield where it is eventually reprocessed.  Such reprocessing means that radioactive materials are emitted and released into the Irish Sea, again in the interest of making a profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>BNFL is actively pursuing as many contracts as possible.  It depends to a large extent on information from the countries whose fuel it reprocesses. Therefore, misinformation from another country could suddenly become our problem. This is a grave concern when a number of heavily <Col N="1001" /> populated developing countries, such as India and China, are looking more and more towards nuclear power to provide energy in their countries. I am aware of only one other facility similar to Sellafield and that is located in France.  It stands to reason, therefore, that BNFL will increase its business.</P>
    <P>The contracts actively being pursued by BNFL are being pursued without the facility of a permanent site to store intermediate radioactive waste due to the wise decision to reject the possibility of NIREX's underground depository.  This, combined with the Beaufort Dyke arms incident, does nothing to reassure me the British Government is forthcoming with important information.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last week that research carried out by Carmel Mothersill shows a link between genomic instability and low levels of ionizing radiation.  This research has been confirmed by renowned scientific institutions, such as the Harvard School of Public Health.  These serious matters need to be addressed by the Irish Government on behalf of all our citizens, but unfortunately the silence of successive Governments has been deafening.</P>
    <P>I hope the motion is the first of many steps to address the complex problems associated with Sellafield.  I will closely monitor progress on the meeting to be set up with the Dundalk residents. Unless concrete proposals are spelt out, accepting this motion will have been nothing more than a token gesture and that is no good to any of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is getting away from the real issue.  The people who have indicated their willingness to pursue this case against Sellafield are seeking the support of the Government, political parties and other individuals to pursue their case.  The basis of the court case should be focused on.  Because of the complex issues involved, compiling fundamental scientific evidence is vital to the case.  The court case will be doomed to failure unless such scientific information is compiled and that will take some time. The RPII is bound to have a volume of data on this area, but it may be necessary to gather more information.  In future meetings between the Minister of State and representatives of the groups I hope concrete arrangements can be made to gather the necessary information and that the difficulty we are discussing can be tackled on a phased basis.  I also hope that when the evidence is compiled the next stage can then be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the Cabinet sub-committee of the last Government which <Col N="1002" /> dealt with Sellafield and nuclear issues.  I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Ahern, left the Chamber because I wanted to say directly to him &mdash; no doubt he will read the Official Report &mdash; that he has done very serious damage to Ireland's position in relation to Sellafield and to the case of the litigants.  On reflection he should take the first available opportunity to return to the House to correct an impression he has left which will linger for a long time, that the State and the litigants have no case and that there is no scientific evidence on which to base a case.  It was highly irresponsible of him to attempt to convey to the House advice given to the Government by its legal advisers about matters, some of which are currently before the High Court, as in the case of the litigants, and about a matter on which the State might yet take a case.  He should correct that.  If he does not, what he stated here about the advice from the Attorney General will come back to haunt this case, undermine it and the position of this country in relation to the Sellafield issue.</P>
      <P>It is highly irresponsible, childish and counterproductive to engage in an exercise of political one-upmanship on this important issue.  It is an attempt to have political one-upmanship that has us here tonight.  The last Government agreed to financially support the case being taken by the four County Louth residents.  Fianna Fáil, for its own reasons in Opposition, decided that it had to go one better than that and announced it would fully fund the case.  It has now effectively pulled back from that pre-election promise, but it created an expectation it is finding it cannot fulfil.</P>
      <P>There is no greater threat to the security of the people of this island than that from nuclear installations in the neighbouring state of Britain.  An accident in any one of those, including Sellafield, has the potential to literally wipe us out.  The insidious nuclear pollution and radioactivity from those installations poses an enormous threat to the health, food and environment of the people of this country.  It ought to be the job of this House, and whatever Government happens to be in power, to do whatever it can to minimise that threat and ensure the people of this country get the maximum protection from those threats posed to us.</P>
      <P>The last Government also inherited the case taken by the four County Louth residents.  I was one of the first Ministers in the last Government to meet some of the litigants.  It was our view in the last Government that the four residents who courageously took that case should not be exposed to the costs of it or, more particularly, to the enormous costs that might arise if they were to lose it.  That is a consideration that must be taken into account in any case.  Anyone familiar with court cases will know that costs primarily arise when one loses a case.  That is when the question of the awarding of costs arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In committing itself to supporting the residents and assuring them they would not be exposed to those costs, it was the view of the last Government <Col N="1003" /> that a certain degree of caution had to be exercised so that the taxpayer would not be exposed to effectively writing a blank cheque for the lawyers of BNFL if the worst happened and the case were lost.  That was the first consideration. The fundamental consideration was that the residents should not be exposed to the costs of the case.</P>
    <P>A second consideration related to the preparation of this case which affects not only the four citizens who are bringing it or their legal representatives, but all the people.  It was the view that the best possible case ought to be prepared. That involved a certain amount of legal costs in the preparation of the case for which payment would have to be made.  The payment put forward by the last Government was a down payment on that cost, the start of the process.  It was not attended by any conditions and there was no question of it being a full and final payment or whatever terminology was subsequently used by the Government.</P>
    <P>Another matter was the preparation of the scientific evidence and the carrying out of research.  There were aspects to that such as the making available to litigants of the evidence, information and research available to the State at present and the preparation of such additional scientific evidence as would assist the case.  In that respect a degree of co-operation was required between the State and the litigants.  It was the view of the last Government that the State ought to be released as a defendant in this case.  It is my view and advice, if I can be so presumptuous as to offer it, that the State should be released from being a defendant in this case because no matter what Government holds office it will have difficulty dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate the Government has politicised this issue in a way that is extremely divisive. It should not have done that.  Its difficulty with the concept of fully funding the case arises directly from its attempt to politicise it in the run up to the last election.  It should depoliticise it. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, in particular, should come back into the House and undo the damage he did tonight by effectively undermining the State's position, that of the litigants and the national case that many of us have been making for years in relation to Sellafield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for allowing me to say a few words on this issue as a Dundalk man.  Initially Sellafield was not a priority for me nor for the masses that live in County Louth.  Fianna Fáil held a public meeting early in May and including the Deputies and Fianna Fáil personnel, less than 36 people attended.  Nevertheless, I plead guilty to complacency about the brooding menace presenting itself to the people of County Louth.  I acknowledge Senator O'Dowd's awareness of this menace. He had convened two conferences on the matter in Drogheda.</P>
      <P>My awareness of the menace has been heightened by the recent publication of unacceptable statistics by the North Eastern Health Board. These show that the rate of cancer deaths is 15 per cent higher in County Louth.  This is unacceptable and I hope this Government will make continuous funding available for the North Eastern Health Board to conduct much needed research into this unhappy statistic.</P>
      <P>Deaths from cancer are consistently higher in County Louth and its neighbouring County Down.  There has to be a rational reason for this and it is the duty of this Government, through the North Eastern Health Board, to fund a continuous research programme to elicit the facts and to take whatever measures are necessary to eradicate the scourge of cancer.  The man on the street has had the uneasy feeling that Sellafield has contributed to this.  In 1957 there was the unexplained phenomenon of a discharge from Sellafield which hit St. Louis's Convent in Dundalk. Some years later this resulted in an unusually high proportion of handicapped children born to girls who did their leaving certificate in that year. This too has heightened my awareness of the problem.</P>
      <P>Sadly, Sellafield has been used over the years by those in Opposition as a stick with which to beat the Government, none more so than the present Government who raised the matter in the Dáil every six months in the past five years.  I would like a consensus with every party uniting to tackle this problem.  The four people who have taken the burden of fighting this case upon themselves are courageous.  However, the money provided for them, initially by my Government is petty cash.  A sum of £200,000 cannot fund the necessary legal expertise to fight this case.  This case should be fought by the State.  Four ordinary citizens are unlikely to win this case but a State, particularly given our recent eminence in Europe, would have some chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been hypocritical in including this matter in its manifesto.  It gave a solemn commitment to the people of County Louth that it would fund this court case on an ongoing basis. Now, four months into its term it has done an about-turn.  Like Deputy Gilmore I am sorry the Minister who is from the area concerned, has chosen to turn his back on this assembly.  During the suspension I told him what I would say here. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern is an <Col N="1005" /> accomplished young man and he has a definite future in politics.  However, tonight I have to dub him the &ldquo;Minister for Bluster&rdquo; because he came into the House determined to pull down the scrum.  He frustrated Deputy Stagg who did significant work in his Ministry, attended conferences all over Europe and opposed Sellafield at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern, and to a lesser extent, Deputy Kirk, must take responsibility for what the people of County Louth were told in that unholy manifesto. As a political cynic, who is sometimes cynical of my own party, I believe that when in Government, a party should be morally and legally obliged to implement promises included in an election manifesto.  Fianna Fáil has done a U-turn on this issue and it would not have moved but for the threat by Deputy Fox.</P>
    <P>The Government is in a difficult position and political expediency has won the day.  This is a shameful example of stroke politics.  At a time when the country is condemning this assembly, we need some honesty.  We need a united, all-party approach to Sellafield.  The State, on behalf of the people should give continuous backing to the four people who had the courage to take this court case on board.</P>
    <P>I name the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, not only as the Minister for bluster but as the architect of that inducement in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  He got a magnificent tally of 10,000 votes in County Louth.  I was proud of him because there has not been a Minister from Dundalk since the early days of the State.  I would like to think he will advance greatly in the world of politics but this has not been his finest hour.  He spoke from the side of his mouth when he assured the residents that when in Government, the soldiers of destiny would deliver.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Fianna Fáil party stand here tonight with their trousers around their ankles.  They should pull them up as quickly as they can, cover their dignity, honour their commitment and take care of the interests of the people of County Louth and this State.  The interest, health and welfare of the people of County Louth should be paramount to the Minister. Political advancement will come naturally, but not by giving bum promises to the people of County Louth.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Dowd, a member of my party, for the work he has done in this area over the past three to four years.  He has informed debate in my party and brought us up to speed with the concerns of the people in County Louth, as was recognised by his constituency colleague, Deputy McGahon.  As someone who has proactively helped this campaign, we owe him a great debt and I am sure that in the future, the people of Louth will agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential we clarify this motion.  The Minister said &ldquo;we are fully committed to the principle of this motion.&rdquo; That is not good enough.  This House intends to support the exact motion on the <Col N="1006" /> Order Paper and to give to the people who took this brave legal challenge against BNFL the necessary financial assistance towards research and legal costs as well as the appropriate technical expertise and information.  It is not the principle of the motion, but its substance, which must be supported.  I agree with my colleagues who said it has been a very bad night for this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Successes were gained in relation to Sellafield over the past years particularly in the stance taken by the previous Government on NIREX when it courageously went to the planning process and was part of the opposition which ensured that BNFL's ludicrous rock cavern proposal did not go ahead.  The ministerial task force established by the previous government was also a success. Both of these were achieved because there was cross party support.  The moment we lose that cross party support is when BNFL and every other vested interest which supports the nuclear industry in Britain will laugh at this Parliament. We must adopt a united stance on this issue; I know it is supported by every Member of this House.  The kind of histrionics we have witnessed tonight show this House in a bad light and how irrelevant we are to many people in the public who are looking for leadership on this issue from all sides.  I encourage the respective spokespersons on all sides of the House to do what they can over the coming weeks to come together on this crucially important issue.</P>
    <P>I am on the Seanad record as saying that until we take this message to Britain and win over public opinion there we will get nowhere.  One quarter of the entire power source in Britain derives from BNFL and the nuclear industry.  BNFL and the nuclear industry is a massive vested interest which has over 15 years of contracts on its books. Their profits over the past ten years exceeded £500 million; that is not peanuts, we are not taking on some small player here.</P>
    <P>This issue fits into the idea of the east-west relationship between Britain and Ireland and should be the number one issue on the talks agenda in Northern Ireland.  It crosses the Catholic-Protestant, Nationalist-Unionist divide and goes to the heart of the relationship which should exist between Britain and Ireland.  Adopting a united stance would say to the British Government that we are not prepared to allow this time bomb to rest on our doorstep any longer.  We must approach this issue as a united Parliament; if we do that we will succeed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I fully support the motion.  As a Socialist Party TD, I salute the residents of County Louth who have pushed the issue this far.  It is not the first time ordinary people have had to intervene in the face of the State's dereliction of duty.  The State has a primary responsibility to protect its people and should have been providing leadership on this issue for decades instead of forcing residents to lead it by the nose to carry out its duty to the people.  Lame <Col N="1007" /> excuses may have existed for nuclear power generated energy in the post-war period but, in view of what we now know, it is criminal in the extreme to persist with nuclear fission as a basis for nuclear power and with the treatment of waste nuclear material.  Experience shows the kind of disasters which undoubtedly will impend. We do not yet have the same level of proof about the microwave radiation which emanates from mobile phone systems, an issue about which some of us are very concerned, as we do about nuclear power.  For that reason, we are rubbished when we advise caution.  However, in relation to nuclear fission, we have the evidence of Windscale, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl; we have graphic detail of the risk posed to humanity by nuclear power.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of the arrogance of the nuclear industry that it persists with an all-out attempt to develop an industry based on the most lethal substance known to humankind.  That is what we are dealing with.  This issue is not one which concerns just the people of Louth; it concerns the people of Ireland in general and, indeed, people all over the world.  This is an international issue; fallout knows no boundaries.  This issue is as serious, if not more serious, than the destruction of the rainforest which is an also an international issue of concern to us even though we are far removed from it.</P>
      <P>The THORP plant at Sellafield must be closed down; nuclear fission must be eliminated as a source of power generation and the nuclear industry, particularly the privatised BNFL, should not be trusted.  There is a fundamental conflict between its drive for super profits and the safety of the Irish and British people.  Any building worker faced with a conflict between profit and safety will, nine times out of ten, allow profit to come first.  Last April, BNFL was fined the maximum possible fine of £20,000 for total disregard for safety at its Sellafield plant.  We should not only pursue the legal route in this case; there should be a major campaign to lobby public opinion in Britain to win over the millions of British people who are also faced with this threat.  We should also lobby the trade union movement in Britain because thousands of workers and their families depend on the nuclear industry for a living. I am reminded of the biblical saying &ldquo;beat your swords into ploughshares&rdquo;; we should advocate that the marvellous ingenuity which has helped to create the technology for the nuclear industry should now be redirected constructively away from it and towards human advancement. That ingenuity and the billions of pounds channelled into this industry could be directed towards producing safe, cheap and renewable sources of energy in the areas of electricity generation, transport systems and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Government in Britain should be held to have a major responsibility on this issue and the Irish Labour Party should use whatever influence it has on it.  If the Labour Government <Col N="1008" /> in Britain were a democratic, socialist Government it could, instead of aping Thatcherism, lead the movement to close down the nuclear industry there.  It could take BNFL and the Electricity Generating Board back into public ownership and management, close down the nuclear generating and nuclear waste processing sectors and reemploy the thousands of workers involved in a planned way in alternative industries.  If we approach the ordinary British, working class people, the workers dependent on this industry, in this way and pursue the legal approach to the limit, we could achieve success on an issue crucial to the safety of our people, the British people and humanity as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPerry" hpid="Mr. Perry Mr. Perry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Perry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me pay tribute to my predecessor the former Deputy, Ted Nealon, who served the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim well. When history is written it will show that he brought about huge changes in the development of that constituency.  I intend to share my time with Deputy Michael Ring.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question regarding the removal of cargo freight into Knock Airport, the Minister stated that the operating licences granted to Irish air carriers by the Department in accordance with Regulation No. 2407/92 do not impose any conditions which oblige the licensee to provide any particular services or to operate on any specific route.  The Minister should have a say in certain cases.  I appreciate the Minister's reply regarding the conditions which apply to the granting of air transport operating licences and, in particular, the information regarding the company which has ceased the carriage of cargo on all its services, not just those operating to Knock Airport.  The cessation of this air service has far more serious implications for the west and north-west than for other parts of the country which have alternative air cargo services.  Families and firms in Counties Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon are now left totally without a regular air cargo service. This is one more example of the loss of an important service for the people of this part of the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the disadvantage which this poses for existing business firms in the area and for the attraction of industry, which is very important for the west at the moment, there is a particular hardship involved in the loss of the air transport funeral service which was provided by the operating company in recent years.  There was a significant convenience for a large number of <Col N="1009" /> families in the west when a relative or family member died abroad and was being brought home for burial.  Families will again be faced with the cost and traffic difficulties of bringing the remains of relatives to Dublin Airport rather than having a proper funeral service available through Knock.</P>
    <P>I understand that before the cessation of this cargo traffic was announced it was the intention of the board of Knock Airport to provide a funeral home at the airport to further facilitate this much used service.  The Minister stated that Ryanair felt this was a problem, but the management of Knock Airport can solve the problem by providing a funeral parlour at Knock Airport.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider what steps she might take to remedy this matter or to encourage the operating company to provide even an occasional service to facilitate, in particular, this important funeral service?  Would she also consider whether, in view of this total loss of air cargo services for a considerable portion of the west, the EU essential air services provision, which allows for a subsidy to encourage passenger service to operate in remote and disadvantaged regions and which would not normally attract a commercial operator, might be extended to include cargo service to Knock?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Perry for sharing his time with me and congratulate him on bringing this very important motion before the Dáil.  I understand the Minister only issues the licences and that she has little power in regard to this.  I compliment Mr. Cathal Duffy and the board on the excellent job they are doing in Knock.  Five funerals a week used to come into Knock Airport. The board was considering building its own church and mortuary there.  I condemn Ryanair for treating the west with contempt.  It is not the Minister's function, but perhaps she would contact the managing director of Ryanair to ask that company to reconsider restoring cargo services to the west.  She might also try to help the board of Knock Airport to get a second carrier into the airport because there are dangers in monopolies. The west has suffered and I am asking to Minister to try to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether this was Deputy Perry's maiden speech, but I congratulate him on it and on having gained a seat here.  I join him in his tributes to the retired Deputy, Ted Nealon.  I also praise the Deputy's commitment and doggedness in this matter because the matter is outside my remit.  The Minister of State, Deputy Tom Moffatt, who is here on other business, has spoken to me about this matter, as has Deputy Beverly Cooper-Flynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ryanair has ceased the carriage of cargo on all air services, including those operating to Knock Airport.  That company has advised my Department that because of this decision it no longer has <Col N="1010" /> the handling facilities appropriate to the carrying of human remains and, therefore, could not guarantee to handle such remains with the dignity and respect that would be required.  Death is traumatic for anybody, but it is even more so for families waiting to bring the mortal remains of a loved one home.  I sympathise with any family facing the prospect.  At a time of trauma it would be comforting to know that the last journey of the deceased and those who travel with them is handled with efficiency and dignity.  I regret the loss of this facility at Knock Airport and all other airports served by Ryanair.  It is, however, a matter outside my control.</P>
    <P>I share the disquiet of the Deputies of the area who have spoken here about the matter.  It has been probed by officials in my Department and they have been informed that this was a commercial decision of the airline in question and, as such, a matter for the company.  Deputy Ring has acknowledged that this is the difficulty I face. However, on foot of this debate and queries from my parliamentary colleague, the Minister of State, Deputies Cooper-Flynn, Perry, Ring and other Deputies who are not here, I will ask my officials to go back and talk again to Ryanair.  I am aware that the board intended to build a small church where people could receive bodies and grieve with dignity.</P>
    <P>The substance of the matter raised relates to the funding subsidy provided to Knock Airport to enable it to extend its services.  Everybody knows the history of Knock.  There is a consensus that it is not just a boggy place but a good commercial enterprise, well run, and with further potential.  Deputy Jim Higgins was always in favour of it even when his own party and the Minister at the time, Deputy Jim Mitchell, were firmly against it.  The recent success of Knock in terms of increasing passenger numbers and profits is heartening.  Passenger numbers in 1996 were more than 20 per cent up on the previous year's figures.  The Exchequer has made a considerable investment in Knock Airport.  Under the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charlie Haughey, Knock Airport received grants amounting to £9.8 million which were later written off.  Further funds, amounting to over £200,000, were made available from the European Regional Development Fund.  There was a marketing package amounting to £270,000 in 1993 and £67,000 in 1995.  All the regional airports benefit under the scheme.  Knock airport will receive £250,000 in the period 1996-9.  This is a considerable sum but it is well deserved and will be well spent.  I hope to visit the airport shortly in an official capacity.</P>
    <P>I strongly align myself with the remarks about the efficient way the board runs its business.  It continues to engender much activity at the airport. This is a story of courage and determination to ensure its survival.  I wish the board well and will ask my officials to explore the matter further with Ryanair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  The flooding problems in Gort, south Galway received widespread coverage two years ago when many farms were flooded, livelihoods were threatened and Gort town was covered in water.  Large areas did not return to normality until the following year. As the House is aware, many houses were flooded and substantial compensation payments were made to farmers and those who had to be relocated.  Will the Minister indicate how much was paid out in compensation overall?</P>
      <P>People living in the area were lucky last year when the flooding problems did not recur but if one is to believe the met.  office they may not be so lucky this year.  The big question is why do the floods cause so much damage so often.  This is the question to which people living in the area have not been able to get an answer.  The estimated cost of the damage is in excess of £10 million.</P>
      <P>With this in mind an in-depth survey was commissioned. Has this been completed and, if so, when will the report be published?  It is vitally important the results of the survey are presented to the people of Gort and south Galway at a public meeting.  As the House is aware, a number of public meetings have been held.  These have been helpful in the sense that the person leading the investigation, Mr. Peach, has been able to outline to ordinary people what he and his team are trying to do.  The previous Government estimated that the survey which was expected to take approximately 22 months to complete would cost £750,000.</P>
      <P>Many experts have investigated the flooding problems in south Galway.  This is the mother of all surveys and is supposed to provide all the answers.  Will the report be published and will its findings be presented, as promised, at a public meeting in Gort?  Will the Government provide the necessary finance to implement the proposals contained therein?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the matter raised by the Deputy and thank him for allowing me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Cullen, to provide the House with information on the position in relation to the report on the investigation of flooding problems in the Gort-Ardrahan area of south Galway.  As the Deputy said, the report was commissioned in August 1995 and the overall study is being undertaken by the engineering consultants Jennings O'Donovan and Partners of Sligo and the West Sussex based water company Southern Water Global and was expected to take approximately 20 months to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the winter of 1996 being particularly dry the hydrological-hydrogeological monitoring had to be extended to May 1997 and the study was therefore prolonged by some months.  A preliminary <Col N="1012" /> report was produced two months after the study commenced which set out the objectives for the overall study which were to quantitatively define the flooding problem; to define the hydrological-hydrogeological processes to assess the effects of climate change; to quantify and rank the environmental importance and economic value of the various turloughs, streams, land areas, wetlands etc, and to propose engineering and other possible solutions and evaluate their economic costs, social, environmental and archaeological implications.</P>
    <P>A draft interim report was submitted by the consultants in September 1996 and a public meeting was held in Gort on Thursday, 7 November 1996 at which summary documents were distributed to the local people in attendance.  A copy of the full report which ran to five volumes was also available for inspection on the night and the meeting was well attended and received a good reaction from the local people.  A copy of the report was also lodged in the local library in Gort for inspection.</P>
    <P>The monitoring, analyses and study have been continued and the Minister of State has received a draft final report which is being examined by his officials.  The report runs to eight volumes and includes approximately 50 large scale maps and other A3 size drawings which are incorporated in the report.  When officials at the Office of Public Works have concluded their evaluation of these volumes there is a commitment to present the report at a public meeting in Gort similar to the one held in 1996.  Because of the size of the document copies will not be freely available but a copy will be available at the public meeting to be arranged.  A copy will also be lodged in the local library for inspection.</P>
    <P>While the draft final report is in the hands of the Minister of State's officials, the economics have to be finalised.  Financial commitments cannot be considered until an economic cost benefit analysis has been completed and the financial implications will be a matter for consideration with the Estimates on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>I commend the Deputy, Deputy Michael Kitt and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for explaining to the people of the area what was involved and for being open and transparent.  The Minister of State will act in a similar manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The upgrading of the Accident and Emergency and Out-Patients Departments, medical records, day ward, Endoscopy and Radiology units at Mullingar General Hospital must be given priority.  The State has already invested £11 million of taxpayers' money in providing an extension for these units, to furnish and equip them.  The public, through a very active local committee, raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to purchase a CAT scan for this hospital which, with other equipment, remains unused because of insufficient staff for their operation.  A <Col N="1013" /> full complement of 80 staff, comprised of nurses, doctors, registrars, attendants and so on is required at a total cost to the Exchequer of approximately £1.5 million to upgrade the service at present available to the public.</P>
      <P>A service is currently being provided in that area in the most appalling conditions, with the Accident and Emergency and Radiology Departments housed in pre-fab buildings constructed in 1968 which have long since passed their functional sell-by date.  The staff providing this service must be commended on tolerating the poor facilities and their terrible working conditions.</P>
      <P>Progress must be made immediately.  There is need for immediate sanction of this staffing complement to bring these services on stream, thereby maximising taxpayers' investment by utilising the £11 million already allocated and to protect the radiology equipment, already installed, from deteriorating if not brought into service fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children told us last week in reply to a parliamentary question that this matter would be considered in the preparation of the 1998 Estimates.  I am glad that the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, is present since this hospital is located in her constituency and I know the interest she will take in it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to use considerable force at the Cabinet table to ensure that the staff complement for this hospital is sanctioned immediately so that the services so badly needed in the area can be provided for the people of Westmeath and Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for allowing me to contribute on this issue of extreme importance to the people of Westmeath and Longford.  I am also glad that the Minister for Public Enterprise is present to take note of what we say.</P>
      <P>I cannot over-emphasise to the Minister for Health and Children the importance of providing the requisite staff to allow the important new facilities within phase 2A of this hospital development to be opened.  I recall urging my party colleague, Deputy Howlin, as Minister for Health, to give the go-ahead to this development.  Indeed I was delighted he provided the first tranche of funds amounting to £5.5 million for that purpose carried on by his successor, the outgoing Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan.  As Deputy McGrath said, a total of approximately £11 million has been expended, phase 2A has been completed and handed over to the Midland Health Board on 30 July 1996.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that we should discuss this matter since the local papers this evening carry a huge headline reading &ldquo;Three million pounds in medical equipment lies idle in Mullingar General Hospital&rdquo;, approximately £300,000 of which was raised locally for the purchase of a CAT scan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet the fully equipped X-ray, Casualty, Accident and Emergency and day bed units remain <Col N="1014" /> unopened, forcing the Midland Health Board to spend huge amounts of time and money maintaining old equipment in those old departments described by Deputy McGrath costing nearly as much as its replacement.</P>
    <P>Surely it is incumbent on the Department of Health and Children not merely to provide the necessary buildings and infrastructure urgently required in the Mullingar area, because of the dilapidated nature of the structures staff and patients have to contend with, but also to ensure the necessary finance is provided for the immediate recruitment of the requisite staff at all levels to enable these units to be opened.</P>
    <P>Indeed the current position never should have arisen but did as a consequence of downright bad planning.  Staff must be provided simultaneously with the completion of building such units.  The ordinary people of Mullingar are asking the reason for the delay.  It is difficult for me or any other Member to inform them that it is occasioned by a lack of financial resources at a time when the Exchequer is awash with funds. What better place to begin the process of equitable economic distribution than allocating sufficient funds to permit the recruitment of the full staffing complement to allow phase 2A of this hospital to be opened?  Those staffing requirements amount to a total of 81 at a cost of approximately £1.6 million, which includes those required for the X-ray, Accident and Emergency, Out-Patients, day bed unit and Endoscopy suite in addition to a third consultant surgeon.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that all the necessary extra equipment has been installed, the guarantees on which have commenced.  The Minister will be well aware that radiology equipment, if not used, deteriorates and that the most expensive part of an X-ray machine is the X-ray tube which deteriorates most quickly.  These units cost £30,000 to £40,000 each with the result that tube failure due to prolonged non-usage is very expensive.</P>
    <P>Existing staff find the overall position extraordinary, having been of the view that because of the dilapidated state of the old pre-fab buildings, when the extension was completed, they could move in immediately.  The general public is perplexed. If the opening process is to begin in January next funds need to be committed for that purpose immediately.</P>
    <P>I understand proposals were advanced recently to break the deadlock to permit the new services to start along with the CAT scan, mammography and digital screening units.  It is also my understanding that there has been a trial run of the CAT scan but that this facility cannot be made available to the public until the necessary staff are provided.</P>
    <P>I had hoped the Minister for Health and Children would be present.  I am glad that there is this representation of Members from the midlands who know how important these services are to the people of the area, who know also that this is not an effort to politicise the issue.  We urgently <Col N="1015" /> require those funds to allow phase 2A to commence.</P>

Due to the size and improved lay-out of the development and its expected increased usage, the Midland Health Board estimates it will require an additional 80 staff at an annual cost of £1.5 million to have these facilities fully operational. Indeed when other running costs are taken into account it is expected the facility will cost up to £2.5 million per annum.</P>
      <P>Some progress has been made in bringing these new facilities into use.  For example, the existing Out-Patients' Department was relocated in the new building at the end of 1996 using two of the four new OPD suites and, since then, medical records staff have been providing services to the out-patient clinics from the new building.</P>
      <P>As a first step it may be possible to extend the use of the Out-Patients Department but it is clear that some units must be opened simultaneously, particularly the Accident and Emergency and X-ray Departments.  I am sure Members are aware that no money was set aside by the outgoing Government in l997 to allow the commissioning of any portion of that development this year. While there is great anxiety expressed by Opposition Members at present, that is the essential point to be borne in mind.  Discussions on how best to commission these facilities continue between the Department and a group representing management and staff at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that these new facilities should become operational as soon as possible and assure Members that every effort will be made to achieve that objective.  To that end the Department sought funds for new developments in 1998 as part of the 1998 Estimates process, among the key items being the commissioning of phase 2A at this hospital for which funds have been sought. Indeed the Minister for Enterprise has been requesting that these facilities be opened as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This problem arose on 22 September when the school reopened after the summer and was created by the Minister for Education which I hope he will rectify.  A problem had existed earlier in the Shraheens area which the Minister resolved but, in so doing, gave rise to problems in another, Ballyburke, where the children &mdash; since the closure of their local school &mdash; had availed of the transportation service provided for Killawalla, thus ensuring they were picked up at 3 o'clock and reached home by 3.15 p.m. While acknowledging the Minister resolved one problem, I cannot wholeheartedly support him until he has resolved the one remaining.  I will not continue to support him, however, unless he goes the other 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have not been long in politics.  I led a deputation to the previous Minister of State, Deputy Allen, about a problem in Killeen in Louisburgh, and following a request he made a political decision.  He told the officials in his Department what to do about that problem but they did everything in their power to ensure that situation did not develop.  It took them almost two months to place an advertisement in the newspaper and another two months to deal with the tenders, by which time the school tournament was almost over.  They disobeyed the Minister.</P>

      <P>What the Minister did in relation to the Ballyburke area was wrong.  The school had a service for the past 29 years.  A simple way to correct this problem would be to provide a small bus to take 19 children home from school.  The operator lives only a few hundred yards from the school.  We are talking about a cost of £13 to £15 per evening.  These young children are left waiting unsupervised in the cold and wet weather, something which is of great concern to the parents.  It is not right to leave four, five and six year old children waiting unsupervised in a play area. Nobody will take responsibility for this matter. The Minister says it is the responsibility of the board of management but the board of management says it is not its responsibility.  If something happens these young children somebody will have to be responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State will have to deal with many major problems in his Department and I wish him well in his new Ministry.  This is a minor <Col N="1017" /> decision which will not cost a great deal of money.  I ask him to be strong enough to make a favourable decision on this matter.  I know Deputy Cooper-Flynn supports me on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>The parents will not let this issue go away, as they indicated at a recent public meeting. They kept their children out of school for a week although I and other public representatives asked them not to do that because it is wrong to affect the children.  The Minister of State has taken a service away from a community that it has had for 29 years.  I ask him to return that service to the people of Ballyburke.  They were given a guarantee that this service would be provided as it has been for the past 29 years.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not do anything else I ask him to examine the whole school transport issue. The people in the Civil Service appear to run the school transport service and they are afraid to make the right decision in case it will create a precedent, but matters can sometimes be easily resolved.  All that is necessary is to sanction a small amount of money for the provision of an additional bus to bring these children home in the evening.</P>
      <P>I will be the first person to compliment the Minister of State when he makes this decision, which I am sure he will do because he will not let down Deputy Cooper-Flynn or the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt.  It is wrong to have children of four and five years of age waiting unsupervised in a playground in the wet and cold weather.  I ask the Minister of State to sanction the provision of this service and not heed the officials.  If he does not, he will never sanction anything in his Ministry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter.  It gives me an opportunity to outline the position in relation to school transport arrangements for pupils attending Killawalla National School.  My Department has responsibility to ensure the safe delivery of approximately 160,000 primary and post-primary pupils to <Col N="1018" /> schools throughout the country.  It also has responsibility to ensure the State gets the best possible value for the money spent on the provision of this service.  It does not come cheaply. In 1996, the net cost to the taxpayer was in excess of £40 million.</P>
      <P>I should explain that in the organisation of school transport services, routes are planned to ensure every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable, while at the same time ensuring that the school transport vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient and cost effective manner.  To do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended timetables often require some pupils to make an early start in the morning and to wait for some time in the evening.  This is a feature of the school transport scheme throughout the country.  My Department has to consider the operation of the school transport scheme as a whole and the requirement not to breach guidelines which would have financial and policy implications for the transport service in general.</P>
      <P>The position in this case is that there are two buses operating to Killawalla school, a large bus and a minibus.  The minibus operates a double trip whereas previously the services to this school were provided by a contractor's minibus operating three trips.  I understand that from 22 September 1997 the large bus on this service caters for pupils from the Shraheens area.  The minibus now caters for pupils from the Ballyburke and Derreendafderg areas.  This arrangement is being kept under review.</P>
      <P>It was originally intended that a large bus would be used to accommodate all the eligible pupils from the Ballyburke and Shraheens areas immediately after school.  This service could set down the Ballyburke pupils first which would involve a trip of approximately 17 minutes before operating the Shraheens trip without having to return to the school.  However, this option was not availed of by the pupils but could still be implemented if required.  The Department has been requested to provide an additional bus to cater for pupils from the Ballyburke area who have to wait 20 to 25 minutes in the evening.</P>
      <P>The present level of service is considered to be reasonable and adequate in the context of the general operation of the scheme and extra cost would be incurred in providing the additional bus as requested.  Despite the foregoing, and in view of Deputy Ring's moving eloquence and certain new facts brought to my attention today by my colleague, Deputy Cooper-Flynn, I am prepared to have my Department examine this case again to see if a solution can be found.  I cannot give any guarantee to the Deputy but I will examine the matter again tomorrow with a view to finding a solution.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 October 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain persons with disabilities with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  At the end of last August 9,753 people were in receipt of a carer's allowance at an estimated full year cost of £36.4 million.</P>
      <P>Regulations preclude, with very few exceptions, the payment of welfare benefits and allowances concurrently.  An example of one exception is the payment of a widow's pension in addition to disability benefit, at half the rate of payment. However, the payment of carer's allowance in addition to a widow's pension would have major cost implications and I am not convinced that it would be the best use of limited resources.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of improvements in this payment since its introduction in 1990.  In this year's Social Welfare Act a change was introduced to the rule which required that the carer must provide full-time care and attention in order to cater for those situations in which recipients of care attend approved rehabilitation courses. Under the new arrangements, the person may attend a recognised non-residential training course or day care centre.  Furthermore, an additional payment of 50 per cent of the basic rate, was introduced for carers who take care of more than one person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In its Action Programme for the Millennium the Government is committed to progressively relaxing the qualifying criteria for the carer's <Col N="1020" /> allowance to ensure that more carers can get the benefit and increasing the value of the allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>In line with these commitments, I will consider the further development of the scheme in the context of an overall review of the provisions for carers, which is being carried out by my Department and in the light of budgetary considerations.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs</askee>
      <Quest>the rates of payment to benefit recipients for child dependants; and the reason different rates apply to different schemes irrespective of the status of the child.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16412/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum rates of payment for child dependants are set out in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  There are currently three different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients.  The reasons for this are largely historical.  The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the rates be rationalised. Significant progress has been made over the years &mdash; there were thirty six different rates payable in 1987; now there are only three.  further rationalisation would be extremely costly.  The additional annual cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £58 million.</P>
      <P>It is widely recognised that the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to taking up available work opportunities. This issue has been highlighted in various reports, notably the final report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Policy direction in relation to child income support in recent years has, therefore, focused on targeting resources towards the provision of substantial increases in child benefit.  This approach, which centres on making child income support more neutral <i>vis-a-vis</i> the employment status of the parent, has the effect of reducing work disincentives.</P>
      <P>Child benefit remains one of the most effective means of tackling poverty, as it channels resources directly to families.  It is of particular importance to families on low incomes and because it is not withdrawn when an unemployed parent takes up employment and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits such as differential rents, medical cards, etc, it does not act as a disincentive to taking up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention, in the context of reducing disincentives to work, that priority has been given to utilising family income supplement (FIS) as a means of increasing the net return from work to families with children.  Accordingly, in line with a commitment made in the Partnership 2000 Agreement, FIS will be reformed so as to be calculated <Col N="1021" /> on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, as at present.  This will significantly increase the supplements payable under the scheme, thereby increasing the rewards from work.  Since June of this year, FIS is calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions, levies and pension contributions payable.</P>

      <P>The control programme is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.  New approaches and measures are identified and adopted on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Central to future developments will be the use of information technology to target clients for review more effectively and to monitor their continued entitlement.  Better co-operation and <Col N="1022" /> exchange of information with other Departments and State bodies is being progressed actively.</P>
    <P>A review is also planned of the current legislative provisions in relation to offences and penalties together with a review of the powers of the Department's inspectors to ensure that they cover new payment methods and work/employment practices adequately.  In addition, procedures have been introduced which aim to improve the level of recovery of overpayments.  These will be developed further and intensified over the coming months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance is a means-tested payment which is paid to unemployed people between the ages of 18 and 66 who are not entitled to insurance-based unemployment benefit. Payments are means-tested to ensure that the limited resources available are directed at those most in need.  In assessing a person's means for unemployment assistance purposes, account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of any capital or property. In addition, the value of any benefit or privilege enjoyed by an applicant, such as the benefit of board and lodging in the family home, is assessed.</P>
      <P>The students' summer jobs scheme provides income support for less well off third level students who are unable to obtain work during the summer months and are disqualified from claiming unemployment assistance.  Entitlement to the scheme is dependent on the students satisfying a means test similar to that which applies in the case of unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of free board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances, for example, between applicants whose parents are employed <Col N="1023" /> and those who are dependent on social welfare payments.  Otherwise, people living in affluent circumstances would become entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose with limited means or no means at all.</P>
    <P>However, a number of improvements have been made over recent years in the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging.  For instance, in 1991 provision was made for the introduction of a minimum payment of £5 for claimants whose only means were assessed from board and lodging. This minimum payment has been progressively increased to £25.</P>
    <P>The cost of abolishing the assessment of the benefit of board and lodging for unemployment assistance purposes is estimated to be in the region of £20 million in a full year.  The question of making any further improvements in this area would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 18, 21 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a number <Col N="1024" /> of specific proposals directly in relation to social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed as part of the programme to addressing the issue of social exclusion, marginalisation and poverty and to ensure that a two-tiered society does not take root.  A number of key priorities are set out in this context.</P>
    <P>With regard to the family particularly, the Government is committed to protecting the family through political, economic, social and other measures which will support the stability of the family.  Policies will be evaluated to monitor the effect on social policy and key priorities will include a refocusing of the tax and welfare system in favour of the family unit; providing a mechanism to allow women, who take time out for family reasons, to continue contributions for pension purposes and for the establishment of a national mediation service.</P>
    <P>With regard to older people, there is a commitment to provide substantial social welfare increases (including an increase in the old age pension to £100 per week over a five year period) and to increase the value of carer's allowance in real terms.</P>
    <P>There are also commitments concerning the funding of voluntary agencies, and ensuring that social welfare policies do not discriminate against rural areas.</P>
    <P>I would also add that the Government is committed to the fulfilment of the terms of Partnership 2000, which include a number of policy issues relating to my Department, including the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>Since July of this year, the Department has been renamed as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and has been assigned additional responsibilities for which it will shortly take over from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform along with appropriate staffing resources.  These include responsibility for marriage support services, family mediation services, births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and for progressing other issues, in particular initiatives in the community for children arising from the Commission on the Family.</P>
    <P>An interim report of the Commission on the Family was published in November 1996 and the final report is due to be submitted in November 1997.  Any further developments in this area will take account of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I also draw the attention of Deputies to the interdepartmental working group which is currently examining the treatment of one and two person households under the social welfare and tax systems.  This working group is due to report in March 1998.</P>
    <P>Further progress in each of the areas mentioned above, including consideration as to how the tax and social welfare systems can be made more family-friendly, will be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> With regard to community affairs, the voluntary and community services section of my Department manages the range of supports provided for the Department for community groups, viz, the community development programme, family and community services development resource centres, money advice and budgeting service and the once-off grants schemes (women's, men's, lone parents, voluntary organisations).</P>
    <P>These support services are administered on a non statutory basis and there are no plans at present for introducing legislation governing the operation of these services.  There are some ten staff currently assigned within my Department to administering these services.  Staff in the Department's regional and local offices throughout the country also play a key role in managing these schemes at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 19, 29, 35, 39 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The Government acknowledges the special place of the older people in the community and the contribution they have made towards our current favourable economic position.  In recognition, the Action Programme for the Millennium proposes a significant package of improvements to repay their efforts.</P>
      <P>Many people still rely totally on the social welfare pensions for their income in retirement and this was one of the reasons why a key priority of the Government action programme is substantial social welfare increases, including increases in the old age contributory pension to £100 per week over our five year term of office.  This commitment is being examined in the context of formulating proposals for the 1998 budget.  The question of improving payment rates for other categories of social welfare pensioners for example, old age non-contributory pensioners or widow's and widower's (contributory and non-contributory) pensioners, is also being examined in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The position of pensions, both social welfare and occupational, and pensioners generally is also being considered in the context of the national pensions policy initiative and the Pensions Board will be submitting their report to me on this initiative before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>An annual increase of approximately 5 per cent would be required to progressively increase the old age contributory and retirement pension from its present rate of £78 to £100 over a five year period.  Alternatively, the £100 rate could be achieved by providing flat-rate annual increases of £4.40 over the five years at an additional full year cost of £37.36 million in each year.  The cumulative full year cost over the five year period would be £186.78 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the old age (non-contributory) pension, an annual increase of 5 per cent would bring that pension from its present rate of £67.50 to approximately £86.10 over five years, at a cumulative full year cost of £97.65 million.  An annual increase of approximately 8.3 per cent would be required to progressively increase that pension from its present rate of £67.50 to £100 over a five year period.  Alternatively, a £100 rate would require a flat-rate annual increase of £6.50 over five years, at an additional full year cost of <Col N="1027" /> £34.13 million in each year.  The cumulative full year cost over the five year period would be £170.63 million per annum.</P>
    <P>In the case of the widow's and widower's (contributory) pension, an annual increase of 5 per cent would bring that pension from its present rate of £71.10 to approximately £90.70 over five years, at a cumulative full year cost in the region of £100.94 million.  If such an increase were to be confined to widows and widowers aged 66 and over, the cumulative full year cost over five years would be in the region of £65.46 million.  An annual increase of approximately 7 per cent would be required to progressively increase the widow's and widower's pension (contributory) pension from its present rate of £71.10 to £100 over a five-year period.  Alternatively, a £100 rate would require a flat-rate increase of £5.80 each year, at a full year cost of £29.87 million in each year and a cumulative £149.35 million over five years.  If such an increase were to be confined to widows and widowers aged 66 and over the respective costs would be £19.37 million in a full year and £96.86 million cumulatively over five years.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the case of the widow's and widower's (non-contributory) pension, an annual increase of 5 per cent would bring that pension from its present rate of £67.50 to approximately £86.10 over 5 years, at a cumulative full year cost in the region of £18.6 million.  If such an increase were to be confined to widows and widowers aged 66 and over the cumulative full year cost over five years would be in the region of £14.69 million.  An annual increase of approximately 8.3 per cent would be required to progressively increase that pension from its present rate of £67.50 to £100 over a five year period.  Alternatively, a £100 rate would require a flat-rate increase of £6.50 over five years, at a full year cost of £6.5 million in each year and a cumulative £32.5 million over a five year period.  If such an increase were to be confined to widows and widowers aged 66 and over, the respective costs would be £5.14 million in a full year and £25.68 million cumulatively over five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategic management initiative (SMI) which was introduced in February 1994 required each Government Department to examine and review its performance under three main headings: the contribution it could make to national development, the quality of services provided to the public, and the provision of value for money to the taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> My Department, which is a large service delivery organisation, has actively pursued the implementation of the SMI process and has made significant progress to date, particularly in relation to the quality and method of delivery of its services. Some of the more important developments include customer consultation is now conducted on a systematic basis through surveys and customer panels; a customer service training programme has been developed following research into best practice and consultations with customers and staff; participative structures are now in place which facilitate staff consultation and input on many issues; a management development programme has been delivered which is aimed at equipping managers in the Department with the necessary change management and leadership skills; improved targeting of control resources and better systems for the monitoring and evaluation of control activities have now been established; annual business planning now takes place by which targets, milestones and activities are set for each of the business units. Key performance indicators are now in place and these are actively monitored on a regular basis; a revised building and refurbishment programme is in place for public offices; an information systems strategy has been developed which is aligned to support the business direction and which will ensure capability of delivery systems into the new millennium; a national anti-poverty unit has been established within my Department which is responsible for cross-departmental initiatives aimed at addressing the issues of poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The Department is committed to the principles of quality service set out earlier this year and an action plan based on these is being prepared for implementation over the next two years.  The SMI process was given fresh impetus in September this year when the provisions of the Public Service Management Act were commenced.  This Act provides the necessary legal framework for each Department to further develop the process.  Work has already commenced, within the requirements of the Act, on outlining a statement of strategy for the next three years.  This will involve building on the significant progress that has already been achieved to date and will provide on opportunity to re-examine the Department's existing mission statement, objectives, outputs and related strategies.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the deepening of the SMI process, with which we are now actively engaged, will further contribute to the development of my Department as a highly professional organisation with a strong commitment to quality service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The different methods of assessing means under the one-parent family payment for a widow with child dependants, and non-contributory widow's pension for a widow with no child dependants, reflect the fact that, in addition to widowhood, widows with child dependants face additional difficulties.</P>
      <P>Economic and social research has shown that one-parent families are particularly vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion and so the one-parent family payment is designed to both provide basic income support for lone parents, taking into account the special needs and requirements of single parents raising children, and encourage lone parents to return to the workforce so that over time they can become less reliant on social welfare payments for their income needs.</P>
      <P>This is the rationale behind the earnings disregard of £6,000 available to lone parents under the one-parent family payment means test.  I am confident that over time providing such positive support to lone parents will result in their achieving a greater degree of economic independence. However, the extension of this earnings disregard to other social welfare recipient &mdash; such as widows without child dependants &mdash; who do not face the same economic difficulties &mdash; would obviously have cost implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit is payable for a maximum of 15 months (390 days) for people generally and for six months (156 days) in the case of people under age 18. However, people aged 65 are entitled to receive unemployment benefit, beyond 15 months, up to the date on which they reach age 66, provided that they have at least 156 weeks (three years) paid PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>This special arrangement for people aged 65 and over acts as a bridging mechanism and ensures that such a person is enabled to avoid a situation where he/she could lose entitlement to any social welfare payment for a very limited period prior to reaching pension age.  It is not intended to be a more general income support mechanism, and therefore I do not believe that it would be appropriate to extend the period of unemployment benefit entitlement along the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The free schemes, including the free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65, whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement.</P>
      <P>A change in the qualifying conditions for the free schemes was introduced in the 1996 budget. This allows new applicants over age 75, who were previously required to satisfy more rigorous household composition rules, to be assessed in the same way as all other persons in that age category. This means that their household composition will not affect their eligibility for the free schemes.  Effectively now all persons over age 75 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment may qualify for the free schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition, the free schemes were extended in July 1996 to include low-income pensioners who were not in receipt of a social welfare type payment. The weekly income limit fixed for this purpose is the maximum personal rate of old age (contributory) pension (currently £78 per week), plus any increases for dependants, plus £30.</P>
      <P>To extend the free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance to all people over the age of 75 would involve significant additional expenditure which could only be examined in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to indicate when the Social Welfare Bill, 1998 will be published.  The date of publication will depend on a number of factors including the extent and range of measures contained in the budget, affecting my Department, which require legislation; the implementation dates for such measures, and the level of consultation required with other Government Departments, agencies or interested groups in the formulation of the provisions of the Bill.  I will endeavour to have this Bill published at earliest possible date.</P>

      <Col N="1031" /> With regard to the effective date for any increases in social welfare payments, this matter will fall to be considered in the context of the forthcoming budget and will be announced by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement on 3 December 1997.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement (FIS) scheme is designed to provide an incentive for low paid workers with families to take up or remain in full-time employment.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a commitment given in the Partnership 2000 Agreement and in the context of reducing disincentives to work, FIS is being reformed so as to be calculated on a net income basis, rather than on gross wages, over the lifetime of the agreement.  As an initial step in this process, provision was made this year for FIS to be calculated on the basis of gross earnings less any PRSI contributions, levies and pension contributions paid.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance (UA) appropriate to their family circumstances are entitled to claim UA.  The rate of UA payable depends on the person's means.  In assessing means, account is taken of the net income which the applicant may reasonably expect to receive in the next year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the extension of FIS to self-employed people with children would cost in the region of £30 million in a full year.  This cost is in addition to the existing expenditure involved in providing unemployment assistance to self-employed people whose income falls below the rate of unemployment assistance appropriate to their family circumstances. In view of the very significant additional costs involved, the question of extending FIS to self-employed people would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by the Deputies relates to the position of people who return to the live register after their period of community employment finishes and who, by virtue of having paid Class A PRSI contributions, may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The position is that the Social Welfare Act, 1996 provided for the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension, treatment (dental and optical) benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other Class A workers.</P>
      <P>In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether or not they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit.  Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them. However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the social welfare secondary benefits, i.e. free fuel allowance, butter vouchers and the Christmas bonus, can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or jobstart etc.  As regards income-related secondary benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
      <P>The introduction of special concessionary arrangements for former CE workers have both legislative and cost implications.  I will keep the issues raised by the Deputies under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The name of a Government Department should reflect as accurately as possible the range of the Department's activities and responsibilities. The new name of my Department reflects the wider role which the Department has been developing over recent years.</P>
      <P>The Department's role has been broadened over the last number of years beyond that of income support in order to cater for the wider needs and expectation of those to whom it provides a service.  This wider remit includes, for example, employment support services, second chance education opportunities for unemployed people, support for the voluntary and community sectors, household budgeting facilities and money advice and budgeting services.</P>
      <P>This broader role is reflected in the inclusion of &ldquo;Community&rdquo; in the Department's title.</P>
      <P>Families are supported by the Department at all stages of the life cycle from infancy to old age and in a wide variety of ways.  The Department is now focusing closely on how State policies impact on the various family types that make up our increasingly complex society.</P>
      <P>The Department has recently been assigned additional responsibilities which include marriage support services, family mediation services, births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and for progressing other issues, in particular initiatives in the community for children arising from the Commission on the Family.</P>
      <P>The Department's stated mission is &ldquo;to promote social well-being through income and other supports which enable people to participate in society in a positive way&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This statement was developed as part of the strategic management initiative process initiated a number of years ago.  The strategy document &ldquo;Open, Fair and Caring&rdquo;, which was published in 1996, set out a framework through which the Department's objectives and goals could be achieved.  It details the Department's strategic action programmes, values and high level goals.</P>
      <P>The mission statement reflects an organisation that not only provides income to a wide range of people but which also has a very significant contribution to make to the well-being of society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is in the process of developing a new statement of strategy under the terms of <Col N="1034" /> the Public Service Management Act, 1997.  This will involve a full review of my Department's strategic action programmes, and will provide an opportunity to re-visit the mission statement.  The statement of strategy is to be prepared and submitted to me by 1 March 1998.</P>
    <P>The process of developing a new statement of strategy will present an opportunity to review the organisation and structure of the Department to ensure the optimal structure for the achievement of the Department's objectives, outputs and strategies.</P>

      <P>It would be extremely difficult to measure if the cost of living is higher in rural areas than in urban areas or in cities and, indeed, to get agreement on such a measure and the boundaries to which it applied.  Indeed, the same difficulties could apply to measuring between different rural areas or different urban areas or different cities.</P>
      <P>Some initiatives, such as the scheme of community support for older people, which was established to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community, while available to all pensioners, benefits many in rural areas.</P>
      <P>However, the whole question of the adequacy of pensions generally, both social welfare and occupational pensions, is being considered in the context of the national pensions policy initiative and I expect to receive the Pensions Board report, including recommendations, before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>My Department provides support for people providing care to relatives in a number of ways, as follows.</P>
      <P>Firstly, there is the carer's allowance.  This is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners or certain disabled persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.  Last June, two improvements in the scheme were introduced: an additional payment, or 50 per cent of the basic rate, was introduced for carers who take care of more than one person, and the &ldquo;full time care&rdquo; requirement was relaxed to extend entitlement to cases where the person being cared for attended a day-care centre on a limited basis.</P>
      <P>The Government programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, contains a commitment to improve the carer's allowance, and I will be examining how best to make progress on this in the context of the budget.</P>
      <P>The second way in which my Department recognises people working in the home is through the &lsquo;homemakers' disregards&rsquo;.  From 6 April 1994, time spent working full-time in the home rearing young children up to six years of age or caring for an incapacitated person may be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the yearly average condition in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  This was increased to include children up to 12 years effective from April 1995. Altogether, a maximum of 20 years may be disregarded for this purpose.  The main aim is to assist people taking time out of work but there is a certain amount of flexibility to enable people to engage in part-time work with earnings of up to £30 per week.  Up to 250,000 people, mainly women, may benefit from this arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to the question of basic income, the Conference of Religious of Ireland has for some time advocated the introduction of a basic income scheme in this country.  Under such a scheme, the social welfare system, as we know it, would be abolished; personal income tax allowances and exemptions would also be abolished. Instead, every person in the country would be entitled, as of right, to a weekly basic income payment from the State.  This would be paid without any means test, and regardless of family circumstances or labour force status.  The idea of basic income is not a new one; many such schemes have been discussed in the past, both here in Ireland and abroad.  Most of the interest in basic income has centred around the contribution it might make to removing poverty traps from the tax and social welfare systems.  It is true that such a scheme would provide an automatic payment, without any means test, to people working fulltime <Col N="1037" /> in the home.  However, since the payment would be payable to everyone, whether they work in the home, work in the paid economy or choose not to work at all, it is questionable if the payment could be seen as &ldquo;recognising the value of work in the home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A particular problem with basic income is that most of the research which has been undertaken to date in Ireland has suggested that the tax rates needed to fund such a scheme would be extremely high.  More recent research by CORI has suggested that the growth in the economy in recent years, and the consequent growth in the tax base, means that the tax rates need to fund the basic income scheme may be lower than previously envisaged.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to carry out a further independent appraisal of the concept and the full implications of introducing a basic income payment.  A broadly-based steering group for this project has been established under the chairmanship of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Government is also committed to producing a Green Paper on the issue of basic income within two years.  The research being commissioned by the steering group will be an important input into that paper.</P>
    <P>When these studies are complete, the Government will be in a better position to evaluate the merits and disadvantages of introducing a basic income scheme and I will consider what action needs to be taken at that stage.</P>

      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy is very much in keeping with the commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to build a more inclusive society.  As a result, there has been a considerable level of activity in this area since I came into office.  A strategy unit was established in the Department in early May to co-ordinate the implementation of the anti-poverty strategy and additonal staff were appointed to the unit during the summer.</P>
      <P>One of the key objectives identified for the first year of the strategy is to have the concept of social inclusion embedded at political and departmental levels initially and in the wider public service ultimately.  Consequently, the main focus of activity to date has been the establishment of the various mechanisms required to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>The NAPS Interdepartmental Policy Committee has met twice and the first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs (including local development) took place last week.  Individual Departments have appointed a liaison officer to fill a communication and co-ordination role and it is through the network of liaison officers that the NAPS unit interacts with Departments.</P>
      <P>Drawing on the Programme for Government, Partnership 2000 and NAPS, Departments are currently preparing baseline documents which review the key issues relating to social inclusion in so far as their remit is concerned.  The process includes identification of cross-cutting issues.  In addition, Departments are drawing up workplans for 1998 that identify clear objectives and targets.</P>
      <P>I believe that the adoption of a strategic approach involving all Departments and agencies is the key to building a more inclusive society in the long-term.</P>

      <P>The details of the staffing levels sought are shown in a table which I am circulating in the Official Report.  The table shows the staffing levels for each of the years as at 1 <Col N="1040" /> January, with the exception of 1987, for which the available figures as at 1 April of that year are shown.  In addition, it also shows the staffing level at 1 October 1997.</P>
      <P>In summary, there were 4,199 staff serving at 1 October 1997, of which over 800 are located in four decentralised ofices in Sligo, Letterkenny, Longford and Waterford and about 1,440 are based in local offices throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The overall staffing levels in the Department are reviewed, from time to time, as the need arises to ensure that the work requirements of the organisation are met as effectively and efficiently as possible, having regard to Government policy on public sector numbers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern) Dermot Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  In this regard, the Government will be ensuring that disability is placed on the agenda of every Government Department and public body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's mission is to promote social well-being through income and other supports which enable people to participate in society in a positive way.  Traditionally people with disabilities have relied heavily on the State income maintenance system for their incomes.  Therefore, by providing them and other social welfare recipients with the necessary financial resources, the various income support and other schemes <Col N="1041" /> administered by my Department ensure that individuals, families and communities have the opportunity and incentive to participate fully in society.  However, it is not enough to simply provide income support services for people with disabilities, it is also equally important to ensure that these services are fully accessible.  In this regard, I am committed to making all my Department's services fully accessible to people with disabilities. This involves ensuring that all my Department's premises are accesssible; that information on social welfare services is provided in an accessible format and that the services themselves are accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which was published last year, provides a framework for ensuring that people with disabilities can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life.  Three guiding principles have informed the commission in its work &mdash; equality; maximising participation; and enabling independence.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the commission's report an interdepartmental task force was established to prepare the Government's plan of action for people with disabilities.  The task force is due to report to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, by the end of the year.  However, my Department has already taken significant steps towards improving the position of people with disabilities, in advance of the Government's action plan being finalised.  This year's Social Welfare Act, for instance, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive package of measures to further assist people with disabilities, including special increases in social welfare rates over and above the rate of inflation, which bring invalidity pension up to the target rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, and disability allowance, blind person's pension and disability benefit up from 95 per cent to 98 per cent of the CSW rate; a new part payment of disability allowance for those in part-time residential care; and an additional payment of 50 per cent to recipients of carer's allowance providing care to more than one person.</P>
    <P>In addition, 1,000 places have been reserved under the back-to-work allowance scheme for a pilot scheme for people with disabilities, to facilitate their integration into mainstream employment.</P>
    <P>I am examining further improvements in the services provided by my Department for people with disabilities in the context of formulating proposals for the 1998 budget, having regard to the commitments contained in the Government's programme An Action Programme for the Millennium, and the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>

The additional responsibilities recently assigned to my Department include responsibility for marriage support services; family mediation services; births, marriages and deaths registration legislation, and for progressing other issues, in particular initiatives in the community for children arising from the report of the Commission on the Family.  The change of name of the Department reflects these changes and the low expenditure to date is fully justified on the basis of the additional responsibilities and expanded role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs operates a range of support programmes for community groups, including grant schemes for women's groups, men's groups, lone parent groups and the community development programme.  The objective of all these schemes is to enable disadvantaged communities to work in a practical way to address the issues that face them, to foster greater self-reliance and community leadership and to support a process of community and personal development in disadvantaged communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to develop a range of programmes to support local communities, including the community development programme, CDP, under which funding is provided towards staffing and equipping local resource centres which provide a <Col N="1043" /> focal point for community development activities in an area and to other specialist community development projects.  Partnership 2000 contains a commitment to the pro-active targeting of 30 new areas for the establishment of new CDP projects over the next three years.  An expert technical group has been appointed to assist and advise me in that regard.  The group has the following functions: (a) advising me on applications received from groups for funding under the programme; and (b) assisting the Department in drawing up a list of 30 priority areas to be targeted for the development of new projects over the next three years.  Work on drawing up the priority list is well under way.</P>
    <P>In addition to the main community development programme, the Department has funded on a pilot basis a number of family resource centres since 1994.  A review of these centres was commissioned by the Department in 1996 and has recently been published.  The review recommends continued support for local community-managed resource centres providing family support services and the main thrust of the report has, as already announced, been accepted.</P>
    <P>Reviews of the scheme of grants to locally-based women's groups and the scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups are being finalised. These reviews were undertaken to examine the effectiveness of these grants in meeting the needs of the groups they target and to recommend a framework for the future support and funding of women's and men's groups.  The outcome of these reviews will be taken into account in developing future policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The community development education and training grants scheme enhances the capacity of local community groups to operate effectively by providing funding to assist with training for management and strategic planning.</P>
    <P>As Minister with responsibility for the political oversight of the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, I will also be working with other key Cabinet colleagues on the Cabinet committee on social inclusion towards achieving the objectives and targets of the NAPS.</P>

      <P>The social insurance fund is central to the provisions of social welfare services and to the economic and social life of the country.  I am fully committed to safeguarding the security of the fund and in this context one of the issues I am examining for the future is the establishment of a social insurance board and its role and composition.  In setting up such a board <Col N="1044" /> I am anxious not to add unduly to the State's bureaucracy, so one of the issues I will consider is how to ensure the board functions efficiently and does not lead to setting up a major new organisation with large staff, expensive premises, etc.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system plays a key role in the provision of social protection in society. People, when they are economically active, make contributions to the social insurance fund according to their ability to pay and depending on the range of benefits and pensions for which they are covered.  These payments fund the pensions of an earlier generation of contributors and also pay benefits to persons who are not working due to contingencies such as unemployment or illness. Contributors, accordingly, build up entitlements to various pensions and benefits which are paid to them as of right, without having to undergo a means test.</P>
      <P>The social insurance system is based on a long-term contract between employers, employees, the self-employed and the Government.  It plays a major role in income redistribution and achieves solidarity between generations and between those at work and those currently not at work.</P>
      <P>Social insurance fund expenditure, excluding administration costs, amounted to £1,794 million in 1996.  Of this expenditure, £1,176 million or 66 per cent went to pay for retirement, old age, widow's-widower's and invalidity pensions.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the long-term importance of pensions generally and the role of the social insurance fund in the pensions area, an actuarial review of social welfare pensions was commissioned. The report of this review, which I launched on 29 September last, covers the period from 1996 to 2056.  This report is an important contribution to the debate regarding future pension provision.  While the report concludes that the funding position in respect of pensions, given current contribution levels, is relatively stable for the next 20 years, it also shows that the position thereafter, when a large increase in the number of older people is projected, is more serious.  I intend to commission further such actuarial reviews, in line with the original recommendation of the National Pensions Board that such reviews be carried out every five years and I will be giving consideration to bringing forward legislation in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed the Deputy is referring to the means test for the unemployment assistance scheme.</P>
      <P>In assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes account is taken of a number of items, including earnings as an employee or from self-employment, capital i.e. deposits in financial institutions or property (other than claimant's residence) which is leased or rented, and income from use of property e.g. smallholding.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, where a farmer or self-employed fisherman applies for unemployment assistance, account is taken of the value of the net income derived from either fishing or farming, less the expenses actually and necessarily incurred in producing that income.  For example, in the case of a smallholder, sales of milk, livestock, crops and subsidy payments, such as headage payments, will account for gross income, while expenses may include such items as the cost of fertilisers, veterinary expenses, interest on borrowing for farm purposes, hired labour, repairs to farm buildings and machinery, etc.  The balance of gross income over allowed expenses represents means and this is set against the scheduled rate of unemployment assistance payable, on a £1 for £1 basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance for smallholders and other self-employed persons &mdash; e.g. boat owners <Col N="1046" />&mdash; therefore, acts as an income supplement, akin to the family income supplement for employees.</P>
    <P>Fishermen who are employed under a contract of service are insurable for Class A PRSI contributions. In return they are covered for all social insurance benefits, including unemployment benefit during periods of unemployment. However, where such a fisherman is not entitled to unemployment benefit, e.g. does not have sufficient PRSI contributions, they may claim unemployment assistance instead.  In such cases, where a fisherman is unemployed for at least three days in any period of six consecutive days, they continue to receive their weekly rate of unemployment assistance, less 60 per cent of their net income from employment.  In addition, persons without children will be allowed a £10 disregard for each day worked, while the balance of earnings will be assessed at 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>A significant improvement in the means test for smallholders was provided for in 1996 with the introduction of a substantial disregard of up to £2,000 in moneys received by way of the rural environmental protection &mdash; REPS &mdash; scheme. Any further changes in the means test applying to smallholders and fishermen would have cost implications, would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources and existing priorities.</P>

      <P>I am aware of ISME's recent call for a third soft interest loan scheme.  I would like to make it clear that previous subsidised loan schemes were not solely funded by the banking sector.  On the contrary, previous schemes required substantial Exchequer resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small business expansion loan scheme and the access to finance scheme have provided over £300 million in subsidised long-term fixed interest loans to small businesses at subsidised rates of <Col N="1049" /> 6.75 per cent and 6.5 per cent respectively over recent years.  Almost 2,000 small businesses continue to benefit from these schemes.</P>
    <P>The most recent of these schemes, the access to finance scheme, was introduced as a partnership between the European Commission, the participating banks &mdash; Bank of Ireland, AIB, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank &mdash; and the Exchequer whereby each partner contributes to the cost of providing seven year loans at a subsidised and fixed interest rate to the small business sector.  Almost 50 per cent of the cost of the scheme is carried by the participating banks; the other half is jointly funded by the European Commission and the national Exchequer.  No further EU funding is available at this time to fund a further scheme.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government, an Action Programme for the Millennium, commits this Government to making life easier for small business. The nature of the financial environment faced by business is a vitally important element of the overall business environment.  My Department, with Forbairt and Forfás, is examining a range of options which could improve the financial environment for start-up and existing businesses. In addition, a review of the access to finance scheme, as part of a wider review of the operational programme for small business, has been commissioned and is expected to be completed shortly.  On completion of these studies I will consider whether a new soft loan scheme or other instruments are most appropriate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary objective of the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism, to which almost £18 million has been allocated in the period to 1999, is to enhance the <Col N="1050" /> tourism angling product and to ensure that our coarse, game and sea angling resources are upgraded to the best international standards, thereby increasing tourism revenue and employment. More than £12 million has been allocated to date under the measure which represents a satisfactory level of commitment to date.</P>
    <P>Fitzpatrick Associates, Economic Consultants, were engaged by the monitoring committee in February 1996 to undertake the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Tourism. In so far as the tourism angling measure is concerned, the mid-term evaluation recommended, among other matters, that while there was no convincing rationale for altering the financial allocation to the measure, apart from a small transfer to the marketing sub-programme, overall spending under the measure should be part of the end-1997 expenditure review; substantially more attention should be paid to the international promotion of Ireland's angling product; and the allocation of funding across the different types of angling should be altered with more attention given to rectifying the problems which were leading to the falling popularity of coarse and sea angling.</P>
    <P>Progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the mid-term evaluation which were accepted will be discussed at the next meeting of the operational programme's monitoring committee when specific measures and proposals designed to address the issues identified by the evaluator will be assessed.</P>

      <P>Imports of pigmeat for the first five months of 1997, which is the most recent period for which CSO figures are available, amounted to 13,000 tonnes.  Exports during the same period came to 49,000 tonnes.  There is no evidence to suggest that such imports have an adverse effect on demand or prices for Irish product.  In 1996, Irish pigmeat exports were three and a half times greater than imports to this country.  It is clear, therefore, that the Single Market, of which free trade in pigmeat within the EU is a part, is of overall benefit to the Irish pigmeat sector.</P>

The taxpayer's gross taxfree allowances amount to £9,048 and her pension is £4,834.  The taxpayer's net taxfree allowance for the current tax year 1997-98 is therefore £4,214.</P>

      <P>This question relates <Col N="1056" /> to siblings being separated when in foster care. The Deputy may recall I dealt with this matter in the House on Thursday, 9 October in reply to a question from Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>The position is that the report of the Eastern Health Board/IMPACT review group on child care and family support services referred to the separate placement of a number of sibling groups. I had inquiries made of the Eastern Health Board about this matter and the board reported that while this may occur from time to time it is their policy to place siblings together and it would be most unusual not to do so.</P>
      <P>The report also highlighted the need to create more foster care and residential places and following a recent Eastern Health Board fostering recruitment campaign, which yielded over 60 applications to foster, there is currently a backlog of fostering applications awaiting assessment. While a time lag in processing applications is inevitable, I am anxious that the current lengthy assessment period for the approval of foster carers to be shortened as much as possible and I have asked the board to submit proposals in this regard at an early date.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently met with the chief executive officer of the board to discuss the provision of additional placements for children requiring care.  I am happy to report that the board has immediate plans to open a ten bed emergency residential centre for children under 12 years of age.  The board also plans to establish an additional ten bed emergency residential centre for children over 12 years of age who are out of home.  Also, up to ten out-of-hours emergency carer families will be brought on stream during 1997.  These will be available to provide emergency care for children during the out-of-hours period.</P>
      <P>I am confident that these measures will help to alleviate the situation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84, 85 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the services provided in St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin, people living in the west of Ireland can be treated in a range of hospitals closer to their homes including University College Hospital Galway, Merlin Park Regional Hospital, Mayo General Hospital and Roscommon <Col N="1058" /> General Hospital.  Under the national cancer strategy oncology, haematology, cytology and palliative care services are being strengthened in the Western Health Board area.  To date a total of £550,000 has been allocated from funds available under the strategy to develop palliative care and cytology services.  The action plan implementing the strategy also indicates that an additional medical oncologist and an additional haematologist will be appointed to the western region as implementation of the strategy proceeds.</P>
    <P>Certain specialised services such as radiotherapy are available only in a limited number of locations at present, due to the very high cost involved and the large patient throughput required to make them viable.  The question of providing radiotherapy services in University Hospital Galway is being kept under review in the context of planned capital developments there.</P>
    <P>The number of out-patient attendances at St. Luke's Hospital from Counties Mayo, Galway and Roscommon are shown as follows &mdash; a breakdown of figures between these counties is not available.</P>

      <P>There has been a major capital development programme under way at St. Luke's Hospital over the past three years.  This programme involves a complete upgrading of accommodation throughout the hospital and the provision of new radiotherapy equipment.  As part of the development, St. Anne's Hospital will close and with the transfer of beds from St. Anne's a total of 144 beds will be available at the new St. Luke's Hospital including day beds and hostel places.  The development is at an advanced stage and when completed will cost approximately £20 million. Allied to this major capital development my Department has provided substantial additional revenue funding to support the development.  In 1997 £600,000 additional revenue moneys were provided under the cancer strategy.</P>
      <P>The number of consultant radiotherapists-clinical oncologists in St. Luke's Hospital for each year from 1995 to date is as follows: 1995 &mdash; 6; 1996 &mdash; 6; 1997 &mdash; 6.</P>
      <P>I am committed to the continued development of cancer services throughout the country as outlined in the national cancer strategy.

      <P>The funds available to me for the local authority housing programme, including improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, were fully allocated among local authorities earlier this year.  Kildare County Council's 1997 allocation included £45,000 for the improvement works in lieu etc.  scheme.

      <P>The essential repairs grant scheme is administered by the housing authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993. Subject to these regulations, it is a matter for each authority to determine whether a grant can be paid in an individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essential repairs grants are payable for houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of the essential repairs, the house can continue to meet short-term <Col N="1064" /> accommodation needs.  The regulations reflect this intention and in general would not preclude the payment of a grant in respect of a house where an extension with a flat roof has been provided.  If there is a query in relation to any individual case this might in the first instance be raised with the particular housing authority involved.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals at this stage to review the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993.</P>

    <P>*Note: In the case of invalidity pension and disablement benefit recipients, the figures relate to people aged 66 and over, as separate statistics are not kept on people over 65.  Old age (contributory) pension is only payable to persons aged 66 or over.  The statistics supplied in relation to other payments relate to recipients who are aged 65 years and over.</P>
    <P>As the table shows, the vast majority (98 per cent) of social insurance payments to persons over 65 years are for old age (contributory) pension, retirement pension and widow's/er's (contributory) pension schemes.  The remaining 2 per cent of payments are for invalidity pension, deserted wife's benefit, disability benefit, disablement benefit and unemployment benefit.</P>

      <Quest>if he will deal with the issue whereby elderly applicants for personal security under the community alert scheme are being told that no further finance is available for the provision of personal security for the elderly such as necklace alarms; and if he will rectify this situation in view of the recent attacks on the elderly.</Quest>

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community.  Under the scheme my Department makes grants available to voluntary organisations such as Muintir na Tíre, Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, who have undertaken to identify the older people in the community most in need of the schemes services.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme funding can be provided for small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>In 1996 grants were made to 528 voluntary groups, representing 15,000 individuals, at a cost of £2.562 million.  Under the scheme the maximum grant available is 90 per cent of the cost and in 1996 grants were typically in the region of 60 per cent to 90 per cent.  The scheme was continued in 1997 and was advertised early in the year and the deadline for receipt of applications was 25 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1067" /> It was evident from an assesment of applications received that the initial allocation of £2 million was inadequate to meet the volume of worthwhile applications that merited funding.  I felt that a selective approach to dealing with applications or payment of grants at a level considerably below 90 per cent would result in many people in need of protection not being adequately catered for under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Recognising the very real need that still exists among older people in the community in relation to security I obtained Government approval for the allocation of an additional £3 million to the scheme for this year, bringing the total allocation for the year to £5 million.</P>
    <P>Allocations from this £5 million have been made to the regional offices of my Department who are now processing applications on hand.  My Department expect to provide funding to voluntary organisations in respect of 21,000 individuals who wish to avail of the scheme this year.  It is also expected that the additional funding secured will enable a greater number of applications to be funded at higher levels than in 1996, with many applications being funded at the maximum 90 per cent allowable under the scheme.</P>
    <P>As outlined the additional funding was secured to cater for the volume of applications received before the advertised closing date and my Department expects to be in a position to provide funding under the scheme to all eligible applications received before that date.</P>
    <P>The Department will be undertaking a fundamental review of the scheme to ensure that the scheme is achieving its aims and to ensure that the security needs of the most vulnerable older people in society are being met in the most effective way.</P>
    <P>The findings of the review will be taken into account in determining how best support for community initiatives in the security of older people can be delivered in the future.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that projects being funded under Sub-Programme One of the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99 are insufficiently oriented towards international tourism. In the development of the projects it is an ongoing requirement that the needs of international tourism be a high priority and kept constantly in mind.</P>
      <P>The surveys of overseas visitors to Ireland conducted by Bord Fáilte confirm consistently that almost half of all overseas holidaymakers visit places of cultural/historical interest.  This confirms the relevance of the projects aided under Sub-Programme One to international tourism.  Indeed cultural tourism is fast emerging as one of the main growth areas in the tourist industry world-wide and the projects being assisted under Sub-Programme One of the Tourism OP aim to increase the range and choice of facilities available to the foreign visitor in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I referred in my answer to his Questions Nos. 199, 200 and 201 of yesterday that it is intended to allocate significant funding to international marketing of the tourism product.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>In December 1988 the Government decided that, in cases where substantial investment in the manufacturing or services sectors of the economy has been made by overseas investors, the Minister for Justice should interpret such investment as falling within the interpretation of Irish Associations set out in section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, and that if the person had purchased a substantial residence, and had resided in Ireland for a period of 60 days in the preceding two years, naturalisation could be granted.</P>
      <P>From 1988 to 1994, the original conditions applying to the scheme began to loosen; for example, some property and forestry developments were taken as qualifying and the 60 day residence requirement was not applied in all cases.</P>
      <P>In 1994, the Government established an advisory group consisting of representatives of the Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Enterprise and Employment and Forbairt to assess the investment proposals of individual applications and to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice on foot of that assessment as to whether the normal preconditions for naturalisation should be waived.  The terms of reference of the advisery group are set out on the attached sheet.</P>
      <P>As part of the review of this scheme, which I am conducting at the request of the Government, I have arranged for my Department to identify all of those naturalised under the provisions of the scheme.  Identification of the files of the individuals concerned has just been completed and, as I have already said publicly, 143 naturalisations have taken place &mdash; 50 of spouses and minor children &mdash; and investment in the order of £90 million has been committed.</P>
      <P>My Department will be examining each case in order to establish if the promised investment was made.  Completion of this process will take some time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the details of persons naturalised under the scheme, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 132 of 9 October 1997.</P>

      <P>The report on the mid-term evaluation of the Operational Programme for Tourism was undertaken on behalf of the monitoring committee for the programme in the context of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework (CSF) for Ireland 1994-99.</P>
      <P>Following extensive evaluation and consultation, the European Commission and the Government agreed the CSF mid-term review package in July.  This package sets out the detail of changes which were considered desirable in the overall balance between the various programmes, including tourism, which go to make up Ireland's Community Support Framework (1994-99).  It is intended that all issues relating to the mid-term review of the tourism programme, bearing in mind the CSF mid-term review package, will be dealt with at the tourism monitoring committee meeting scheduled for November next, including the issues of possible financial transfers within the progrmme, reorganisation of priorities and selection criteria.</P>

      <P>There are 19 eligible pupils availing of transport to Kilcredan national school who would benefit from the proposed re-routing.  These pupils live between 0.2 and 0.8 miles from the present pick-up point and are well catered for within my Department guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual cost of the proposed re-routing is estimated at £360, which, taken in isolation, may <Col N="1077" /> appear insignificant.  However, if similar criteria were to be applied on a nationwide basis the resultant additional cost to the State would be considerable.  The rules of the school transport scheme must be applied consistently to all areas, and to allow preferential treatment in one case, even at a relatively low cost, would inevitably lead to demands for improved services elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration that three other pupils on this service would be adversely affected if the change in the route were implemented.  Given that the above-mentioned 19 pupils already have a very satisfactory level of service in the overall context of the scheme, I regret that I am not in a position to authorise the change as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend to the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.  Currently, there are 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country.  The school mentioned by the Deputy is included in this number.</P>

      <P>The identification of a site for Coláiste Raithín, Bray, County Wicklow is a matter for Town of Bray Vocational Education Committee. Officials from the planning and building unit of my Department were recently in contact with the vocational education committee regarding the matter.  A progress report on the situation is being prepared by the vocational education committee.</P>

      <P>Students pursuing postgraduate courses at approved colleges can apply for grants in respect of their fees and maintenance under the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committee (VEC) scholarship scheme.  In addition, students pursuing courses approved under the ESF-aided advanced technical skills (ATS) programme, which must be at postgraduate level, do not pay tuition fees.</P>
      <P>In addition to these student supports which are administered by my Department, the office of science and technology provides scholarships, in the form of an annual grant of £2,000, to doctoral students in science and technology subjects. Other sources of funding available to postgraduate students include demonstratorships funded by the colleges and funding from programmes for advanced technology and applied and strategic research grants.</P>
      <P>In relation to research equipment I recognise that under the capital investment programme the dedicated provision of £10 million included in the National Development Plan 1994-99 cannot itself meet all the requirements of researchers.  The plan did, however, provide a total of £120 million for investment in higher education and research projects primarily related to economic growth and job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also consider that there is potential in the <Col N="1080" /> changes introduced in the 1997 Finance Act.  I believe that these will further encourage the private sector to enter into new partnerships. Section 16 of the Act provides tax relief on donations made by individuals and corporations in relation to research and the acquisition of equipment.  Section 25 provides a mechanism to encourage investment in third level buildings or in machinery or plant.  These measures provide new possibilities for encouraging partnership with the private sector in financing approved capital projects in third level education.  I will keep the issues of postgraduate funding and funding for research equipment under review in the light of available resources.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education and Science</askee>
      <Quest>if he will sympathetically review the application for a higher education grant by a person (details supplied) in County Kilkenny who has a disability; and if the medical expenses incurred by the applicant's mother will be taken into consideration in the review.</Quest>

      <P>Under the terms of the third level student support schemes, a candidate's reckonable income for the purposes of the award of a grant is the candidate's gross income from all sources and that of her/his parents or guardians, where applicable.</P>
      <P>I understand from Kilkenny County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme, that the reckonable income in this case exceeds the income limit for the payment of a maintenance grant.  The student's fees are being met under the free fees initiative and the local authority will award her a grant of £250 in respect of the charge for student services, registration and examinations.</P>
      <P>The student referred to by the Deputy received a grant from the special fund for students with disabilities for the 1996-97 academic year.  She may apply to this fund for further assistance for the 1997-98 academic year and I have arranged for details of this fund to be sent to her immediately.</P>
