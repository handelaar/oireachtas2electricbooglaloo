    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>As it made clear in the White Paper on Foreign Policy, the Government is committed to the process of ever closer Union among the peoples of Europe.  My new year statement clearly falls within the spirit of that commitment.</P>
      <P>I addressed the European Parliament on Wednesday 15 January on the outcome of the Dublin European Council and on the Irish Presidency of the European Union.  In the course of my address, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House, I outlined the significant progress made by the Irish Presidency and the Dublin European Council, particularly on the key issues of economic and monetary union, the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking, employment policy and the intergovernmental conference.  The response of MEPs was overwhelmingly favourable on the performance of the Irish Presidency and the outcome of the Dublin European Council.</P>
      <P>In my address I also focused on the longer-term challenges facing the European Union in the overall context of the global challenges of income inequality and population growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I was in Strasbourg, I had a short meeting with the President of the European Commission, <Col N="1530" /> Mr. Jacques Santer.  I told President Santer that Ireland opposed the 10 per cent cut in the rate of export refunds for beef and cattle exports and requested that the Commission reconsider this decision.  I have since written to President Santer setting out Ireland's case in detail and requesting that the 10 per cent cut be rescinded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his new year statement referred to a process of an ever closer co-operation with Europe.  There is a quantum leap between what he said about fighting for a federal Europe in that statement and the process of ever closer co-operation.  Will he accept that the right approach is that followed by my party and by successive Governments which were deeply committed to supporting closer European integration rather than a federal type Europe? The approach we took has been taken by successive governments and is also taken in the Government White Paper where there is no reference to a federal Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong in his quotations.  The Maastricht Treaty agreed to when his party was in Government agreed not to ever closer co-operation, which is mere intergovernmentalism, but to ever closer union. &ldquo;Union&rdquo; means unity within Europe in a union. The Deputy may not agree with what his party signed up to in the Maastricht Treaty but it is there as the law of the European Union.  That Union should be made ever closer.  From the outset the European Union has enjoyed many of the characteristics of a federation.  In many senses the European Union is already a federal structure. That European law has supremacy over national law in the courts of each nation state is the characteristic not of an intergovernmental arrangement but of a federal state.  That is an important characteristic of the European Union. There are other aspects of federation in other parts of the world that the Union has not yet adopted.  I could list for the Deputy a number of characteristics of a federal state that the Union has already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the proper approach is being taken in supporting integration to which we, like all other parties in the House, are committed but not in the sense of federalism, which term does not appear in the Government's White Paper?  Is it the case that the parties in Government do not subscribe to it? Is the Taoiseach concerned, as he should be, that raising the issue could be needlessly divisive and will he accept that we do not want downgrading of our status as a fully fledged member of the international community while being deeply committed to supporting European integration?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;something one goes far beyond in joining the European Union.  In his second supplementary he referred, more sensibly, to the need for ever closer integration, something I support, believe in and understand.  Perhaps the Deputy does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not grateful for the lecture. Will the Taoiseach agree it is very much in Ireland's interests to maintain the cohesion of the European Union and that when we held the Presidency in 1990 and 1996 we went to great lengths to avoid a scenario of an isolated Britain versus the rest?  Will he agree that we in Ireland want Britain to join European Monetary Union as soon as possible and that any talk of federalism with its implications for national sovereignty will only frighten Britain off to the detriment of our domestic economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the Deputy's first and second questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and, to his third, &ldquo;most definitely no&rdquo;.  I do not believe Britain is frightened off by those who have ambitions of the kind I expressed for an ever closer union of European peoples and by people expressing them publicly. One of the good characteristics of the British political system, and our own, is that it allows robust and honest debate.  For us to pretend to believe things we do not believe or to have beliefs other than those we have would not do democracy a service.  The European Union is a democratic entity where people should freely express their convictions, as I have expressed mine, on European issues.  I took great care in the exercise of my responsibilities as President of the European Council not to allow any country, be it Britain or any other, to be isolated.  It was because of the good preparation for the Dublin summit that we had the necessary information to ensure no country was isolated.  We were thereby able to get an outstandingly good result from the Dublin European Council, one of the best and most successful summits in recent memory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that fiscal federalism is, at best, some way down the road; that the French and British Governments which are facing big economic problems in trying to bring themselves into line with the Maastricht criteria are in no mood to cough up more for the budget in Brussels, and that the cohesion question is vitally important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will not.  When the Deputy's party was in office it looked for £8 billion. That constituted a concrete and tangible expression of fiscal federalism in favour of countries <Col N="1532" /> which are less well off.  It is not in Ireland's interests to be tepid in our support for fiscal federalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach's commitment to a federal Europe extend to support for a European defence policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty agreed when the Deputy's party was in office and signed by him contains a commitment to the development of a defence policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Taoiseach's view on the matter?  I outlined my view the day I signed the Treaty.  Perhaps our views do not correspond. I understand a common defence policy will be a key component in a federal Europe and because small states under the decision making system will be in the second division, decisions on defence matters will be taken out of our hands. We are trying to hold on to our commissioner. If we follow the Taoiseach's concept of a federal Europe, as I understand it from his statements, the status of small states will be downgraded. That is what others in the same grouping as ourselves seem to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When he signed the Maastricht Treaty on behalf of Ireland the Deputy signed up to the aspiration of a common defence and he should not now attempt when he is not in a position of responsibility to resile from commitments he gave when he was in a position of responsibility. It is very important that Ireland approaches that issue in a way that will preserve our traditional position and recognise the distinctive contribution we have made to the overall building of Europe.  There are now a number of other member states which have a policy of neutrality.  The Treaty commitments signed up to at Maastricht need to be pursued in light of that reality.</P>
      <P>The Government has approached the matter in a constructive way in so far as it has looked at a step by step approach which will involve us in taking initial responsibility in what are known as the Petersberg tasks, humanitarian missions involving a military contribution but which are not primarily military in their objective.  This is an approach which can be supported by the Irish people who have a strong understanding of the need for humanitarian actions but who also recognise that for humanitarian relief to be given one needs some means of maintaining order and holding the ring.  Action in that context would have the support of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>We will pursue this matter in a pragmatic and sensible way with a view to ensuring that Europe is strong enough to defend what it has achieved and is also generous in the way it approaches the needs of other countries and recognises the different traditions of member states, including the traditional approach of this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Questions Nos. 2 and 3 the Taoiseach said he discussed the issue of foreign subsidies and cuts with the President of the Commission.  In the course of that discussion did he express his concern about statements made by the Agriculture Commissioner prior to the meeting, particularly his comments that the CAP will have to be reformed before the next world trade agreement and that the various restrictions and impediments to world trade will have to be removed?  That will present huge difficulties for us.  The Commissioner also said that pressure to trim farm subsidies will come from the European Union's ambitions to extend membership to countries in eastern Europe and that if we keep going in the way we are they will cost almost £9 billion per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He further said this will result in huge cuts when the 15 member states shortly sit down to negotiate a new six year deal.  What was the Taoiseach's response to these statements and how does he see the CAP being reformed? Is the Government yet in a position to outline what position we will take in the next round of negotiations?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the European Commission on the matter of the reduction in export refunds which had been decided by the European Commission some days previously.  Under the GATT agreement, which was agreed to on behalf of the Commission by the former Commissioner MacSharry, an upper limit was placed on the level of exports by the European Union which could be subject to export refunds.  The Commission, which had entered into international commitments in that matter at the time Commissioner MacSharry signed the world trade deal on behalf of the EU, was concerned to ensure that it did not breach its international commitments and that was the reason for that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represented to the President of the Commission that this decision had serious implications for Ireland as it exports nine tenths of the beef it produces and exports a great part of that outside the EU.  Any reduction in export refunds would have a greatly disproportionate negative effect on the incomes of producers in Ireland, as against producers in other countries.  The President of the Commission was careful in the note he took of what I said and I am glad to say that subsequently, <Col N="1536" /> following representations by myself, the Minister for Agriculture and others, a change has been made in the method of calculation of the periods used for determining whether or not there should be reduction, or otherwise, in the export refunds.</P>
    <P>The period of three months when licences could be bought will be reduced to one month. This change, although technical, will I hope ensure that community exports are micro-managed in a more careful and ongoing way and that people are not allowed to sit on licences.  This would put the Commission above the agreed limits in the MacSharry deal and would therefore allow the Commission to review the state of community penetration on a monthly basis, with beef exports enjoying the refunds of the world market. I hope we will revert to a situation where this level of reduction in export refunds will no longer be necessary and that the Commission will be able to continue to support Irish beef exports while at the same time adhering to the commitments it gave in the GATT deal at Marrakesh.</P>

      <P>That would probably be best done through the National Economic and Social Council, which has already undertaken a study of this matter.  It is a forum representing all the principal economic and social interests.  If the Deputy believes a wider group would be useful, the National Economic and Social Forum, which contains a wider range of representative interests, could also consider the matter.  I agree it is important that this matter be discussed and studied carefully.  Ireland committed itself in the Maastricht Treaty.  It did not seek an opt-out at that time, as Denmark and Britain did.  We are committed to membership if we comply with the terms.  It is important we should prepare as well as possible for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Study No. 1: Challenges for the European Union: Integration and Enlargement.  This is an analysis of economic and social policy issues arising in the European Union.  The study focuses on three issues: (i) economic and social cohesion; (ii) the Union's eastern frontier and possible eastern <Col N="1540" /> enlargement; and (iii) economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>The study examines each of these policy areas in the light of new understandings of EU policymaking and the current stage of European integration. This study was undertaken by the NESC Secretariat and is currently going through final approval by the council.  Its likely time of publication is early March.</P>
    <P>Study No.2: Competitive Advantage and Clusters in the Irish Economy: A Study of Selected Manufacturing and Service Activities.  The central purpose of this study is to explore how policy can promote the development of clusters in the Irish economy.  This involved an analysis of industries in three sectors:</P>
    <P>(i) indigenous manufacturing for which the dairy industry was selected; (ii) the internationally traded services for which the music industry was selected; and (iii) a sector which has been influenced to an appreciable degree by some form of contact or interaction with foreign multinational companies in Ireland and here the software industry was selected.  This study was undertaken by consultants who have now submitted their first report which is currently being considered by the council.</P>
    <P>Study No. 3: Ireland's Investment Performance. This study was undertaken by a consultant and is now being worked on by the Secretariat.  It will be discussed by the council at its meeting on Friday,21 February 1997.</P>
    <P>Study No. 4: Socio-Demographic Trends and Settlement Patterns: Implications for Public Policy. The council is undertaking a study of socio-demographic trends and their policy implications. A work programme was agreed comprising an examination of observed and projected trends and patterns in demographic and related social change.  This study has now been reactivated, having been set aside for the Secretariat's work on <i>Strategy into the 21st Century.</i> It is now proposed to incorporate a study of settlement patterns in the overall study.  Such a study was requested by my Department following the action plan of the Western Development Partnership Board.  I have requested that the first reports be made available by mid-1997, if possible.</P>
    <P>Study No. 5: Benchmarking.  Partnership 2000 includes a commitment that the NESC, in consultation with relevant Government Departments, will benchmark Irish progress in the areas covered in the partnership, both over time and in comparison with other countries.  This will involve reviewing the evidence, both national and across EU countries, of experience with benchmarking and related approaches in the public sector, and evaluating its appropriateness for application in the Irish public sector.  The study will be undertaken by the Secretariat with consultancy input where specialist expertise is necessary.  A research proposal will be presented to the April meeting of the council.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that a year ago I suggested that the National Economic and Social Council undertake studies on European Monetary Union.  I welcome the fact that this report will be available in approximately one month.  As a result of the conclusions of the work of the council a number of business organisations have suggested &mdash; Deputy Harney raised this matter earlier &mdash; that they should engage with the Government and the State agencies to help industry prepare for European Monetary Union.  Studies undertaken in 1996 indicate that while there is still enormous support for European Monetary Union among small, medium and large businesses, there is a lack of knowledge in regard to what they should be doing to prepare for European Monetary Union.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the council's study should be used in conjunction with the Government to assist industry in preparing for European Monetary Union which they support but for which they are totally unprepared?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a constructive suggestion with which I agree.  It would be useful not just to have this report debated in the rather limited circle in which such reports tend to be debated but to have a proactive discussion with both sides of industry, and the farming sector also, on the implications of the single currency and, most importantly, the opportunities of the single currency.  It is important to recognise that the onset of the single currency will bring major opportunities for Ireland.  It will reduce the costs of transactions in and out of Ireland; it will make Ireland a more attractive investment location than it has been previously; and hopefully it will open up access to sources of long-term finance in particular that may not have been available to us previously where there was a currency risk, however small, involved in the transaction.  It would be very useful to have a structured, joint analysis of the opportunities and the threats between the Government services and the social partners.  While I indicated to Deputy Harney earlier that the NESC would be the body to carry out a study, the elaboration of that study into practical sectoral discussion is something that might require a new structure, and I will certainly pursue that matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  While some valuable work on European Monetary Union has been done by committees of the House over a number of years, little debate has taken place on the floor of the House.  Some Members may have fallen behind with valuable work.  There is a view that some of the proposed studies that have been debated have not taken place, although I am aware they have because I have taken a personal interest in this issue.  This report should be debated in the House and the presentations should be summarised for Members so everybody will be aware of them.  If Members are engaged in informing the public that there has <Col N="1542" /> not been dialogue and debate we could all run into great difficulty later.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 19 January 1997, referred to by the Deputy, I identified a number of the more significant challenges which face us as a society in the coming years.  Among these is the need for us to recognise that the system of Government administration which was designed in the early part of this century can no longer be assumed to be the best available option for the conduct of public business in the era of the information society.</P>
      <P>Change is necessary in the way in which our public service is managed and in the way in which our system of Government generally is managed. The major elements of the Government's programme of change for the public service are as set out in <i>Delivering Better Government,</i> published last May.  This provides for the modernisation of the public service over the coming years. In particular, there are opportunities for the devolution of responsibility and accountability in order to allow the people closest to the point of service delivery to make the relevant and appropriate decisions in each case.</P>
      <P>The Public Service Management Bill, which is due to be published shortly, will give legislative effect to this devolution and lead to a more streamlined approach and customer focused orientation throughout the public service.</P>
      <P>Additionally, it has become clear in recent years that, as our society becomes more diversified and complex, Government by one party, on its own, will become less and less frequent.  The approach to the management of coalition obviously needs to be different to the approach to the management of single party Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of coalition Government is more than just a process of compromise.  It involves completely abandoning one party thinking.  Successful coalition requires that each and every one of the parties in that coalition approach it with a partnership mentality and a willingness to spend as much time thinking <Col N="1543" /> about the problems of the other parties as it spends thinking about its own problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was going to be stimulated by the Taoiseach's great ideas about reinventing our system of Government.  Is the Taoiseach really saying that his definition of reinventing the system of Government for the 21st century is to make sure we have more programme managers, handlers and press officers?  Has the Taoiseach abandoned the Strategic Management Initiative?  Has he no real concern?  I do not mind the Taoiseach laughing because it is a bit of a laugh.  Nothing is happening with it.  It is costing money but there has been no progress.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, got lost in the Departments while dealing with it.</P>
      <P>Is there anything new in this system of Government for the 21st century other than what the Taoiseach has already stated?  He puts it out as some sort of visionary line on new proposals, but is there really anything behind it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, the article to which I am referring in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> covered a large range of topics.  I have referred to only two of them.  In regard to reform of the system of Government at administrative level, the availability of information technology means you do not need the hierarchical system of public administration that has operated for several hundred years.  Information is now instantly available to those making and delivering the decisions, without the necessity of an intermediary hierarchical system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach ever hear of the Office of the Minister for Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, hierarchies in the public service tended to be a means of dispensing &mdash; and, in some instances, controlling &mdash; information. Now that a more sophisticated system is available, there is not the same need for this elaborate structure.  It is possible to devolve more responsibility to front line management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is easy to describe that, it is much more difficult to apply it in a practical way in each office of Government. That process, which is being pursued in a purposeful way by the Government, will take a number of years.  It also needs legislative backing &mdash; a law to underpin it. The Ministers and Secretaries Act, which centralises all responsibility in the Minister, is not entirely consistent with a process of devolving <Col N="1544" /> responsibility.  That is why we need to reform the law concerning Government.  The Public Services Bill, which will be published shortly, will provide a legal basis for this major process of reform.</P>
    <P>As far as political responsibility for Government is concerned, it is important to have the necessary governmental stability for taking decisions in a coherent and purposeful way.  A spirit of partnership within Government is required, which involves the abandonment of one party thinking and statements which derive from that.  I am glad this Government operates on a partnership basis.  Each party works not just to look after the concerns their constituency represents, but with equal concern for the views of other constituencies represented in the Government and the country at large.</P>

      <P>The reason for answering in the way I have is not just that it happens to correspond to answers given by Ministers in other situations where a criminal file remains open.

The real reason is that detailed disclosure as to where precisely a matter of this kind starts, what contacts may have been made and what precisely may or may not be contemplated by the Garda Síochána and the DPP could genuinely prove to be counterproductive.  It would be very wrong to take my answer as a signal of inactivity on the part of the Garda Síochána in this case, far from it.  The Garda Síochána are fully aware of what is being claimed and will continue to make their own professional judgments in consultation as necessary with the DPP as to what course of action may be appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There were, on 24 January last, a total of 465 prisoners on temporary release.  Several of these individuals would have been granted temporary release irrespective of the current shortage of prison accommodation.  The plans the Minister has brought forward, and which were approved by the Government in 1996, provide for an accelerated prisons capital building programme to provide more than 800 additional prison places in the period up to the end of 1998.</P>
      <P>In excess of 160 additional places under this programme became available in 1996, a further 180 places are scheduled to be completed in the current year, and the remaining 460 new places will become available in 1998.  The building programme, when completed, will provide an increase of 35 per cent in the total prison capacity.</P>
      <P>Records are not maintained in such a manner as to provide the precise information requested by the Deputy in respect of the average proportion of sentence served in each case.  I assure the Deputy, however, that in the case of offenders convicted of serious crimes such as sex offences and those who are considered to pose a real threat in the community such as violent or otherwise dangerous offenders, there is no question of their being granted temporary release to relieve pressure on accommodation.</P>

Surely there is even a manual system of recording when a person enters and exits a jail.  Why is the information I requested not available?</P>
      <P>What has been the cost to date of the 160 extra prison places which the Minister said have been provided since the so-called accelerated prisons building programme was announced in July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Records are available, but my reply stated that records are not maintained in such a manner as to provide the precise information requested by the Deputy in respect of the average proportion of sentence served in each case.</P>
      <P>As far as the other part of her question is concerned, it might be as well to remind the Deputy and the House just how much has been done by this Minister and the Government in providing prison spaces which were not provided by previous administrations.  The Minister has brought forward a major prisons building programme for the provision of more than 800 additional prison places.  This represents an increase of about 35 per cent on the capacity of 2,150 which existed at the beginning of the year.  The new remand prison at Wheatfield for 400 males is due for completion by the end of 1998.  There is the main prison for 150 convicted adult male prisoners at Castlerea, County Roscommon.  The new wing at Limerick Prison for adult male prisoners is due for completion in October 1997.  The new women's prison for 60 females beside Mountjoy Prison, Dublin, is due for completion in early 1998.  The Castlerea Prison Unit A, a small separate special unit for up to 40 male prisoners on a site adjoining the main prison at Castlerea, County Roscommon, was to be completed in October 1996 and is now in operation.  The Curragh Prison for 70 convicted adult male prisoners was completed in November 1996 and is now in operation.  In addition, approximately a further 70 prison places have already been brought into use in existing prisons under this programme.  I am not in a position to give the amount of money involved for all of this extension of prison places but very considerable progress is being made and more can be expected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the cost per unit of the 160 extra prison places to which the Minister referred, which have been provided since July? The Minister said records are not maintained in such a way as would inform the House as to the average length of sentence served by each prisoner.  If it is the case that there is a record of when a prisoner enters prison and when he or she is allowed out on full temporary release or for whatever reason, surely that figure could be calculated if there was the political will and the powers that be wanted to release this information. Just as figures are not available to give information as to the number of crimes committed by persons on temporary release, is it not the case that those figures are not available for the inforer <Col N="1549" /> mation of the House for a good reason?  Is it not true that those figures would make worrying and disturbing reading for members of the public? When I table a question as to the average length of stay of a prisoner in our jails and there are figures on prisoners entering and leaving jail, why is this information not being given to me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants precise information, she should table precise questions.  Where the information is available it will be given and obviously where the information is not available it will not be given, but for the Deputy to suggest there is a lack of political will, political sleight of hand or whatever in answering these questions is absolute nonsense.  This Government is proud of what it has done so far in making additional places available in prisons.  In comparison with previous administrations, the Government has a very good record indeed so there is no reluctance to disclose the figures.</P>
      <P>On the first question, if the Deputy tables a question on the cost per unit, I will do my best to ensure she will get an answer to it.</P>

      <P>A variety of applications seeking to enforce the different remedies available under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, have been made by the Criminal Assets Bureau to the High Court. The Bureau has obtained interim and interlocutory orders under sections 2 and 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, in two cases involving five persons.</P>
      <P>The Bureau has also obtained interim orders under section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, in two cases involving three persons and applications for interlocutory orders are pending. As the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, provides for disposal orders only after a period of seven years has elapsed, no funds have as yet been realised for the Exchequer.  As all the applications and hearings to date have been held <i>in camera</i>, it would be inappropriate to publish any further particulars of these cases.  Other cases being investigated by the Bureau may lead to further court applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications have also been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to restrain assets under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, in four cases involving a total of seven persons.  The value of the cash assets involved was approximately <Col N="1550" /> £168,000, being cash and money held in accounts maintained at financial institutions.  In addition, two applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 38 of the 1994 Act in relation to five persons resulted in the detention of cash assets of approximately £30,000. The value of other realisable assets which were subject to restraint orders in these cases is not readily available.</P>
    <P>The Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, provides a structure for the more effective exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda on an ongoing basis.

In the light of that statement will the Minister of State give an assurance that every one of those individuals will be investigated under this legislation and freezing orders sought in the court in respect of their assets?  The underlying philosophy is that if the wealth is taken from those who are trading in death in society for the purposes of acquiring wealth the underlying reason for their vile activities will be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue here is the possible variation of opening hours of stations in the context of extending the rural community policing scheme to provide a better service to the community.</P>
      <P>The rural community policing scheme has been operating in 14 Garda districts throughout the State since 1991.  It was intended that the schemes, once operational for a reasonable period, would be extended to other districts.  The Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing scheme and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension.  This involves a consultative process taking in consultations with local Garda management, the Garda Representative Associations and, most important, local community interests.</P>
      <P>This process, by its nature, will take some time to complete.  However, the Minister is particularly anxious to ensure there will be sufficient consultations with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  It is only after the detailed consultative process has been completed that the Garda Commissioner will be in a position to submit proposals to the Minister as to whether rural policing should be extended, or modified as the case may be.</P>
      <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years in the media and by the public about this scheme.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at allowing the gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.  It is precisely these objectives which are being examined to see how well they have been met in the existing rural policing areas.</P>

      <P>On 21 November 1996 the Minister for Justice, as reported in column 1635 of the Official Report, stated that the Garda Commissioner, following a further review in June 1994, submitted a report to her Department outlining proposals for a further extension of the <Col N="1552" /> rural policing scheme.  She indicated to the House that discussions were ongoing between her Department and the Garda authorities.  At no stage in the course of her reply did the Minister advert to the possibility that some rural Garda stations might be closed.</P>
      <P>Subsequently reports appeared in newspapers to the effect that this matter was also under consideration. The Minister of State has enlightened the House in relation to what is being considered. I put it to him that the closure of rural Garda stations should not be a consequence of the extension of the rural policing scheme.  There is a feeling in the rural community, rightly or wrongly, that it is the intention of the Government to close rural Garda stations by stealth.</P>

      <P>I am not surprised the previous reply from the Minister for Justice, to which the Deputy referred, did not mention the closing of rural Garda stations.  Neither is there a mention in this reply of the closing of rural Garda stations. What is stated in the reply is that the Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing scheme and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension. This involves a consultative process taking in consultations with local Garda management, the Garda representative associations and, most important, local community interests.  This process of consultation, by its nature, will take some time.  The Deputy will agree the process of consultation is an extremely important one, that the views of the groups to which I have referred, including those of local people and of Members, should be taken into consideration.  It is only when that consultative process has reached a conclusion that the Minister will take decisions on this matter.  That consultative process is ongoing and, therefore, no decisions have been taken.</P>

      <P>The Garda strength on 31 October 1996 was 10,784.  There is a general feeling that the numbers in the Force are too low and that a recruitment campaign is necessary to ensure natural wastage will not continue to outstrip recruitment.  In this context I ask the Minister of State for a categoric assurance that no rural Garda stations will be closed and that there will be a sufficiency of gardaí to deal with problems in rural areas, as a result of an adequate recruitment drive.  My colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, our spokesperson on social welfare, has tabled a question today regarding the safety of older people from assault and robbery.  In the event of a closure or the prospect of a closure of rural Garda stations or an insufficient number of gardaí in the force for rural Garda stations and to police rural areas vulnerable people will be extremely frightened.  The reason I am seeking assurances from the Minister of State is because of reports which appeared in the print media.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be as aware as I am that one cannot always rely on reports in the <Col N="1553" /> print media or elsewhere.  In some cases I do not pay much attention to such reports.  As I said, when the ongoing consultation process has been finalised the Minister will, of course, take the necessary decisions.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a later question tabled by Deputy Walsh.  I give him the same assurance as I will give Deputy Walsh, that the Minister for Justice is very aware of the problems in rural areas and of the fears of older people in particular and will continue to do everything possible to allay these fears.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister of State has failed to satisfy me and others who were seeking reassurances on this matter.  Does he not realise there is little need for consultation on the question of whether rural Garda stations should be closed?  Farming organisations, voluntary community groups and public representatives have made it abundantly clear over a period of time that the closure of rural Garda stations would be a retrograde step and only give solace to criminals. I again ask the Minister of State to give an assurance to people living in rural areas that a decision will not be taken in the discussions taking place to close rural Garda stations.</P>

      <P>I referred earlier to a misunderstanding of the objectives of the rural community policing scheme.  These misunderstandings appear to be shared by the Deputy.  The rural community policing scheme is not designed to close rural Garda stations, rather it is intended to increase and facilitate greater Garda contact with the community, including the elderly.  That is the purpose of the scheme, and not to close rural Garda stations.</P>

      <P>Security considerations play a major role in the arrangements for escorts of prisoners, whether between prisons, to court or hospital or for other purposes.  The level of security <Col N="1554" /> in each case is determined by a number of factors, including the length of sentence being served by the offender, an assessment of the risk of attempted escape and, of course, the potential risk to the community in each case.</P>
      <P>Despite the most stringent precautions, however, there will always be an element of risk inherent in transporting prisoners outside the secure confines of the prisons.  It is important to keep the level of such incidents in context.  In 1996 more than 13,000 prisoners were escorted outside the prisons.  In less than one in every thousand of these cases incidents occurred leading to the escape of prisoners and, of these, four prisoners remain at large today.</P>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, seriously concerned at any level of escapes from custody wherever and however they occur.  As a matter of routine, security of escorts is reviewed after every escape or attempted escape.  Following an incident late last year the arrangements for the handcuffing of prisoners were reviewed.  New equipment has been adopted which will greatly reduce the possibility of incidents of the type to which I referred. The question of the type and design of vehicle best suited for the transport of prisoners is also being reviewed.  The Minister has also ordered a further tightening up of the procedures for searching prisoners prior to and following escorts. These measures will help lower the risk of further similar incidents.</P>

Given the importance of a sufficient level of security when transporting criminals, some of whom can be very dangerous, these reviews should be completed by now.

As a result the new equipment has been adopted which will greatly reduce the possibility of incidents of the type referred to in my reply.  A promise was given to review the type and design of vehicle best suited for the transport of prisoners and this is being carried out.

Will he also agree that if procedures need to be tightened up action should be taken immediately?  In an incident in my constituency the prisoner was apprehended but the member of the force was injured, although thankfully not to the detriment of his life.  Will the Minister of State agree it is very important for measures to be introduced immediately so as to ensure the safety of those who transport prisoners?  Will he also agree that prisoners should be checked before they leave prison to ensure they do not have access to implements which could be used to injure the people transporting them?</P>

      <P>As always, I listened very carefully to the Deputy.  I am not sure why she used the word &ldquo;infantile&rdquo; and she might consider using another word.  She may not fully appreciate the difficulties involved.  For example, many prisoners can use considerable ingenuity and some people would prefer to avoid the practice of strip searching except in the most necessary of cases.  It is very difficult to cover all possible eventualities but a review has been carried out on the use of handcuffs and another review of vehicles is taking place.  The Minister and I will listen to constructive suggestions from any side of the House about ways to deal with these unfortunate incidents, many of which are a product of considerable ingenuity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that each regional assistant commissioner and divisional officer has strategies in place to combat attacks on the elderly.  These take the form of special regional, divisional and district operations, utilisation of the community alert schemes, liaison with local community groups and crime prevention advice from local crime prevention officers.  Among the measures being taken by the Garda Síochána are operations which involve <Col N="1556" /> backup from the Air Corps and the placing of mobile checkpoints at strategic locations throughout the State; extra patrols in areas at special risk; increased Garda visits to the elderly to advise them on measures to improve their personal safety; increased visits to neighbours and relations to enlist their assistance in the protection of the elderly; increased contacts with voluntary agencies working with the elderly; special requests to voluntary agencies and the public to report matters out of the ordinary to the gardaí without delay; increased activity by crime prevention officers in areas affected and encouragement for the development of neigbourhood watch and community alert schemes in areas not already covered by them.  The full co-operation of the community and voluntary agencies working with the elderly is, of course, critical to the success of these measures.</P>
    <P>It will be of interest to Members to hear that the gardaí evaluated the operation of the community alert scheme in 15 selected areas.  Based on research carried out on the crime levels for the three year periods before and after the community alert scheme was established, a 17 per cent decrease in attacks on the elderly, a 25 per cent decrease in burglaries and a 21 per cent decrease in other crimes were recorded.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 800 community alert schemes in operation involving more than 150,000 households.  As a practical demonstration of her support for the expansion of this valuable scheme, the Minister provided £50,000 to Muintir na Tíre to assist it in expanding the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Social Welfare established a Task Force on Security for the Elderly last year.  The Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána were represented on the task force by senior officers.  It made a series of recommendations on the security of pensioners and my Department is implementing those for which it has responsibility. The Deputy will be aware that before Christmas the Ministers for Justice and Social Welfare jointly launched an information pack containing Garda crime prevention leaflets, relevant to the security needs of the elderly, and Department of Social Welfare leaflets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that some of the most recent horrendous and vicious attacks involved the elderly?  Despite the good work of the community alert scheme and voluntary organisations, elderly people live in fear.  The mobility of the Garda force, particularly in rural areas, is a matter of concern.  Has the Garda received additional resources for transport and mobile telephones to enable it deal with this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem providing additional resources in this area.  In addition to what I stated in my reply, I will outline other examples of the anti-crime strategies being implemented.  Operations Meabh/Retrieval have <Col N="1557" /> been in place for some time and are co-ordinated by assistant commissioners in western and eastern regions.  They have successfully controlled the activities of travelling criminals in the midlands, mid-west and western areas.  They are designed to dovetail Garda strategy on both sides of the River Shannon by means of checkpoints and intensive mobile patrolling, backed up by the Air Corps helicopter.</P>
      <P>A number of anti-crime operations are in place in the southern region, about which I assume the Deputy has a particular interest.  They include Operation South-West which was introduced in the run up to Christmas.  It was designed to curb the activities of known criminal gangs and involves designated sector patrolling and checkpoints. Operation ATC was put in place in April 1996 and continues to operate in the 22 districts in the southern region.  It combines up to date intelligence with dedicated strategic checkpoints which are decided on available intelligence or in addition to other routine patrolling and checkpoints. A special operation was introduced in the Cork city area to counter a series of crimes against the elderly in large urban centres.  A special unit successfully targeted specific gangs and resulted in a number of prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Operation Mount Leinster was introduced in the autumn of 1996 with the objective of targeting the activities of travelling criminals and criminal gangs from the greater Dublin region.  It continues to operate and involves a series of strategic checkpoints designed to be flexible and intelligence based.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to preventing these abominable attacks on old people and we will use whatever resources and imagination are required to stop them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister state there is no problem in providing additional resources to address this problem.  I recently attended a community alert meeting at which it was obvious gardaí operate over and above the call of duty in this regard, but they claimed there is a shortage of resources to purchase telephone aids.  The additional £2 million provided in the budget will not be adequate to address this problem.  The Minister stated on two occasions that the Air Corps gave helicopter support in the fight against this type of crime.  How many helicopters have night flying facilities?</P>

I <Col N="1558" /> am a humble man.  I will not attempt to answer questions to which I do not know the answer.  The Government and the Minister are deeply committed to bringing an end to attacks on the old and most vulnerable people in society.  I have already indicated the amount of resources the Government has made available and what the Government has been prepared to do to stop these dastardly attacks.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister of State's rhetoric and to learn that there is no difficulty with resources.  Would that that were the case and that the Minister for Justice would react with the same optimistic abandon as the Minister of State.  The Government, which is supposed to be committed to providing whatever resources are necessary, has failed to provide a humble Garda car to many Garda stations, let alone a helicopter with night sights.  In this era of high technology mobile telephones the members of the security forces are denied the use of them. How can the Minister of State inform the House, tongue in cheek, that sufficient resources are available and that the Garda will have whatever is required to fight these vile attacks on the elderly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget debate affords us a rare opportunity to discuss in this Chamber the economic performance of the Government.  This matter is usually discussed in committees where nobody listens.  In the Chamber there is an opportunity to consider the objectives of the budget and the extent to which the political imperatives as identified by the Administration have taken over from what is fiscally prudent in the circumstances. There is a definite lack of consideration of our entry into the single currency.  There is an assumption in the mid to long-term fiscal scenarios outlined in the budget that the future will be certain and favourable.  It ill behoves the Minister for Finance to claim to be munificent on the one hand and the author of fiscal rectitude on the other.</P>
      <P>This budget, as with many other areas of Government activity, is an amalgam of policies, cobbled together by the parties involved in an attempt to satisfy their own perceived narrow political constituencies.  If the economic philosophy of the Fine Gael Party means anything, it is difficult to see how Democratic Left, or indeed the Labour Party, can claim total credit for its direction.  It showed its teeth some months before the budget when it got in on the Labour Party act of establishing a parliamentary party committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Hogan who demanded that the top rate of tax should be reduced.  That was a core demand of the Fine Gael Party in the negotiations on the budget, but there has been a distinct failure on its part to achieve it since the other parties did not seek such a reduction.  The top rate of tax should be reduced since it applies at a base of £13,200.  For many people earning that amount of money, the failure of that party &mdash; which claims to be more in favour of private enterprise and the productive sector of the economy than the social services sector &mdash; to achieve a reduction in the top rate of income tax is ample testimony to its impotence in conducting negotiations in the lead-up to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is obvious from the fact that the Minister for Finance and the public service did not conclude the public service deal.  It was concluded by a side of the social partnership model rarely seen &mdash; a trade union leader went to the Labour Party Leader and sorted it out with no involvement by the Taoiseach, the man who has written books and pamphlets about how we should order our public finances.  He is at the pinnacle of political power but had no involvement in a critical part <Col N="1567" /> of Partnership 2000.  In addition, the Minister for Finance, as has been reported without denial in newspapers recently, was totally undermined by his party leader.  However, we understand all is rosy between them again.</P>
    <P>It is clear this is an election budget.  It is an attempt by this Administration to boost its popularity so that it can go to the polls with some confidence in its prospects for re-election.  I am sure many of its members have gone to their constituencies and found it was not the election budget they thought it was.  It has been met with an unvarying degree of apathy everywhere I have been.  No one was overly impressed and the main reason was the inability of this Administration once again to keep its mouth shut before it presented the budget.  Public relations officers of the three parties, in various breakouts to the media, were getting in one before the other to see who was going to get out the best story.  Two weeks before the budget, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, claimed credit for social welfare increases beginning on 5 April when tax cuts would be introduced.  This was to be a major achievement for Democratic Left. Fine Gael and the Labour Party offered their platitudes as to how they would do in this budget. Unfortunately, they talked up the budget before it was announced to such a degree that no one was listening.  People were disappointed because the spin doctors had given the impression there was going to be more on offer.  The fourth instalment of the standard rate of mortgage interest relief was not mentioned in the budget.  What people recognise is that they may be better off by £4 to £6 per week.  In these buoyant economic times that is not regarded by taxpayers as a particularly munificent gesture.</P>
    <P>This Minister has had less room to manoeuvre on tax cuts because, on the publication of the Book of Estimates before Christmas, he had already dealt his cards.  The old maxim of the sign of a good government being the ability to say no is certainly one that cannot be applied to this Administration.  Public expenditure increases are too high.  Over the past three years it had a real opportunity to get a better mix between increased public expenditure and tax deductions which would make its electoral position better than it is now.  Its failure to do anything about it in the 1996 budget and its preparedness to front load everything into this budget will be seen for the cynical political exercise it is.  One particular statistic bears that out &mdash; £393 million of the £900 million in tax deductions or 44 per cent of the commitments given in Partnership 2000 is front loaded into this year's budget.  This is evidence that political imperatives have coloured the Government's thinking and economic logic in the presentation of this budget.</P>
    <P>The Government's jibe in regard to public services is &ldquo;where would you cut?&rdquo; The problem is that the Labour Party and Democratic Left see high public expenditure as a good end in itself. <Col N="1568" /> They will always seek to point to the high levels of public expenditure involved in the running of Government while they were in office so that they can build a reason for being in office again some time in the future.  All public expenditure should be related to total GNP and subjected to value for money audits on an ongoing basis but this Administration does not see a problem.  The fact that we have such favourable economic conditions is blinding them to the fact they are building into the base.  I am concerned good public service and high public expenditure will become a misnomer because it usually means unsustainable public services in the medium and long term. That does a great disservice to those they claim to represent or of whose political constituency they claim ownership over any other part of the political spectrum.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987 there was a need to make swingeing cuts.  Our position was so difficult economically that there were serious dislocations in the provision of services which caused great hardship.  These were necessary in the interest of trying to return public finances to some state of order.  An increase in the provision of public services is seen as an end in itself with no thinking as to how they are provided. Are there other ways in which they can be provided?  Are there ways and means by which we can control the level of public expenditure and provide more money in people's pockets and give them the choice as to what services they wish to pay for or to have?</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has failed to get back to a culture where there is nothing for nothing in the running of the economy.  We have had the abolition of this and that to service every narrow political constituency, whether it be the 300 people who attend the Democratic Left annual convention or the few Labour Party activists who still have some ideological hang ups about the provision of local services.  They will be paid for some other way and people will have charges imposed on them in other respects because there is nothing for nothing.  That has been a great step backwards under this Administration.</P>
    <P>It is hyperbole of an unreasonable kind for a Labour Party Minister to say this is a tax reforming budget.  He has reduced the standard rate of income tax by 1 per cent.  This Administration cannot deliver tax reforms if that is all that can be done.  Over the past three years with GDP growing by over 25 per cent and tax revenues at record levels, the outturn has meant that over £900 million extra in taxes have been collected. One would have expected a greater return for the taxpayer under these buoyant economic conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons there is apathy among the electorate about the ability of political parties to deliver is that in good times we decide their money is our money and spend it rather than returning it to those involved in the economic activity generating those taxes in the first place. This Government will pay for that when the eleclected <Col N="1569" /> tion is called because it is a ground of criticism it cannot evade.  If one represents working people who pay high rates of tax on low levels of pay and does not resolve that problem under favourable economic conditions, there is no point in seeking their support on the basis one will do it the next time because one can only win their support on such issues by doing the business.</P>
    <P>If that problem is not resolved when economic conditions are favourable there is no point in seeking their support on the grounds that we will do it next time.  One can only win their support on such issues by doing the business.  Unfortunately, Fine Gael is in the position that Labour in the economic ministries and Democratic Left in all ministries have the capacity to insist upon growth in public expenditure which is neither warranted nor required.  Although we have already had too many, the last three years have seen a further proliferation of quangos of every description. Many of them are not politically accountable and some of those which are receiving millions of pounds are not required.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCreevy had south Kildare included in the Offaly project.  I can assure the Minister that the people who came down to run the scheme know far less than you or I know about the problems in those areas.  We could identify community groups who would spend the money far more wisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the spending the Deputy is worried about.  He is prepared to spend money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not spend it through those people.  I am prepared to look at any given item of expenditure but in a whole range of areas we are not getting value for money.  We are told that one problem in our economy is that we do not have a sufficiently trained labour force &mdash; for instance, the construction industry is finding it difficult to obtain plasterers.  What has been done with the £400 million spent by FÁS in the past ten years, year on year?  What is happening in the social services job training, which is also supposed to involve the long-term unemployed in general activity?  Nothing is happening in those areas. Those issues should be addressed by the Government <Col N="1570" /> on a yearly or monthly basis but they are not.</P>
      <P>It is crazy that there are still far too many long-term unemployed, despite our favourable economic conditions.  They could take up jobs in the construction sector, now that it is doing so well, or semi-skilled jobs in other sectors, or could receive training which would provide them with the basic manual skills needed by contractors on building sites.  We do not have people with those skills.  We have no shortage of training schemes or companies involved in training, such as the one I mentioned, but sub-contractors cannot find plasterers, electricians, bricklayers or labourers.</P>
      <P>We have a myriad of training schemes, as I was telling the Minister when he was engaging me a moment ago.  There are many service providers and people to tell us how to do things but when we look for people to do the work we cannot find them.  That area should be examined because significant amounts of money, both from taxpayers and the Structural Funds, is being spent but the rate of return cannot be seen and there seems to be no direction in the area.</P>
      <P>The level of social welfare expenditure is so high that any expenditure over and above cost of living increases should be targeted &mdash; the continual across the board increase makes no impact. Successive Governments have not sufficiently targeted the money at widows or widowers, who have probably lost the main income earning spouse in the family and whose income has reduced by over 50 per cent in many cases.  A widow's pension for a recipient under 65 years will be £71.10 per week after this budget.  She receives an additional £17 per child so if she has three children she is expected to live on £126 per week.  The husband she has buried may have been in his mind &mdash; to late forties or early fifties and may have earned £250 per week, so she has to run the house on half the money.  She is not automatically entitled to the free electricity allowance, a free television licence or the free fuel allowance, which are available to other categories not having the same measure of family responsibilities as widows and widowers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the constitutional protection of the family is to mean anything, it is time that our commitments were made practical.  We should declare that we will differentiate between varying degrees of need.  I do not suggest that everyone receiving social welfare has an adequate income but, given the limited extra resources available with an expenditure already totalling over £4.2 billion, spending should have been targeted to these identifiable categories.  We all encounter hardship cases in our constituencies but we still run into a bureaucratic wall which is incapable of providing an answer for those families.  This is not good enough.  I am not making a party political point. I have said this since I entered the House in 1984 but for whatever reason the system seems incapable of dealing with this problem.  It is not acceptable that a widow should have to rear a family on a basic income of £71.10 per week.  We <Col N="1571" /> must do something to help people trying to bring up children having lost their partners at a critical time of life.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare claims to have a monopoly of virtue and a greater understanding of poverty issues.  That is a joke; he is no better than the rest of us in that regard.  He is unable to solve the problem but it should be solved.  If nothing else were to happen during my political career other than that problem being solved, I would be happy.  I would rather see that happen than anything else in the budget, if it were fiscally neutral.  A growing number of people are trying to keep a home together who feel totally alienated because they are not entitled to benefit from schemes which help other categories of social welfare recipients, many of whom either do not appreciate the help when they receive it or do not know that they are entitled to it.  Something should be done to help people trying to rear and educate a family on very little money.</P>
    <P>On pensions, we should target people who would like independence in their later years and want to look after themselves rather than being entitled to a free fuel scheme.  We should give them money to buy their own fuel so that they are not dependent on a health board official to decide whether they have other means.  We should discriminate in favour of certain categories and defend our decision to give them more than they currently receive, while others will have to make do with cost of living increases.  That is a far more practical and sincere approach than giving a £3 per week increase to everyone, as if that will keep the lid on the problem for this Administration or whoever introduces the next budget.</P>
    <P>The only way we will make a significant impact on tax reform, to get more people back to work and more money in workers' pockets, is to tackle our debt.  Half our income tax revenue, some £2.56 billion, goes towards the interest on our accumulated debt.  It is an indictment of successive Governments that the national debt has gone from £1 billion in 1973 to £30 billion now and the Government is projecting it will be £32 billion by the end of 1999.  Is it beyond the means of this House to broadly agree to not increase our debt above a certain level and to work within those constraints?  We would have a much more intelligent debate about the management and administration of the country if we were prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>Until we reduce the interest bill we will not be able to provide for real sustainable increases in public services and tax reduction. The best way to maintain public services at the level to which we all aspire and require for our constituents is to do something about the interest bill.  The only way we can find an extra £100 million every year to improve the health services, target social welfare, put more money in people's pockets by extending the tax bands and so on &mdash; whatever political <Col N="1572" /> decisions the Cabinet wishes to make &mdash; is to control and reduce our debt.</P>
    <P>If we do not begin to make such macro-economic decisions together in this House, we will continue to have silly budget debates.  The reason we have silly budget debates is that some people pick out the good parts while others pick out the bad, resulting in a mishmash which makes no sense.  It would be far better if we agreed to cap the national debt at £30 billion and then argued about the political priorities.</P>
    <P>The dynamic of this Administration is to build up the spending base of Government expenditure. Times are good at the moment which means it is in a position to provide tax cuts.  It then says paternalistically to the people: &ldquo;We are looking after you well; please re-elect us so that we can reinforce the stereotype&rdquo;.  That is politically stupid because the electorate is politically sophisticated. Many people tried pretty successfully to do that for many years but it will no longer work because the electorate is now far more discerning and far less prepared to give blind loyalty to political parties.  Voters want to know if something makes sense, which this does not.</P>
    <P>There is very little about agriculture in this budget, which is an increasing feature of budgets. There does not seem to be the political courage to acknowledge that reinvestment policies for farming so as to maintain the maximum number of viable farms mean providing benign tax regimes for farmers.  It seems to be politically incorrect to advocate that.  However, if we are serious about dealing with issues such as rural depopulation and the other manifestations of social change, such as the reduced impact of agriculture on the economy, we will have to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution tax relief of £20,000 is to be welcomed.  However, low income farmers who are trying to get into REPS on completion of pollution control works must wait for the mid-term review.  That should be looked at, given that commercial farmers will be able to get £20,000 tax relief and a 50 per cent write-off in the first year.</P>
    <P>There is no dairy hygiene support for small dairy farmers in the budget, which is to be criticised. There is reference in Partnership 2000 to pushing that out into a mid-term review. However, it should be dealt with now because it is by far the most profitable enterprise in farming.</P>
    <P>There is provision for 100 per cent stock relief for two years, which will mean that the additional value of cattle at the end of the financial year will not be treated as income.  That is a welcome development but the two year time period is insufficient.  I also welcome the stamp duty relief and the increase to 90 per cent of the relief for farming assets for capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    <P>However, there is failure to make provision in the budget for qualified young entrants to farming. We must recognise that the farming sector is stagnating.  We need enterprising and innovative schemes, particularly in relation to production <Col N="1573" /> rights, which would make it much easier for young people to get into farming than is the present position.  I hope that as part of the ongoing review of the beef and dairy regime at European level, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will devise innovative solutions to that problem, otherwise, we will have an aging farming population and a declining farming sector.  We all recognise that the dynamic increase in agricultural production over the past few years has come from young, enterprising, trained farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the two most important features of the budget has received hardly any attention from the Opposition because it does not seem to understand it; the second has received a great deal of attention from the Opposition but it has completely missed the point.</P>
      <P>The first important feature is that, having brought in a surplus in 1996, the Government is budgeting for a surplus this year and projecting surpluses in the next two years.  There has been very little reference to that in Opposition speeches on the budget so far or in statements by Opposition Members before the budget.  That astonishes me because if the Progressive Democrats, in particular, meant even half of what they say about budgetary policy, they should home in on that aspect.  Budgeting for a surplus this year and projecting surpluses for the next two years is the most powerful statement which can be made about the future course of budgetary and fiscal policy and the most powerful reason for people to believe that we have, at last, arrived at a maturity in our approach to budgetary and fiscal policy, for which we have been striving for quite some time.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that all the striving towards that aim has been on this side of the House.  At least one Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, clearly saw the importance of that and was heading in that direction. The pity, of course, is that his two Fianna Fáil successors as Minister for Finance dropped the ball in terms of financial management and set us back quite some way on that road.  I am delighted we are now back on that road.  Although the Progressive Democrats do not like to admit it, they have got that message.  However, as usual, the understanding of that message is imperfect and very patchy in the Fianna Fáil Party, which worries me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second important aspect of the budget is that, for once, we have seen a very measured and deliberate approach to the changes in personal income taxation.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have emoted a great deal in the past few days about how nothing has been done about the 48 per cent tax rate, because the Progressive Democrats are deliberately pitching for a particular part of the electoral market and Fianna Fáil just think it is a good idea to criticise the fact that nothing was done about the rate.  However, they <Col N="1574" /> have completely missed the point.  The fact is that whatever is done about the basic rate of taxation, the width of the first band and personal allowances delivers its full benefit to those who pay tax at the higher rate who, uniquely, can be sure of getting the full and undiluted benefit of the changes.  The difficulties with poverty traps arise for those who pay tax at the basic rate or who, if they entered the labour force, would pay tax initially at the basic rate.  The importance of concentrating our fire on that part of the tax system where resources are always limited is underlined.</P>
    <P>A clear, simple concept on taxation policy such as this is foreign to the Progressive Democrats.  It does not suit its niche in the market, nor does it suit Fianna Fáil.  Although the party understands the concept it does not want to articulate it because it is not good at making choices.  Deputy Cowen illustrated this when he gave out about the amount of expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>When he is asked to explain or make choices on expenditure it becomes clear that his problem is not with expenditure but with how money is being spent and by whom. However, he would happily spend the money in any event.  This is a feature of Fianna Fáil comment on public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>His party pretends to object to the level of current expenditure, yet it complains daily of insufficient public expenditure on this or that, and there is nothing on which it wishes to spend less.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen has argued for a greater degree of discrimination and selectivity in given budgets with regard to various social welfare payments.  I sympathise with that view, but the problem is that everybody in Fianna Fáil has different priorities and cannot agree on where the choices should be made.  The Government has agreed and produced a budget that is defensible, but Fianna Fáil never agrees on a limited number of targets in any given year.  Deputy Cowen, for as long as he is a member of Fianna Fáil, is therefore doomed to be a voice crying in the wilderness because nobody will agree with him.  His other colleagues, who take a similar view, have other priorities.  As a result they try to be all things to all men and women and turn out to be nothing much to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been much speculation in recent weeks in the media and among the Opposition about the expectation that there <Col N="1575" /> would be a pre-election budget.  However, they cannot tar the budget with that brush because they have seen a sound and sensible set of measures.</P>
      <P>The budget has been produced in an election year, but it has far more to do with the needs of our economy, and of different groups in our society, for stability in the management of public finances than it has to do with the fact that this is an election year.  In his recent speech Deputy Bertie Ahern referred to this when he said an election budget, by its nature, is an exceptional event, unlikely to happen more than once every five years.</P>
      <P>Neither the Deputy nor his colleagues in Fianna Fáil would have much chance of recognising an election budget because they have not had the chance to produce one for a long time. In 1978 they produced a post election budget following their pre-election promises.  It was a disaster and set us on the road to ruin.  Since then, they have been unable to plan one.</P>
      <P>The party pulled down its own Government in 1989.  The then Taoiseach, having thought he told his Minister for Health to resolve a specific problem which would have cost £1 million, returned from a trip to Japan to find the Government had lost a vote on a Private Members' motion.  He called an election, which he lost.  The next Government &mdash; the first coalition Government involving Fianna Fáil &mdash; reversed that which its predecessor had objected to and on which it had decided to hold an election.  This Government was then pulled down by Fianna Fáil before an election budget could be produced.  It next pulled down the subsequent Government, again without having the opportunity to create an election budget.</P>
      <P>I understand, therefore, Deputy Bertie Ahern's remark that an election budget is exceptional; it is extremely exceptional for Fianna Fáil.  It has not had the chance to have an election budget because it holds elections without budgets.  On the last three occasions when Fianna Fáil has been in Government it has run the Government into a wall.  It is no wonder it cannot tell the difference between an election budget and a non election budget.</P>

      <P>Around budget time the Opposition has the opportunity to set out its stall in terms of economic policy and to tell us how it <Col N="1576" /> would handle different parts of the economy and different economic situations.  Deputy Harney gave her views in an interview with the business supplement to <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 January 1996, while Deputy Bertie Ahern provided his views in the same forum a week later.  In addition, they made speeches on budget day and since. These beg the question as to whether the two parties are capable or working together in Opposition, let alone in Government.  It appears they are incapable of working together in Opposition because they face in different ways on several key, important issues in the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Although Deputy Dermot Ahern's outburst a few days ago was disowned by his party leader it was at least honest.  When he said the party wanted to be in the driving seat, regardless of what the other party in Government may think, he indicated that Fianna Fáil had not changed from the time when the party was in coalition Government with the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party.  His leader attempted to recover the situation with emollient words, but it does not wash, because if one looks at the two parties views on key economic issues it is clear there are enormous differences between them.  Indeed, what they say is a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney is renowned for being unable to resist a glib soundbite.  In her interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 January she said:</P>
      <P>I don't think we reward risk-takers or appreciate them in Ireland.  There's an assumption that if you start your own business you're some class of semi-criminal, or that you're a fat cat.</P>
      <P>She went on to say: &ldquo;The State almost does everything it can to stop rather than support Irish business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That sounds fine.  It is a wonderful statement from a platform or the back of a lorry at election time but does she mean it?  If she means it, what type of world view does she hold?  I do not know anybody who set up a business who is classed as a &ldquo;semi-criminal&rdquo;.  However, I know people who set up business who might be described as &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo;, some of whom have been members of Deputy Harney's party.  More power to them if they set up a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That says more about the Minister's mentality than Deputy Harney's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney knows that, but it is a good line to use.  It suits the type of yuppie market which the Progressive Democrats wish to court.  Deputy Harney said the State does almost everything it can to stop rather than support business. However, that was not her tune when she was a Minister of State.  She would have said then, the State was pursuing wise policies to support <Col N="1577" /> business.  Although the Government has reinforced the measures that were in place when Deputy Harney was last in office, she now finds, because she is in Opposition, that it is smart to say the Government does almost everything it can to stop business.  She knows it is not true but she cannot resist the glib and easy soundbite.  If that is policy driven parties, they are not for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a member of a &ldquo;no policy&rdquo; driven party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney said she would like the State to realise £2 billion over the next five years from the sale of assets, including the Trustee Savings Bank, an old reliable target. However, the Deputy should be aware &mdash; if she is not aware it is culpable ignorance &mdash; that there is no sense in which the State owns the TSB.  It belongs to its depositors and has trustees to look after it.  The State does not own it and has no moral right to the proceeds of the sale of the TSB. I wish the Progressive Democrats would realise that point and leave the TSB &mdash; which is a sound financial institution that has found a viable place in the market &mdash; alone and allow it to get on with the job it is doing well.  It should stop its right wing, fashionable, yahoo nonsense of wanting to sell off the TSB.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney is worried about the taxpayer bearing risks.  She mentioned Aer Rianta, another company in which I have more than a passing interest.  She warned us she does not think taxpayers should carry the risk for successful Aer Rianta ventures in running shops in Karachi, St. Petersburg and Bangkok.  However, the taxpayer is the ultimate shareholder in Aer Rianta and is deriving value from it.  Taxpayers are making a capital appreciation from the success of Aer Rianta in running those shops.  There is no sense in which they are being asked to bear a risk there and I wish Deputy Harney and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats would catch on to the realities of business about which they pretend to know and stop making such howlers.</P>
      <P>However, there is a worse example of a lack of understanding in the Progressive Democrats. Deputy Harney made the ringing statement regarding the ESB that the national grid should remain firmly under State control.  However, she should be aware, as Deputy Cowen is aware, that Ireland agreed with its EU partners as part of the business of opening up the semi-State sector to competition &mdash; a move one would think the Progressive Democrats would favour &mdash; to give access to the national grid to companies which want to compete with the ESB in the supply of electricity.  I paid tribute to Deputy Cowen and my predecessor, Deputy Lowry, for their work in bringing our semi-State companies increasingly into a competitive environment.  That needs to be done and the member states agreed to do it at EU level in relation to public utilities.  However, Deputy Harney obviously does not understand that.  She would say anything for a soundbite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1578" /> The Deputy then picked another semi-State target because it suits the Progressive Democrats to pretend that nothing in which the State is involved can work properly.  She stated that the Government's endorsement of strategic alliances in companies such as Telecom Éireann is inherently flawed and has left them vulnerable. She continued that the consortium involved in Telecom Éireann will be able to take it over in a few years.  She said Comsource, the consortium comprising KPN-Telia, got its share at a knock down price and has the first option to take it over completely.</P>
    <P>To use a phrase one of my teachers used, Deputy Harney has dribbled a bib full on this matter.  The strategic partner does not have a right to take over Telecom Éireann.  It has acquired a 20 per cent shareholding and has an option to acquire a further 15 per cent.  It did not acquire this at a knock down price; it paid an initial consideration of just over £180 million for the 20 per cent share.  When that matures and the final reckoning of the value of that shareholding is made, it will be valued at approximately £500 million.  This matter has been dealt with comprehensively and if Deputy Harney does not know the details, I accuse her and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats of culpable ignorance and I conclude from it they cannot be allowed next or near the levers of Government power.  We would be in for a rude awakening if they were making decisions about the semi-State companies on the basis of that type of idiocy.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil thinks of that matter but I doubt Deputy Cowen would find it congenial to work in Government with somebody who so distorts the position.</P>
    <P>In another case involving an important issue of policy, it appears the two parties in Opposition, which are making goo goo eyes at each other and trying to cuddle up to persuade the people that they should be allowed to govern together, are facing totally different directions.  This relates to a single currency and economic and monetary union.  Deputy Harney stated that a final decision on whether Ireland becomes part of economic and monetary union cannot be taken in the absence of a comprehensive analysis of the reper-cussions for the economy of Britain going it alone.  She continued that we must keep an open mind and assess our options much closer to the event.  However, Deputy Ahern sounded much more sensible.</P>

      <P>While recognising the challenges in budgetary and other policies of monetary union, Deputy Ahern has no doubt that Ireland should enter, even if Britain stays out.  He said it must be good to be involved &mdash; he can sing that &mdash; because it will lower transaction costs for business and maintain low interest rates.  On the other hand, remaining outside could deter tourism and inward investment.  He then made a much more perspicacious statement, with which the Progressive Democrats have not caught up, that the potential growth markets of the next ten years will also be economic and monetary union members and Ireland must be a full member of this single market. He also believes that countries which remain outside will not get away with aggressive devaluations against the Euro.  This is sensible on the part of Deputy Ahern but I wonder what type of a dog's dinner will emerge if those two parties ever try to get together to run economic policy?</P>

      <P>I agree.  Deputy McCreevy is a friend of mine and I hope he will continue to be. I was listening to his budget speech while in the RTÉ studio that day.  Deputy O'Rourke was there also and seemed to be having problems listening, which is common enough.  She said at one stage: &ldquo;Is Charlie still talking?&rdquo; The only answer I could give was: &ldquo;Yes he is, but he is not saying anything&rdquo;.  It was not until that moment that I realised how much Deputies McCreevy and O'Rourke have in common.  They can talk for hours without saying anything.  Deputy McCreevy did so on budget day.  He was trying to be like Deputy Noonan but was without the substance. He lacked what Deputy McCreevy himself called the &ldquo;whole nut&rdquo; and was all soft-centred.  I have never heard Deputy McCreevy give a more inconsequential response to any economic policy matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell was different.  He made the extraordinary proposition that instead <Col N="1580" /> of spending some public money in previous years, the Government should have saved it so we could spend it in 1997.  He is objecting to the level of public expenditure.  His only complaint in his budget day response was not about the total level of spending but that the Government had spent it too soon.  The Government should not have spent it in previous years but should have spent it this year.</P>
    <P>I am unsure whether people would thank the Progressive Democrats for saying that from time to time we should stop spending money we know we are going to spend but hold it for a couple of years.</P>

      <P>Never mind what people would suffer in the meantime but release it all in a given year for no reason other than to produce a nicer looking balance that appeals to the kind of business community Deputy Harney and her colleagues think they are after.  These are, she claims, regarded as semi-criminals or fat cats.  It is not a good idea to construct budgetary policy that way.</P>
      <P>Then there is Deputy McDowell's other extraordinary proposal on capital expenditure.  The Deputy was making a case for us not to have capital borrowing this year.  We should not borrow for capital expenditure this year as he thinks it would be a good idea for us to go through penury in capital spending because in a couple of years EU funds might dry up.  That is not a good investment policy.  Stop investing this year, next year and 1999: the EU might not have as much money to give.  It seems total lunacy to pretend to starve ourselves for three years to get ready for being hungry later.  That is not a policy I would recommend and I suspect that it is not the kind of policy that Fianna Fáil would support.  If one tries to put these two prescriptions for the economy together, what will we get out of it?</P>
      <P>We would have an amazing forced self-denial recommended by Deputy Michael McDowell on one hand and Deputy Cowen's approach to expenditure on the other.  He does not mind spending but worries a little about who gets to do the spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's version and he is sticking to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To put those together and expect any kind of coherent economic policy to come out or steady management of budgetary policy would be asking far too much of people who are, as Deputies Cowen and McCreevy said, very sophisticated. They are not going to fall for that.  I can think of nobody, no matter how unsophisticated, who would agree with Deputy Michael McDowell's prescription that we should starve ourselves for three years to practise for being hungry three years later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> There is more one could say about Deputy McDowell's economic policies.  On capital expenditure, he denied he was going to hit in with swingeing cuts in the semi-State sector.  Somebody should tell him it is a long time since the State put huge amounts of capital for current investment into the semi-State sector.  He asks: &ldquo;Does it make sense to borrow money and pour it, by way of capital, into an enterprise which is expected to compete with other enterprise on a level playing field and at the same time to have the Irish Government be the regulator, referee and arbitrator on that level playing pitch?&rdquo; I have news for Deputy McDowell.  That question has been taken up and examined.  It has been negotiated on and conclusions were arrived at some time ago.  Deputy Cowen will bear me out as he had the same portfolio some years ago as I have. He was involved, from the early days, in negotiations on bringing competition into the electricity, gas and public transport industries.  The questions of regulation, arbitration and shareholding have already been addressed.  We passed the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last year that dealt specifically with that question in terms of telecommunications. We will be installing a telecommunications regulator in the course of this year.</P>
    <P>If Deputy McDowell and his Progressive Democrats colleagues feel the need to contribute to economic policymaking, then as a first step they should catch up with what the real world is about.  Then, rather than waving ancient ideological and theoretical constructs they have taken from the more dog-eared textbooks, they would have something real to say about the economy we live in.  Until they do that, they cannot present themselves as being valid critics of economic policy, much less valid pretenders to being in charge of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have confirmation that this is an election budget.  This year many of the difficult problems besetting our society could and should have been tackled.  The Conference of Religious of Ireland has published an analysis of the budget.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something profoundly wrong where resources are growing dramatically yet it refuses to give priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion.  This is exactly what Government has done in its budget for 1997. The massive new resources which are coming onstream have been allocated to those who are already well-off.  Meanwhile, poverty, unemployment and exclusion will persist at their present totally unacceptable levels.  This Government had the resources to impact dramatically on poverty, unemployment and exclusion.  It chose instead to allocate these resources to those who were already well-off. Budget '97 marks the triumph of greed over need.  When the whole budget is evaluated it is clear that most of the resources will continue to go to the better off in Irish society.  This budget <Col N="1582" /> aggravates the widening of the poverty gap between the long-term unemployed and all those with jobs.  The gap in take-home income between an unemployed couple and a couple on £20,000 a year has widened by £530 a year in this budget alone.  Compared to a couple on a salary of £40,000, the gap has widened to £1,072.  This simply continues the trend of budgets in recent years.  Since coming to power, this Government has presided over a widening of the poverty gap by £1,405 a year in the take-home income of a long-term unemployed couple compared to a couple earning a salary of £20,000.  In the case of a couple on £40,000 a year, the gap has widened by £2,737 a year since 1995.</P>
    <P>That gives some indication of the Government's less than caring attitude in regard to high relief.</P>
    <P>In the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>... take the case of a family of parents with two children both over 18 and in full-time third level education, again with one spouse earining say twice the average industrial wage.  Their annual disposable income will have risen by about £2,350 as a result of pay increases and the tax and PRSI changes in my three budgets, even after taking account of the standard rating of certain discretionary reliefs.  This represents an increase of 13.5 per cent or over 6.5 per cent in real terms.  They will also gain by say a further £3,000 per year as a result of the abolition of undergraduate third level education fees.</P>
    <P>That average family to whom the Minister referred will get an increase of about £100 per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that &ldquo;an elderly person will be £7 a week better off from the increases of almost 10 per cent in the old age contributory pension in my three budgets&rdquo;.  Under this budget old age pensioners will get a weekly increase of £7 in their income compared to the beloved middle class who will get an increase of £100 per week.</P>
    <P>Before examining the specific provisions in the 1997 budget, I would like to consider the economic context in which it was presented.  Nobody can be in any doubt that we have a good and growing economy with low inflation, low interest rates and virtually all the economic indicators are sound.  This dramatic improvement in our economy was brought about by sound financial and economic policies developed from the mid-1980s, specifically since 1987.  We all recall that in the mid-1980s, particularly after the abysmal performance of the 1983-87 coalition Government, our national finances were not in good order.  The Government of that era broke up after failing to introduce a budget in 1987.  Sacrifices and difficult choices had to be made, particularly from 1987 to the early 1990s.</P>
    <P>Through discipline and prudent, skilful and courageous management of the national finances <Col N="1583" /> and the economy a dramatic was achieved.  I pay tribute to the social partners for their work in achieving that welcome turnabout. The trade unions, ordinary workers in various organisations, factories and plants throughout the country, the farming community, and particularly their leaders, must be commended for maintaining displine through very difficult times. They took a decision that it was in the best long-term interest of the national economy and our people to maintain discipline.  It is against the background of achieving that level of good health of the economy this budget was drafted.</P>
    <P>On coming into office more than two years ago the Government was presented with a sustained level of industrial growth, a balance of payments surplus in the State's finances and a growing number of multinational companies deciding to set up here because they were impressed by the performance of the economy and the discipline, high output and the level of technological and literate skills of our workers.  A very healthy economic position presented itself to the Government.</P>
    <P>There were also a number of challenges to be faced, notably the high level of unemployment. We have heard a good deal of rhetoric about the level of unemployment, particularly the long-term unemployed and how that problem should be tackled.  With our good economic performance no doubt many people thought the old adage that a rising tide would lift all boats would be brought to bear on the unemployment problem, but sadly that is not the case.  Today, there are more long-term unemployed than there were three years ago.  That is regrettable.  I accept it is a particularly difficult problem, but it must be tackled more vigorously.</P>
    <P>A second major problem in our society is the persistent poverty experienced by many families and the particular needs of various socio-economically deprived groups.  Many reports have dealt with this issue.  One recent report dealt with the level of homelessness in Dublin city and towns, villages and cities throughout the country, particularly the young homeless who are unable to gain access to resources that should be available to them.  When people seek to highlight the problem of homelessnes, they approach a health board, the Department of Social Welfare or the Garda Síochána but find that they are fobbed off from one organisations to another.  Given the state of our economy, surely the problem of homelessness more than any other should be seriously addressed.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the growing level of domestic violence and abuse.  A recent report outlined a harrowing account of the level of domestic violence.  We seem to be anable to tackle that to provide the necessary resources to tackle that problem.  There are also difficulties concerning the travelling community.  I accept this is a difficult problem, but it is not one from which we should shy away.  It must be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> In the immediate aftermath of the coalition's third budget, their performance must be assessed in regard to three key opportunities.  What overall impact has the coalition Government has on our society?  Has it given quality leadership and exerted a major positive influence?  What specific groups have benefited from the Government's policies?  In particular, it is vital to carefully assess the impact of the Government's policies on those most in need.  The include the elderly, the unemployed, lone parents and widows and those suffering from persistent illeness and disability.  We cannot forget that the overall cohesion of communities is heavily dependent on the quality of our social welfare system.  Given the various indicators of growth and expansion in our econnomy, the need for a clear overt signal of support for social welfare recipients has never been as profound.  How has the rainbow coalition responded to the challenge?  In particular, how has the Minister for Finance responded in his three budgets?</P>
    <P>It is important to acknowledge that the 1997 budget includes a number of welcome features. The above inflation increases in certain personal social welfare payments are much needed, while minor but useful changes have been made in areas such as the family income supplement, carer's allowance, eligibility for adult dependant allowance as well as treatment, maternity and adoptive benefits.  The changes proposed to rationalise the qualifying conditions for free electricity allowance and free telephone rental allowance are a stap in the right direction.  It should be the priority of every Government to streamline the administration and operation of each and every scheme.  This applies not just to the Department of Social Welfare but to all other Department and State agancies.</P>
    <P>An old age pensioner living on his or her own is in receipt £64.50 per week.  This is to be increased to £67.50 per week.  Givern the healthy state of the economy, can anybody truthfully say the elderly are being trated fairly?  It is eleven years since the commission on Social Welfare produced its report but its recommendations have yet to be implemented in full.</P>
    <P>Elderly people living on their own are in vulnerable position.  They are, as everybody knows, subject to violent attack and some have been murdered for small amounts of money.  Although a task forde was set up this time last year, the mot we could do on this occasion was provide £2 million for the provision of modern telephone systems to allow the elderly sleep peacefully at night.  This is insufficient given that there are thousands on the waiting list.  We should not adopt a begrudging attitude.  I therefore ask the Ministers for Finance, Justice and Social Welfare to look at this matter again.  The protection and security of the elderly should be given priority in the formulsation of each and every budget.</P>
    <P>The back-to-work allowance scheme is worthwhile in that it facilitates the return of unemployed persons to the active labour force.  The <Col N="1585" /> numbers on the live register must be reduced. There are 836,000 people with over 500,000 dependants in receipt of social welfare payments of one kind or another each week.  The issue of fraudulent claiming must be tackled in the most aggressive but fairest way possible and recipients encouraged to take up worthwhile jobs.  We must aim to reward work.  The education sector has an extremely important role to play in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Education is present in the House as earlier today I received a press release from the National Economic and Social Forum concerning its report entitled Early School Leavers and Youth Unemployment which makes some stark findings.  The press release states:</P>
    <P>Although the number of early school leavers (i.e. those leaving before the end of the junior cycle of second level) has been falling in recent years, the problem is now more critical arising from the process of &ldquo;qualification inflation&rdquo; and a drop in traditional job opportunities for the unskilled.  As a result, the problem of marginalisation and social exclusion for this group is becoming more acute.</P>
    <P>The unemployment rate for those aged between 15 and 24 with no educational qualifications was around 64% in 1995 (almost one in every two.)  This was almost 2.5 times the overall rate of youth unemployment (19.1%).  The long-term unemployment rate for those without qualifications in that age group was around 30% in 1995 (almost one in three, compared to around one in ten for those with qualifications) and is one of the highest in the EU.  Rural areas have the highest level of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Over half of our early school leavers come from families where the father is unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Forum considers that the link between educational disadvantage, poverty, drug abuse, crime and long-term unemployment has been clearly established and that a more comprehensive and integrated strategy on a number of policy fronts is, therefore, necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>The Forum proposes that the Department of Education should set a target to eliminate early school leaving within the next five years.</P>
    <P>To achieve this target the forum makes a number of recommendations in its report.  In response the Government has decided to establish a high level interdepartmental group with representatives from the Departments of Education, Enterprise and Employment and Social Welfare and from FÁS.  The Government should target more resources at the Minister for Education to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>As Opposition spokesperson on social welfare, I have been trying for the past two years to obtain information on the unemployed, their ages, skills, qualifications, background and how concentrated the problem is in certain areas but all the CSO can tell us is how many are male and how many are female.  A detailed and comprehensive profile <Col N="1586" /> of each unemployed person is not available.  The Government should ask the CSO to provide this essential information which would be invaluable in policy-making.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit for two main reasons: it involves an explicit acknowledgement by the State of the importance, integrity and full rights of each person from the beginning of life and the direct payment of such allowances to mothers guarantees at least a certain level of protected income each month, irrespective of other financial and social realities affecting individual families. While I acknowledge the increase in child benefit during the lifetime of this Government is significant, the child benefit scheme is one of the few State programmes which are neutral in terms of targeting poverty.  The stockbroker's family and the unfortunate unemployed trying to avail of the family income supplement both get child benefit.  Therefore, it is totally neutral in terms of targeting poverty and its impact is completely diffused across all socio-economic strata.  While any real improvement in the level of payments represents a welcome gesture of support to mothers and children, its impact on narrowing the gap between the poor and the affluent is nonexistent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the substantial child benefit increases over the lifetime of this Government. However, recently, the butter voucher scheme was halved in a most surreptitious way.  Nobody knew much about it but social welfare offices were sent Department circulars to say that from the start of this year the butter voucher scheme would be reduced from two butter vouchers per month to one, which represents a slashing of 50 per cent.  I know a family of five children and two parents who previously got 14 butter vouchers per month.  This number has now been cut to seven.  The cutting of this scheme, which was most helpful to largers and poorer families, was cruel. There are butter mountains in Ireland, Britain, France and throughout the European Union, farmers are complaining about spilling milk down the drain because they are over their quota and we slash a butter scheme for poorer people.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture who is responsible for policy and the Minister for Social Welfare who is responsible for the implementation to look at this scheme.  It is unacceptable to cut this scheme for larger families in a country with mountains of butter.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, what is a fair assessment of Minister Quinn's budgetary performance over the last three years?  Our evaluation of the Minister and his colleagues since they took up their duties must take three key factors into account.  First, by the end of 1994 the State finances had been retrieved from the disaster of 1983 to 1987 and put on a secure footing.  Furthermore, the economy had been prudently stimulated to record growth levels while interest rates had been reduced substantially.  Second, the domestic challenges facing the Government were explicit and <Col N="1587" /> extremely well defined.  Principally, it was vital to make significant strides in terms of net job creation, with the long-term unemployed being particularly targeted.  An equally major onslaught was required on the level of profound poverty we have in Irish society.  Third, the Government contained personnel who had a long record of rhetoric and verbal commitment to those most in need in our society.  People expected that the poor and deprived would be looked after, especially when some of the most vocal Ministers were in charge of some of the caring Departments. Regrettably this has not happened and any fair assessment of developments could only conclude that this Government has dissipated the massive potential for good at its disposal to an unprecedented degree.</P>
    <P>Instead of the rising tide being used to confer especial benefit on those most in need, the Government has indulted in what is undoubtedly the most profound and prolonged example of incoherent fumbling for a long time.  We have had the bizarre situation over the last few months of one Minister after another falling on their swords. The business of Government clearly became almost an irrelevance in an alarming atmosphere of self-preservation at all costs.  Unfortunately, the unbelievable sequence of self-inflicted disasters, which have become the defining characteristic of the rainbow coalition, has taken its toll.</P>
    <P>As we review the three budgets of Minister Quinn, we see that a unique opportunity to make a profoundly positive impact on Irish society has been almost totally squandered.  The only discrenible rationale behind the various policies of the Government seems to be an ill-fated attempt to regain power at the forthcoming general election. For a Minister of the calibre and track record of Deputy Quinn it is extremely disappointing to note the only coherent strategy which seems to underpin his three budgets from 1995 to date is the maximising of the giveaway nature of this budget.  There were spartan increases in the 1995 and 1996 budgets &mdash; for example, the infamous 2.5 per cent to the elderly &mdash; so this year's budget could be increased.  The full extent of this gross manipulation of the State's finances, particularly in the area of social welfare, is only now apparent. It has been a question of seeking to spread a little good too thinly and not targeting and focusing on the almost intractable problems in society. It will be left to an incoming Fianna Fáil Government to really tackle these problems.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the budget.  It enables me to outline to the House how the financial provision <Col N="1588" /> for education is central to the Government's strategy for the economy and society in 1997 and into the future.</P>
      <P>In a world of global markets, multinational corporations, satellite television and almost instant communication by the Internet and other technologies, it is clear that education is, and will continue to be, the basis for economic prosperity.  It will be no less important for personal fulfilment and social progress.  Knowledge is at the heart of new products and new processes.  The knowledge revolution has surpassed the industrial revolution in its impact on human life and it continues to grow at a phenomenal rate.  As an eminent educationalist, Frank Rhodes of Cornell University, recently said, &ldquo;nations that can work smarter &mdash; not harder &mdash; will be the ones to lead the world into the next century&rdquo;.  That is not too far away.</P>
      <P>The new national agreement, Partnership 2000, is a strategic approach to lead the Irish economy and society into the 21st century.  Education is a vital component of this strategy.  In framing the budget the Government has added £6.5 million to the £22 million already provided in the Abridged Book of Estimates to the allocation for the First Level Capital Building Programme in 1997.  This extra funding, along with the additional £8.5 million made available for primary buildings in 1996 in the Supplementary Estimates voted by this House last December, will make a significant contribution to meeting the capital needs of primary schools.</P>
      <P>This year also sees the introduction of a new grant scheme for minor works to primary school properties.  This initiative is in keeping with the White Paper statement that &ldquo;implementation of smaller projects and building maintenance will be developed to the relevant education board or school as appropriate&rdquo;.  Once schools benefit from the investment in their capital programmes they will be given the wherewithal to maintain the buildings to the proper standard in which our children and our teachers are expected to work.</P>
      <P>The 1997 Estimates also provide for the first full year costs of the Breaking the Cycle initiative which I launched in the autumn of 1996.  This initiative, which is one of the most significant education interventions since the foundation of the State, targets resources to the disadvantaged in both urban and rural areas in a radically new approach.  I hope Deputy Walsh will have the details of this initiative available to him because he has expressed concern about the need to intervene, particularly in rural areas of educational disadvantage.  I have been taken aback by the horror stories of neglect in rural communities which have been systematically excluded from the benefit of education investment over many years, including schools on the western coast which are now qualifying in clusters to benefit from the Breaking the Cycle initiative.  As I move steadily to eliminate substandard buildings it is obvious there has been criminal neglect of whole communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of funding to the Breaking the <Col N="1589" /> Cycle initiative is fully in accord with the strategy contained in Partnership 2000 which highlights the strong link between educational disadvantage and unemployment and social exclusion.  The Partnership 2000 document states that &ldquo;education policy will continue to be oriented in such a way as to give priority in the allocation of resources to those in greatest need&rdquo;.  We are finally getting our priorities right.</P>
    <P>As Minister, I have prioritised policies of intervention from pre-school through to adulthood with a strong focus on preventive strategies which will break the inter-generational cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  Evidence of the success of the policies is already clearly to be seen.  In the past five years, for example, the numbers staying to leaving certificate level have risen from 73 per cent to 82 per cent &mdash; well on target for 90 per cent by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>There has been extensive curriculum reform at second level in recent years.  The success of the transition year, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programmes has been underpinned by increases in funding for them.  The increased investment at second level is concentrating on ensuring that students remain in and benefit from education.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of schools involved in the transition year and the new leaving certificate programmes is encouraging and the take-up rate is a clear indication that schools are putting in place programmes which are responsive to the diversity of students' needs and abilities.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise the importance of in-career development of teachers and programme support and we are calling on them to introduce such major curriculum reform.  In addition to the specific financial provision for in-career development of teachers, there are significant expenditures in programme supports within the second level Vote through the various structures that have been put in place to help and support teachers and schools to implement these programmes.</P>
    <P>I have recently announced the establishment of a steering group to draw up a recommended funding framework designed to ensure equal treatment for the different schools within the second level sector while taking account of the needs of the different schools.  This framework will give effect to the commitment in the White Paper to apply common criteria and entitlements to the funding of schools at second level.</P>
    <P>The increasing support of the involvement of parents as partners in education has also been prioritised during my term as Minister.  This is evidenced in the increased level of support to the National Parents Councils at primary and post primary levels where the annual grant to each body has gone up from £25,000 in 1992 to its present decent level of £90,000.</P>
    <P>Further recognition of the role of parents is given in the Education Bill which gives parents a statutory right to representation on school boards of management and to establish parent associations in schools.  The legislation will give a statutory <Col N="1590" /> underpinning to a new partnership in education, a partnership which reflects the inalienable rights of parents under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficult task being undertaken by school principals.  For this reason one of my objectives has been to improve the in-school management arrangements in schools.  The proposals made to teachers following negotiations on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> involve, among other things, the provision of a substantial number of additional posts of responsibility.  I have no doubt that the implementation of these proposals would greatly assist principal teachers in the running of their schools and ease the burden of their current workload.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the provision for third level education.  The 1997 Estimates provide for gross expenditure on the third level Vote for over £540 million.  This is an increase of £33 million over the 1996 Estimates allocation.  This level of funding will permit continued expansion of student numbers in third level education.  There will be an estimated additional 21,000 students at third level in 1997 compared to 1992.  This explosive growth in numbers has been matched by increased investment.  The gross third level Vote allocation in 1992 was £349 million but in 1997 it will be £540 million; that represents an increase of 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>Capital provision for the sector is particularly important in view of the growth in student numbers. In 1997 the capital provision for third level is in excess of £36.5 million.  This provision will ensure the continuation of the ongoing rolling capital investment programme for the sector.  The programme, which includes in particular the completion of the £120 million European Regional Development Fund programme and the £60 million Exchequer/private sector initiative, is geared towards the construction of new facilities and upgrading of existing infrastructure to facilitate a much needed expansion of the third level system; the development of a supply of highly skilled manpower with a view to meeting the skill needs of existing industry and to attract foreign investment; providing support for indigenous industry by generating the research capacity to introduce and disseminate state of the art technology to upgrade the quality of existing goods and services and to develop new products; strengthening the links between education institutions and researchers and industry in various fields; and improving remedial action to combat social and regional inequalities in participation at third level.</P>
    <P>Among the more important developments which will be catered for under the 1997 provision will be the acquisition of a site for the proposed new regional technical college for Blanchardstown. The first phase of the college when completed will provide places for approximately an additional 1,000 students.</P>
    <P>Another significant component of the 1997 provision is an allocation of £600,000 for the <Col N="1591" /> further development of the Castlebar campus of Galway regional technical college which currently has over 350 full-time students enrolled on a range of national certificate and diploma level courses.</P>
    <P>I am confident that completion of these projects, which embrace most third level institutions, will ensure the continuing relevance of programmes to the needs of the individual in society and the economy as well as bringing about improved economic growth and job creation.</P>
    <P>This budget shows the Government's continuing commitment to education &mdash; a commitment that is clearly shared by the social partners in the Programme 2000 document.  The 1997 Education Estimates show targeted, prudent and productive investment in our people.  The emphasis on quality in the education system, which is evident throughout the White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> and which is contained in the measures proposed in the Education Bill, will ensure that this investment will yield significant returns for the individual citizen and for our society.</P>
    <P>The Government's financial and fiscal policies have led to a declining national debt burden, low inflation, low interest rates and there is a range of tax incentives to encourage employment.  The success of these policies, and in particular our continued success in the environment of European Monetary Union, depends on a highly skilled, flexible and adaptable workforce ready to respond to change throughout their lives.  It depends to a considerable degree on the investment that we as a people make in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>This year is the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Independence. We can fairly claim to have finally come of age.  We can take our place in the world with a sense of pride in our achievements and confidence in our future.  We have created a growing economy and a highly competent workforce; we are in the process of creating a more caring society with greater equality of opportunity.</P>
      <P>This budget is a further, major contribution to economic and social progress.  In many countries economic growth has been achieved at the expense of social progress; we have managed to marry the two, let us keep it that way.  In order to do so and to consolidate and advance the improvements made, the people need to look to the choices they will make about their future.  The choices are clearcut.  Do you want to continue our current economic and social progress or do you want to have the social agenda sacrificed on the altar of perceived economic correctness?  That is the difference between what this Government has to offer and what a PD dominated Government would provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no Labour Party strategy to demonise individual members of the Progressive Democrats although it may well be a PD strategy to try to <Col N="1592" /> divert attention from their damaging policies by suggesting that this is the case.  There is a Labour Party intention, however, to point out to the electorate what voting for a PD Government will mean.  We intend to draw attention to the inconsistencies between the stated objectives and the actual performance in Government.</P>
    <P>In 1992, Deputy Harney announced on RTE that that year's budget had the letters PD written all over it.  It was, she said, a liberation budget for taxpayers.  The Progressive Democrats are distinctly coy on policy details.  Like Salome, they prefer to reveal all little by little.  We can take Deputy Harney at her word, however, that 1992 gives us an indicator of how the Progressive Democrats in a future Government will manage the economy.</P>
    <P>Alas for Deputy Harney, the budget which she hailed as a liberation for taxpayers does not stand up to scrutiny some five years later.  It did nothing for job creation.  Unemployment rose that year with an average of 47 extra people on the dole for every day Deputy O'Malley reigned over industry.  Emigration rose and interest rates for home owners and small businesses reached crippling levels.  Some 25p in every tax pound went to service the debt.  The economy stagnated.  The notorious &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts were introduced in social welfare, and the tax burden as a share of national income was higher than it is now.</P>
    <P>Later that fateful year the Fianna Fáil-PD Government collapsed in ignominy.  They left behind a woeful economic mess.  Today, the PD Deputies prefer to draw a veil over that year and its unhappy memories but voters have the right to remember and to ask if those policies have changed.  The plain fact is they have not.</P>
    <P>Most revealing of all is the PD attitude to the current economic boom.  They have sought repeatedly to deny its existence.  On numerous occasions PD Deputies have spoken of our current economic success as illusory and this word crops up in their speeches again and again.  PD leaders have to be challenged on this point.  Are the construction cranes throughout the country an illusion?  Are the numerous pages of job advertisements in all our national papers week after week illusory?  Over Christmas a leading US computer firm placed a jobs advertisement urging emigrants to come home and take up job opportunities on offer to skilled workers here.  Was this real or an illusion?</P>
    <P>None of this happened while a PD Minister presided over the Department of Employment. Obviously, PD Deputies are in what psychiatrists call a state of denial over the stunning success of our economy under the stewardship of a Labour Minister for Finance.  They simply refuse to believe it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney constantly sneers that the current jobs growth is only in part-time, low paid jobs.  Only last week, however, detailed research for the Labour Force Survey bluntly contradicted this.  The vast bulk of new jobs created in recent years are full time.  The Progressive Democrats <Col N="1593" /> are out of touch with the real economy.  They do not believe what is happening and resort to ideological blinkers to deny the success our country is now enjoying.  Our economy could never be safe in the hands of people who even refuse to believe what is happening all around them.</P>
    <P>Another repeated mantra is that the boom has not lifted all boats.  This is false and exhaustive recent ESRI research disputes this suggestion.  In 1987 about 20 per cent of the population had below half the national average income; by 1994 this had fallen to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course we have a critical problem with longterm unemployment which requires resources and public investment.  We have many excluded communities with desperate drug and crime problems, but in general all communities have shared in our current prosperity.  The huge increase in the numbers at work is the most direct sign of this.  There is increased investment in education at every level along with targeted emphasis on disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Ironically, Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats actually denounced this Labour emphasis on disadvantage in a recent RTE television interview.  Why did Deputy Harney not rush to disassociate herself from these outrageous remarks by Deputy O'Donnell?  We must conclude that her party will cancel the resources devoted to eliminate educational disadvantage if the Progressive Democrats get into office.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell is anxious to reassure us that his party will implement Partnership 2000, but there is no conviction in his statement because his party has always set its face against social partnership.  Not too long ago Deputy Harney offered us the low wage economy of Hong Kong as a realistic model to imitate, saying: &ldquo;They are not rich but they are happy&rdquo;.  Does she still hold to that view even though our own model is as successful as any other and is obviously able to attract international blue chip companies to locate here?  The Progressive Democrats claim to be the party of enterprise but it is this Government which has reduced tax on small businesses from 40 per cent to 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>Consistently, here as elsewhere, attitude surveys highlight employment, education and health care as priorities way above taxation in the minds of voters.  There is a deep consciousness that social investment is a vital ingredient of prosperity. It is a lesson that President Clinton learned and from it he sculpted his famous comeback. His pollsters told him that the current generation is in a &ldquo;we&rdquo; mood as distinct from a &ldquo;me&rdquo; one.</P>
    <P>The 1997 election will be fought on the same theme.  Labour's commitment will be to economic growth and a fair distribution of its fruits.  The Progressive Democrats, true to type, will reject this social emphasis and as voters recognise this the first wrinkles will appear on the smooth face they present to the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney complains of Labour scaremongering. The truth, of course, is that Labour <Col N="1594" /> has been far too timid in facing up to the relentless flow of PD venom for years on end.  It is neither scaremongering nor a personal attack to point out the mess left behind in 1992 by a PD dominated Government.  It is politically reasonable and valid to subject the stated PD policies to scrutiny as to their effects and the likelihood of being implemented in view of their record in office.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Harney is enjoying something of a charmed existence at the moment, that has not exempted her from making some quite spectacular errors of judgment.  For two or three years now she has gone on a magical mystery tour to the four corners of the planet in search of a model economy to imitate.  She started in New Zealand, full of enthusiasm for the measures introduced there.  You will remember the New Zealand model.  This turned sour a few months ago when voters there delivered a sharp rebuff to the Government that brought in her favoured policies. The prime minister survived, but only in a coalition committed to reverse those policies.  So there was no joy there.  She went on to Hong Kong and South Korea, the Asian Tigers.  At her party conference, Deputy Harney said: &ldquo;People there are not rich, but they are happy&rdquo;.  Nowadays she is not so sure.  The television pictures of armed soldiers breaking strikes by Korean workers does not fit the happy image she sketched in her speech.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Harney came closer to home for her model but, as before, she got it spectacularly wrong.  In the Dáil last Thursday, she heaped mountains of praise on Tony Blair. New Labour in the UK is her latest fashion, all the more if this allows her to sketch Irish Labour as the old Labour model.  The trouble is that Tony Blair and his colleagues and advisers have spent much time looking at Irish Labour's experience in Government for the past four years, and they regularly indicate how much they want to repeat our mixture of sustained growth, low inflation, social partnership and record job creation.  I am sure Gordon Brown would give his eye teeth to be able to repeat for British voters the achievements of our Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil Deputy Harney went to great pains to praise Tony Blair's efforts to reshape the welfare state.  She spoke in awe of a speech Mr. Blair was to make in Amsterdam on Friday that would face up to the vexed issue of lone parents.  Since then Tony Blair has made this speech.  Alas, there is not much joy in it for Deputy Harney because the policies he set out, radical indeed, are very similar to those we in Ireland introduced, initially when I was in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Like Tony Blair we took our cue from a valuable Australian project called JET &mdash; Jobs, Education, Training.  This policy is to break the dependence of lone parents on welfare by specific incentives to seek work with state support for child care.  New Labour in the UK is following us, <Col N="1595" /> but Deputy Harney is deliberately blind to the reforms we have already introduced.</P>
    <P>I resent her crude allegation that Labour wants to keep people in a mindless state of public dependency.  It is a cheap slogan and it is a lie which does her no honour.  Nothing creates dependency so much as unemployment.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn got 100,000 more people into the workforce in his two years in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>We are implementing policies that ease the transition from welfare to work by allowing the retention for a period of certain medical card and other benefits and by major reductions in payroll taxes.  The back to work allowance scheme has been a fantastic success.  Small businesses are enjoying incentives and tax breaks from a Labour Minister such as they never experienced before. Research published last week shows that the bulk of the new jobs of recent years have been full time and emigrants, exiled by the failures of the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, are returning home.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate how galling it is for Deputy Harney to recognise Labour's successes.  Our Finance Minister has managed to reduce the national debt, reduce interest payments from 27 pence in the tax pound to 16 pence, meet the Maastricht guidelines and, to cap it all, pioneer a Europewide stability pact to copperfasten fiscal prudence for years to come.</P>
    <P>The PD tax and spend mantra is hollow.  Labour has lived comfortably with the international guidelines, more so than many governments of the same political colour as Deputy Harney.  We can live with the stability pact and we can accept a defined public spending target as a share of GNP on a par with international practice.</P>
    <P>Our policy aims can be met inside those targets. It is the share-out of national wealth that brings us into conflict with Deputy Harney and her party.  In America they talk of the &ldquo;we&rdquo; generation that has supplanted the &ldquo;me&rdquo; generation. That is the difference between Labour and the Progressive Democrats, and it will never change.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to my own area of responsibility, I am heartened to hear that Fianna Fáil has responded to my call last year for an all-party consensus on increasing Overseas Development Assistance.  It must be remembered, however, that in their one opportunity in the past four years to draw up the Book of Estimates on their own, Fianna Fáil spectacularly failed to have regard to this policy.  However, I welcome the statement by Deputy Ahern yesterday.</P>
    <P>I now ask what the PD policy on ODA is &mdash; are they going to support and implement the objective of increasing ODA each year, as set out by Deputy Ahern yesterday?  I will be delighted if they do, but I remain sceptical.  I greatly fear that in their enthusiasm for cutting back on expenditure they will target the most needy of all.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cullen, the Fianna Fáil spokesman is here, let me query an item about which I have <Col N="1596" /> been puzzled for the past week but about which I have not had an opportunity to ask Deputy O'Rourke.  On the &ldquo;Vincent Brown Show&rdquo; on the eve of the budget, Deputy O'Rourke argued cogently against reductions in taxes and particularly against reductions in the rates of income tax.  The subsequent comments by Deputy McCreevy and others on the Fianna Fáil side gave me a sense of a party which was calling for more tax cuts.  I am still confused as to whether it was the late hour of the evening or the charm of Vincent Brown, but I certainly heard Deputy O'Rourke arguing vehemently against further tax cuts.  Perhaps Deputy Cullen can enlighten me on this broadening of Fianna Fáil policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I bring my own philosophy to bear when I speak.  I would like to correct something which has been trotted out at national and local level over recent weeks by Labour Ministers and backbenchers, that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, achieved something that nobody else achieved by reducing the national debt.  He did no such thing.  Since the Minister came into office the national debt has risen.  What happened in the last few months of 1996 was through a glitch in the rising figure of the national debt under the Minister &mdash; £100 million came back off the total debt.  The reality is that since Deputy Quinn took office the national debt has gone up substantially, and I wish the Labour Party and its various Ministers, backbenchers and spokespersons would stop announcing to all and sundry that the national debt has come down under the present Government because it has not.</P>
      <P>The budget delivered last Wednesday by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is not the budget he would have delivered if he had been given an unfettered hand to do what he knew was essential for the continued growth of the economy.  The direct interference by his party leader and Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, in the concluding stages of the Partnership 2000 programme seriously undermined the authority of the Minister for Finance both within the Government and with the social partners.</P>
      <P>The interference by the Tánaiste was regrettable and unnecessary but demonstrates once again how the dead hand of the Tánaiste seems to take centre stage when trouble arises within coalition Governments.  However, on this occasion the Tánaiste chose as his target his own Deputy Leader and Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  In this the Tánaiste is consistent in that he always puts his own personal agenda above that of party or good government.  What the Tánaiste wants the Tánaiste gets is Deputy Spring's simple maxim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, time is running out for him.  He must face the electorate in 1997 whether he likes it or not, and the sooner this election takes place the better, not alone for the people but for the economy. <Col N="1597" /> The Tánaiste cannot be trusted now by his Deputy Leader and Minister for Finance.  I wonder how strong the bonds are now to Fine Gael, and if the Taoiseach would not agree that a general election is very much in the national interest, to quote that much abused cliché.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the 1997 budget, it seems extraordinary that a Minister for Finance who is supposedly giving away £650 millions could fail so miserably to achieve a positive response right across the nation.  In truth, the budget has created no more excitement than the ripples created by a pebble thrown into an ocean.  After three budgets that have seen an explosion in public expenditure at a time of unprecedented economic growth, the Minister's contribution to taxpayers has been a paltry one penny.  He rightly receives no applause for reducing the base rate of tax by 1 per cent with no adjustment in the higher 48 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>It is almost painful to think what other countries would have achieved with the levels of economic growth that are now taken for granted in Ireland.  Countries which have nothing approaching Ireland's economic growth rates are thinking in terms of tax rates of which we can seemingly only dream.  When we further position the Minister's opportunities against the difficulties of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which still saw real dedication by Fianna Fáil led Governments to lowering tax rates, his performance almost beggars belief.</P>
    <P>It is a simple truth that you cannot have high spending and low taxes &mdash; the two are incompatible. If one thing has been the hallmark of the Labour Party's involvement in Government in the 1970s, the 1980s and now the 1990s, it has been their failure to recognise the need for lower taxes combined with tightly controlled public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Countries throughout the world have come to recognise that there is a relationship between creating incentives for work and enterprise culture and lowering tax rates.  Nobody likes to pay tax and everybody can accept a reasonable level of tax taken from their gross income.  Ireland still has a strong black economy which solely exists on the premise that tax rates which are penal are not worth paying and, therefore, it is better to risk deceiving the system than be caught in one that demands more than its fair share.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister for Finance understands this but he was unable to win the argument at Government level.  I have no doubt that Minister Quinn's stewardship of office will be remembered as the years of lost opportunity, when so much could have been achieved for taxpayers but was squandered by a desire to increase public expenditure to levels which we will simply not be able to afford in the future.</P>
    <P>The reduction in Structural Funds after 1999 and the inevitable downturn in the economic cycle will see public expenditure levels which we will not be able to sustain.  In my view the Minister should have reduced the lower and upper rates of tax by 2 pence in each case or at least <Col N="1598" /> gone for reducing the lower rate of tax by 2 per cent and widening the tax band substantially. Unfortunately, the Minister took neither of these options.  Giving a paltry one penny back to taxpayers after three years of budgeting with no reductions in tax is an inexcusable failure.</P>
    <P>I have made the point over a number of weeks that if the Minister in his previous two budgets had kept the practice of reducing the lower rate of tax by at least 1 per cent in each year, he would have been comfortably in a position this year to have reached a tax base of 22 or 23 per cent.  That would have been considered as real progress by all who live and work in this country.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, no effort to achieve these levels was made by the Government and, as we head towards the end of the decade and a run down of support under the Structural and Cohesion Funds, the opportunities for such reductions continue to diminish.  Surely the basis of an enterprise culture is rooted in lower taxes which are an incentive to productivity, increase net earnings and also encourage those who are in the black economy to legitimise themselves by paying what they would consider to be reasonable rates of tax on income earned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's budgetary figures for 1997 show that from income tax alone the Minister will take in an extra £364 millions.  As we already know, that is roughly an increase of £1 million per day from the PAYE sector.  If the Minister was seriously interested in tackling the tax wedge, he surely could have used much of this money to target the lower paid.  This could have made a considerable contribution to making work at lower wage rates much more attractive than depending on the State to survive.  It would also have given a real incentive to take up employment because people could have seen a real opportunity of improving their living standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance made much in his budget speech of the current budget surplus of £193 million.  He presented this as if he was the first Irish politician to have found the Holy Grail. The Minister appears to have a very short memory. When he inherited the Department of Finance from my party leader and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, he was handed the first current budget surplus in 25 years.  Of course he quickly ignored this fact and proceeded to produce two further budgets which contained current budget deficits.  I give no credit to the Minister for achieving a current budget surplus in his 1997 budget when the reality is he should have had a current budget surplus in his previous two budgets or at a minimum a neutral current situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made little of the fact that he would have an Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1997 of some £637 million.  This is an absurdly high figure which leaves him very little room to manoeuvre if any unexpected problems arise within the economy.  If the Minister had achieved his spending targets in his previous two budgets, he would be bringing in a very small Exchequer <Col N="1599" /> borrowing requirement or no Exchequer borrowing requirement at all.</P>
    <P>To make matters worse the Minister is also indicating significant Exchequer borrowing over the next two years, bringing his total for 1997-99 to somewhere in the region of £2.2 billion.  This is financial lunacy which takes no account of the changing financial circumstances in which we will find ourselves post-1999.  I support the view gaining wide-ranging support that we should collectively cap borrowing at the level of £30 billion. There is no reason in a buoyant economy, with the levels of economic growth and revenue increases which this country is achieving and is likely to achieve for the next couple of years, to borrow another £2.2 billion.  One can have some excuse for borrowing money when the economy needs to be primed.  There are various difficulties which require borrowing to the levels which the Minister is proposing over the next three years.  I cannot understand the logic of continuing to receive <i>largesse</i> from the PAYE sector and all taxpayers and at the same time having a requirement to borrow millions.  We should be focusing now on stabilising the national debt and ensuring it does not rise further, but the choices that brings for the Government are not palatable to the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  The tragedy is that Fine Gael has abdicated all responsibilities with regard to fiscal policy.  Some of Minister Yates's speeches as Opposition spokesperson on Finance make interesting reading and the policies which he claimed so vehemently would be brought to Government by the Fine Gael Party have been abandoned.</P>
    <P>None of the spending targets which the Government set since it took office has been achieved.  Indeed, all have been handsomely exceeded.  Taking account of targets the Minister set over the last couple of years which have been grossly exceeded with great aplomb and little concern by the Government, it is likely that current year borrowing requirements may well be exceeded again.</P>
    <P>It was very interesting to note the response to the budget of the main players in the social partnership, in particular the muted response from IBEC which only offered token concern about the level of public expenditure.  This was very much out of kilter with the rather trenchant and correct views they have consistently expressed over many years about the levels of public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Of course, the agreement in Partnership 2000 seems to override most of those concerns.  As we approach the end of the millennium it is fair to ask who controls public expenditure.  Is it the elected Government of the day or the social partners, aided and abetted by some high level civil servants?  There is no question that the social partners have, with the Government of the day, played a central role since 1987 in turning around the fortunes of this country.  However, the fiscal policy must rest with the Government and any <Col N="1600" /> abdication of that responsibility will eventually lead to a policy which will be in disarray.  I do not believe a hands on political role was played which was central to the <i>Partnership 2000</i> agreement.  It seemed to me as if all involved were told by the politicians in Government to put an agreement together and whatever that agreement was, so long as they all signed up for it, the Government would endorse it.  Clearly this is not the way to design, formulate and implement fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>The success or failure of any programme may involve many parties and when successful all will share in that success.  When it fails there will be only the Government of the day to blame.  No Government can concede its right to set down the nation's fiscal policy.  We are dangerously close to getting the balance between the parties to social partnership and the Government wrong.</P>
    <P>Lest I be misquoted, I am not against the idea of social partnership which can lay down the national strategy for a number of years.  As I have already acknowledged, much of our economic growth and new found prosperity is due to such programmes which have been put together since 1987.  However, when they are successful there is a tendency to become blasé about the content of such programmes.  The danger is that agreement becomes more important than the substance of the document.  This does not make for good Government.</P>
    <P>For many years I have been a proponent of major changes in our corporation tax law.  I was one of the first to congratulate the Minister when he began to make changes in this area.  However, this year the Minister has got the balance wrong. He is more aware than anybody that the bulk of the jobs in the services sector are being created by small and medium enterprises, and while his initial rate of 30 per cent corporation tax was welcome combined with a threshold of £50,000, he was wrong in the way he made the changes for 1997.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have targeted the lower rate and should have reduced the 30 per cent to 27 per cent at least and doubled the income band from £50,000 to £100,000.  This would have had a more significant benefit within the economy and particularly for employment than the approach the Minister has taken.  In general the budget gave scant reward to this huge sector of our economy. The small and medium enterprises are very much part of the engine room which has been driving economic growth over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>One would have to look very hard at the Minister's speech to identify any consistent theme which recognises that fact.  For the future, small and medium enterprises will be the sector we will look to most for growing employment, therefore, I would have expected a greater influence on the Minister's fiscal strategy aimed at this sector. Instead he seems to have largely ignored it.</P>
    <P>The approach taken by the Minister for Social Welfare to those who are most at risk and socially disadvantaged in society has not been the targeted <Col N="1601" /> one that is so vitally necessary.  It is particularly nauseating to look at the plight of those on old age pensions &mdash; people who have made a substantial contribution to society, who have raised their families, worked most of their lives and are now trying to survive on a minimal State pension.  Surely there has been an opportunity in the past two years to significantly boost the lot of those receiving old age pensions.  The Minister's contribution over three budgets to such people does not amount to the price of a bag of coal.  So much for the substance behind the image of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>To suggest that those in receipt of social welfare, in all its different forms, should be treated the same is to seriously misunderstand what the welfare system is about and what it is trying to achieve.  Clearly there are sectors within the social welfare system that are far more disadvantaged than others.  These sectors should have got the attention they required.  What we got from the Minister for Social Welfare was a spread across the whole system without any real thought given to the advantages that can be achieved by targeting aspects of the welfare system with a view to encouraging people to make a contribution to society.</P>
    <P>When we consider our social welfare system and those in it who are capable of and eligible for work or who are working in the black economy and drawing from the system and those who are trapped within the system who have no incentive to take up a low paid job, we will see that something radical is needed.  On many occasions I have stated the time was well past when the integration of our social welfare and revenue systems was long overdue.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy, who served as Minister for Social Welfare, has often spoken about this and has emphasised that, with modern technology, we have the capacity to integrate both systems, yet no such move seems to be afoot.  Indeed the way in which we ring fence many issues in Departments, such as separating social welfare, employment and tax into individual boxes, is almost unworkable in a modern economy.  The systems in place mitigate against those who at times would want to move freely between employment, part-time employment, receive some support from the State and then return to employment, yet the ivory towers of power that exist within each department are such that they want to protect what they see as their own patch rather than develop a modern system which may result in some of the power blocks being removed.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative, launched with such fanfare by the Government over 18 months ago, has almost died in a watery grave.  If memory serves me correctly, the Minister's speech on introducing the debate in the Dáil is still not completed.  We can no longer afford this type of approach in a fast changing world. Change is an ongoing process, it must be managed but it never stops.  We should not have to reach a point again where we realise that systems <Col N="1602" /> are outdated, outmoded and unworkable.  That was the curse of Ireland in past decades and modern Ireland should continually manage change and ensure we are at the cutting edge of technology in all we do and achieve.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that at last we seem to be getting some level of debate with regard to economic and monetary union and the advent of the euro.  I have long been a supporter of monetary union and from all I have read and heard recently nothing substantive <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland's position has arisen which makes me change my mind.</P>
    <P>I believe we will meet the Maastricht criteria, albeit just barely as the Government has pushed our room to manoeuvre to the upper limits of what is required.  The only serious outstanding argument against Ireland's entry is whether the United Kingdom will enter in the first round.  It is most unfortunate that much of the political debate in the UK has been of a rather nationalistic nature and there has been no serious debate about the real effects of monetary union within the UK.  Indeed, debate across the water seems to centre on monetary union not occurring at all.</P>
    <P>It has, however, become much more difficult politically to deliver monetary union from either the Tory's or the Labour Party's point of view. Because of this it is probably likely that the UK will not be members in the first round of monetary union.  Clearly this poses difficulties for Ireland because of the size of our trade with the UK and the fact that a substantial portion of that trade comes from high employment sectors within the agriculture and food areas.  Nevertheless it would be dangerous and foolish to become exclusively entangled in this one issue debate in an Irish context to the exclusion of all other possibilities and our prospects within monetary union.</P>
    <P>I have noted recently that certain economists attached to our main banks are beginning to change their line and have become more sceptical about monetary union.  Clearly a large portion of the bank's income will be lost when monetary union is achieved.  This is a singular, vested interest point of view which puts their own narrow banking interests very much ahead of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I would find it almost amusing if it were not so serious when I hear people say we could survive outside economic and monetary union and float as a currency akin to sterling.  This is absolute rubbish and nonsense.  If the Irish pound was to remain outside a new Euro system it would be subject to attack from whoever would like to make a quick killing.  Even when Ireland was part of the old ERM our partners were unable to protect us when the Irish pound came under severe attack and eventually had to be devalued.</P>
    <P>Can one imagine a situation where, although we qualified for monetary union, we decided not to move with our partners in Europe and remained outside just because sterling was not <Col N="1603" /> going to be party to the new system for reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Before I call Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn to move her motion I wish to remind Members that while the Chair is cognisant that the motion calls on the Minister for Health to amend the terms of reference of the current tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C controversy, under the rules and Standing Orders of the House &ldquo;a matter shall not be raised in such an overt manner so that it appears to be an attempt by the Dáil to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal&rdquo;.

      <P>To use the elegant words of his adviser, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was not &ldquo;absolutely shafted&rdquo; by a senior civil servant at the tribunal of inquiry on Monday.  For the women, men and children infected by the State with poisoned plasma, for the haemophiliacs left out of this procedure and for me that brief reported conversation sums up all that has been wrong in the approach to the blood tragedy. The approach has been &ldquo;forget the victims, focus on ourselves, the impact on the Minister, the impact on the Department and on senior civil servants shafting or not shafting Ministers&rdquo;.  It is not an issue of &ldquo;senior civil servant absolutely shafts Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have seen in recent months is selfpreservation within the system, the Blood Transfusion Service Board protecting itself by rationing <Col N="1604" /> the information it fed to the Department, the Department protecting itself by setting up investigation processes that it knew were doomed to fail and Ministers shamefully protecting themselves by the use of that most contemptible of political devices, the claim that &ldquo;your lot did the same when you were in power&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Systems of justice, finance and health should serve people and not the other way round. However, the Government has elevated systems beyond the people they were created to serve. The Government is based on pious platitudes and impersonal concepts, never on concern for people.  From the word go we have had to listen to lectures on openness, accountability and transparency and hear those words become gradually dissociated from any meaning, reality or humanity.  Instead of approaching the blood tragedy through its famous pane of glass, the Government fled from accountability and rejected transparency, even if it had to denigrate the dying and attack the advisers of the sick to do it.  The Government lost sight of the victims, the women, men and children whose blood the State had poisoned.  It lost sight of present pain and the dark dread of the future that an infection like this brings with it.</P>
    <P>This is the 25th occasion on which the hepatitis C scandal has been raised by me in the House. On each previous occasion I hoped this was the last time the Minister for Health would have to be harassed and hounded into granting the victims their reasonable request.  While this will be my last time leading the debate on the issue, I do not doubt but that there will have to be further debates.  I say this because all the other debates have shown that the Minister for Health and the Government have a blind spot in relation to this scandal.  They have failed, and continue to fail, to recognise the State's responsibility in the matter and to appreciate the frustration and anger of victims. This has meant that every right for the victims has only been won after a long and tortuous battle.  I fear the same battle lies ahead in relation to the issue we are debating tonight.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment will not address the difficulties and is yet another fudge in this State-based horror story of hepatitis C.  Our proposal to widen the terms of reference of the current tribunal to investigate haemophiliacs' issues in relation to hepatitis C is the best way to proceed. The difficulties with the amendment relate in particular to paragraphs (iii) (b) and (iv).  I welcome the Minister's decision to investigate the HIV episode which was highlighted late last year and involved people being at risk of contracting HIV from contaminated blood products.  That episode once again emphasised that the Blood Transfusion Service Board has a long way to go before it is transformed into a model of public accountability.  An inquiry into this episode has been promised for some time.</P>
    <P>There is an important point I wish to make in relation to this episode, that is one specific case of HIV contamination is currently being prepared <Col N="1605" /> for the courts.  As the Minister knows, there is a time constraint in this case, which involves the South Eastern Health Board, similar to that which obtained in the Mrs. McCole case.  There will be requests for Department files, for files from the Blood Transfusion Service Board and for the pre-screening services and conditions and procedures available in the Blood Transfusion Service Board pre-1985.  I ask the Department and the Blood Transfusion Service Board to respond for once in a caring and compassionate way to that very specific case where time is against the individual involved.  It may be possible to deal with the case by way of a non-public hearing or in another way by Mr. Finlay.  I ask the Minister to please let this case take priority over all the others because of the time constraints involved.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (iii)(b) and (v) of the amendment are unsatisfactory.  If the interim report of the tribunal is anything to go by, the final report will make no reference to the difficulties the haemophiliacs are encountering in relation to hepatitis C.  As the terms of reference of the tribunal stand, the haemophiliacs' issues are unlikely to be highlighted. They are not being investigated by the tribunal.  What will change between now and the publication of the final report?  The haemophiliacs sent huge amounts of correspondence to the tribunal about their problems before the interim report was published.  However, this did not even merit a line in the report and until the Irish Haemophilia Society withdrew from the tribunal the matter had not come to public attention.</P>
    <P>On this basis paragraph (iii) (b) of the amendment is not sufficient and is only kicking to touch. For the past two months the haemophiliacs have sought a simple addition to the terms of reference, this is that the tribunal investigates the circumstances in which its members became infected with hepatitis C.  The Government amendment will not achieve what is required.  The only way of ensuring the matter is correctly addressed is to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal in the way proposed in our motion.  This must be done sooner rather than later as time is not on the side of haemophiliacs.  These people are getting sicker and they need answers now.  The proposal in the amendment is a huge mistake and is a tactic designed to long finger the issue.  No doubt the Minister will accuse us of all sorts of things, apart from trying to achieve what is in the best interests of haemophiliacs.  During the previous debates on hepatitis C the Minister accused the Opposition of playing politics and of overstating the seriousness of the situation.  If I or the victims ever needed vindication for the statements we made we have it in the revelations before the tribunal.  Our worst nightmare of a deep rooted cover-up has been realised.</P>
    <P>This motion is as important as any of the other debates that have taken place.  In some ways it is more important because it highlights the needs of a group which has been in the shadows up to now. <Col N="1606" /> Many people think the hepatitis C scandal is only about women who received the anti-D product and the consequences of this for their families.  It is about this very large and important group who are very well organised and have received extraordinary leadership from their chairwoman, Jane O'Brien, and the Positive Action executive committee. It also received much media coverage &mdash; with up to 700 members it had sufficient people to go public and tell their harrowing tales.  Many believe that men and children only come into the scandal through their connection with the anti-D women.  They do, but men, women and children, such as haemophiliacs, transfusion victims and kidney patients, have been infected other than through anti-D.  Their story is less well known because, understandably, many of them want to protect their anonymity.  As fewer numbers are involved there are fewer volunteers to go public and, as the media prefer the personalised story, their spokespeople have not been reported to the same extent as those of victims.  Merely because they have not been as vocal as other victims does not mean they are not as devastated.  Their lives have also been shattered by the negligence of a State body.</P>
    <P>This motion is about haemophiliacs, the group that has been most in the shadows.  Two weeks ago it took the dramatic step of withdrawing from the hepatitis C tribunal.  Fianna Fáil regards this as a matter of great concern.  The Irish Haemophilia Society took this step only as a last resort and after making every attempt possible to have its concerns heard at the tribunal.  The society does not believe the tribunal, under its current terms of reference, will deal with its issues of concern. It also does not believe the amendment proposed by the Minister will achieve what is required for its members who have been infected with hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The issues of concern to haemophiliacs are real.  Haemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder where one of the blood's clotting factors is missing or present at a much reduced level.  Treatment is administered via injections of the missing clotting factor when bleeding occurs.  Like anti-D, the treatment used is made from pooled human plasma.  The method of treatment has led to the contamination of the haemophilia population with hepatitis C; half of the 450 haemophiliacs have been infected with the disease.  According to the Irish Haemophilia Society four of its members have already died directly from hepatitis C while 66 have died from combined HIVhepatitis C infection.</P>
    <P>The prognosis for people with haemophilia infected with hepatitis C is significantly worse than for individuals infected with hepatitis C without haemophilia.  Haemophiliacs have had multiple exposures to the virus due to frequent injection with pooled plasma products.  Multiple exposure results in infection with several types of hepatitis C.  Many hepatitis C haemophiliacs are also infected with hepatitis B and-or hepatitis A. Those viral infections, when present with hepatitis <Col N="1607" /> C increase damage to the liver.  Many are also infected with HIV which accelerates the development of serious liver disease.</P>
    <P>It is obvious haemophiliacs need to ask distinct questions, the answers to which were known before the tribunal began.  How did all blood products manufactured by the BTSB, including anti-D, factor 8 and albumin, become infected with hepatitis C?  How did children born in the last six or seven years become infected with hepatitis C when administered BTSB supplied factor concentrated blood product?  Viral inactivation procedures should have been implemented in the past seven years.  There have been continuing problems at the BTSB not only in relation to anti-D but in relation to products used by other groups.  Why did the BTSB commercially obtain concentrates from the plasma of paid overseas donors in 1982?  Why was a self-sufficiency policy in respect of blood plasma for the fractionation of factor concentrates not developed at that time? That might have prevented infection of blood products.  Why was there improper viral inactivation by the BTSB of factor 8 concentrates which the board had started to manufacture in 1986 from Irish derived plasma as part of a policy of self-sufficiency?  The need for the BTSB to investigate all aspects of donor selection was identified.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society needed to get information as much as any other victim.  Alarm bells about the BTSB began to ring even louder in the society in October 1996 when a product alert was raised.  Details of that alert, which had not been widely publicised, related to a batch of factor concentrates which was recalled at a very late stage because of fears that it was not adequately virally inactivated.  The batch had been sent out to haemophiliacs when a concern was raised that a blood donor, whose plasma was used in the manufacture of the product, had subsequently tested positive for hepatitis C. A product controller in St. James's Hospital in Dublin sought to contact haemophiliacs directly at their homes rather than going through the Irish Haemophilia Society, the central administrative organisation for haemophiliacs.  The first the society learned of the alert was when panic telephone calls were made to it.  It has since emerged that the product was adequately virally inactivated. Obviously, the BTSB must have contacted St. James's Hospital to warn of a potential problem. While this was the correct thing to do, the concern in this episode is that there was no procedure in place for dealing with the alert two years after the new management had been put in place at the BTSB.  It certainly signalled that the process of transforming the BTSB and improving its communications structures has a long way to go.</P>
    <P>Because haemophiliacs continue to depend on the blood supply, they have a real interest in the tribunal.  However, neither the Minister nor his Department consulted the Irish Haemophilia <Col N="1608" /> Society before the terms of reference were published or even before tonight's amendment was put down.</P>
    <P>At the time the terms of reference were about to be published last year, I was alerted to the concerns of groups representing victims and the failure to consult them.  When the Minister for Health provided a briefing before the publication of the terms of reference for me and for the progressive Democrats spokesperson on health, Deputy O'Donnell, in mid-October 1996, we specifically asked if all the vicitims of the hepatitis C scandal would have an opportunity to raise their issues at the tribunal as it was to be constituted. The Minister for Health informed me it was his intention that all victims would get the same treatment and would have an opportunity to raise their concerns.  This comment echoed what the Minister for Health said on the Six One News on 8 October last.  In regard to the inquiry, the Minister stated, &ldquo;The focus will be narrow.  It will be to inquire into all the circumstances of the infection since 1976 both of blood products and blood and how so many persons, men and women, got infected&rdquo;.  The Irish Haemophilia Society and other groups were also assured by the Department of Health that the circumstance of infection of their members with hepatitis C would be a matter for direct consideration by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The assurances given to me by the Minister and by the Department to the groups resulted in Fianna Fáil co-operating with the passage of the terms of the tribunal.  While I remained unhappy with many aspects of the terms of reference and had put down amendments in that regard in the Dáil, I was assured by the Minister these difficulties would not present a problem.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society then entered the tribunal in good faith.  It had made reasonable submissions asking for representation on a limited number of issues.  These were rejected by the chairman of the tribunal.  The only group of victims granted representation were those relating to anti-D and this concentration by the tribunal on just one blood product which was manufactured by the BTSB has continued.  This is why there are few grounds to believe the final report of the tribunal will make any difference to haemophiliacs as the circumstances of their infection are not being directly investigated.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society and other groups sought a judicial review in the High Court over representation.  In granting leave to seek a judicial review, Mr. Justice Shanley noted that the terms of reference had been narrowly construed by the tribunal.  The matter was later settled on the basis of limited representation being granted to the Irish Haemophilia Society on 27 November.</P>
    <P>The terms of that settlement achieved by Mr. Justice Finlay are interesting.  Legal representation was granted at the opening of the oral hearings of the tribunal.  During the course of the tribunal's deliberations a transcript of the evituted <Col N="1609" /> dence was to be laid before the tribunal on a daily basis, proofs of the prospective evidence were to be given and sight of or copies of such documentation as was necessary were to be provided to inform the said parties of the tribunal's deliberations. The right to apply to the tribunal to be permitted to cross-examine any witness was granted, as was such representation as was necessary for the purposes of advising in the course of the tribunal's deliberations.  Also granted were the right to attend and be represented at the tribunal when any of the parties' witnesses were before the tribunal and to make a closing statement.</P>
    <P>These terms were accepted by the Irish Haemophilia Society.  Two days later, on 29 November, the society's solicitors wrote to the tribunal asking how it proposed to deal with the issues of concern.  Concerns were also raised about the attitude the tribunal was taking to documentation made available by the BTSB.  It soon became clear that the tribunal would not deal with the issues as raised by the Irish Haemophilia Society.</P>
    <P>On 18 December, the society wrote to the Minister for help, outlining its concerns.  It told him it had been endeavouring to work within the terms of reference but that there was a catalogue of problems.  It asked him to amend the terms of reference to specifically include the issues relating to people with haemophilia and their circumstances of infection with hepatitis C.  That remains its and our position.</P>
    <P>The last straw for the haemophiliacs appears to have been a letter from the tribunal on 10 January. The solictor to the tribunal said that the tribunal was &ldquo;solely concerned&rdquo; with the licensing arrangements for anti-D and that the blood products manufactured by the BTSB and used by haemophiliacs were not relevant to the terms of reference. In particular, the letter stated that donor screening for one of these products, which is a huge issue for the haemophiliacs, was not considered to be relevant.  The Irish Haemophilia Society withdrew from the tribunal on 15 January and Fianna Fáil has since taken up its concerns.</P>
    <P>This saga raises many issues.  Is Mr. Justice Finlay construing too narrowly the terms of reference of the tribunal?  Did the Minister for Health mislead Members of this House and the public when he said that all victims would be able to raise their concerns?  Was the Minister misled by his Department or the Attorney General about the terms of reference and what they meant?  One of these scenarious must be the case because no other conclusion can be drawn.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is extremely concerned about this issue.  Haemophiliacs comprise one of the most vulnerable groups in society and they already feel they are the miner's canary, so to speak, in the field of infection and the use of blood products. Their dependence on the blood supply puts them in the front line of every crisis.  They are the most frequent users of blood products and are those most reliant on them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> In the interests of fairness and equity, Irish haemophiliacs deserve to have their questions in relation to hepatitis C answered at this tribunal. The BTSB manufactured more products than anti-D but, as the tribunal stands, it neglects and omits to acknowledge that there were other difficulties pertaining to the BTSB.  No one product should be preferred over another.</P>
    <P>We believe it has been a gross mistake for the Minister for Health to have ignored the exclusion of haemophiliacs for so long.  How can he admit now that the terms of the inquiry were inadequate when to date he has claimed they were adequate?  In some ways this tribunal is more necessary for haemophiliacs than for others. Much of what has emerged at the tribunal in relation to anti-D would have come out eventually as there has been discovery for a number of court cases in relation to the product, including the case of the late Mrs. McCole and another case which is pending.  However, there has been no similar discovery in relation to haemophiliacs and, based on what has emerged from the tribunal so far on anti-D, it is reasonable to believe that another catalogue of errors and a cover-up will emerge.</P>
    <P>The reason there has not been a court case involving haemophilia products is that haemophiliacs are desperate to protect their anonymity. They know that if there is a case, like Mrs. McCole, they will not be allowed to retain their anonymity.  Last week <i>The Irish Times</i> carried the sad tale of the parents of two unnamed young haemophiliac boys who had been infected with hepatitis C at a time when the blood products were supposed to be treated for the virus.  They want to know how the infection occurred at a time when it should not have occurred.  The parents' only option may be to go to the High Court but, if they do, their sons' anonymity will be lost.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that none of the difficulties relating to the terms of reference were highlighted in the interim report from the chairman of the hepatitis C tribunal.  What hope is there that the final report will change matters?  While we all want to see an efficient and expeditious inquiry, we do not want it to be at such a pace or on such narrow terms that some victims feel it is at their cost.  The tribunal is the appropriate forum to address haemophiliacs' concerns in relation to hepatitis C.  It is wrong that it has not been considering those matters to date, but even now it is not late.  Given that the tribunal is considering many of the relevant issues, the matters relating to the haemophiliacs could be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    <P>The second part of our motion relates to the need to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal so that the questions raised by the McCole family may be addressed.  One question raised by the family &mdash; that relating to who authorised the legal strategy for their mother's case &mdash; is not within the scope of the tribunal.  This matter is of great significance.  Only for the work done on the late Mrs. McCole's case this tribunal would not have been able to proceed as quickly as it has. <Col N="1611" /> The truth would not have come out but for her case.</P>
    <P>The tactics employed in Mrs. McCole's case were despicable and were designed to frustrate the truth.  They were not in the interests of the victim or in the public interest, although many of the threats were made by agents of the State.  The &ldquo;hardball&rdquo; tactics included an attempt to use the statute of limitations; a challenge to the date for an early hearing; a threat from the Chief State Solicitor that the case would be pursued all the way; the making of a lodgment to raise a threat of costs and an attempt to get the family of the late Mrs. McCole to sign off any claims they might have after their mother's death.  The stonewalling, barracking and blocking went on for months.</P>
    <P>I raised the question of who authorised the legal strategy at the time the terms of reference first went before this House.  I received support from three Government Deputies for an amendment I proposed to address this problem. However, when it was put to a vote, those Government Deputies ignored everything they said during the debate.  Everything that has since emerged at the tribunal would show that it was a deliberate act by the Minister not to allow any questions on the legal strategy used in the McCole case.</P>
    <P>If the tribunal has shown anything, it has highlighted the role played by the Minister in keeping the victims in the dark.  He knew all along that the BTSB had no defence to offer in any court case.  He did not do enough to acknowledge the scandal involved and to ensure disclosure of the cover-up.  Instead, he participated in it and, as we have seen in recent days at the tribunal, he took other actions.  He resisted a tribunal of inquiry even though he knew the expert group was flawed.  He was told that the information relating to the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932, which was supplied by his own Department, was wrong but he still published the report.</P>
    <P>When questioned in the Dáil on this matter by me on October 16, 1996, the Minister suggested that anti-D did not require a licence under the Therapeutic Substances Act, 1932.  Yet the Minister was given a memorandum by an official in his own Department in early 1995 saying that a licence was required under the Act and that the law had been broken between 1970 and 1984.  At the tribunal, the Minister claimed that if he had put this into the public domain he would be criticised for it.  Who would have criticised him for telling the truth once and for all?  Why did he block the judicial inquiry for so long when he knew the Department's advice was to this effect and that the BTSB had not been honest or open with the expert group.</P>
    <P>The Minister has maintained the charade at the tribunal about the expert group report and the discovery of the file relating to infective hepatitis which clearly shows the state of knowledge of the BTSB when it went about manufacturing its <Col N="1612" /> poisons.  Deputies will not forget that the Minister told the House that the file about infective hepatitis did not change the expert group report.  The Minister's officials told the tribunal that the first time they knew donor X had been diagnosed as having infective hepatitis was when details of the file emerged.</P>
    <P>Even more remarkable than the Minister for Health's evidence at the tribunal has been that of the former Minister and his officials.  No two versions of the events of that time in 1994 are the same and this is a matter of great public concern.</P>
    <P>The Government should remember in tonight's debate the wise aphorism that he or she who does not learn from history is condemned to repeat it. Deputies on the Government side of the House should recognise the inadequacy of what is being proposed and inequity of the treatment so far for haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the justification which I am sure the Minister will give for saying that the issues of concern will be raised in the new tribunal will stand up to scrutiny.  The Minister's amendment to the motion states that &ldquo; ... such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in the light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal ... &rdquo; will be included.  I want the Minister to give a commitment that between now and the end of Private Members' Business tomorrow evening he will revise that section of the motion to specifically include haemophiliacs.  That is the only basis on which haemophiliacs will believe the Minister, the Department or the BTSB.  Everyone has reason to accept their concerns in that regard.  That is the only amendment that will be acceptable because I believe there will be no reference in the final report to haemophiliacs, their concerns or the fact that they walked out of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, since 8 a.m. yesterday, when he was abroad, the Minister discovered an interesting piece of news on the radio and he has the champagne ready, the bucket is in the corner of his office and the ice is in the freezer.  While this will be my last time leading this debate, I will still be responsible for summing up tomorrow night and I will have much more to contribute at that time.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to keep the champagne, the bucket and the ice ready.  In contemplating what I have said, the Minister should make one generous gesture, not for me, Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats or the general public but for those who make most use of blood products &mdash; the 450 haemophiliacs and the other victims of haemophilia in Ireland.  That gesture might begin to restore the faith of this House in the Minister, his Department and the procedures therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion outlined by our spokesperson on Health, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, which expresses concern that the Irish Haemophiliac Society has withdrawn from the judicial inquiry into hepatitis C and requests that the interim report should be debated and the <Col N="1613" /> terms of reference of the inquiry altered to properly investigate the problems relating to these issues and address questions raised by the Bridget McCole case.  The Government's amendments to the motion do not address concerns about this matter, particularly those of haemophiliacs.  Any astute manoeuvring by the Minister or the Government does nothing to enhance the reputation of the Government or the judicial review. An inquiry, by its terms of reference, will only partially complete its work if it neglects the real and ongoing fears of the Irish Haemophiliac Society.</P>
      <P>Great strides were made in the 1970s in respect of anti-D immunoglobulin, blood transfusions and the manufacture of factors 8 and 9.  These developments led to changes in the lives of haemophiliacs. For the first time, they had the possibility to lead normal lives.  Up to that time, their lives were endangered by the smallest trauma which could lead to bleeding into joints and other areas and additional unfortunate consequences. When that problem was solved, new difficulties emerged with the advent of various viruses &mdash; hepatitis A, B and C, AIDS and other co-infections &mdash; and the contamination of blood.</P>
      <P>However, in the 1980s, the Blood Transfusion Service Board &mdash; under the auspices of the health boards &mdash; had access to the knowledge and technology relating to viral inactivation which is required to deal with many of those problems. Due to errors and suppositions, contamination occurred unnecessarily.  Attention was not paid to donor selection, quarantine periods and fractionation methods and other matters relating to a safe blood system were not properly addressed.</P>
      <P>Haemophiliacs are concerned because it takes large amounts of blood to manufacture products such as factors 8 and 9 and consequently, there is a greater risk of contamination.  If the blood is not properly inactivated, different kinds of problems can result.  Haemophiliacs should not be dying as a result of contracting hepatitis C; at least four patients have died during the past year. It is enough to be afflicted with the problem of haemophilia without being obliged to run the gauntlet of viruses such as hepatitis C.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn stated, hepatitis C is very aggressive in the case of haemophiliacs and generally leads to early death.</P>
      <P>Haemophiliacs are not like the anti-D patient recipients, who may receive injections of that substance between one and six times during their lives, or the recipients of blood transfusions. People may receive blood transfusions on one or more occasions but haemophiliacs are wont to receive factors 8 and 9 many times.  That leaves them open to contamination if the blood is not of the highest standards.  It is for this reason that haemophiliacs should be given every consideration at the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having considered the issues relating to haemophiliacs, I believe they have a special case. They are more liable to be contaminated than any other group in society.  As late as 1996, there was <Col N="1614" /> a scare regarding factor 8.  The way this problem was managed and dealt with left much to be desired.  Some patients were not informed of the dangers involved and read about it in the newspapers. Much progress has been made in respect of blood products such as factors 8 and 9. However, it is the responsibility of the Minister and his Department to ensure that the best standards obtain in this country.  We should not be obliged to purchase blood products from abroad. If the Blood Transfusion Service Board had access to the correct equipment and the goodwill of the people, it could supply sufficient amounts of blood required for various trauma cases and people who need it, particularly haemophiliacs.</P>
    <P>I entreat the Minister to seriously consider our spokesperson's comments in respect of the debâcle concerning blood products.  It is time we put our house in order.  The technology is available to eliminate viruses of which we are aware at present.  I presume that further viruses will emerge in the future but if we use best practice today we cannot be accused of not taking due care.  As I stated earlier, haemophiliacs are a special case and they should be treated in a special way, particularly by the tribunal.  Not only have they fears about the past and present, they also have fears about the future because they will be the greatest users of many of the products to which I referred.  On mature reflection I hope the Minister will agree to the motion as proposed by our spokesperson on Health, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>(i)  welcomes the publication of the Interim Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB;</P>
      <P>(ii)  acknowledges the concerns expressed by the Irish Haemophilia Society;</P>
      <P>(iii)  welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Health that the Government has agreed to establish a Tribunal of Inquiry to examine specific urgent matter of public importance, namely:</P>
      <P>(a) the HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation <Col N="1615" /> in the light of the Report of the Hepatitis C Tribunal; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  notes that detailed terms of reference will be prepared after the Report of the current Tribunal becomes available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment to the motion before the House, it is not to be suggested in any way that this is the framework for the terms of reference of a new tribunal &mdash; I hope there is no misunderstanding about that.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the House of the background to this debate.  The announcement that a health service worker in Kilkenny had tested positive for the HIV virus following a blood transfusion she received prior to the introduction of HIV screening by the BTSB precipitated a debate into the lookback procedures of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I subsequently stated in the House that I would explore the feasibility of either extending the existing terms of reference of the present tribunal or setting up a separate but related inquiry to deal with the specific questions then being raised in regard to HIV infection.  I have been having discussions with my Cabinet colleagues on this matter since the middle of December last.</P>
    <P>The Irish Haemophilia Society had sought legal representation at the tribunal of inquiry into hepatitis C, but that was not granted by the tribunal as the tribunal felt it was neither necessary nor appropriate for the task which it had to carry out &mdash; I am referring to what the tribunal said. The society then sought a judicial review in the High Court in November last and that was allowed.  Following that there was an agreement on the level of representation to be allowed to the Irish Haemophilia Society at the tribunal.  The Irish Haemophilia Society withdrew from the tribunal of inquiry into hepatitis C on 15 January last because it felt that the issues of concern to it and to its members were not being addressed by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder which results in the blood of the haemophiliac not clotting in the normal way because some of the clotting factors normally present in blood are missing. Treatment for haemophilia consists of replacing the missing factors with blood derivatives to allow normal clot formation to occur and thus avoiding haemorrhage.  Haemophiliacs are, therefore, not only frequent users of blood products but also totally reliant on blood products for their quality of life.</P>
    <P>Before the introduction of this replacement therapy in 1967 a person with haemophilia could expect to live to his or her middle 30s.  Following the introduction of replacement therapy, life expectancy for haemophiliacs increased to between 65 and 70 years, not quite up to average life expectancy for the rest of the population but significantly near it.  It is clear how effective the replacement therapy has been for a group which is the greatest user of blood and blood products <Col N="1616" /> and consequently most at risk from virus or infection in the blood or blood products.  When the HIV virus began to appear in blood products the life expectancy went back again to the middle 30s. The viral infection of blood products is obviously a crucial issue for the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members who rely so much on the quality of blood and blood product supply.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the decision of the Irish Haemophilia Society to withdraw from the present tribunal.  I am aware the society feels that a number of its concerns are not being dealt with by the present tribunal of inquiry.  The terms of reference of the current inquiry specifically allowed for the tribunal to make me aware, at the interim report stage, of any changes which the tribunal considered were necessary to its terms of reference.  The interim report stated that there were no matters which the chairman considered necessary to draw to my attention at that stage &mdash; I put the interim report before the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is available to every Member. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to seek to influence the tribunal in the discharge of its mandate given to it by the Oireachtas.  The terms of reference specifically stated that if the tribunal wanted to draw to the attention of the Oireachtas any matter, including a change in the terms of reference, that could be done.  The interim report stated that there was no such matter which the tribunal needed to bring to the attention of the Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I too am very concerned that the circumstances of the infection of all blood products are fully and properly investigated and, to this end, the Government has today agreed to the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry to examine specific urgent matters of public importance, primarily in regard to HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the substantive issues of the debate.  The interim report of the tribunal of inquiry into the hepatitis C infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB was laid before this House on 8 January 1997.  I take this opportunity to express my grantitude to the chairman, Mr. Justice Finlay, for the speed and efficiency with which this report was produced and presented to me.  The terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into hepatitis C, as approved by this House, included the stipulation that the tribunal should report on an interim basis on the following four matters: the number of parties then represented before the tribunal; the progress which had been made in the hearings and the work of the tribunal; the likely duration of the tribunal proceedings and any other matters which the tribunal believed should be drawn to the attention of the Minister for Health at that stage, including any matter relating to the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Six parties have been granted full representation before the tribunal for the duration of the inquiry: Positive Action; the family of the late Mrs. Bridget McCole; the Blood Transfusion Service <Col N="1617" /> Board; the National Drugs Advisory Board, now known as the Irish Medicines Board; the Department of Health and the Minister for Health; and a team of lawyers nominated by the Attorney General to represent the public interest. Limited representation before the tribunal was granted to the following four bodies: Transfusion Positive, the Irish Kidney Association, the Irish Haemophilia Society and Crumlin Hospital. Three persons who were witnesses were granted representation in connection with the giving of their testimony.</P>
    <P>All the parties to the action brought by the late Mrs. Bridget McCole agreed that documents discovered by them in those proceedings should be made available to the tribunal.  In addition, orders for the discovery of documents relevant to the terms of reference of the tribunal and not already discovered in the court proceedings were made against the following: the BTSB, the NDAB and the Department of Health.  Orders for discovery were also made against Positive Action, the Coombe Hospital and Crumlin Hospital.  In addition, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association and Transfusion Positive supplied documents on request to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>At the outset the tribunal decided that it would divide the terms of reference into two separate groups for the purpose of taking evidence and consideration of documents.  Items Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, and item No. 9 of the terms of reference, were taken first, to be followed by items Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, of the terms of reference. Prior to the commencement of oral evidence on 2 December 1996 the tribunal circulated to parties a statement of facts seeking their agreement or dispute with such facts as itemised.  The interim report states that this represented a very significant contribution to the expedition and clarity of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>The tribunal sat for 11 days from 2 to 17 December 1996 during which it took evidence from 29 witnesses.  The names and occupations of those witnesses are set out in an appendix to the interim report.</P>
    <P>The interim report states that, save for a very limited number of topics in which some oral evidence may be required in the second part of the proceedings of the tribunal, in the view of the chariman the oral testimony and the documentary testimony necessary to reach conclusions on the terms of reference already dealt with, items 1-4 inclusive and item 9, is completed.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the likely duration of the tribunal proceedings in so far as that was capable of being estimated when the interim report was presented.  The extensive preparatory work carried out before oral evidence commenced on 2 December 1996 on the first segment of the tribunal's work was also carried out in relation to the remaining terms of reference, items 5-8 inclusive.  The interim report states that this process is likely again to clarify and greatly expedite the taking of the evidence which remains to be heard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> The taking of oral evidence recommenced on Monday, 13 January 1997.  The interim report stated that: &ldquo;... while it is particularly difficult at this stage to estimate the duration of oral evidence the Chairman considers it likely that it may be concluded within approximately 3 weeks and that thereafter a period of another 3 weeks may suffice for the final preparation of the report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At this stage it appears the oral hearings will conclude this Wednesday or Thursday and the final report of the tribunal will be received around the end of February.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, in terms of the interim report the House asked the tribunal to report on any other matters which it believes should be drawn to the attention of the Minister for Health at that stage, including any matter relating to the terms of reference.  As I said earlier, the interim report stated there were no matters which the chairman considered necessary to draw to my attention at that stage when the interim report was presented.</P>
    <P>All reports of the tribunal's proceedings to date indicate it is operating efficiently and effectively and that this is due, in large part, to the fact that its terms of reference were very specifically drawn up to satisfy the desire of this House that the inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible, consistent with a fair examination of the matters referred to it.  The tribunal has confirmed it would not be practical to extend the terms of reference of this inquiry and the Government accepts this view.</P>
    <P>There were two ways of approaching the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society and HIV issues which arose before Christmas.  One was to extend the terms of reference of the current tribunal and the other was to set up a related tribunal with new terms of reference with, perhaps, the same personnel to examine a new area requiring investigation or a new module of work.  The Government, through the Attorney General, contacted the tribunal and it confirmed that, from its perspective, it would not be practical to extend the terms of reference of this inquiry, and the Government accepts this view.</P>
    <P>The option of extending the terms of reference of this inquiry is not available.  I suggest the tribunal is correct in its assessment and that the way the Government is proceeding is the better way because there are many arguments against extending the terms of reference of the present tribunal.  They include the fact that the present tribunal team considers it is neither practical nor feasible for the current tribunal of inquiry to meet the requirements of the Irish Haemophilia Society which were put to it.  Discovery of documents is also an issue.  Document collection and appraisal of documents would have to commence in respect of any new matters arising and this would add significantly to the postponement of the publication of the final report of the current tribunal.  It is not only in the public interest but in the interest of all parties participating in the tribunal and victims of the hepatitis C scandal <Col N="1619" /> that, when the body of work which the tribunal was set up to do by the Houses of the Oireachtas is almost complete and when the tribunal has informed me that it can report in about four weeks, we should be very reluctant to change its terms of reference in any way which would prevent it from delivering on this.</P>
    <P>When we came into the House to debate these issues the arguments put forward were that the anti-D scandal should be investigated and that the hepatitis C infection of anti-D product and its consequences for blood and blood products should be investigated with specific terms of reference to ensure, in so far as possible, that we would get an early report and that we would not opt for an open-ended tribunal as some kind of exigency of the political system to kick uncomfortable matters into touch.  We were looking for the truth.  We wanted the truth after a thorough examination and we wanted it reasonably quickly.  The tribunal has informed me and both Houses of the Oireachtas that it is in a position to deliver on this in about four weeks' time.  We should hesitate before deciding to take a course of action which might lead to an unforeseeable delay.</P>
    <P>If I came in here to change the terms of reference, I envisage that Deputies opposite would very quickly say I was deliberately extending the work of the tribunal because I do not want the report to come out, that I am hiding behind the procedures of the House and taking action to ensure the tribunal does not report at an early date.  I am sure charges would be made that I was trying to postpone the publication of the report of the tribunal until after a general election.  I consider it is in the best public interest that the report is finalised promptly, that it is important there is no lengthy gap between the giving of evidence, which may be completed tomorrow or the day after, and the publication of the report.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that the public has already heard a good deal of evidence from the tribunal.  Many of them have an open mind on it and others may be making up their mind about it.  Because the issue in respect of the BTSB and confidence in the blood supply is so serious, it is very important that the tribunal should adjudicate quickly.  It has told me it will be in a position to do so in approximately four weeks' time.  It is important that report should be made available as quickly as possible and I am very pleased that the tribunal has decided to do that.</P>
    <P>That is not to say there are not other outstanding important issues.  The House should support me in dealing with them in a systematic and equally efficient way so that we get answers once more in respect of other problems and that the truth is again arrived at.  I do not want a situation to develop where, in attempting to do everything together, we do nothing effectively.  It is much better to order our business in the manner I am proposing to the House and that we come back with a related tribunal which will inquire into <Col N="1620" /> very serious matters concerning the blood supply, and hope we can again draft specific terms of reference, in co-operation with all sides of the House, which will allow an equally efficient inquiry to arrive at the truth.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the background to the HIV element of the proposed tribunal.  As I informed the House in December, no lookback programme was undertaken by the BTSB following the introduction of HIV screening in October 1985 in respect of the earlier donations by donors now screening positive, although their donations were not used.  The BTSB had, from 1989 onwards, a lookback programme for newlypresenting donors.</P>
    <P>A total of 24 blood donors have tested positive for HIV since screening was introduced in 1985. Eight of those were first time donors and, accordingly, no risk of HIV transmission to recipients was involved.  In the case of nine of the remaining 16 donors, recipients of potentially infected issues were traced and none of the recipients tested positive.</P>
    <P>The tracing of recipients of the issues from the remaining seven donors has been rendered very difficult by the absence of the BTSB despatch records for the period prior to 1986.  Of the 31 issues from those seven donors, 15 were donated prior to 1981 and are not regarded as a potential source of infection.  The residual problem relates to tracing the recipients of the balance of the 16 issues derived from the potentially infected blood donations made prior to 1985.  Six of the issues have been traced leaving ten issues of concern remaining.  I was advised that there can be no guarantee that all the remaining ten issues will ever be traced.  There is also the possibility that some donors who may have been HIV positive prior to the introduction of HIV screening of donations in October 1985 may not have come back to donate since 1985 and cannot, therefore, be identified.  As I said in the Dáil on 17 December, I therefore decided to introduce an optional HIV testing programme, the details of which are being finalised.  It will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The success of the tribunal has been ascribed, <i>inter alia</i>, to the specificity of its terms of reference and, when the terms of reference of the HIV inquiry are being drafted, it is important that that example is followed.  In finalising the terms of reference account will be taken of such further matters in respect of blood and blood products as may require investigation in light of the report of the hepatitis C tribunal.  Particular attention will be paid to the concerns of the Irish Haemophilia Society.  I wish to enter into consultations with it before the terms of reference are finalised in the House.  I understand its concerns.</P>
    <P>The tribunal of inquiry had terms of reference which allowed it to look at the chain of infection from anti-D to blood and blood products and it allowed the society partial representation.  In its report it may deal with some but not all of the issues.  I wish to enter consultations with the <Col N="1621" /> society before I bring forward terms of reference in the House and in the light of what may be contained in the report which we expect to receive in about four weeks.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the terms of reference for the new inquiry which will express specific questions can be drawn up and brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.  It will not be possible to do this, however, until the final report of the tribunal of inquiry has been presented.  Until that is available it will not be possible to say what matters of urgent public importance remain unaddressed. It is expected around the end of February.</P>
    <P>We are talking about events that occurred in the 1980s.  People have waited a long time for answers.  I have proceeded with one tribunal which will present its report in four weeks time. There is no kicking to touch.  We will bring forward the terms of reference in the Dáil as soon as we are able to do so.  If I brought forward terms of reference tonight which dealt with generalities and said there would be an examination, it might satisfy the political demands of the moment but a future tribunal may drift on and on and the truth would not be arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas did a good job in drafting the last terms of reference.  There are outstanding matters, some of which are of deep concern to the Irish Haemophilia Society.  I wish to enter consultations to identify the matters that need to be addressed and to continue the process in the House.  It is important and central to the health service and confidence in the blood supply.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will not promise that somebody will respond tomorrow night but I would appreciate it very much if the Deputy would give me or officials of my Department the details privately.  The matter will receive consideration. The anonymity of the person concerned in Kilkenny was not preserved and I do not want talk across the floor of the House about an individual whose identity is known.</P>
      <P>On 16 October I made a comprehensive statement in the House on the legal strategy adopted by the State in the High Court case arising out of the action taken by the late Mrs. McCole.  It is not necessary or appropriate for me to restate the rationale for the approach adopted in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chief medical consultant of the Blood Transfusion Service Board has made a public appeal for blood donors to come forward to ensure adequate blood supplies are maintained. As the House understands, blood donations drop off around this time of year because of seasonal factors such as colds and flu.  This is not a feature confined to Ireland.  In the United Kingdom blood donations are down by 50 per cent in some <Col N="1622" /> places and the health authorities there have the same difficulties as we have.  Elective operations have been cancelled in certain parts of the United Kingdom and a number of other countries have similar difficulties in maintaining their blood supply.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure the blood supply in Ireland is adequate for the needs of those who are ill and in need of transfusions. There has always been a great tradition of giving in the health service.  This is not confined to those immediately involved in health care, although health care workers are also significant blood donors.  Blood donation allows those who work outside the health care area to provide something of benefit to those who are ill.  Each year over 180,000 donations of blood are made.</P>
    <P>I have on previous occasions highlighted the importance of ensuring an adequate supply of blood and blood products and pointed out that without an adequate supply the lives of patients are put at risk.  Heart transplants and bypass operations, kidney and liver transplants and many other surgical procedures cannot take place without supplies of blood being available.  The blood supply is at the core of the hospital service.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, make a special appeal to blood donors throughout the country.  These donors have been magnificent, especially in recent years. My appeal to them is to continue to donate blood in the same generous way that they have always donated and for the same reasons.</P>
    <P>The policy of my Department is to continue to use voluntary unpaid donors and to remain selfsufficient in blood and blood products.  This is also the policy of the European Union.  I am most anxious to ensure this continues to be the position in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Doctors will confirm that there is no alternative to human blood in treating patients who require transfusions and in keeping the hospital system operational.  It will be many years before an alternative is available.  In the meantime the health service will continue to rely on voluntary donations made by some for the benefit of others.</P>
    <P>The strictest safety procedures are in place in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and its operation conforms to international standards.  I have been involved in putting new management in place and its new chief medical consultant has taken up his appointment.  I am confident that the blood supply has never been safer and that donors will come forward in their usual high numbers to ensure adequate supplies of blood are available for the patients who urgently need their help.</P>
    <P>I ask other Members who have influence, particularly the spokespersons opposite, to make a similar appeal.  It is crucial that blood supplies are maintained.  The position improved significantly today.  The awareness among donors that seasonal factors are impacting has led to an increased presentation of donors to give blood. Any support that others could give would be helpful also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> I am confident that all Members want to see the issues in relation to blood safety fully addressed and I am aware that all parties are anxious to ensure that whatever remains to be done is done.  There should be no unanswered questions remaining following completion of the present and proposed inquiries.  It is also essential to ensure that whatever institutional changes need to be made are made.  I am anxious to deal comprehensively with these issues and to allow the new management structure to get on with planning the future needs of the blood supply without the constant need to become involved in investigating the past.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody in the House will join with me in my wish to ensure that the public and patients have every confidence in the blood supply. The fact that this House is prepared to agree to have all of the matters at issue examined is a clear signal to blood donors that their concerns are our concerns and that the maintenance of the safety of the blood supply is an absolute priority.</P>

      <P>In light of the amendment tabled by the Government I find myself in the somewhat embarrassing position of having to declare an interest in the matter.  I appeared as counsel for the Minister for Health in the litigation arising out of the previous claims made by the haemophiliacs who contracted HIV from infected blood products.  Some developed full blown AIDS.  That matter led to a general election and the proceedings were subsequently compromised by the Minister for Health.  I do not want anything I say here to be taken as going beyond that particular matter, in which I am bound by the confidentiality I owe to my former client.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said there have been 25 debates on this subject.  In the light of the announcement made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn two days ago, I want to take this opportunity to wish her well in the future.  She has made a tremendous contribution to the proceedings of this House, in Government and in Opposition. She has done Trojan work vindicating the rights of this frightened and intimidated group of people.  The work she has put into it will be one of the monuments to her in the future.  We all wish her the best.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter in hand and the 25 debates we have had prompts certain reflections on the procedure of a tribunal of inquiry.  We have had a number of these over the decades but I do not think there has been the degree of supervision of a tribunal of inquiry we have seen with this one, which I welcome.  We all learnt the lesson from the previous tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry that there was a need for a more comprehensive control by these Houses of inquiries which we establish to report to us.  As the Supreme Court made clear in their judgments on the previous tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry, these tribunals are creatures of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  They are not, in any sense, a court of <Col N="1624" /> law.  They may follow or adopt the procedures of a court of law, they may hear evidence and conduct the discovery of documents but they are established for the purpose of reporting to us and of conducting an inquiry on our behalf.</P>
    <P>There is some discussion in the House at present about conducting these inquiries ourselves but it is better that we entrust that task to some person outside the House.  With the best will in the world, we can all be guilty of strong party passions.  I am not sure politicians are in the best position to judge when clear answers to disputed facts are required.  We should pay tribute to former Chief Justice Thomas Finlay for the expeditious manner in which he has conducted the inquiry to date.  It is encouraging and will foster the greater use of tribunals in the future.</P>
    <P>As regards the motion before us this evening, I am disappointed the Government has not been able to come forward with a more reasoned amendment.  The Minister concluded his speech this evening with a powerful appeal for donations to the blood bank.  We all know how important the voluntary unpaid donor is to the Irish blood transfusion supply.  I am happy to join with the Minister in that appeal.  If he wants a response, he must realise the importance of maintaining public confidence in the administration of that system. If the most farreaching inquiries have to be conducted urgently, the Minister has to translate that into a practical exercise of political will to see that it happens.  We on this side of the House join with him in appealing to donors all over Ireland to come forward and help out in the problem that has arisen.  The Minister can also play a part in this by encouraging the most candid and full investigation into the matters raised in our motion.  Their amendment does not address that.</P>
    <P>I do not need to rehash the precise points made by the Haemophilia Society.  They have already been set out by the party spokesperson, in correspondence received by every Member of this House and in the records of the proceedings.  We were all disappointed when they led to the society withdrawing from the proceedings.  They made the point that of the 210 people with haemophilia who have been infected with hepatitis C, three have already died, a further 34 have died of coinfection of hepatitis C and HIV and the majority have chronic liver disease.  This is a group of people with whose interests we should be dealing as quickly as possible.  That is not covered in the Government amendment, which disappoints me.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a number of objections as to why it could not happen.  He fairly set out the reasons against extending the terms of reference of the present tribunal.  He said the present tribunal team considers it is neither practical nor feasible for the current tribunal to meet the requirements of the society.  That is a matter of legal opinion.  It is a notorious fact that lawyers can diverge in their opinions.  Where there is a determination to see a matter resolved and ascer-tained, I believe lawyers can bend their energies, undoubted talents and intellect to that end.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> Fresh discovery of documents may now be required.  I would have thought a great deal of documentation has been discovered in the course of the existing inquiry which would touch on the matters with which we are concerned.  It is not really a matter of an entirely fresh discovery but rather bringing documents to light with which the tribunal is, to some extent, already familiar, making them explicit or drawing out their implications.</P>
    <P>The kernel of the Minister's case is that he is anxious to see this matter finalised within the next four weeks.  I do not know whether this is a signal of the possible timing of the next general election but he seemed to be very concerned that matters would conclude in the next four weeks.  I agree this is important.  It is obvious from how the former Chief Justice has conducted his work that a further extension to deal with this matter would not take up a great deal of time.  Whatever the lawyers may say, it is clear from how the chairman of the tribunal has approached his task that he would be in a position to deal with the matter in an expeditious fashion.  Having made those objections, the Minister gave an undertaking.  I am pleased he did this because the Government amendment refers to the &ldquo;HIV infection of blood and blood products manufactured and distributed by the BTSB&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not want to comment on that other than to say it does not appear to relate to the infection of haemophiliacs with hepatitis C.  It is curious that the amendment is proposing an entirely different inquiry from the matter we raised.  It goes on to say &ldquo;such further matters...as may require investigation in the light of the report of the Hepatitis C Tribunal&rdquo;.  It is clear that the chairman took a strict view of the interpretation of the terms of reference.  I do not fault him on that.  The Oireachtas settled the terms of reference and it probably assisted him in the rapid disposal of his business that he adopted a strict construction of his terms.  However, subparagraph (b) in the amendment refers to &ldquo;such further matters&rdquo; and is open to a strict interpreta-tion which does not apply to the question we raised in our motion.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I was glad to hear the Minister say it was a matter of particular concern to him that any terms of reference would be settled in consultation with the Haemophilia Society.  I urge him to do that.  I do not see why he cannot do it here and now and bring this matter before the Houses as soon as possible in the form of resolutions. Wherever the hare may run on this issue, it is essential we maintain public confidence in the blood supply.</P>
    <P>The other matter raised is the question of the McCole case and the authorisation of legal strategy on the defence of her claim.  We have not included that in the motion for any prurient political interest to ascertain some facts that might cause political embarrassment to this or that Minister.  There is a wider question involved here because there is the public suspicion that the legal <Col N="1626" /> strategy adopted by the defence &mdash; and I am not making any suggestions or allegations about the Ministers in this regard &mdash; was adopted essentially for the purpose of concealing facts from the public.  The public is concerned about the degree of concealment that took place at the BTSB and, therefore, the whole question of the legal strategy could very well throw light on the findings of fact which the tribunal should make on the overall questions posed to it by the terms of reference. That matter deserves to be examined in further detail.  I wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy McDaid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Lenihan, for sharing his time with me and my other colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who has been foremost in pursuing this matter in recent years and who will see it through until justice as she sees it is done in this case.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I do not want to go over what has been said here tonight but rather concentrate on two aspects of the motion, namely, the call on the Minister for Health to grant a debate on the interim report and that all questions raised by the family of the late Mrs. McCole should be answered.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister has refused to grant us a debate on the interim report because in the first three or four days of the tribunal I learned more about the scientific ongoings in the BTSB than I learned here or about medicine in general in the past five years.  I was absolutely horrified by what I found out in the first few days of the tribunal and it is only right that we should debate it in this House.  I intend to raise just one specific point from the first week of the tribunal to outline the reason we should have a debate on the interim report.</P>
      <P>I have been somewhat disturbed by the recent change in what the tribunal has undertaken.  It has gone from producing scientific knowledge and fact finding to what appears to be a debate about who is at fault between the Department of Health and the BTSB.  Officials on one side seem to blame officials on the other side and it is unfortunate that the tribunal has reduced itself to that. A debate on the interim report should be granted by the Minister because this House has failed the people involved in the hepatitis C crisis.  Such a debate would at least bring some of the facts out into the open.  Facts not previously known to us or the Minister are now known and they should be debated and perhaps apologies made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second part of the motion refers to the questions posed by the family of the late Brigid McCole.  The entire nation was enormously impressed by the dignity with which Mrs. McCole's family have conducted themselves throughout this terrible trauma.  Brigid McCole was given an injection in 1977 that was meant to save the life of her baby but in fact was to cause her death 18 years later.  We have heard from Mrs. McCole's daughter of her harrowing suffering in recent years.  The media and the entire <Col N="1627" /> population described this case as a tragedy and a travesty, but to describe the case in that way after what we have heard is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>The picture that has emerged in the first week of the tribunal is not one of a tragic scientific mistake involving a relatively new condition but of revelations that have shocked the scientific medical world.  It appears the facts which have emerged from the tribunal and which caused Brigid McCole's death were known to the BTSB before she received her injection.  An analysis of the evidence given to the tribunal in chronological order reveals that a doctor identified the source of the infection of one of his patients as an injection of anti-D and informed the BTSB, as did a consultant who wrote to him.  That letter was dated 4 October 1977.  Brigid McCole received her injection on 5 November 1977.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that in July of that year the BTSB received at least seven reports of severe hepatitis in women who had received anti-D five months before Brigid McCole received her injection.  In that same month the BTSB knew precisely where to look for the source of the problem &mdash; batches of anti-D from patient X.  I have great compassion for patient X because even the so-called expert group that reported to the Minister referred to her as donor X.  That was totally unfair to this patient because neither she nor her doctor knew her blood was being used in this way.</P>
    <P>Why did the BTSB use plasma from such a patient?  There are two basic reasons they should not have used it.  Patient X was diagnosed in 1976 as having infectious hepatitis and the BTSB accepts that it is probable she received her contamination from blood transfusions.  Yet it was made clear in the first few days of the tribunal that the BTSB had a clear rule dating back to 1968 that blood was never to be taken from a person who ever had jaundice of any kind.</P>
    <P>It may never be known how patient X became infected but it has emerged that in 1975 the entire stock of anti-D in Pelican House was placed in a refrigerator in a special hepatitis laboratory thereby probably exposing it to the risk of crossinfection. Patient X may take that as a suggestion but we will never know how she became infected. This fact was made known to the tribunal by a scientific biochemist, Stephen O'Sullivan, who demanded and was told that stock would be destroyed.  The entire batch was brought back and continued to be used.</P>
    <P>The second basic reason patient X plasma should never have been used was that patient X was attending Crumlin Hospital three days per week for a plasma exchange programme. Throughout the world the blood of people receiving such exchanges is never deemed sufficiently healthy for the manufacture of anti-D.  Crumlin Hospital sent samples of patient X's plasma to the BTSB, and nine of those samples were marked &ldquo;Infective Hepatitis&rdquo;.  The BTSB was asked to test one of the samples for hepatitis B, but despite <Col N="1628" /> the fact that those samples were marked &ldquo;Infective Hepatitis&rdquo; the BTSB continued to make anti-D from that plasma.  That decision could have been reversed in 1977 but the BTSB took an extraordinary step.  It decided to cease using the plasma to make new anti-D but continued to use the anti-D already made.  The first question in relation to Mrs. McCole, therefore, is very pertinent because one of the batches already made was batch 250.  For the next 18 years that decision by the BTSB determined the quality of life of Brigid McCole because she received her injection from batch 250.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Fisheries (Commissions) Bill, 1997 is to validate the establishment of the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and the appointment of Mr. Séamus Keating as member of the commission, to validate the actions of the commission and to provide an indemnity to the members of such commissions against all and any actions or claims.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission was established, and had certain functions conferred on it, by an order signed by me on 21 February 1996 following debate and resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In summary, the Attorney General has advised that the order in question is invalid because the necessary authority to sign it had not been conferred on me as Minister of State at the time.  New legislation is needed to validate actions taken by that commission in exercise of functions purportedly conferred on it under that order.</P>
      <P>I would like to recall for the House the circumstances which gave rise to the establishment of the commission.  The Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, provides that the Minister for the Marine may, by order, following a request from a Fisheries Board or after consideration by him of a report on the management, organisation and performance of a board, appoint a commission to carry out particular functions of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation was enacted on foot of a review of the existing legislation governing intervention by the Minister in the affairs of a fisheries board <Col N="1629" /> where exceptional circumstances warranted.  It was prompted by recurring allegations concerning the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995 was enacted, I appointed Mr. Dermot Rochford, personnel consultant, to report to me under section 2 of that Act, on the management and organisation of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, and the exercise by it of its functions in relation to its finances and staff.  His report concluded that the affairs of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board were not, nor in the foreseeable future likely to be, managed in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>He recommended that the Minister consider exercising his powers to establish a commission under section 3 of the 1995 Act while ensuring a working structure which would continue to harness the undoubted capabilities within the board itself.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the Southern Regional Fisheries Board on 13 January 1996, giving notice under section 4 of the Act of my intention to make an order appointing a commission and conferring on it the management, conservation and protection functions of the board.</P>
    <P>The board would continue to be responsible for the development and improvement of fisheries; the encouragement, promotion, development of angling; the issuing of licences; fisheries rates and the preparation of development plans.  The Southern Regional Fisheries Board responded positively to my proposal on 24 January 1996.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Act, a draft order establishing the commission was laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 9 February 1996.  On 21 February 1996, each House passed a resolution approving the draft order.  I accordingly made the order on 21 February 1996 under section 3 of the 1995 Act, providing for the appointment of a commission for a period of one year from 23 February 1996, to take over the protection, conservation and management functions of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>Mr. Séamus Keating was appointed as the sole commissioner with effect from 26 February 1996. In causing a report to be prepared on the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, signing the order providing for the appointment of the commission and appointing Mr. Keating to the commission, I proceeded on the understanding that I was exercising powers conferred on me by the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995 and the Marine (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) (No. 2) Order, 1995 (Statutory Instrument No. 199 of 1995).</P>
    <P>The latter order delegated certain specified functions of the Minister for the Marine to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine. These functions included functions under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1994 in so far as they relate to inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>It was in the course of routine preparation of a draft order to extend the term of the commission last December, that the Attorney General's office <Col N="1630" /> discovered that the original order establishing the commission was invalid.  It transpired that because the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995, under which the order was made, post-dated by several months the delegation of functions order, the specific new powers conferred on the Minister under that Act had not been delegated to me.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General's office advised the Department of a potential problem on 18 December last and at a meeting the following day.  Pending clarification of the legal situation, it was decided to proceed in any event with the laying of a draft order extending the term of the commission in the name of the Minister for the Marine.  This was laid before the Oireachtas on 20 December 1996.</P>
    <P>Following definitive clarification of the problem after the Christmas break, in consultation with the Attorney General's office, the Minister and I agreed on the need for immediate action to address the legal difficulty.  The Attorney General advised that primary legislation was required to validate the appointment and the work of the commission since its establishment.</P>
    <P>I regret that this situation has arisen, resulting in the need to introduce this legislation.  I assure the House that I signed in good faith and with the agreement of the Minister and the approval of both Houses, the order establishing the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission.  I had at the time no reason to doubt that I had the necessary authority under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1995 and under a delegation of ministerial functions order made earlier in 1995 to make that statutory instrument.  Indeed, I would say that we were all proceeding in good faith in the course of the debate on the order in this House last February.</P>
    <P>Equally, the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission has subsequently acted in good faith in exercising the functions conferred on it, as has the Southern Regional Fisheries Board in co-operating and working with the commission.  I will refer later to the constructive work carried out by the commission since its establishment in February 1996.  Clearly it would be neither in the public interest nor the interest of the Southern Fisheries Region, nor in keeping with the intentions of the Oireachtas, if we were not to address the legal deficiencies which have now come to light.</P>
    <P>The commissioner was informed of the legal deficiencies on 14 January last and the chairman of the southern board has been briefed on the matter.  I understand that he has briefed board members and staff.  The legal situation pending the enactment of this Bill is that the Southern Regional Fisheries Board has all the functions of a regional board under the Fisheries Acts.  The Bill is designed to enable the constructive and valuable work of the commission to date to be validated and preserved, and will allow that work to be completed in the best interests of the southern board and southern fisheries region.</P>
    <P>In that context, I can advise the House that since taking office the commission has undertaken <Col N="1631" /> a review of fisheries protection and surveillance in the southern region and has, where necessary, formulated revised working procedures in this operational area.  The commission has worked closely and constructively with the board which, under the purported order, retained responsibility for fisheries promotion, development and licensing and for fisheries rates.</P>
    <P>The commission is also reviewing management systems within the board and, in conjunction with the Central Fisheries Board, has undertaken a review of the board's finances and financial systems. I am satisfied, on the basis of regular reports to date from the commission, that it is in the interests of the efficient and effective management of the board for the commission to be allowed to complete the work it has begun.</P>
    <P>The detailed provisions of the Bill are as follows. Section 1 governs the interpretation of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the validation of the order signed on 21 February 1996 which established, and conferred certain functions on, the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission and of actions taken in fulfilment of conditions precedent to the making of that order. Section 3 provides for the validation of all actions taken by the commission in the period since its establishment to the date, 14 January 1997, on which the commission was informed of the legal difficulties and the validation of the appointment of the sole member of the commission.  Section 4 subjects validations under sections 2 and 3 to the necessary constitutional provisions.  Section 5 provides for the extension of the order which purported to establish the commission and which is to be validated under section 2, to 20 February 1998 or to such earlier date as the Minister may specify.  This will make the draft order laid on 20 December 1996 redundant.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the continuation in office of the existing member of the commission. Section 7 provides for the indemnification of members of the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission, and members of commissions which may be established in future against actions brought against them by virtue of their actions or omissions as members of commissions.  Section 8 provides for the non-abatement of prosecutions brought prior to the enactment of this Bill by either the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission or the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  Section 9 gives the short title of the Bill, collective citation and construction.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.  It will enable the commission to be put back on track, and will allow for the substantive work already under way to continue and be completed as everyone had intended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems of the Southern Fisheries Board still beset us.  The original legislation was designed to address shortcomings in existing legislation.  On examination it became clear that it would not be possible to deal with <Col N="1632" /> the board's problems and that new provisions would have to be introduced.</P>
      <P>This is extremely embarrassing for the Minister of State, but I do not lay the blame at his feet. We have had problems in the Attorney General's office before.  I distinctly recall the Smyth case &mdash; the new Government did not act very quickly regarding correspondence in that matter.  We had the conflict in the Goodman case, the Dunnes case and the delisting of Mr. Justice Lynch.  In no period of our history has this House been confronted with such problems in the Attorney General's office as it has been in recent times.  That is why it should be possible for us to introduce legislation, make orders and establish commissions of this kind without this embarrassment.</P>
      <P>Both here and in the other House people on all sides supported the necessity to introduce legislation quickly in order to validate the work being undertaken by the commission.  I am glad there has been co-operation and that we are likely to see good developments arising from this intervention.  It is a great pity that this good work and co-operation has to be tarnished in the way it is because the advice to the Minister's office from the Attorney General's office came a year too late.  It is not good that we have to introduce extreme measures to deal with current problems. Most of us are reluctant to give those powers, to overcentralise the work we do.  We prefer to leave local people in charge to take control of their own lives and business.  When extreme measures are introduced with the full support of both Houses of the Oireachtas, it behoves those men and women who advise the Government on legal matters to make sure they are adequate and that we do not end up with the kind of mess we have on our hands.  That kind of <i>faux pas</i> is not acceptable and we cannot overlook it just because the Minister regrets that it happened.  It is high time the ability of that office to respond to today's needs is improved so that we do not find ourselves in situations like this.</P>
      <P>Did we find ourselves in this situation because the Department of the Marine is viewed by the Attorney General's office as the &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; Department.  Is it not high time Cinderella got a new dress to go to the ball?  Are the resources of the sea, inland fisheries, sea angling and marine development not viewed by the Attorney General's office as an extraordinary national asset which has to be protected, preserved, developed? Are we to believe that that office deals with items of this kind in a way that leads to the problems we are faced with?</P>
      <P>On the question of clearly defined objectives as to the value and potential of our fisheries, a number of important developments have taken place, not least the investment in the operational angling tourism programme.  Other areas should clearly be developed and policies improved, and this is not enhanced by this kind of debacle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House support the validation of decisions that have already been taken &mdash; I hope they can be truly validated.  I would like the <Col N="1633" /> Minister to deal with that question since already there are legal cases pending.  Can any actions taken up to now be challenged in court?  Are we finished with such cases or will we be faced with other difficulties of that kind because of the inadequate legal advice given to the Minister?</P>
    <P>There is no need to trot out again many of the statements made in both Houses with regard to the value of our inland fisheries, sea angling, etc. However, when introducing extreme legislation, which is not usual in the House, conferring extreme powers and involving fairly radical intervention in local management and which could be quite embarrassing for all of those who have performed well over the years in the Southern Fisheries Board and elsewhere, it is important that we have legal sanction and are not faced with continuing embarrassment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances outlined by the Minister of State, I have no objection to this Bill because it is essential that it be passed. However, I have comments to make on why it is necessary.  I am not blaming the Department of the Marine.  The drafting of this order was not its business.  It was the business of that most sacrosanct of places, the office of the Attorney General. Yet again the Attorney General and his office have made a serious mess of things, necessitating this emergency legislation, and we have not had one word of apology either from the Minister or State or from or on behalf of the Attorney General or his office.  That is regrettable. These are the very people who are currently lecturing Members of this House in a sub-committee of the House of which I am a member dealing with the compellability of witnesses Bill as to what is allowable and what is not allowable in this House, and how their office in particular must be exempt from any normal examination. These are the people who claim to be the font of all wisdom.  This is a most elementary mistake and, in their usual arrogant fashion, they simply advise that it should be rectified and this House has a duty to rectify it.  I am quite sure this House will rectify it but I want to place on record my disgust at the elementary error which was made by the Attorney General and his office for which they will accept no responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State read out a speech tonight which suggested that this was some kind of technical error which could not be avoided.  It was not; this was a fundamental mistake by people who should not make that sort of mistake and this kind of legislation should not be necessary. Unfortunately it is necessary, and Members might bear in mind in a wider context that the mistake was made by people who regularly tell us what we are and are not supposed to do and who seem to regard themselves as superior beings above the law and, in particular, above political criticism even though they are headed by a political appointee who should have the grace to accept responsibility for this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> The purported order was invalid because the delegation order predated the legislation and, therefore, could not have encompassed the legislation. If there had not been a delegation order or if the Minister rather than the Minister of State had made the order, the problem would not have arisen.  While delegation orders may be seen as desirable politically, they frequently give rise to legal problems and this is certainly an example of one such problem.</P>
    <P>The delegation order was described in the purported order and in the legislation as Statutory Instrument No. 199 of 1995.  If the date of the order was given rather than its statutory instrument number, which is not very enlightening to anybody inside or outside this House, then this problem would have been avoided because any Member of this House would have spotted it, but it is impossible for me or anybody else to know the date of an order if one is simply going by its statutory instrument number because the number of statutory instruments varies greatly from year to year.</P>
    <P>To move on to some of the more substantive matters which arise under the purported order and the order which this Bill now proposes to validate, I see that the commissioner was appointed on 26 February 1996, that is over 11 months ago, and I must express disappointment at how relatively little has happened since that date.  When the Minister introduced the original legislation and made the original order, he led us to believe that things would happen very quickly but there seem to have been very few changes.  In particular, the whole management structure of that board was supposed to be revamped. Nothing appears to have happened.  The only event which has taken place which is relevant to all of this is that two officials of the board have been returned for trial on charges of corruption and I understand the trial has been transferred at their request from Waterford Circuit Court to the Dublin Circuit Court, with the result that the trial will presumably be delayed.</P>
    <P>Apart from that there have been no changes at management level.  It was recognised over a year ago in 1995 in the report by Mr. Rochford that it was desirable that changes be made expeditiously.  For that reason it was desirable that an order be made establishing the commission. The purported order was invalidly made but we did not know until recently that it was invalid.  The commissioner was acting all along until January of this year in the belief that his powers were valid.  The Minister of State should explain why so little has happened in a period of 11 months.</P>
    <P>There has, of course, been at least one major development so far as salmon and the protection of inland fisheries are concerned, that was the making of an order within the past few days on 24 January.  I hope that one was valid, although in a sense I would not mind if it was not because it legalises for the first time, or certainly the first time for a very long time, the use of monofilament <Col N="1635" /> netting in drift net fishery and it increases the maximum depth of mesh permitted from 30 to 45 meshes deep.  That is a most retrograde step. I am concerned for the preservation of wild salmon in Ireland.  It is one of the most valuable national assets in every sense, not just the financial sense.  To legalise monofilament netting and increase the depth of the net by 50 per cent &mdash; that seems to be the purpose of moving it from 30 to 45 meshes deep &mdash; seems to be quite retrograde and I thoroughly and fundamentally disagree with it.  The other matters which are included in the Minister's order are matters of detail to a great extent and involve shifting a few dates, times and such like around.  The real crime is committed by the use of these monofilament nets and I did not think I would see the day when that equipment would be legalised.  It is absolutely fatal to the survival of wild salmon and, therefore, in time to the survival of salmon as a species and it is deeply regrettable that this should have happened.</P>
    <P>We are moving in the opposite direction to most European countries.  Drift netting of all kinds is forbidden in many countries in order to try to conserve salmon and allow the species to regenerate itself.  I cannot understand why Ireland has moved in this way and I am surprised that there has not been wider outcry.  I know this is based on a report which was published some time ago but I could not see any merit in it and I am surprised that the Minister has followed its recommendations in this respect.  When something like this can happen, it makes one wonder whether revalidating subsequently the actions of the Southern Regional Fisheries Commission makes any difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State proposes to ask the House to insert an indemnification clause in section 5 of the original Act.  I presume that the commissioner asked for that and I am not surprised, given that he was allowed to operate for nearly 11 months without legal powers.  In one way it is surprising that it was not there beforehand. On the other hand, it draws a very clear distinction between the commission and this fisheries board or any other fisheries board because they do not have indemnification.  Will they now look for indemnification because they operate on the same legal basis as the commission?</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill proports to say that all prosecutions brought before the commencement of this Act by or in the name or on the complaint of the commission shall be deemed to have been brought in the name of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.  Subsection (2) goes on to say the opposite, that all prosecutions brought in the name of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board shall be deemed to have been brought by or may be continued as if they had been brought in the name of or on the complaint of the commission. I do not understand how each one substitutes the other name.  Perhaps there is some explanation for it that escapes me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> I understand that in the past week in Waterford a number of prosecutions were dismissed because they were brought by the commission which, by then, had been found not to validly exist.  Does this affect the more important and fundamental prosecutions in train relating to corruption within the board and its officials?  Will those prosecutions fail because of this mistake made by the Attorney General?  I hope not because while it took ten years for something to happen in relation to the activities taking place in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board, at long last something has happened.  Now we find that everything that happened was, apparently, invalid.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that people might be sceptical of this officialdom at all levels within the Department of the Marine and in the Central Fisheries Board which seemed to become paralysed when it came to dealing with what was going on in the Southern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
    <P>I said before that the chairman of that board in December 1987 wrote an official letter to the then Minister pointing out that corrupt practices were taking place and asking him and the Department to do something about it.  They never even bothered to reply.  They ignored it, turned a blind eye to it, as is so frequently the case, unfortunately, where certain types of activity take place here. This gives rise to the belief that it is fair game for people to carry on in a certain way.  The letter was ignored for ten years.  I gave credit to the Minister of State when we debated the Bill for being prepared to do something about it.  It is a pity that what he tried to do was invalid and useless and we are here tonight to try to retrospectively validate it in the hope that something will come of it.</P>
    <P>I referred before to the injustice that has been suffered and continues to be suffered by one individual who was employed by the board and who, technically, is still employed by this board.  He did the unforgivable in Irish life &mdash; he blew the whistle.  He drew attention to the corruption that was taking place and has paid a very severe penalty. First, the man is crippled for life having been attacked by convicted criminals in the course of doing his duty.  He suffers severe spasms of pain from time to time and is unable to work.  He is in his late forties and faces a future in which he will never work again.  What is the reward the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and/or the commission and/or the Department and the central board gave that man?  They gave him an income of £133 per week.  That sum is made up of £103 which is paid to him by the Department of Social Welfare for disability benefit.  He is forced to go to the post office in his local town every week with that cheque and cash it and from there proceed to the office of the Southern Regional Fisheries Board and hand over the £103 in cash. When it has got the cash it will send him a cheque the following week for £133; in other words its contribution is £30 to a man who was so severely <Col N="1637" /> injured in the course of his duties and in the course of trying to enforce the fisheries Acts.</P>
    <P>Let us contrast that with two individuals who have not just been charged but returned for trial for alleged corruption in the course of their duties with this board.  The board pays them their wages in full every week and allows them retain various perks.  I call that gross injustice.  I ask the Minister of State to examine the way in which this man has been treated and contrast it with the way in which certain others have been treated and to tell the House whether he stands over the treatment of this man whose only crime, in the eyes of many people here, is that he committed the unforgivable, he blew the whistle.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder there are so few whistle blowers here when this is the treatment meted out to them by officialdom?  On top of the miserly £30 per week he is given by the board, he has been unable to get any recompense from an insurance policy which the board claimed it had for the purpose of reimbursing employees who lost their income.  The company concerned has turned him down and will pay him nothing.  This is a grave injustice.</P>
    <P>I have enough regard for the Minister of State to believe he does not want to stand over this. The only way he can desist from standing over it is to put a stop to it and to change it.  He has power to do that.  If somebody is suspended for good reason from their duties, how is it they can be paid in full while a person who is unable to carry out his duties because of severe injuries inflicted on him, in the course of carrying out those duties, should be penalised and get only £30 per week from a publicly funded body?  That is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister or his Department for this mess but the Attorney General and his office.  It should be clearly recognised that they made a silly error that should not and need not have happened.  It was an elementary error, not some complicated legal conundrum where one had to make a judgment subjectively and where one might have been right or wrong &mdash; it was a purely fundamental error that a Minister of State, to whom powers had not been delegated, purported through an order to exercise those powers which he did not have.  This elementary error should not have happened.  Given that it has happened the House should allow the rectifying legislation to go through.</P>
    <P>There are many spheres of activity here crying out for legislation.  I could name half a dozen or perhaps a dozen that have been waiting years for the production of a Bill.  This Bill, consisting of nine sections, was produced in a week because officialdom in the Attorney General's office made a mistake and wanted to rectify it as quickly and as quietly as possible.  I wish they would display the same anxiety in producing legislation on other matters that are a great deal more important than this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This seems to be much ado about very little.  It is a technical mistake and reflects in no manner on the Minister of State who has been the best Minister responsible for fisheries in my 20 years here.  It is unfortunate that the delegation of functions order was not in place when the original legislation was brought before the House.  The Minister of State assured us that anything which transpired during the past 11 months will not be invalid as a result of this slip-up in the Attorney General's office or the Department of the Marine.  The mistake probably originated in the Department of the Marine and was spotted by the Attorney General.  One might say the Attorney General should have identified the problem at the outset but the major fault lies with the Department of the Marine.  It is very difficult to ascertain which is to blame, but it is purely a technical matter.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the points made by Deputy O'Malley about the legislation of a certain amount of monofilament net.  The restrictions on the use of such nets has meant the virtual extinction of inshore fishermen.  I would like Deputy O'Malley to face some of the coastal communities in my constituency and explain to them why they should go hungry because they do not have the equipment to catch salmon.  It is disgraceful that for the past 20 years, 70 and 80 feet trawlers which do not have a licence to fish have been using monofilament net to catch tens of thousands of salmon while inshore fishermen cannot do so.  This is an indictment of previous Governments and Ministers for Justice and Fisheries. This is the issue about which we should be concerned.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in the regulations to allow the use of a limited amount of monofilament net by inshore fishermen inside the six mile limit.  This is a correct decision and should have been introduced years ago.  I would like Deputy O'Malley to visit the village of Ardmore in west Waterford where 40 fishermen who were employed gainfully during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s were driven off the seas because they could not catch salmon using nylon net, the only legalised netting allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One cannot survive in the open sea in small open boats without the right type of gear.  These fishermen did not have the right gear and were driven off the sea.  If they were prepared to pay bribes to certain individuals they could have continued to fish.  I agree with Deputy O'Malley that it is long past the time when people who took bribes were brought to book.  Seven or eight years ago I wrote to the authorities about this matter but nothing was done.  The problem was not outlined to me initially by the official to whom Deputy O'Malley referred.  He has done tremendous work and shown tremendous bravery and courage in speaking out, but several years prior to his blowing the whistle another fisheries officer told me what was happening.  I wrote to the relevant authorities &mdash; the Minister for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda <Col N="1639" /> Commissioner &mdash; but nothing was done and the alleged taking of bribes and other illegal activities continued.  Those people in high places who were informed of the activities taking place should be called to account for not taking action.  That is where the fault lies to a significant degree.</P>
    <P>We all know that the bigger the crime the more likely one is to get away scot-free.  People caught driving over the speed limit for a few miles or without a light on a bicycle are prosecuted and convicted, while those who commit horrendous crimes are most likely to get away with it.  Who has ever seen a big businessman, a wealthy person or a person of stature sent to prison?  This bugs the ordinary person on the street, particularly fishermen who were hounded, prosecuted and imprisoned for trying to make a living.  Some of these fishermen were sent to prison on the basis of very tenuous evidence, as may be shown by subsequent events in the courts.  This was a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I give a qualified welcome to the regulations because the Minister has, to use a nautical expression, rowed back from what was proposed initially.  I hope we get an opportunity to debate the regulations in more detail during the coming weeks.  It was proposed to allow the use of a limited amount of monofilament net during June, July and August.  However, it will now not be permitted in August.  I would like the Minister to explain the reasons for this.  During the fishery year 1995-96 fishermen could fish for 2,600 hours but they will only be able to fish for 600 hours if fishing in August is not permitted.  One cannot expect fishermen to accept a reduction of more than 75 per cent in their fishing capacity.  I ask the Minister to include August, otherwise there will be major problems.  We could convince fishermen to remain law-abiding if they were allowed to use monofilament net during June, July and August, but if not in August we will see a return to the old ways of law breaking and indiscipline, something none of us wish to see.  We want people to be given a fair chance to make a reasonable living.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the summons issued and the prosecutions taken during the past year. The Minister said these prosecutions will be validated. However, we have heard that before and it has not always transpired.  The prosecutions taken while the commission was not properly constituted could be open to a High Court challenge.  I would like the Minister to be explicit on that point.  The commissioner has worked well and most people would say the present arrangement is more satisfactory than the one which pertained prior to his appointment, however tenuous that might have been.  For example, there is peace on the high seas off the south east and south coast and there is not the same level of confrontation as previously.  Will the Minister refer to the task force report on the conservation of wild salmon? As that report has far reaching consequences for many people, the sooner the better its terms are <Col N="1640" /> implemented.  I accept the Minister has implemented some of its recommendations, but some months ago he promised that prior to their implementation he would allow a debate on the matter.  I hold the Minister to that commitment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with this legislation.  A mistake was made and there is no reason for a ballyhoo about it.  I hope this legislation will rectify the mistake and that there will be no far reaching consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill and commend the Minister on approaching the matter in an expeditious manner and on consulting legal advisers and the Whips.  The support for this measure reflects the need for the initial legislation to appoint a commission to deal with the particular problems in the Southern Fisheries Board.  Deputy Deasy raised some of those unbelievable problems on many occasions.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Smith stated this must be an embarrassment for the Government and not for the Minister as such, the need for the commission must have been a major embarrassment for Fianna Fáil, particularly having regard to the personages currently before the courts because of misdeeds over many years.  Even though those misdeeds were brought to the attention of people in high authority, no action was taken.  It was embarrassing to discover that legislation was necessary to appoint a commission.  In hindsight I am sure we should have been more vigilant.  Pinning blame is easy to do.  People who do not make mistakes rarely do anything.  It is important that the error is being rectified.</P>
      <P>I also support Deputy Deasy's views on the new regulations published by the Minister, whom I compliment on the consultation he painstakingly initiated with each fishery board in an effort to reach a consensus about what needs to be done to preserve our salmon stocks, particularly our wild salmon stocks.  Because of the competing interests in this area, it is virtually impossible to reach agreement on what should be done and where facilities should be provided.  There has been much controversy about monofilament and so on, but once the problem is controlled ports such as Ardmore could be brought back to life. The livelihoods of many fishing families have been gradually eroded because of regulations which were impossible to adhere to.  Unless they bribed officials, fishermen ran the risk of being arrested or having their gear impounded.  They risked their livelihoods trying to survive under difficult regulations, but the Minister has gone some way towards addressing that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also pleased that as a result of representations the Minister has addressed the question of snap-net fishermen.  As the management plan for the River Slaney was successful he is prepared, in consultation with the boards, to introduce a similar plan for the River Suir.  I am familiar with the traditions of snap-net fishermen in Carrick-on-Suir who provide the only source of income for many families in the area.  I am pleased the Minister <Col N="1641" /> identified their special needs, particularly in regard to changing tides and the restriction on the number of hours and days they can fish.  The needs of snap-net fishermen in Carrick-on-Suir are different from those in Mooncoin.  I am pleased the Minister is prepared to examine the specific needs of those fishermen in an overall plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister has addressed many of the problems that have lain under water for many years. While it is difficult to meet all the needs of fishermen, he has gone some way towards addressing their needs.  We are all aware of the importance of fishing to our tourism industry.  Wild salmon can only breed in the wild.  They spawn in our mountain rivers and streams and then go back to sea, a wonderful evolution of nature.  The regulations introduced by the Minister and this legislation will ensure that responsible people are in control of our fisheries boards.  I hope those charged with fraud, bribery and corruption will get their due comeuppance in court.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the forthright manner in which he tackled this problem.  He is the first Minister to grasp the nettle and give a clear direction on how the salmon fishing industry can survive.  Successive Ministers failed hopelessly to tackle the problem. It could be described as &ldquo;Nero fiddled while Rome burned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley attacked the drift-net salmon fishermen.  I thought he understood the position more thoroughly.  Does Deputy O'Malley think that the hundreds of fishermen trying to eke out a livelihood can be swept aside?  Everyone has a right to earn a living.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the forthright way he has tackled the problem and legalised monofilament nets for draft net fishing. Successive Ministers for the Marine have turned a blind eye to this problem which was at the root of the salmon fishing industry's troubles.  Successive Governments had no difficulty collecting VAT from unfortunate fishermen for monofilament nets at the point of entry into the country. However, it was illegal to use the nets and the fishermen were hounded like criminals by the Navy.  The Minister of State has now resolved the problem.</P>
      <P>He has reduced the fishing week to four days and he has also reduced the volume of the nets that can be used.  The fishermen are delighted with the Minister of State's forthright vision for the industry.  He is ensuring that fishermen can work without being hounded by the fishery protection vessels.  Those vessels should patrol the sea areas in which factory ships are taking up large amounts of our salmon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salmon hatched in Irish rivers swim to <Col N="1642" /> Greenland where they feed before returning to their native rivers.  Alas, the journey to Greenland is long and they face many difficulties.  Therein lies the threat to the extension of our salmon fishing, not from the few salmon caught by small operators with boats no bigger than 24 feet who are only trying to make a just living.  I am glad the Minister of State has had the courage to tackle the problem &mdash; a courage which no Minister over the past 15 years has shown.</P>
    <P>I sought to have this anomaly sorted out once and for all on many occasions in the past.  The Minister of State consulted with the salmon review group which reported to him and set out the measures to be adopted to protect the salmon stocks.  The legalisation of monofilament nets will diffuse a serious situation that had arisen which put people trying to protect their livelihoods at loggerheads with the authorities.  It is all very well for the well-heeled in society to attempt to remove the fishermen's opportunity to earn a living and to put them on the dole.  The parties in this House who would espouse such a policy should face the facts.  The Minister of State has made a realistic decision.  The fishermen are ready to co-operate to ensure the industry will prosper.</P>
    <P>There is a minor amendment I would like the Minister of State to consider with regard to the date of the closure of the season.  Three months have been taken off the start of the season but it has not been extended.  If the Minister could extend the season to the end of August the Bill would be perfect.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on the action he has taken.  It was necessary to give a legal basis to the commissioner's operations and I wish Mr. Keating well with his task in the future.  There were protracted problems in the southern fisheries region which were aired vociferously in this House on many occasions.  I am glad the Minister of State has taken the necessary action, appointed a commissioner and given him the necessary legal backing.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency on the east coast and salmon fishing in that area is virtually extinct because very few salmon make it as far as that. Draft net salmon fishing was a valuable source of employment in Wicklow in the past.  If the Minister of State's conservation measures are successful we hope to see a revival of salmon fishing in the Wicklow area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a particular problem with the change in the date of the start of the season to 1 June for the Wicklow coastal area.  A seaweed, locally known as wrack, appears in the area in early June each year.  It makes salmon fishing, draft fishing in particular, virtually impossible during June, July and August.  I ask the Minister of State to contact the fishery authorities in the area and they will supply him with the details of the problem that will arise if the limits on the season are introduced.  It is accepted that there must be <Col N="1643" /> reductions in the fishing effort, in the licences and the days of the week on which fishing is allowed.</P>
    <P>There is a problem on the east coast, particularly the coast of County Wicklow, in respect of draft salmon fishermen.  I am aware that the same problem exists in the Minister of State's constituency because of the efforts of two fisheries boards north and south of Wicklow Head.  Perhaps he will give some attention, through the Fishery Board, to the problems that will arise from the new conservation measure to shorten fishing efforts from 1 June.  I met the fishermen involved who are willing to speak to the Minister of State or his officials in connection with this problem. I would like every effort to be made to meet a reasonable request that consideration be given to changing the date, which is causing problems to fishermen in my area.  I thank the Minister of State for his co-operation.  He has visited the Wicklow constituency on several occasions and, in each instance, there have been positive results.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing his valuable time.  Like previous speakers, I will refer to the most recent communication we received from his Department in connection with the conservation of wild salmon.  People living in the constituency I represent in County Donegal are aware of the value of wild salmon and the necessity to conserve the species.</P>
      <P>I entered this House 15 years ago and Deputy Deasy, from his time as Minister, will remember the difficulties experienced each summer, during the months of June and July, regarding wild salmon fishing and drift net fishing.  The kernel of the problem was that fishermen were not expected to use monofilament gear which was illegal for many years.  However, I fear that was more honoured in the breach than the observance. There were running battles each summer between fishery protection vessels and those legally charged with protecting wild salmon and fishermen. This led to awful pressure being exerted on public representatives and Deputies such as myself and others living on the west coast.  Ministers came and went and reports were initiated and published.  The salmon review group was established in 1986 or 1987 by the then Minister for Fisheries, Mr. Paddy O'Toole, and its report was published and has languished in the Department ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, who is charged with responsibility for wild salmon fishing, grasped the nettle in a serious and meaningful way on assuming office.  He established a committee which issued recommendations in its balanced and responsible report.  It is true that not everyone got what they wanted and people were obliged to compromise.  However, that is what occurs when there are competing interests.  If a <Col N="1644" /> solution, which will be acceptable to everyone, is to be reached, there is a necessity for compromise on all sides.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State for taking the initiative and publishing the report.  He travelled to each county where there is an interest in salmon fishing, met the people involved and discussed the report with them, took account of their comments on the recommendations, returned to Dublin fully informed, kept in touch with the various interests in the interim and he has now submitted his regulations.  I congratulate the Minister of State for engaging in such a widescale consultation process.  There is a hackneyed phrase which refers to people &ldquo;taking the gun out of Irish politics&rdquo;.  In my opinion, the Minister of State has succeeded in taking the aggravation out of wild salmon drift net fishing.  I look forward to the coming season which will prove my theory.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues to which I will now refer.  For example, the fishing week has been shortened from five days to four.  The hours in which it is legal to fish have also been curtailed to 21 hours, from 4 a.m. to 9 p.m.  That is quite reasonable.  There are a number of measures which will affect fishermen working off the coast of County Donegal.  These people were given their licences at the most recent meeting of the fisheries board.  The fishing limit has been reduced from 12 to six miles, which will cause some difficulties.  The fishing week for estuary fishermen, or draft net fishermen, is also being reduced from five days to four.  These people do not have the same liberty, freedom or scope as drift net fishermen who operate six miles off the coast and they are concerned at the reduction.  I do not know whether the Minister of State can change this matter but I ask him to consider it.</P>
    <P>There was a great demand for drift net fishing licences this year.  A man living in my constituency has been a licensed fisherman for 35 years but he was deprived of a licence this year because he submitted his application on a Monday morning instead of the previous Saturday evening.  It is very harsh that a board should act in such a manner and deprive a genuine fisherman of his licence because he was a day or two late in applying. He could have submitted the application on the Saturday but was not aware he could do so. He delivered the application at 9 a.m. on the following Monday, having hired a car to travel 60 miles from his home to Ballyshannon, but he did not obtain a licence because it was too late.  It is a pity that fishery boards act in such a harsh way. I do not believe the Minister of State intended the regulations to be interpreted in that way.  It is against the spirit of the regulations that a genuine fisherman should be deprived of his licence because of a simple oversight.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State who grasped this nettle.  Other people living on the western seaboard talked about what they could do and what should or should not be done but they did nothing.  The Minister of State, who represents a constituency on the east coast, has proposed <Col N="1645" /> a solution and engaged in a wide consultation process.  My party appreciates his actions. There will be growing pains and initial difficulties but I am sure everyone will become used to the new regulations.  In the past, efforts were made to legalise monofilament fishing nets but to no avail. However, the Minister of State has been successful in doing so and, while there is a price to be paid, we know where we stand.  Fishermen can now use the most modern equipment available with limitations and restrictions.  However, if he can find a solution to this problem, the Minister of State will be known as &ldquo;Solomon&rdquo; in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their co-operation and their support for the Bill.  In particular, I thank Opposition spokespersons for agreeing to take the Bill this evening.  A mistake was made regarding the order which was signed last year.  I regret that mistake and I wish I did not have to come before the House to seek approval for legislation to correct it.  It does not help matters to apportion blame for that mistake. I take responsibility for it.  I reject the criticisms of the Attorney General and the Attorney General's office.  The mistake was identified in that office and was brought to our attention immediately. We acted to correct it by introducing legislation to put the commission back on side.  It is much better that the problem is dealt with in that way than be discovered at a later stage in the courts or elsewhere.  I am sure Members will be aware of many cases where a flaw in legislation was discovered in the courts, causing a subsequent problem.  The problem in this case was identified in the Attorney General's office and appropriate action is being taken to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Malley on the functioning of the commission.  The commission, in the person of Mr. Séamus Keating, has been working satisfactorily in the Southern Fisheries Board.  The original Act provided that the commission would be appointed for a period of up to two years.  It has not yet completed its work.  I am confident Mr. Keating will be able to complete his work, that the management difficulties identified by Mr. Rochford and signalled by him in his report will be addressed by the commission and that the matters which are a cause of concern to Members on all sides of the House will be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to refer to matters which are before the court.  On the case of the individual referred to by Deputy O'Malley, the information he put before the House is not entirely factual.  I will not go into detail on the methods of payment, concessions and so on made to the individual concerned <Col N="1646" /> other than to say the individual has received payments in excess of those to which there was a strict entitlement under the existing schemes that apply to the individual.  The schemes concerned are under negotiation at present and I hope a new scheme will be introduced which will provide for a more generous arrangement for officers who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the new management arrangements with regard to the salmon fishery generally.  The report of the salmon task force, which I established in October 1995 and which reported to me last year, has been referred to the appropriate committee of the House.  I look forward to discussing that report in greater detail at that committee.  The area of salmon management is a very difficult one.  As Members have stated, there are many competing and conflicting interests in regard to the salmon fishery.  What concerns me about the wild salmon fishery is that stocks of wild salmon have been continuously in decline for the past three decades. When the salmon review group reported ten years ago it pointed out that salmon stocks were about half those of the early 1960s and when the salmon task force reported to me last year it pointed out that stocks were about half that again.  There is a necessity to address the problem of declining stocks and to put in place a management regime for wild salmon stocks which is pragmatic and will work and command the support and compliance of the broad spectrum of interests in the salmon fishery.</P>
    <P>The regulations I have introduced in recent weeks are not a matter of tampering with days, as Deputy O'Malley said.  They are significant in that they reduce the area of sea in which drift net fishing can take place from the 12 mile limit to six miles, reduce the number of days from five to four, confine fishing to daylight hours, set the date for the start of the drift net fishing season at 1 June and legalise the use of monofilament net, which has been banned for the past 30 years during which time salmon stocks continued to decline.  As the salmon task force reported to me and as the salmon review group reported ten years ago, monofilament net was in widespread use.  It was concluded that a much better way to address the conservation of our salmon would be to put the emphasis on the fishing effort rather than the type of gear used.  Because most people used monofilament net the minute they put their foot in a boat they were, by definition, fishing illegally.  It would be much better to have a culture of compliance in our salmon fishery than widespread non-compliance with the regulations.</P>
    <P>The regulations will be enforced.  A number of new patrol vessels have been put in the water in the past two years and a national fishery protection co-ordinator has been appointed.  This is the first phase of a two-phase move on salmon management.  The second phase will be the introduction of a quota system and a catchment management system, which will address the difficulties with the snap net fishery, raised by Deputy <Col N="1647" /> Ferris, and the draft net fishery, raised by Deputy Kavanagh, whereby the problems which apply in local areas or particular estuaries may be dealt with at local level.  There is a very good model for such catchment management in the Slaney, and under the regulations the Slaney plan will continue to operate in that area.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to the point about prosecutions. Section 8 provides that prosecutions brought by the commission before the commencement of the legislation will be deemed to have been brought by the board and prosecutions brought but not concluded by the board before the commencement of the legislation may be continued after the commencement of the legislation as if they had been brought by the commission. The invalidation of the purported order means that the commission had no authority to bring prosecutions in respect of fisheries offences.  Until such time as this legislation is enacted, therefore, any new prosecutions will have to be taken in the name of the board and prosecutions taken by the commission and due to be concluded before the commencement of the legislation cannot be proceeded with in the name of the commission until such commencement.  The effect of this legislation will be to validate the prosecutions which are being taken.  From memory, about four prosecutions were concluded during the lifetime of the commission and about 40 prosecutions are under consideration.  Those prosecutions are validated under section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who contributed for their support for the legislation and their general welcome for the new approach we are adopting to salmon management.  I thank in particular the Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation in the timetabling of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for attending to deal with this important and urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>E-coli is a serious life threatening infection.  As we know, 19 people in Scotland died from contracting the particularly virulent organism bacterium E-coli 0157.  In recent days a three yearold child in Dublin died from an illness caused by complications of that infection.  I raise this matter <Col N="1648" /> to highlight this extremely worrying development. I ask the Minister of State if contact has been made with the Scottish health authorities to learn from their harrowing experience of 19 people who died from that infection during the course of a number of weeks resulting in tremendous distress to the families concerned.</P>
    <P>Because there is interaction between the peoples of the two islands in regard to the import and export of food, the Department of Health here and in the UK and the health authorities should seek to benefit from any experience or expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the current outbreak of the infection here is managed optimally in terms of early identification and corrective action as a matter of urgency.  Regarding any future outbreaks, it goes without saying that all food outlets and personnel involved in the food industry and GPs working in the area should be notified of the problem and any experience gained from Scotland should be put at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The general public should be informed immediately about the handling of food, maintenance of standards of hygiene, quality control systems and heat treatment of products, such as milk which will kill this bacteria.  There will be no point in saying in a few weeks' time that we should have handled the matter more efficiently with a greater degree of urgency.  That should be done now.  I look forward to the Minister of State outlining what his Department is doing about the matter and how it is reacting to this tragedy in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Joe Walsh and other Deputies will join with me in extending sympathy to the family of the young child who died over the weekend as a result of E-coli infection.</P>
      <P>E-coli is a bacterium widely distributed in nature and is present in large numbers in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals.  Many strains are not harmful.  However, several strains are very harmful in humans as they can cause internal damage.  One such harmful strain is E-coli 0157.  Surveys have shown that E-coli 0157 lives in the intestines of healthy animals and can contaminate meat during slaughter.  When meat is minced, the mincing process, in particular, can transfer the harmful bacteria into the interior of the finished meat product.</P>
      <P>The symptoms of E-coli infection include acute diarrhoea, vomiting and fever.  In about 10 per cent of such infections, a further condition called haemolytic uraemic syndrome, HUS, develops. HUS is characterised by kidney failure and fatalities are associated with about one-tenth of HUS cases.  Most cases of E-coli infection can be resolved with simple measures including home nursing, plenty of fluids, a light diet and rest.  The further condition of HUS requires hospital treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several years now, my Department has recognised the potentially serious implications of <Col N="1649" /> E-coli infection and has taken steps to increase awareness of it.  A report on the matter by the Food Safety Advisory Committee was circulated to all health boards in October 1994 with an instruction that it should be brought to the attention of all officers engaged in food control operations.</P>
    <P>A reminder to this effect was issued in July 1995.  A further reminder issued in December 1996, this time to all directors of public health in the health boards.  The directors were asked to remind doctors and laboratories to be particularly vigilant in reporting cases of food poisoning, with a view to identifying any possible cases of the E-coli infection.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981-96 list all the diseases and categories of diseases which are notifiable.  The E-coli 0157 infection is already included in the category, &ldquo;Food Poisoning (bacterial other than salmonella)&rdquo;.  This means that all cases of the infection in Ireland must be brought to the attention of the relevant health board, which is then required to notify my Department.  To date, all cases of the E-coli infection in Ireland have been sporadic.  There have not been epidemics here as have occurred in other countries, most notably in Scotland on several occasions in recent years.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless it is imperative that the medical profession, the public, and all persons engaged in food preparation are aware of E-coli and of the simple measures by which infection can be prevented.  As only very small numbers of the E-coli bacteria are necessary to cause illness, it is important that the proper cooking and general good food hygiene practices are observed.  In particular, I would stress the following precautions: minced meat and similar products should be thoroughly cooked until the juices run clear, and there are no pink areas on the inside of the meat product; raw fruit and vegetables should be washed; as unpasteurised milk and its products are potential sources of infection, as Deputy Walsh pointed out, vulnerable groups such as children or those with poor immunity should avoid these products in favour of pasteurised milk products; and, as with many other forms of food poisoning, the observance of general personal hygiene and good food hygiene practice can prevent and control instances of infection.</P>
    <P>This advice corresponds with that provided to the Minister recently by the Food Safety Advisory Board on steps to increase awareness of E-coli infection and on the means of preventing and controlling it.</P>
    <P>In relation to the recent case of E-coli infection, I understand the Eastern Health Board is currently checking for other instances of infection in persons who were in contact with the child, but that the results of initial investigations are all negative.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies of my strong commitment to the question of food safety.  Deputies are aware of the Government's plans to establish a new body <Col N="1650" /> dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.  My Department is giving priority to the preparation of the necessary legislation but, meanwhile, the interim Food Safety Board of Ireland is proceeding with putting in place the necessary structures and administrative systems to ensure the statutory board will be able to make a strong and immediate impact in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity of raising this important matter on the Adjournment.  St. Michan's, near the Four Courts in Dublin, is an important church.  As well as being a place of worship, it is also a significant historical site and major tourist attraction.  It is threatened with closure unless essential works are carried out to the ceiling which, I understand, is collapsing.  This disaster follows on an attack by vandals six months ago when the crypt and the bodies within it were desecrated.</P>
      <P>St. Michan's should be given some assistance to ensure it remains open.  It would be a huge loss to the heritage of Dublin if the building had to close.  I call on the Minister to step in and help fund the restoration, the cost of which has been estimated at around £270,000.  He should produce a joint initiative for St. Michan's with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny.  This is justified given its significance.</P>
      <P>The church was first dedicated in May 1095.  It was rebuilt around 1685 when the tower and its famous vault may have been added.  It has exceptional wood carvings and has been associated with many of the great events in Irish history.  As I am sure the Minister is well aware, the composer Handel is associated with it as is Robert Emmet, Edmund Burke who was baptised there and Oliver Bond who is buried in the churchyard while Parnell's funeral is believed to have left from it for Glasnevin.  The Shears brothers are buried in the vault.  That should be of particular significance with the 1798 bicentenary celebrations due to take place next year.</P>
      <P>Given its proximity to the Four Courts, the church has strong links with the legal profession and has seats known as Judges Pews.  It is one of the most popular tourist sites in Dublin and, with its unique vaults, interest will continue to grow. For this reason I ask the Minister, together with his colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, to assist with the restoration of this exceedingly important church.  I hope his reply will be positive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this matter.  As she said, St. Michan's Church is one of Dublin's oldest and most popular sites which each year attracts thousands of people from all over the world to its famous vault and other historical artefacts.  I am grateful to her <Col N="1651" /> for drawing our attention to some of the more important personages, on both sides of the dock, associated with it.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the matter in detail, I express the absolute disgust I felt on hearing of the damage caused to this fine church when vandals set fire to the vault some months ago.  It is my hope that the perpetrators of this vile crime will be brought to justice in the near future.</P>
      <P>An application has recently been submitted to me in respect of renovation works to the church to include re-slating of the roof, replacement of the ceiling in the main church and repair and replacement of the floors in the church's tower. This application was submitted under phase II of the cultural development incentives scheme which I am administering under the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9.  I am glad, therefore, to have this opportunity to outline the position not only with regard to the St. Michan's Church project but with regard to all applications submitted to me under this phase of the scheme.  In the spirit in which the Deputy has brought this matter to my notice, I will look at the issue of possible co-operation with my ministerial colleague.  I will ask him to review the issue of joint assistance.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that the Heritage Council recently received a request for financial assistance for renovation works to St. Michan's and in response informed the applicants that specific heritage grant schemes are being formulated with a view to their launch in March.  It is my understanding that the council also advised that if an application for grant assistance in respect of St. Michan's is received at that time, it will be considered together with any other applications received.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Heritage Council is independent in its assessment of grant applications and the award of grants.</P>
      <P>With regard to the application for funding submitted to me, the Deputy will be aware that the cultural development incentives scheme is designed primarily to assist the four main categories of the visual and performing arts &mdash; art centres, museums, theatres and galleries.  During 1996, I approved 25 projects for funding under phase I of the scheme.  On 15 November, I invited applications for phase II of the scheme.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was 10 January by which time a total of over 140 completed applications seeking grant assistance in excess of £60 million, including that in respect of the St. Michan's Church project, had been lodged with my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate in light of the foregoing that some difficult decisions will have to be made by me with regard to projects to which funding will be offered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications lodged with my Department will be the subject of a detailed assessment process. As with the first phase of the scheme, I have engaged the expertise of a number of State agencies to assist in this process.  I have asked An Chomhairle Ealaíon to carry out detailed artistic <Col N="1652" /> examinations of applications for projects such as art centres, galleries, theatres etc.  The Heritage Council will carry out a similar exercise in respect of museums and other heritage-type projects, including the St. Michan's Church project.  This process is under way but given the quantity and quality of applications I have received I do not expect it to be completed until late March-early April.</P>
    <P>Once the assessment process I have outlined is complete all applications will be considered in detail by the advisory committee for the scheme. The brief of the advisory committee is, following consideration by it of all the assessments completed by An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Heritage Council, to make recommendations to me on the projects it feels merit funding.  As with the first phase of the scheme, the advisory committee will consist of representatives of my Department who will chair the committee, the Department of Tourism and Trade, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the Heritage Council, the County and City Managers' Association and the general Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>In relation to the St. Michan's Church project, while I am aware that this project and many of the other projects submitted to me are in a position to commence work should an offer of funding be made &mdash; this is an important point &mdash; the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot make a decision on individual applications in isolation from the remainder.  All applications, however, submitted to me under phase II of the cultural development incentives scheme will be receiving urgent attention in coming weeks and I will announce details of my decision on successful projects as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's views on the importance of St. Michan's and will indulge in conversations with ministerial colleagues or other agencies which might be of assistance to a project about which there is general public concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>On 12 December the Minister for Education gave a commitment which was widely welcomed that the Dublin Institute of Technology would be granted degree awarding powers. She stated:</P>
      <P>If, in the future, movement to university status enhances the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology, I am pleased that section 9 of the Universities Bill provides an appropriate mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this which is in contrast with the statement in <i>The Irish Times</i> by the institute's staff where a spokesperson for the Dublin Institute of Technology Academic Staff Association expressed outrage at reports that the Dublin Institute of Technology would not be able, after all, to award its own degrees in its own right. According to that report the Minister gave the Dublin Institute of Technology the powers to <Col N="1653" /> award its own degrees.  The Academic Staff Association's statement followed the recommendation from the National Certification Authority that in future TEASTAS should approve the review and audit of Dublin Institute of Technology's degree awarding process.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can clarify the situation. If I received over 100 submissions from students and teachers associated with Dublin Institute of Technology, I am sure the Minister probably received thousands.  Will the Minister give effect to the statement of 12 December or is there a potential impediment?  Does the recommendation have conditions attached?  Will the Minister accept the Higher Education Authority review team report which specifically recommended that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be allowed proceed to the full potential and concept of university status?</P>
    <P>I do not mean university status in the way the Minister appears to have referred to it in a number of statements.  On Committee Stage of the Universities Bill, she said it saddened her that some people put so much store by the title of &ldquo;university&rdquo; while MIT, a world renowned organisation, does not have the word university attached.  This misses the point.  MIT is a university under its own charter of 1861 and operates under a framework which gives it an autonomy traditionally associated with universities.  To compare Dublin Institute of Technology with MIT is flattering but totally unrealistic since the latter has an endowment of $1.3 million and spends in excess of $300 million per annum on research.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can clarify the situation so there is no impediment to the Dublin Institute of Technology awarding degrees and that it is left to its own capable devices.  As the largest third level institution in the State, it is very capable and over the years has proven its capacity and ability. There is a compelling case for upgrading.  I met the Minister in my constituency during the summer recess and I know her recognition of the technical aspects of various subjects is important. There is an element of confusion that the request for university status is interlinked to the technological sector.  However, the university capability of the Dublin Institute of Technology in having the capacity to award degrees is of vital importance. I hope the Minister can clarify what appears to have muddied the distinction between the announcement of 12 December 1996 and the fact that it can be subject to review and scrutiny before the Dublin Institute of Technology can award degrees.</P>

      <P>The Dublin Institute of Technology is growing as a distinct and distinguished institution in its own right.  Building on its legislative base, put in place in 1993, it has made major strides with the active support of the Department of Education.  I congratulate the Dublin Institute of Technology on the progress it has made since 1992 in building a single integrated institute.  The Dublin Institute of <Col N="1654" /> Technology has a vital role in higher education in providing courses at certificate, diploma, degree and post-graduate levels.</P>
      <P>An international review team was established by the Higher Education Authority to recommend whether degree awarding powers should be given to the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The Higher Education Authority has received the report of the review team and has sent it to the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>The review group recommended that the Dublin Institute of Technology be granted authority to award its own degrees in respect of undergraduate and post-graduate courses, with effect from the academic year 1998-99; the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology be transferred from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority as soon as possible; the relevant authorities should consider whether the key features of the university legislation should be extended to the Dublin Institute of Technology and its legislation be amended in the light of such analysis; the system of quality assurance and quality improvement in the Dublin Institute of Technology should be subject to periodic review and the Dublin Institute of Technology should ensure that its organisational structures and processes are firmly in place and operating effectively.  The successful completion of the review group process on degree awarding status is another step in the history of the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated that I intend to make an order to confer degree awarding powers on the Dublin Institute of Technology from the 1998-99 academic year as recommended by the report of a review team.  The relevant order is subject to the provisions of the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992.  The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, published in April 1995, outlines Government policy for the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I recognise that the international review team has endorsed this policy that the funding and oversight of the Dublin Institute of Technology be transferred from the Department of Education to the Higher Education Authority. An implementation group will begin work shortly on the transfer of the regional technical college/DIT sector to the Higher Education Authority.  Amending legislation will also be necessary.  The institute is in the process of implementing a number of recommendations arising out of this review.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposal that the Dublin Institute of Technology should be considered in the context of the Universities Bill, I am sure the Deputy is aware that this issue has been the subject of detailed consideration by the Select Committee on Social Affairs and that a majority of the committee does not support the inclusion of the Dublin Institute of Technology in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 of the Universities Bill will provide a mechanism by which an institution can attain university status.  This is the first time that a formal <Col N="1655" /> mechanism by which an institution may become a university is being placed on a statutory basis.  If, in the future, moving to university status enhances the mission of the Dublin Institute of Technology, section 9 of the Universities Bill provides an appropriate mechanism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for discussion this evening and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>The fatal road accident which is the subject of this Adjournment Debate led to the death of a 29 year old truck driver on the Naas dual carriageway at 7 a.m. on Thursday last, 23 January. The young man had an impeccable record of safe driving, was driving within the speed limit, as testified by the tachograph record, and he was driving a vehicle adjudged to be in a perfectly roadworthy condition when the fatal accident occurred.</P>
      <P>All fatal road accidents are tragic but this was a particularly poignant case as the young man was due to get married in September.  I understand a three vehicle pile-up caused the fatal accident and that this was a direct result of a patch of black ice at the point of impact on the dual carriageway.  If this is proven to be the case, then the local authority for the area has a clear case to answer.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for the Environment is not here to speak either on their behalf or on behalf of the National Roads Authority.  It is unfortunate that matters which are the responsibility of either local authority or the National Roads Authority are not taken in this House; I wonder if we can devise a mechanism to allow that.  The National Roads Authority is funded by taxpayers' money and there must be democratic accountability for its activities.  Equally, local authorities are charged with the responsibility for gritting roads in their areas in icy conditions.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to answer two questions. First, was the patch of ice notified to the local authority in advance of the time the fatal accident occurred?  I have been told &mdash; although I cannot verify this &mdash; that a number of concerned motorists made telephone calls to that effect to the local authority from 5 a.m. onwards, and the accident occurred at 7 a.m.  Second, if the local authority received such calls, why was this section of the road not gritted as a matter of urgency?</P>
      <P>This was a serious accident resulting in a death and three people are still in hospital.  In addition, the city bound side of the dual carriageway was blocked to all traffic for five and a half hours, including the morning rush hour, and the south bound side was reduced to a single lane.  This horrific accident had major implications not just for those directly involved but also for motorists using that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the factors that led to this horrific accident must be fully established and the lessons learned <Col N="1656" /> must be heeded.  The Minister for the Environment must put in place a national policy of gritting roads with clear guidelines to be carried out uniformly by all local authorities.  We do not have long periods of icy conditions on our roads but when we do there is a clear obligation to carry out gritting to secure the safety of motorists.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to establish definitively the cause of this accident.  There is a clear obligation on him, through the local authorities and the National Roads Authority, to ensure that this type of accident which was avoidable will never happen again.</P>

On behalf of the Minister and on my own behalf I offer sincere sympathy and condolences to the family of the deceased in this tragic accident.  Also, we wish a full and speedy recovery to the injured drivers involved in the accident.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister cannot make any comment on this unfortunate accident, which happened only last week, as the Garda investigations are at an early stage.  The Minister wishes to assure the Deputy and this House that the circumstances of this accident are being fully investigated by the Garda.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that she is precluded from making any statement as to the causes of the accident.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that traffic law enforcement is a top priority for the Garda which now employs the most modern technology available to detect serious road traffic infringements. A Garda traffic corps operates in each Garda division whose main function is one of enforcement of road traffic legislation.  The Minister has endeavoured to ensure that the Garda traffic corps has sufficient manpower and adequate resources to ensure that the corps carries out its enforcement duties effectively.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Garda traffic corps all members of the Garda Síochána are involved in road traffic enforcement, and ongoing campaigns are carried out by gardaí to enforce the road traffic law.  These enforcement campaigns are carried out throughout the year in conjunction with the National Safety Council.  Last year the Minister for the Environment announced the road safety together strategy which aims at the implementation of effective measures to reduce road accidents by enlisting the co-operation of all agencies involved in road safety.</P>
      <P>The Minister is determined that traffic law enforcement remains a top priority and that the gardaí will continue to have the necessary resources in both personnel and equipment to carry on with this vital and essential task.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 January 1997.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a perception that the drink driving campaign is seasonable and that publicity and enforcement measures are only taken at Christmas.  This is not so.  While it is the case that the number of checkpoints tend to increase around Christmas, for the very obvious reason that a high level of offending can be anticipated, the enforcement of the drink driving laws is given a high priority by the Garda authorities throughout the year.</P>
      <P>Ongoing campaigns are carried out by the Garda to enforce the law not only in relation to drink driving but also speeding, dangerous and careless driving, and seat belt wearing.  These campaigns, carried out in conjunction with the road safety campaigns conducted by the National Safety Council, are critical elements of the road safety together strategy which my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, announced in May 1996.  In co-operation and consultation with all the agencies involved in road safety, effective measures are being taken to combat the scourge of road accidents as a result of drink driving.</P>
      <P>The campaigns have created a greater awareness of the dangers of drinking and driving and have made such behaviour less acceptable to the general public.  In addition, the results of the campaigns can be seen in the downward trend for prosecutions for drink driving offences in recent years.  Such prosecutions have dropped from 6,568 in 1993 to 4,949 in 1995 the most recent year for which statistics are available, notwithstanding a significant increase in the number of checkpoints.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Garda authorities are committed to the rigorous enforcement of the road traffic Acts, including the law on drink driving, throughout the year.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the rural community policing scheme about which there has been some media publicity in recent weeks.  The scheme has been operating in 14 Garda districts throughout the country since 1991.  It was intended that the schemes, once operational for a reasonable period, would be extended to other <Col N="1658" /> districts.  The Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing scheme and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension.  This involves a consultative process with local Garda management, the Garda representative associations and, most importantly, local community interests.</P>
      <P>This process, by its nature, will take some time to complete.  However, the Minister is particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultations with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  It is only after the detailed consultative process has been completed that the Garda Commissioner will be in a position to submit to me proposals as to whether rural policing should be extended, or modified as the case may be.</P>
      <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years in the media and by members of the public about this scheme.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at allowing the gardaí spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including, in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.  It is precisely these objectives which are being examined to see how well they have been met in the existing rural policing areas.</P>

I understand from the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda personnel and resources, that this service is provided as required by the gardaí from Lusk and other stations within the Balbriggan district.  They have also informed me that this type of escort duty is part of the normal demands placed on the Garda Síochána and that, at present, it would not be appropriate to separate this responsibility from other policing duties within the district.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> I understand that provisional statistical data supplied by the Garda authorities for the period Jan-uary-November 1996 show that the level of overall crime in the Dublin North Central and South Central divisions has increased.  This increase is a cause of some concern and the Garda authorities are taking appropriate steps to respond.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that Operation Dóchas, which is part of the Garda strategy to deal with drugs-related crime, is proving successful.  This strategy operates in all Dublin districts and involves the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain-clothes gardaí.  This operation has already resulted in an increase in the quantity of drugs seized and the number of arrests of those suspected of being involved in drugs.  Operation Dóchas, like all Garda operations, is subject to ongoing review with a view to enhancing its effectiveness.  Operation Dóchas will continue and is being revised as circumstances indicate or require.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of measures are being taken to enhance security for newsagents.  For example, Garda crime prevention officers throughout the State carry out comprehensive surveys on a regular basis at newsagents premises and other shops.  This service is available to all and it is free of charge.  The gardaí will hold a number of seminars on crime prevention with the Irish Retail Newsagents Association during the course of this year.  Seventeen fraud seminars for business people were held by the gardaí throughout the State last year.  The topics covered in these seminars include crime prevention techniques.  There are 90 business watch schemes in operation in the country.  The first such scheme was set up in Finglas in 1994. All retailers are welcome to join these schemes and members of an Garda Síochána liaise on a regular basis with the business people involved and keep them abreast of crime trends in their areas.  The Garda national crime prevention unit is drafting a new booklet on security of shops and business premises.  This new booklet will be a comprehensive guide to all business people and will assist them in conducting their own security survey.  The booklet will offer advice on the primary features of good security practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that many newsagents are concerned about the incidence of attackers using syringes and, in this regard, the House will be aware that the Minister for Justice recently announced that she intends shortly to publish a Bill to amend the criminal law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person which will provide for a new offence aimed at people who use syringes to <Col N="1661" /> injure or threaten others.  While there is a wide range of charges that can be brought under the existing law against people who use syringes to threaten or injure others, the Minister, having reviewed the matter in the light of the increasing incidence of offences involving syringes, considers it right and proper to mark society's disapproval of and concern with this form of criminal conduct by creating a new and explicit offence in relation to syringes.  The Bill is in the final stages of being drafted and will be published in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>A variety of applications seeking to enforce the different remedies available under the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 have been made by the Criminal Assets Bureau to the High Court.  The Bureau has obtained Interim and Interlocutory Orders under sections 2 and 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 in two cases involving five persons.</P>
      <P>The Bureau has also obtained interim orders under section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 in two cases involving three persons and applications for interlocutory orders are pending. As the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 provides for disposal orders only after a period of seven years has elapsed, no funds have yet been realised for the Exchequer.  As all the applications and hearings to date have been held <i>in camera</i>, it would be inappropriate to publish any further particulars of these cases.  Other cases being investigated by the Bureau may lead to further court applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications have also been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to restrain assets under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 in four cases involving a total of seven persons.  The value of the cash assets involved was approximately £168,000 being cash and money held in accounts maintained at financial institutions.  In addition, two applications made by the Director of Public <Col N="1662" /> Prosecutions under section 38 of the 1994 Act in relation to five persons resulted in the detention of cash assets of approximately £30,000.  The value of other realisable assets which were subject to restraint orders in these cases is not readily available.</P>
    <P>The Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996, introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, provides a structure for the more effective exchange of information between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda on an ongoing basis. I have been advised that there has been regular exchange of information which has been of assistance to the Bureau in their ongoing investigations into the assets of criminals.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Marine, informs me that the existing facility at Mount Gabriel operated by the Irish Aviation Authority is a secondary radar which identifies aircraft flying overhead from transponders carried on board.  These are compulsory under international conventions. There is no requirement that ships or boats must carry such transponders.  The range of radar appliances is limited over land and sea and one radar system, even a large radar system, based on Mount Gabriel would not cover the south-west of the country.  Small vessels, especially those made of wood or fibreglass which are the materials mainly used, give very poor radar reflections and would be unlikely to be picked up on a radar screen.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have not submitted any proposals to me in relation to the provision of new equipment at Mount Gabriel and I am informed that they do not at this time have any plans to acquire equipment for the purpose stated.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that a range of measures have been put in place involving the gardaí, the Customs Service and the Naval Service which have considerably enhanced the State's capacity to tackle drugs smuggling more efficiently.</P>

The question of fundraising is one of the issues which will be considered as part of that process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee made ten recommendations in its report.  The current position in relation to each is as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendation 1</i>
      </P>
      <P>Appoint an Inspector of Prisons with specified proposed powers, duties and terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The question of the appointment of an inspector of prisons is a matter which falls within the brief of the Expert Group that was set up pursuant to a Government decision on 12 November 1996 to work out all detailed aspects of the proposed new prisons administration.  The group has been asked to report by the end of January 1997.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendation 2</i>
      </P>
      <P>Provide separate remand facilities for prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's decision to go ahead with the building of a remand prison is in accord with the committee's recommendation in this regard. The new 400 place remand prison, to be located adjacent to the existing place of detention at <Col N="1664" /> Wheatfield, is now at an advanced stage of planning and the target date for completion is late 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 3</i>
    </P>
    <P>Introduce a legal ceiling to numbers in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the committal of persons sentenced to imprisonment by the courts, and for the execution of penal warrants by the gardaí, do not provide for maintenance of an upper limit on the number of persons held in the various committal institutions at any one time.  There is, of course, an upper limit on the numbers which can be held securely and having regard to humane considerations.  Where this limit is exceeded from time to time, immediate steps are taken to reduce the numbers to an acceptable level.  These steps include transfers to other institutions and, in suitable cases, the granting of temporary release.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 4</i>
    </P>
    <P>Immediately commence the building of the womens' prison.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to proceed with the building of the new womens' prison is in accordance with this recommendation.  Planning of the prison has been completed and it is hoped that construction should be finished in 1998.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 5</i>
    </P>
    <P>Review and restructure the Permanent Suicide Prevention Committee,</P>
    <P>There is a suicide awareness committee in existence in each institution.  They were set up pursuant to recommendations made by the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths in August 1991.  The committees comprise mainly of persons who are working within the prisons.  The visiting committee have sought to be represented on the suicide awareness committee in Mountjoy.  I have agreed that there should be occasional joint meetings between members of the visiting committee and the suicide awareness committee.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendations 6, 7 and 8</i>
    </P>
    <P>Formulate one coherent medical services policy. Introduce structures of medical accountability. Increase powers of Medical Director of Prison Services.</P>
    <P>The Management of Offenders &mdash; a Five Year Plan (Chapter 7) sets out the medical services policy for the prison service, its objectives, the difficulties faced and the developments which are planned.  In relation to the question of structures and the role of the director of prison medical services, I indicated some time ago that there had been a failure to clearly define the accountability of the prison doctors to the director at the outset and that I had asked the director to review his role and to make a submission to me on the matter. I am now considering that submission and expect to discuss it with the director shortly.  The key issues involved centre on his overall role and on the measures which are needed to achieve responsibility and accountability for service delivery and financial control.  I should also point out, <Col N="1665" /> however, that one of the aims of the proposed common contract for prison doctors, which has been under negotiation with the IMO for some time, is to more clearly define the line management responsibilities of prison doctors to both prison governors and to the director of prison medical services.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 9</i>
    </P>
    <P>Review present guidelines for padded cells.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of practical necessity to put some prisoners in a place of safety when they prove difficult to manage.  The guidelines in place for the use of padded cells require all such placements to be reported to my Department and the early involvement of the prison doctor where a stay in the padded cell has to be used.  It should, however, be noted that on many occasions placement in a padded cell is at the prisoner's own request.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendation 10</i>
    </P>
    <P>Initiate a survey to establish the real extent of drug abuse within Mountjoy Prison with a view to setting procedures in place to eradicate the problem.</P>
    <P>A research psychologist has been commissioned to prepare a detailed report on the Mountjoy prisoner population.  Social, health and criminological aspects will be given particular attention in this study, which, I understand, is now at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>On 12 November the Taoiseach announced the Government's decision to establish a courts service on an interim non-statutory basis.  Subsequently, on 18 November 1996, I received the Third Report of the Working Group on a Courts Commission entitled <i>Toward the Courts Service.</i></P>
      <P>Following consideration of the report which contained the draft heads of a Bill to establish the courts service which will greatly facilitate the speedy preparation of the necessary legislation, and as a result of discussions which I held with the Chief Justice and Mrs. Justice Denham, chairperson of the Working Group on a Courts Commission, the Government decided on 19 November 1996 that the courts service should be established on a statutory basis from the beginning and that interim non-statutory arrangements should not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reaching their decision of 19 November 1996 the Government took into account the fact that the establishment of the courts service would not be unduly delayed by putting the necessary legislation in place because of the preparatory work <Col N="1666" /> already done by the Working Group in their Third Report.  In addition the Government also recognised that the separation of the respective roles of the Executive and the Judiciary would be better served by the establishment of the courts service on a statutory basis from the beginning. The legislation to establish the courts service is currently being drafted in my Department as a matter of priority.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 219 together.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of persons in custody comply with prison discipline and do not behave in a manner threatening to prison staff.  Attacks by prisoners on prison staff are, thankfully, rare in the Irish prison system.  A very small minority of prisoners do constitute a danger to staff.</P>
      <P>Prison governors and senior managers in my Department are urgently reviewing all aspects of violent prisoner management at this time.  The Prison Officers Association has also met on a number of occasions in the past few weeks with Department officials in the matter to convey their concerns and suggestions.  Dialogue is continuing in this respect with the POA.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to anticipate the changes that may be recommended to me about the future management of violent prisoners.  I can, however, assure the Deputy and this House that very prompt, careful consideration will be given by me to the recommendations put forward in this respect.</P>

      <P>I am assured by the Garda authorities that prostitutes are afforded the same protection under the law as all other persons and that there is no evidence that the operation of the legislation referred to above can be directly linked to the incidence of attacks on prostitutes.</P>

      <P>Section 46 (2) of the Court Officers Act, 1926 provides for the appointment of District Court clerks by the Minister for Justice.  District Court clerk posts are filled either through the recruitment of executive officers from panels set up by the Civil Service Commission, following open public competitions, or from amongst serving civil servants in the appropriate grades, which range from executive officer to principal officer, depending on the level of responsibility involved.  The persons selected are then formally appointed as District Court clerks under the 1926 Act by way of order signed by an authorised officer of my Department on foot of delegated ministerial authority given under section 15 (4) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 and section 7 (2) of the Documentary Evidence Act, 1925.  This procedure has been in place since the early 1980s.  Prior to that time there were separate open public competitions for recruitment to the posts of District Court clerk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the involvement of those who live and work in local communities in co-operation with statutory agencies, including the Garda Síochána, in the fight against drugs.  Local communities know the extent of the problem in individual areas and can provide informed advice on the measures necessary to tackle the drugs problem, taking into account the specific needs of each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This approach is reflected in the recommendations of the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for <Col N="1669" /> Drugs.  This report recommended the establishment of new structures designed to achieve a more effective and co-ordinated delivery of drugs services at national, regional and local level.  At national level a Cabinet drugs committee and a national drugs strategy team has been established to develop the Government's strategy against drugs and to oversee its implementation.  At regional level there will be regional co-ordinating committees in each health board area, providing a valuable forum for joint planning between the various agencies and the voluntary/community sector.</P>
    <P>The ministerial task force has also recommended the establishment of a local drugs task force for each of the areas identified by the report as having the most acute drugs problem.  This recommendation has been approved by the Government and these local task forces will be commencing work within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The local drugs task forces will comprise representatives of all relevant agencies, including the health board, the gardaí, the probation and welfare service, the relevant local authority, the local youth service and voluntary drugs services, together with six community representatives, a chairperson proposed by the local partnership board and a co-ordinator provided by the relevant health board.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this is the way forward in addressing the menace of drugs abuse which is the frequent cause of crime and which wrecks the lives of so many young people and their families. Needless to say, all members of the community can assist the gardaí by providing them with whatever information they may have in relation to criminal activity in their locality.  I would urge people to do so by way of the Garda confidential telephone line or at any Garda station and I can assure you that information will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>The new structures which are being put in place will complement the initiatives which the Garda Commissioner and I are taking to confront those who deal in drugs, such as, Operation Dóchas, which involves the deployment of over 500 gardaí throughout Dublin; recruitment of over 400 extra gardaí by October 1997; recruitment of 200 civilians to release gardaí for operational duty; establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau; provision of additional prison spaces.</P>
    <P>The Government has also introduced a package of tough legislation designed to strengthen the hand of the gardaí against the so-called drugs barons, as follows: The Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996 which provides for the freezing and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime; The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 which provides for longer periods of detention of suspects; The Disclosure of Certain Information for Taxation and Other Purposes Act, 1996 which provides for more effective exchange of information between the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I believe that the combination of all the measures which I have referred to, which includes substantial input from local communities, will <Col N="1670" /> lead to a significant reduction in the demand for drugs through improved prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes and through the tougher action being taken against those who supply drugs.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 70 together.  As I indicated to the House last month, I am aware of the need to take an overall look at the coroner service and the demands currently being placed on it.  As I further indicated at that time, I have agreed, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, that a study group should be set up which will have the task of examining a range of issues relating to the coroner service.  The group will include representatives of the Departments of Finance, Justice, Environment and Health.</P>
      <P>While the precise terms of reference for this study group have yet to be finalised, I anticipate that the review will focus on a broad range of issues which affect the coroner service including whether it would be practical to attach statutory time limits to coroner procedures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Records in respect of discoveries of drugs at Mountjoy prison are not maintained in such a manner as to readily identify every such incident during the period as requested by the Deputy.  It is, for example, not unusual for individuals upon challenge to swallow articles, the identification of which must remain a matter of conjecture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can, however, inform the Deputy that in respect of Mountjoy prison the number of incidents involving illegal drugs and drugs paraphernalia which resulted in formal prison disciplinary <Col N="1672" /> proceedings against prisoners in the periods stated was as follows: 1990, 101; 1991, 74; 1992, 154; 1993, 161; 1994, 172; 1995, 392; 1996, 423.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note the striking increase in the rate of detections since 1995 when I approved a number of preventative and detection measures concentrated on the main visiting area in the prison. These measures have proved particularly effective in preventing the smuggling of drugs and drugs paraphernalia to prisoners.  The figures above represent a more than doubling of the previous rate of detection.  The steps to which I am referring &mdash; improved video surveillance technology, a new search room, adapted visiting arrangements &mdash; are working and the figures quoted above provide evidence of this.  It is important to bear in mind that there are real difficulties in this area.  For example, the concealment of articles within bodily orifices is known to be used by some individuals in order to avoid detection. Internal searching of the type required to counter this practice is not carried out in this jurisdiction for reasons of bodily integrity and the obvious problems posed by the imposition of such a procedure.  As in any search procedure in the prisons, it could be expected that many of those who would be subjected to this form of searching would be innocent of any involvement with drugs.</P>
    <P>The most effective strategy for tackling this problem, of course, is prevention through education and the rehabilitation of those already addicted.  There are now specially designed drugs education programmes in place in all of our prisons. A range of other initiatives with offenders in custody have been promoted by me over the past two years.  These include the drug-free regime in the training unit where 77 inmates are now accommodated and the drug treatment facility which is based at the Mountjoy Prison's Health Care Unit.</P>
    <P>Both of these initiatives were put in place during 1996 and are working well.  The Mountjoy treatment unit is providing prisoners who in many cases have a history of chronic drug dependency with an opportunity to avail of the most modern treatment and therapeutic methods while serving their sentences.  Those who have completed their treatment programmes will continue to be monitored and provided with support and assistance both within prison and, crucially, following their release back into the community.  As with all such programmes it is important to note that treatment is voluntary and dependent in every case on the will of the individual.</P>

      <P>The anti-crime package which I announced in July 1996, <Col N="1673" /> provided for the appointment of 200 additional civilian staff to the Garda Síochána to enable an equivalent number of gardaí to be released to operational duties.  To date 49 such posts have been filled and I am informed by the Garda authorities that this has led to the release of 43 gardaí to operational duties at this stage.  I understand from the Garda authorities that these members have been redeployed throughout their respective divisions and that the deployment of the six remaining members is currently being addressed.</P>
      <P>The recruitment of personnel to fill the balance of these 200 posts is dependent on selection from competitions run by the Civil Service Commission. The results of one such competition are awaited while arrangements to have further competitions held are at an advanced stage and it is expected that they will be advertised shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>In 1994 a decision was reached to make unsocial hours allowances pensionable.  This was done as part of a restructuring agreement reached under the local bargaining clause of the PESP, and was in return for agreement by Garda associations to contribute to flexibility and change within the Force.  The agreement was subject to an overall limit on cost of 3 per cent of basic pay. It did not provide for the extension of pensionability of unsocial hours to Garda pensioners who retired before 1 January 1993.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 1994 restructuring agreement, I should say that restructuring deals have still to be finalised in respect of several other major public service groups and that consideration is currently being given to the implications for existing pensioners of the existing and pending restructuring deals across the public sector, and in relation to pensions increase policy generally.</P>
      <P>Concerning the Garda pensions scheme generally, the Deputy will be aware that in February 1996 my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, established the Commission on Public Service Pensions to examine and report on the pension terms of public servants, including members of the Garda Síochána.  The Commission has been asked to report to Government in 1998.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 218 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the need to rearrange certain District Court areas arose following queries raised in Court in Milford, County Donegal, by a solicitor concerning planning requirements for the use of rented accommodation for sittings of the District Court and the decision of the District Court judge that court sittings could not be held in such places without specific planning approval.</P>
      <P>Before arriving at his decision the judge had heard the views of a solicitor representing Donegal County Council who argued that such permission was not necessary.  Following consultation with the Attorney General, 16 District Court areas where court sittings have up to now been held in non-court accommodation were rearranged so that hearings would be held in dedicated court facilities.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Donegal County Council, as the local authority, which has the statutory duty to provide court premises has referred the question raised in relation to the need for planning consultation in these cases to An Bord Pleanála under section 5 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 for determination.</P>

      <P>One of the main elements of the anti-crime measures which I announced in July of last year was the recruitment of 400 gardaí to the force over the period July 1996 to October 1997 in addition to the planned recruitment of 350 each year from 1995 to 1997 bringing the total recruitment to 1,450 during this period.</P>

      <P>There is a difficulty with defining what constitutes a serious assault but, nevertheless, it is my view that all assaults on prison officers are serious.  However, for the purpose of this question, I presume the Deputy is seeking to know how many assaults were serious in so far as they resulted in physical or psychological injury to officers who subsequently required medical, surgical, psychological or psychiatric treatment or absence from duty as a result.</P>
      <P>Over the period of 1994-96, there were 141 assaults which could be classified as serious in the prison service, as a result of which officers required medical treatment either from the prison surgery, as hospital outpatients or inpatients or from their own medical doctors.  There were 44 such serious assaults in 1994, 52 in 1995 and 45 in 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 217 together.</P>
      <P>A series of measures relating to procedures and systems in the Department have been introduced following the failure to notify a judge of his removal from the Special Criminal Court.  These include revised administrative procedures in relation to the implementation of Government decisions and the handling of correspondence.</P>
      <P>In addition, proposals for medium and longer-term reforms of the institutional framework of the justice system are proceeding.  Among other matters, legislation providing for the establishment of a courts service arising from the third report of the working group on a courts commission is being prepared as a matter of priority and an expert group which was established to work out the detailed aspects of a proposed new prisons board or agency is to report its findings shortly.  The Garda Strategic Management Initiative steering group is also well advanced on its work and is expected to report in the near future.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the restructuring of the institutional framework of the justice system which is progressing represents a very significant organisation development programme.  It will require the development of a new relationship and accountability framework for all agencies associated with my Department and it will change significantly the role of the core Department when fully implemented.  This programme is being overseen by a high level steering group which is mandated to report to Government on progress on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Finally, I can assure the Deputy that any recommendations in the Cromien-Molloy report which are not otherwise embraced by the organisation development programme have been or are being addressed.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the question I would urge anyone who is aware of drug dealing or any other anti-social behaviour in their area to report the matter to the Garda who will take appropriate action.  The Garda are committed to working with local communities as shown by Operation Dóchas which provides for a strong visible presence of Garda in each district in Dublin, working with community leaders and local residents in each area.  This operation has already resulted in an increase in the quantity of drugs seized and an increase in arrests of those suspected of being involved in drugs.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1996, which was published by the Minister for the Environment last December and which is primarily designed to address problems arising from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour in the context of local authority housing.  The Bill will also give health boards discretion to refuse or withdraw supplementary welfare allowance assistance in respect of private rented accommodation in the case of certain persons who have been evicted or excluded from, or refused local authority housing on grounds of serious anti-social behaviour such as drug dealing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy in the second part of his question refers to existing successful community reaction and policing.  I appreciate the concerns of those people who have taken to the streets to show their anger at the grave damage which is being done by drug dealers in their communities and it is clear that the vast majority of those people are law abiding and that their only concern is to improve the quality of life for their children and future generations.  However, I wish to make it clear that the actions of a small number of people in some areas who have taken the law into their own hands cannot be condoned.  These type of actions, apart from being illegal, merely move the problem to another area.  It is in all our interests that any anti-social behaviour, particularly drug dealing, be reported to the Garda so that those involved may be prosecuted in accordance with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 53 today which sets out the Government's strategy to deal with the drugs problem in co-operation with local communities. This strategy provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the establishment of local drugs task forces in the priority areas identified in the First Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Measures to Reduce the Demand for Drugs.  These local task forces will <Col N="1684" /> comprise representatives of all the relevant State agencies, the local youth service and voluntary drug services together with six community representatives. These task forces will be in place within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I believe that this co-operative approach between the State, voluntary and community sector will result in improved prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes in each area.  This approach together with the tough stance being taken by the Garda against drug dealers through Operation Dóchas, the Criminal Assets Bureau and improved co-operation with the customs and excise officials provides for a comprehensive response to the problems of drug addiction and drug dealing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 81 together.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that all killings, however described, are the subject of an exhaustive investigative process by the Garda Síochána. I am advised by the Garda authorities that the investigation of all crime, including murder, is the responsibility of the local district officer and that all investigations were organised and conducted in such a way as to ensure that the maximum progress was achieved during 1995 and 1996.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I understand from the Garda authorities that in view of the trend in recent times in different forms of criminal activity, they have reviewed the structure of the specialist units attached to Garda headquarters and the Central Detective Unit at Harcourt Square.  As a result of this review the expertise and resources available to these individual units have been combined to from the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation under the control of a chief superintendent. The resources of this unit will be available to investigate any serious crime, including murder, should the local district officer require same.  This is, of course, in addition to the existing specialist services available in the form of fingerprint, ballistic, photography and forensic expertise at Garda headquarters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the new bureau is under the control of the assistant commissioner responsible for all crime related matters.  The expertise of other specialist Garda units such as the Garda National Drugs <Col N="1685" /> Unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, which are also under the control of the aforementioned assistant commissioner, can be called in to assist in any investigation throughout the country where expertise in any of these areas is warranted.</P>
    <P>The Deputies may wish to note that 41 murders were recorded in 1995 of which nine remain undetected, and 41 murders were recorded in 1996 of which 12 are still undetected.  Overall during 1995 and 1996 the proportion of murders detected to date is 78 per cent and 71 per cent respectively.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 includes a number of provisions relating to the seizure, detention, restraint, forfeiture and confiscation of assets which are the proceeds of crime.  Applications have been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to restrain assets under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 in four cases involving a total of seven persons.  The value of the cash assets involved was approximately £168,000 being cash and money held in accounts maintained at financial institutions.  The value of other realisable assets which were subject to restraint orders in these cases is not readily available.  In addition, two applications made by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 38 of the 1994 Act in relation to five persons resulted in the detention of cash assets of approximately £30,000.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on these cases.</P>

      <P>A comprehesive review of security arrangements relating to the management of violent prisoners is under way in the aftermath of the Mountjoy hostage taking incident which occurred on 4-6 January 1997.  This review is being conducted by senior officials of my Department in conjunction with prison governors. Consultations are also ongoing with the Prison Officers Association.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to comment further on the security implications of the Mountjoy incident until this review has been completed.  However, I can assure the Deputy and this House that any proposals to improve security in the prison system will be fully and quickly implemented.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will be glad to join with me in complimenting all of those who successfully brought this very dangerous situation to a safe conclusion.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 243, 246 and 261 together.</P>
      <P>The extension of the rural community policing scheme to provide a better service to the community would involve a variation in the hours of opening at stations.  I should emphasise that no decisions have been made as to the areas in which the scheme may be extended.</P>
      <P>The rural community policing scheme has been operating in 14 Garda districts throughout the country since 1991.  It was intended that the schemes, once operational for a reasonable period, would be extended to other districts.  The Garda authorities are currently evaluating experience of the existing rural community policing scheme and reviewing their 1994 proposals for its extension.  This involves a consultative process taking in consultations with local Garda management, the Garda representative associations and, most importantly, local community interests.</P>
      <P>This process, by its nature, will take some time to complete.  However, I am particularly anxious to ensure that there will be sufficient consultations with local interest groups before any decision is made to extend the scheme.  It is only after the detailed consultative process has been completed that the Garda Commissioner will be in a position to submit to me proposals as to whether rural policing should be extended or not, or modified as the case may be.</P>
      <P>There has been some misunderstanding over the years in the media and by members of the public about this scheme.  It was never designed to close rural Garda stations.  It is actually aimed at allowing the Garda spend more time on active operational duties in their districts including in particular, visits to the elderly, while at the same time providing for station opening hours which actually suit local community needs.  It is precisely these objectives which are being examined to see how well they have been met in the existing rural policing areas.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent body and is not under the aegis of my Department.  In the vast majority of cases the question of estreatment of bail arises at District Court level.  In such cases the applications are required to be taken in the name of the relevant garda superintendent and the Director of Public Prosecutions is not consulted.</P>
      <P>In estreatment applications taken in the name of the Director of Public Prosecutions in other criminal courts the bail moneys estreated are lodged to the relevant court.  Accountability for the handling of such moneys does not, therefore, rest with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <P>Definitive statistics on the level of unemployment are based on the labour force survey and it is not possible to relate the above live register figures to appropriate labour force categories, either on a Principal Economic Status (PES) or ILO basis.  This is because the labour force survey does not provide results for counties or social welfare office catchment areas; and it is known that persons on the live register are not always classified as unemployed in the labour force survey and therefore, it would not be meaningful to express the live register as a percentage of labour force survey categories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my appointment as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15 December 1994 the following reviews and studies have been undertaken by consultants at the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Tánaiste:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; Vote for Foreign Affairs</P>
      <P>A total of three studies or reviews were conducted by consultants and the costs arising were charged to the Vote for Foreign Affairs.  Following are the relevant details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> A review of the structure and the functions of the Department's Legal Division was conducted during this period.  Arising out of this, a number of measures have been taken to strengthen the staffing and effective functioning of the Legal Division.  The cost of this consultancy was £49,331.77.</P>
    <P>A consultancy study was undertaken to develop a new performance appraisal scheme for diplomatic officers.  The costs to date are £30,954.20.  The study will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Last year a study was commissioned and received by the Anglo-Irish and Information Division entitled Choosing an electoral system for elections to an elected body in Northern Ireland. The cost of this study was £1,500.</P>
    <P>A further review was ordered in my Department during this period.  The Anglo-Irish and Information Division engaged a firm of consultants in July 1996 to evaluate applications for funding received under the Co-operation between Public Bodies Measures for which my <Col N="1696" /> Department has responsibility for implementation and monitoring under the EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties of Ireland. A fee of £4,356 was agreed with the consultant, of which £1,936 has been paid to date.  The work has been fully completed and delivered to my Department.  While the commissioning of the review was made by my Department, the actual cost will be met from the technical assistance subprogramme of the EU Support Programme in the Vote of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; Vote for International Co-operation</P>
    <P>A total of 43 studies or reviews were conducted by consultants and the costs arising were charged to the vote for International Co-operation.  The studies were carried out as part of the ongoing supervision and management of the Irish aid programme. The findings have been incorporated in the arrangements for the implementations of the programmes concerned.  Following are the relevant details.</P>

      <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union are actively seeking to promote an early and peaceful solution to the current situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).  I have availed of all appropriate opportunities, including contacts with the Foreign Minister of the FRY, to press the authorities in Belgrade to observe democratic norms, especially with regard to the electoral process; show full respect for human and minority rights, and refrain from the use of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union has fully endorsed the conclusions and recommendations of the report prepared by the OSCE mission led by Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, which visited Serbia on 20 and 21 December 1996.  It is essential that the FRY authorities accept those conclusions and recommendations in their entirety.  We have called on the <Col N="1699" /> FRY to pursue reform directed towards full democratisation and liberalisation of the political and economic system, in dialogue with the opposition.</P>
    <P>The European Union has deferred the extension of trade preferences to the FRY, in the light of the recent events in Serbia.  The Dublin European Council reaffirmed that respect for democratic norms, human and minority rights, including the granting of a large degree of autonomy to Kosovo, will be key factors in determining the European Union's future relationship with the FRY and its further integration into the international community.</P>

      <P>The Government is appalled by the recent violence in Algeria.  The security situation in Algeria has been of grave concern to the Government and our partners in the European Union ever since the outbreak of the cycle of violence in 1992.  At the most recent session of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, Ireland in its capacity as Presidency of the European Union, condemned all acts of violence whatever the source, particularly terrorist attacks against the civilian population.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the European Union, has repeatedly called upon all sides to the conflict to cease all acts of violence in order to allow for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation. While acknowledging that it is for the Algerian people to resolve the crisis on the basis of reconciliation, the EU has given its support for initiatives aimed at encouraging dialogue between those who reject terrorism and violence and at widening the democratic process.  It has repeatedly stressed that respect for human rights is an obligation on all institutions, political groups and individuals in Algeria.</P>
      <P>The European Union has recently decided to begin negotiations with Algeria on an Association Agreement in the context of the Barcelona Euro Mediterranean Process in which Algeria is a participant.  The Union believes that the conclusion of an Association Agreement would contribute towards the restoration of stability to Algeria.</P>

      <P>Since 15 November 1996, approximately 1.2 million Rwandan refugees have voluntarily repatriated from camps in eastern Zaire and Tanzania to Rwanda.  The massive return of these refugees has taken place in an organised and dignified manner and has been welcomed by the international community.  All the refugees have now returned to their home communes and the reintegration needs of the returnees are being met by the Government of Rwanda who are working closely with the international aid agencies and NGSs.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government understands that a number of Rwandan refugees, along with Burundian refugees and internally displaced Zairois remain in eastern Zaire.  Latest information indicates that these refugees, who had been scattered throughout the region, have now gathered into two main groups located near the towns of Shabunda and Lubutu in eastern Zaire.</P>
      <P>The UN agencies and the international committee of the Red Cross have been providing relief supplies to these refugees since the middle of December 1996.  The Irish Government is supporting the international relief effort from the £2.25 million which the Government allocated to the Great Lakes region in the beginning of November 1996.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees remains committed to the early and voluntary repatriation of remaining refugees and is actively pursuing the best means of achieving this.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government is extremely concerned and deeply shocked at the incident in Ruhengeri on 18 January in which four international aid workers and three Rwandan soldiers lost their lives.  Close and regular contact has been maintained with all the Irish aid agencies working in Rwanda, in particular with Trócaire and Concern who have Irish staff working in the Gisenyi and Ruhengeri region.  The Government understands that the aid agencies are fully aware of the security situation and following comprehensive briefing by the United Nations resident representative in Kigali and by the British Ambassador to Rwanda, have placed security procedures for their staff under continuing and close review.</P>

    <P>In recent contacts with the Government of Rwanda, the Irish Government has expressed its concern regarding the security situation in the Ruhengeri and Gisenyi region and has emphasised the importance of increased protection for the staff of international aid agencies.  The Irish Government understands that the Government of Rwanda is working closely with the UN agencies <Col N="1701" /> and international NGOs in dealing with this matter. The Government of Rwanda has been made fully aware of the importance the Irish Government attaches to the safety of Irish nationals in Rwanda.</P>

      <P>The decision to drill for oil arises from the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 986 of April 1995 on which an agreement was concluded between the UN and Iraq last December.  The &ldquo;oil for food&rdquo; Resolution, as it is otherwise known, is intended as a temporary measure to relieve the humanitarian plight of the Iraqi population, including the Marsh Arabs, until there is full compliance by the Iraqi regime with the Security Council resolutions imposed after the Gulf War.  It allows Iraq to sell specified quantities of oil and provides for two-thirds of oil sale receipts to be allocated for the purchase of food and medical supplies.  It also allows Iraq to enter into deals with international oil firms for the extraction of petroleum products.</P>
      <P>Most importantly from a humanitarian point of view, Iraq has agreed for the first time that UN observers will be allowed to operate in central and southern Iraq which includes the Marsh Arab territories, where the population has been under severe pressure from the Iraqi armed forces for many years.  I am glad that supplies of food and medicine will shortly be reaching, under UN supervision, the Marsh Arabs and other suffering sectors of the Iraqi population.  While I am not in a position to comment on individual oil contracts with international firms, the presence of UN humanitarian observers should help to ensure that the lives and, as far as possible, the unique lifestyle of the Marsh Arab population will be preserved from any possible negative side effects of the implementation of Resolution 986.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that VAT returns are not completed in a manner which would enable the yield from particular goods or services to be identified.</P>
      <P>However, the VAT yield from sales of periodicals &mdash; other than general news-oriented ones which are taxed at the reduced rate of VAT, 12.5 per cent &mdash; is estimated at £2.1 million for 1996 and the projected yield in 1997 is £2.3 million. These figures include the estimated yield from sales of research journals which cannot be isolated.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to reduce the VAT on research journals which are liable for VAT at the standard rate of 21 per cent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the comparison made by the Deputy in relation to other member states, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that three member states apply a higher rate to the sales of periodicals than Ireland viz Denmark 25 per cent, Sweden 25 per cent and Finland 22 per cent.  In addition, I wish to point out that Irish libraries, universities and similar bodies purchasing these journals also benefit from the zero rating of books, which is not generally available in other EU countries.</P>

    <P>Civil Service pensions were paid monthly until <Col N="1704" /> September 1996.  From 1 October 1996, payment was changed to a fortnightly basis, with the first such payment being made on 17 October 1996.

    <P>Payment is now made on alternate Thursdays, as is the case for similar salary payments throughout the Civil Service.  For precise calculation of the fornightly pension the annual amount is divided by 26.09.  On this basis this person's current pension rate is correct.</P>

      <P>In my reply I will deal with public spending in relation to the occupational pensions of State employees, rather than social welfare pensions, which is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures are not readily available to provide the information in the precise format sought by the Deputy.  In 1986 the operations research section of my Department carried out, with actuarial advice, an examination of the emerging cost of public service pensions.  This examination showed that in real terms the gross annual cost of pensions in four major areas of the public service, Civil Service, Garda Síochána, teachers, and the <Col N="1705" /> Defence Forces, was £164.1 million in 1985 and would increase by 95 per cent over the following 30 years.</P>
    <P>A more recent estimate and projection of public service pension costs was done in 1995.  This indicated that, in constant salary terms, expenditure on all public service occupational pension schemes (comprising the four groups included in the earlier study, and including the local authorities, other employees in the education sector, the health service, and non-commercial semi-State bodies) would increase from £540 million per annum in 1995 to £1.4 billion per annum in 2030, an increase of 160 per cent.</P>
    <P>As regards providing for this increase, I should say that public service pensions are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis, with the cost being met on an ongoing basis from general taxation as part of the public service pay bill.  However, the Deputy will be aware that the Government established a Commission on Public Service Pensions in 1996 to examine and report on the occupational pension <Col N="1706" /> arrangements of public servants.  The question of the method of financing the long-term costs of pension schemes is to be considered by the Commission, whose report is to be submitted to Government in 1998.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria, which must be met in order that a disabled person may qualify for tax relief, are set out in Regulation 3 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  Six different types of disability are listed under headings (a) to (f) of the regulations and, in order to qualify, a disabled person must meet at least one of the disabilities.  The medical criteria are based on the degree of disability suffered by the person, rather than on the nature of the disease itself.  Consequently, a person who is suffering from spina bifida may, in fact, be eligible for tax relief.  Under regulation 4, the determination of the extent of the disability is a matter for the appropriate director of community care and medical officer of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations, which came into effect on 1 December 1994 were drawn up following completion of a comprehensive and wide-ranging <Col N="1710" /> review of the operation of the scheme, which was established under the Finance Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is to target what are costly reliefs at those who are clearly severly and permanently disabled with regard to mobility.  The operation of the scheme is kept under periodic review and the point raised by the Deputy will be taken into account in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There are no Irish statistics available to cover changes in life expectancy since the publication of the health strategy.  As outlined in the strategy, it is appropriate that trends in these areas be looked at over an extended timeframe. Considerable progress has been made in developing a framework which will enable an improvement in life expectancy to be achieved.</P>
      <P>Following the national health strategy, a comprehensive health promotion strategy was published which looked at the main causes of preventable morbidity and mortality and which specified action plans to help reduce mortality from heart disease, cancer and accidents.  A range of health promotion initiatives and programmes targeting risk factors such as smoking, overweight, diet and high blood pressure are in place or planned.</P>
      <P>Smoking is a contributory factor to both cancer and heart disease and anti-tobacco initiatives from an important part of the work of my Department's health promotion unit.  Initiatives are ongoing with other agencies including the promotion of consensual smoking control policies in the workplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Diet also impacts on both heart disease and cancer and healthy eating is being actively promoted. With regard to heart disease, a three year <Col N="1711" /> research project on cardiovascular disease and health promotion was funded by the health promotion unit and carried out by the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The health promotion unit is actively involved with the Irish Cancer Society and other agencies in raising awareness of cancer risks and prevention through campaigns like European Week Against Cancer and the dissemination of information materials.</P>
    <P>I have, of course, launched a national cancer strategy.  Its main elements include a reorganisation of cancer treatment services, elimination of shortages in certain services &mdash; including oncology and haematology and the development of other services including specialist palliative care.  I regard the cancer strategy as an integral part of a series of initiatives in relation to cancer. I have also published guidelines drawn up by experts on the administration of chemotheraphy and announced details of targeted programmes of screening for breast cancer and cervical cancer.</P>
    <P>Actions planned to meet health promotion strategy targets on accident reduction are the promotion of educational programmes to improve <Col N="1712" /> knowledge and safety skills in the home and in other environments and also working with other appropriate Government Departments and agencies to introduce measures which facilitate a safer environment.  An accident forum with broad intersectoral representation has been established under the auspices of the Office for Health Gain, with a view to developing a co-ordinated approach to accident prevention.  Significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the Review Group on the Ambulance Services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Directors of public health were appointed to the regional public health departments during 1995.  Public health medicine specialists and support staff were appointed to the departments in 1996.  The role of the public health department includes measurement of the health status of the population, assessment of the need for health services, evaluation particularly of the effectiveness of services, contribution to service planning, advice on environmental health and the surveillance and control of communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>The eight regional public health departments have worked together to produce Protocols and guidelines for the prevention and control of infectious diseases.  They have defined and agreed the information required for the measurement of the health status of the population and are working with the Department of Health on the compilation of this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1726" /> Within each public health department, a series of initiatives have commenced involving clinical medical staff, other health care professionals and managerial staff in the monitoring and evaluation of health services within each region.  Each public health department will present an annual report on the health status of the population.  The 1996 reports are being finalised and will be comparable between health boards.  Studies assessing the need for health services for various client groups have been carried out in each region and have made a contribution to service planning within that board with a particular focus on equity and quality of services.</P>
    <P>Finally, since the establishment of the departments, the collection of information and the response to incidents of infectious disease have been streamlined, and the departments have responded effectively to such incidents within their regions in the last year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The precise nature of the advisory committee on health technology assessment is still under examination in the context of a review of the structures in other EU countries which is being carried out by my Department.  The type of structures for health technology assessment in Ireland must take account of the relative size of the Irish health care system.  Increasingly, health technology assessment is being seen in a transnational context with close contact between countries to avoid costly duplication.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The introduction of charters for the groups referred to by the Deputy is being addressed in the context of overall strategy implementation. The following developments will have a major influence on the provision of charters for these groups.</P>
      <P>In regard to children, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, announced in December 1996 that he is committed in principle to the establishment of an office of ombudsman for children.  He is developing detailed proposals on the establishment of such a body to promote and protect children's rights.  It is intended that the detailed proposals developed by the Minister of State will be referred to the Cabinet Committee on Children as soon as possible.  The question of developing a charter for expectant mothers will be addressed following the publication of the women's health plan while the introduction of a charter for the elderly is still under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is currently in the process of introducing new mental health legislation.  This legislation will give greater protection to the civil rights of those with mental illness who have to be detained for treatment and will bring Irish legislation into conformity with international law.  A draft general scheme and heads of a new mental health Bill were approved by Government last year and I hope to introduce the Bill to both Houses of the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date.  The new legislation will provide for the appointment of a commissioner of mental health services whose function it will be to review the quality of care of patients in our mental health services.  In accordance with the proposed legislation I will also produce a code of practice towards ensuring high standards of care for mentally ill patients.  I am committed to the publication <Col N="1728" /> of a charter of rights for patients of our mental health services but believe that it would more appropriately be formulated and introduced at the same time as the other protective measures we are providing for in the new legislation.</P>
    <P>In relation to persons with a mental handicap, the provision of a charter will be examined in the context of the measures being taken to assess the level of need in this area and the work of the interdepartmental task force which has been established to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities was published at the end of last year.  It makes a number of recommendations regarding the involvement of services users and their families in planning service provision which will be considered in the context of implementing the report.  These include recommendations on the drawing up of a charter for people with disabilities.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware, health boards, through their general practice units, have been facilitating the computerisation of GMS practices through the provision of financial assistance and training in the use of information technology. The rate of progress on the computerisation of practices has been variable, with 25 per cent of practices computerised in one health board area and up to 70 per cent in another. However, I understand that boards intend to make significant progress on information technology development in general practice during the course of 1997.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.  The figures, supplied by the National Cancer Register, are for the most common types of cancer occuring in 1994. They are ranked by total national frequency and divided between male, female and total population <Col N="1730" /> as follows: the total number of cases recorded; the percentage of all cases represented by each type of cancer and the rate of cancers recorded per 100,000 population after adjustment for differences in age distribution between populations.</P>
      <P>The National Cancer Register started to collect national data on the incidence &mdash; i.e. number of new cases &mdash; of cancer for the first time in respect of 1994.  The register will shortly publish its first report which will contain considerable detail about cancer in Ireland.  The Deputy will see from the following table that there are variations between males and females in the incidence of certain types of cancer.  These variations may be due to the use of tobacco and alcohol, differences in diet and other lifestyle factors.  However, cancer is generally seen as a multifactorial disease and it is rarely possible to identify a single causative factor.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that the data refer to new cases of cancer recorded in 1994.  The total number of persons with cancer &mdash; i.e. prevalence as opposed to incidence &mdash; would be much higher than these figures.  The National Cancer Register data on the prevalence of cancer will improve as data over a number of years from 1994 onwards become available.</P>

      <P>With regard to the waiting list initiative, over the past four years, the North-Eastern Health Board area, including the International Missionary Training Hospital, Drogheda, has received substantial funding from my Department aimed at tackling the problem of waiting lists.

    <P>Over the period 1995-96, my Department has also invested in excess of £1 million in the Louth-Meath hospital group, which, in turn, has facilitated the appointment of 11 new and replacement consultants to the group.  Further substantial development funding in the region of £1 million is being made available in 1997 to the Louth-Meath group to provide the necessary infrastructural support for these consultant appointments.</P>
    <P>A recent analysis of waiting times in the Louth area by the hospitals involved shows that, with one exception, namely ENT, no patients have to wait in excess of 12 months for inpatient procedures. <Col N="1736" /> In the case of ENT procedures I understand from the hospital concerned that the numbers waiting over twelve months reflect those patients who were offered dates for procedures but for a variety of reasons were unable to attend.</P>
    <P>These results are evidence that the dual approach adopted by the Department in the north eastern region has impacted positively on waiting times and has also enhanced the quality of acute care available.  The Deputy will be pleased to know that an additional £8 million is being made available this year for the waiting list initiative.  I am confident that this should further impact on the average waiting times for procedures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I met the rep-resentatives of the alliance of nursing unions on 21 January last.  Both sides availed of the opportunity to take stock of the current situation.  The meeting also involved discussion of the contingency planning arrangements being made by hospitals and other health service providers.  In the meantime work is continuing in my Department in relation to service arrangements following these discussions at national level.</P>
      <P>Planning within the Department has included direct contact with all of the affected agencies; identification of high risk areas within the service; preparation of resources centrally and regionally to deal with communications with patients, impending patients and their families and the dissemination of information through local and national media; the establishment of regional centres to provide an ongoing flow of information on a daily basis direct to the Department in relation to service disruption.  All health service employers affected by the threatened action are preparing contingency plans for their local sites following discussions between management and strike committees of the alliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the mental handicap service particularly, many specialist agencies have <Col N="1737" /> already provided details outlining the impact of such a disruption in relation to these clients and their families.  They have been asked to provide further details outlining preparations for service disruption to my Department and to make what arrangements will be necessary to ensure the continuing care of this vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>In the course of my discussions on 21 January I specifically asked the alliance to consider an exemption from strike action in sensitive areas, such as services to persons with a mental handicap. The nursing alliance has indicated that it is currently drafting a formal response which it will provide to my Department later this week.  It is my continued hope that it will agree to give special consideration to this area of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is the Government's intention that retired nurses and other public servants will benefit from the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement.</P>
      <P>The energies of the management side dealing with the nurses' claim have so far been concentrated on developing jointly with the nursing unions a set of proposals designed to bring to finality the nurses' claim under the PCW.  The Deputy will be aware that revised proposals arising from the independent adjudication process &mdash; provided for in the framework agreed between the Government and ICTU &mdash; have been rejected by the INO and IMPACT.  The Deputy will be aware that following a further ballot of nursing membership the nursing alliance has voted for industrial action to begin on 10 February.</P>
      <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers, gardaí etc. who have or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question will now have to be considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
      <P>Details discussions on this issue have yet to take place.  When this general policy issue has been resolved, my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to the persons of retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the Health Act, 1970, health boards are required to make available, without charge, a general practitioner medical and surgical service to persons with full eligibility &mdash; i.e. medical card holders.  In accordance with the provisions of the Act, health boards enter into contracts with general practitioners for the provision of these services under the General Medical Services scheme.</P>
      <P>The terms of the GMS doctors' contract are the subject of negotiation and agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation and they specifically exclude payment to a doctor for services relating to the provision of certificates, other than normal sickness certificates and those examinations carried out prior to the issue of first and final social welfare certificates.  For example, certificates relating to driving licences, insurance and assurance policies and certain certificates relating to social welfare schemes are not covered under the contract.  The provision by a doctor of a note, as referred to in the Deputy's question, would not be comprehended by the payment arrangements for doctors under the GMS contract.</P>

I understand from the board that the project in Cootehill is at design stage of planning and that a planning application will be lodged shortly with Cavan County Council.  Progress on this project will be subject to planning permission being received and available capital funding.</P>
      <P>The question of funding for health centre priorities in 1997 is currently under consideration in my Department and a decision will be communicated to the health boards in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The funding of voluntary bodies providing services to people with physical disabilities is primarily a matter for health boards which make grants to such organisations under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953.  Decisions concerning the level of grants are made in the context of a wide range of relevant factors, including an assessment of existing services and the role of individual voluntary agencies in providing services locally.  I understand that discussions are ongoing between the Mid-Western Health Board and the Irish Wheelchair Association regarding the provision of services in that board's area, including north Tipperary.  In 1996, health boards made grants amounting to over £1.4 million to the Irish Wheelchair Association for its services.</P>
      <P>I am making available an additional £1 million for the development of new services for people with physical disabilities through the health boards in 1997.  In line with the recommendations of the review group on health and personal social services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, <i>Towards an Independent Future,</i> this will include the development of community-based support services such as day care places, respite care facilities, home support services and aids and appliances for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Towards an Independent Future</i> also recommends that funding deficits for existing services be addressed.  An additional £2.188 million was built into the health board allocations in 1997 to help put the services on a more secure financial footing and to enable some services initiated in 1996 to be further developed, including services provided by voluntary organisations.  Of this, £350,000 is being provided in respect of Irish Wheelchair Association services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Western Health Board and the Eastern Health Board are responsible for the management of services and deployment of staff in their own area.  Staffing levels in long-term geriatric homes must be considered in the context of the level of resources available and each board's priorities for the development of services.</P>
      <P>Historical data in relation to the nursing staff/patient ratio in the Eastern Health Board area for the years requested are not presently available.  Following are the most recently available figures, which relate to 1996.  Similarly, the Western Health Board is not in a position to supply a detailed breakdown, although data from 1980 forward is supplied.</P>
      <P>The information supplied relates to the nursing staff/patient ratio.  However, comparisons between health board areas and even individual units are not valid as the mix of non-nursing care staff may vary from unit to unit reflecting the overall nursing demand occasioned by the levels of dependency of the patients.  Similarly, the level of day care services impacts strongly on the level of overnight service provided.</P>

However, if the general practitioner feels that her condition has deteriorated, the hospital authorities have confirmed that an early review can be arranged with the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>In relation to waiting times for urology services generally, my Department has made substantial funding available under the waiting list initiative to Cork University Hospital over the past four years to tackle waiting lists for urology procedures. I am satisfied that this additional funding has made a significant impact on average waiting times for urology day cases.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the need for additional anaesthetic cover in the urology department has been addressed following the recent approval by my Department of an additional consultant anaesthetist post to Cork University Hospital.  This should help to reduce the waiting times for in-patient urology procedures.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of orthodontic treatment services for eligible persons in County Cork is the statutory responsibility of the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the board that the individual in this case was seen by the board's consultant orthodontist on 26 July 1996 and it was found that she did not fulfil the Department's guidelines regarding priority for secondary care orthodontic treatment.

The information maintained by the Legal Aid Board is on the basis of waiting times at each of its 28 full-time law centres, for persons seeking the services of the Legal Aid Board.  This information is collated by the board on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>I have set out in a tabular statement, which I propose to have circulated in the Official Report, the waiting times as at 31 December 1996 at each of the board's law centres.  In three centres the waiting time was one month or less, in eight centres the time was between one and two months, in eight centres the time was between two and four months, in one centre the time was between four and six months, in six centres the time was between six and eight months and in the remaining two centres the time was 8.5 months. A reduction in waiting times in neighbouring law centres can be anticipated when the Legal Aid Board commences services to the public soon from two new law centres which are located in Tullamore and Newbridge.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that to provide information on the gender breakdown as sought in the question would require the allocation of a disproportionate amount of the resources available to the Legal Aid Board as the information is not available in this form. However, I can say that of the 1,293 persons who applied for legal aid certificates in connection with judicial separation proceedings processed in 1995, 980 (76 per cent) were women and 313 (24 per cent) were men.</P>
      <P>With the exception of persons provided with legal aid for the purpose of seeking the return of children under the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions who are entitled to legal aid without undergoing a means test, all applications for legal services under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 are required to satisfy a test of financial eligibility as set out in Part 5 of the Civil Legal Aid Regulations, 1996.  Part 5 of the regulations deals with financial eligibility and contributions towards the cost of legal aid and advice.  A similar requirement applied to applications for legal aid and advice under the non-statutory scheme of civil legal aid and advice, which operated immediately prior to 11 October 1996 when it was replaced by the statutory scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period since I was appointed Minister for Equality and Law Reform in December, 1994 a total of five reviews or studies were undertaken <Col N="1746" /> by consultants or ordered from within my Department.  Details of the reports/studies are as follows:</P>
      <P>The Keegan report arose from a study undertaken by Mr. Michael Keegan in relation to aspects of the operation of the Legal Aid Board. Mr. Keegan was required by his terms of reference to review all matters pertaining to the appointment of the solicitor-in-charge in the Monaghan Law Centre in order to establish whether the appointment was carried out in accordance with public service standards.</P>
      <P>The report established that the recruitment process was carried out in accordance with normal public service standards and that the appointment in question was based entirely on merit.  It was critical, however, of the accompanying paper-work, which was considered to be of a haphazard and unsatisfactory nature.  It also made a series of recommendations regarding the manner in which the recruitment process could be improved by the board and on the board's internal staff/union relations.  I understand that the board has implemented these new procedures.  I, also, understand that management of the board is in discussion with the trade unions on matters arising from the report and that agreement has been reached on a variety of issues.  The cost of the report was £3,400.</P>
      <P>I arranged with ADM Limited, which administers the pilot childcare initiative on behalf of my Department, for an evaluation of the pilot childcare initiative to determine what impact the initiative had on childcare measures funded under the initiative, which utilised the skills of trained local people to enable women undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to do, in the absence of a childcare facility. The evaluation report is due to be published in the near future.  The cost of the report is expected to be in the region of £30,000.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the QMP contract was to develop and promote an information campaign, on behalf of the Government, on the referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  On foot of the Supreme Court judgment in the McKenna case the campaign ceased on 17 November 1995.  The cost was £52,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The research project by the MRBI was undertaken to provide information for the Cabinet sub-committee on divorce which had been established by the Government to make recommendations on the form of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, and on the Government's programme of information on divorce and to identify issues in the divorce debate which needed to be addressed.  The research helped to inform discussions in the Cabinet sub-committee and the decisions taken by it.  The research elicited information on the attitudes of people on divorce laws which might or might not be acceptable; what kind of information people sought in the debate and what action needed to be taken to allay their <Col N="1747" /> concerns.  The MRBI produced three surveys. The cost was £41,745.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the report by the National Pensions Board was to draft pension guidance notes for the purpose of the Family Law Act, 1995. These guidance notes, which were completed late in 1995, formed the basis for the preparation of the occupational pension scheme (Family Law Act, 1995) regulations, 1997 which are nearing completion.  The cost was £54,500.</P>

      <P>From funds at my disposal in 1996 I provided CAFE (Creative Activity for Everyone) with funding of £62,000 towards the implementation of the arts awareness intervention II programme.  The aims of this intervention, which is targeted at the long-term unemployed, are to allow access to experience of the arts and also to allow participants the opportunity to gain skills which would connect them with other individuals and groups and with other opportunities for development.  The value of the work being undertaken in this intervention has been recognised by the European Commission which has agreed to provide funding of some £330,000 towards the cost of the project under Article 6 of the European Social Fund Regulation 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition, I also made a once-off grant of £2,000 available to the ATTIC community drama group in Galway city towards the costs associated with a production dealing with the issue of bullying, and £7,000 to the Feis Ceoil towards the cost of hosting the general assembly of the European Union of music competitors for youth.</P>

      <P>Council Directive 90/220/EEC regulates the marketing of genetically modified organisms within the EU.  Approval to such marketing is in the first instance a matter for the competent national authority to whom a particular application is notified, subject to consultation with the competent authorities of other member states; this may involve a committee procedure.</P>
      <P>Where national competent authorities throughout the EU do not agree in a particular case, determination of the application becomes a matter for the Council of Ministers on a proposal from the European Commission.  Where the Council is unable to act in a specified case, the matter reverts to the Commission for decision.</P>
      <P>In a recent case concerning the marketing of a particular genetically modified maize product from the United States, the Environment Council did not reach a conclusion as the majority of member states, including Ireland, voted against the proposal.  Determination then became a matter for the Commission which granted consent to market the product on 18 December 1996.</P>
      <P>As regards future proposals to market transgenic maize, within the EU, the products which may be involved, and the human health and environmental issues in each case, can vary considerably and will be subject to the assessment procedures described above.  The Irish national competent authority for this purpose is the Environmental Protection Agency, acting under the Genetically Modified Organisms Regulations, 1994.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147, 148 and 163 together.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed new system of local finance, local authorities will retain 80 per cent of the proceeds of motor tax collected by them in respect of cars and motor cycles.  The equalisation fund will be financed by the remaining 20 per cent of the proceeds of the tax on cars and motor cycles, together with 100 per cent of the motor tax proceeds from all other vehicles, and the amounts collected in motor tax offices in respect of driver licensing and other minor items.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present collecting precise information from local authorities on income generated from domestic water and sewerage charges in 1996.  Pending receipt and analysis of this information, it will not be possible to determine what amounts should be allocated to individual local authorities in 1997 or future years under the new arrangements.  The new system will require legislation, which is in the course of preparation.  Pending the enactment of this legislation, I will be making interim payments to local authorities in the early months of 1997 by way of a rate support grant provision.</P>

The council were subsequently asked to revise their proposals with <Col N="1761" /> a view to reducing the scale and costs of the project.</P>
      <P>In September 1996, the County Council submitted new proposals to situate the library headquarters in Monaghan Town.  Consideration of these proposals is awaiting the receipt in my Department of the Council's library development programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>There are no current proposals before my Department for reclassification of the routes in question.  A lengthy and comprehensive review of the national road system was brought to a conclusion in July 1994 with the marking of the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994.  I do not propose to make any major changes in the national road network in the near future.  Traffic patterns will, however, continue to be monitored in order to identify any long-term changes which might have implications for the classified system.</P>

My Department approved those proposals in July 1995 and committed funding of £500,000 to this project.

      <P>The non-national road grant allocation of £230,000 in 1997 to Tralee Urban District Council comprises a discretionary block grant of £130,000 and a specific improvement grant of £100,000 under the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement works on non-national roads which are of economic benefit and help to generate employment.

      <P>The discretionary grant allocations (including restoration programme grants) to county councils for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads are allocated on a <i>pro-rata</i> mileage basis with some limited special provision for the special needs of particular areas.  This is consistent with the approach adopted in the determination of these allocations over the years.  Other strands of non-national roads funding are projectbased; projects are selected having regard to the EU eligibility criteria governing these schemes, the merits of the projects submitted for consideration by different authorities, and the competing demands from different areas on the limited funds available.</P>
      <P>The consultants' report on the condition of the road pavement on non-national roads in county council areas is expected to be completed by the end of February.  The report will establish the cost of eliminating the backlog of deficiencies on the regional and local road network in these areas and will allow funds for removing the backlog to be more directly related to needs.  However, road mileage will continue to be a relevant criterion in determining overall grant allocations to individual county councils.</P>

      <P>My Department is currently engaged in a detailed review of overall provision for young offenders.  The review in question encompasses the issue of stronger physical security arrangements at the Oberstown campus and the wider issue for future levels of provision in the context of the Children Bill, 1996.</P>
      <P>As part of the review process, the Department commissioned an engineer's report on the feasibility of introducing a range of physical security measures, including fencing and lighting on the Oberstown campus.  The report also examined existing sewage and other services on the Oberstown campus with a view to identifying current deficiencies and any upgrading which would be required in the event of an expansion of provision on the campus.</P>

      <Col N="1767" /> The report in question is currently being examined by my Department.

I would, however, like to assure the Deputies that any developments which may ultimately be undertaken will have full regard to the concerns of local residents in the Lusk area.  My Department will consider any claim for compensation from local residents in relation to damage caused to property by children who have absconded from the centres.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Currie, Minister of State at my Department recently announced details of new management structures for a number of young offender centres operating under the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>A key element of the new arrangement is the creation of a single board of management to govern the operations of the three young offender facilities located at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin.  The three centres in question, Trinity House School; Oberstown Boys' Centre; and Oberstown Girl's Centre, had previously been governed by three separate boards of management.</P>
      <P>The composition of the new single board has been designed to accommodate continued participation by the various interests, including Lusk Community Council, which had been represented on the original three boards.  The level of such representation has also been designed to maintain the necessary balance of interests which has existed on the boards heretofore.  Such balance could not be maintained under the proposal put forward by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The issue of allowing a substitution arrangement for the Lusk Community Council representative on the board has not previously been put to my Department.  However, in recognition of the valid interests of the council in relation to the centres in question, this matter will now be considered and the council will be advised of the outcome.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 182 and 185 together.  I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools.  The allocation of such posts is subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.  However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wider range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into this area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.  When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools referred to by the Deputies will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my answer of 10 December 1996 on this issue.  As I indicated, each of the 11 regional technical colleges offers a range of courses leading to the awards of the National Council for Educational Awards.  These are the national certificate, the national diploma, the bachelor degree, the master degree and the PhD degree.  Together they comprise a ladder of progression <Col N="1774" /> enabling students to progress from one award level to the next.</P>
      <P>National Certificates have been granted by the NCEA each year since 1972 and holders of this award have a very good record in terms of gaining relevant employment and progressing to higher level awards.  It is also of value to students who receive awards from the National Council for Vocational Awards as these students may gain exemptions from parts of a National Certificate and so progress on the ladder of higher education in accordance with their abilities.  The present arrangements allow students who reach the required standard to progress from National Certificate to degree level.</P>

The operation of the scheme is being closely monitored both internally by the schools involved, in conjunction with my Department's inspectorate, and externally by the Education Research Centre.

      <P>Under the statutory national teachers' superannuation schemes a number of conditions must be satisfied in order for a teacher to be awarded a degree allowance, and for that allowance to be then included in calculations for pensionable reckreckoning. For the purposes of pensionable reckoning, in order to benefit fully from a qualification allowance it must be held for a minimum of three years prior to retirement.  If it is held for <Col N="1778" /> any period less than three years the benefit is averaged accordingly.</P>
      <P>In order to be awarded the qualification allowance in the first instance, a teacher must have given pensionable service after the conferral of the degree, and must formally apply to have that degree recognised by my Department.  As the teacher in question had retired on 31 August 1987 and the conferring of the B. Ed. Degree did not take place until 16 October 1987 it would not have been possible to have been in receipt of the qualification allowance while in pensionable service. I regret that it is not therefore possible to have such allowance reflected in the teacher's pension.</P>

      <Quest>if she will have investigations made regarding an application for a vocational education committee grant by a person (details supplied) in County Cork who has been refused in view of the fact that she opted out of first year eight days prior to the completion of the course as she had been in very ill health throughout the academic year; if her attention has been drawn to the fact that if the student had opted out of third-level education fifteen days prior to the end of her course she would be entitled to grant aid; and if she will waive this condition in view of the fact that there is such a short number of days involved.</Quest>

      <P>Under the regulations governing the 1991 European Social Fund-aided scheme and the 1996 ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme, a grant may not be paid in respect of a repeat year of study on the same course.  A vocational education committee has discretion to waive this provision in exceptional circumstances, such as certified serious illness.</P>
      <P>I understand that the student in question pursued a course in Limerick regional technical college in 1991-92 and was grant aided under the European Social Fund-aided scheme.  The student subsequently sat and failed the 1st year and repeat examination in 1992.  The college have confirmed that the student was absent for a total of eight days due to illness during the 1991-92 academic year.  As students pursuing ESF-aided courses are allowed 15 days sick leave in an academic year without any reduction in the level of grant payable, the absence of eight days did not affect the level of grant payable to the student in question in 1991-92.</P>
      <P>The student is currently pursuing the first year of the same course in Limerick regional technical college.  I understand that County Cork vocational education committee has refused to award the student a grant under the ESF-aided maintenance grants scheme, having regard to the provision excluding payment in respect of a repeat year of study on the same course.  I further understand that the County Cork vocational education committee do not consider that the student's sick leave in 1991-92 warrants this provision being waived.</P>

      <P>The current position of the construction of a new national school at Clontuskert, Lanesboro, County Roscommon, is that an advertisement was placed in national and local newspapers during the week ending 24 January 1997, inviting contractors and sub-contractors who wish to be considered for inclusion in the tender prequalification process to apply to the primary contracts section of my Department before 12 noon, Friday, 28 February 1997.</P>
      <P>A decision on the timing of the tender and contract process will be taken in the light of available financial resources and at this stage I am unable to indicate the time frame for the commencement of the project.</P>

    <P>In general, transistor radios are not purchased by my Department for use by prisoners.  They can be bought from prison tuck shops if required, by individual prisoners.  However, in a small number of exceptional cases, radios are purchased at State expense for prisoners.</P>
    <P>The annual cost of keeping an offender in 1996 was approximately £46,500, based on the provisional outturn.  This figure excludes capital expenditure and expenditure not connected directly with the running of the prisons, such as costs incurred by the probation and welfare service. However, relevant costs borne on other Votes, such as superannuation and teachers' salaries, are included.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in place for prisoner catering provide a nutritious diet as recommended by CERT and in keeping with the best dietary advice for the general community.  A well balanced 14 day menu cycle has been introduced in most institutions and the medical officer at each prison may exceptionally prescribe special diets for individual prisoners on medical grounds.  The kitchens are run on a professional basis with a qualified prison service cook/chef in most cases.</P>
    <P>Library facilities are available in all prisons and newspapers and magazines are available on request.</P>
    <P>All institutions have a supervised gymnasium which is used by inmates for a range of activities, including exercise classes on a group and individual basis.  Supervision is provided by a qualified instructor.</P>
    <P>Subject to the maintenance of safe custody, good order and security, and where practicable, a Governor may make arrangements by which a prisoner may communicate by telephone with members of his or her family or with legal advisers.  The provision of free telephone calls is at the discretion of local management.  Due to the nature of telephone billing in the prisons it is not feasible to accurately state the cost of telephone calls by prisoners.</P>

      <P>The Curragh prison/place of detention was taken over by my Department on 25 November 1996.  There are currently 35 prisoners accommodated there and this number is due to increase to the maximum capacity of 68 on a phased basis over the coming months.  Apart from some teething troubles, which are to be expected in the early days of any new institution, I am not aware of any major difficulty arising from the operation of the institution at present.

      <P>I must stress that one cannot simply add these two figures together to arrive at a total number of individuals who obtained some form of temporary release in that year as there would be a significant overlap of individuals between the two groups, for example a prisoner may have received a day's temporary release to attend a funeral and subsequently been given full temporary release later in the year.  This prisoner would be counted in both sets of figures.  Figures are not kept in such a way as to readily give the exact extent of this overlap.</P>

      <P>The concept of refugee status is generally defined as applying to a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of persecution, is outside his or her country of nationality and, owing to such fear, is unable or unwilling to avail of the protection of that country. That is the definition contained in the 1951 UN Convention relating to the status of refugees. freedom on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group is always persecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> The Refugee Act, 1996, which will become operational later this year, follows the definition contained in the 1951 Convention.  I have no proposals to commission a study as proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>While it is worth mentioning that there is an obligation on the courts when imposing a fine to take into account the means of the offender, I can also inform the Deputy that I am at present considering various proposals in relation to the payment of fines and, in particular, the introduction of a system of attachment of earnings whereby the court could order that outstanding fines be deducted from a person's earnings.  This would represent a form of payment by instalment.  I am at present having research carried out in relation to this matter and any proposals which may emerge will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>

      <P>As you may be aware, a wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under-age drinking was included in the Intoxication Liquor Act, 1988. The primary purpose of those statutory controls was to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to be in possession of or to consume intoxicating liquor other than in a private residence.</P>
      <P>However, legislation alone cannot be expected to solve the problem of under-age drinking.  A broader approach having regard to the social, cultural and economic factors involved is required. It is for this reason that I am actively promoting and encouraging the idea of community based initiatives and have encouraged the Garda Síochána to become involved in organising and assisting such initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda, in co-operation with community groups, are playing a prominent role in organising local groups and school programmes to deal with the abuse of alcohol and other substances by <Col N="1797" /> young people and are willing to help with such local initiatives wherever they are contemplated. The Garda Síochána, through its juvenile liaison officers and crime prevention/community relations personnel, give lectures on the dangers of drugs/alcohol abuse to children at second level throughout the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the need for a specialist unit, I am informed by the Garda authorities that all members of An Garda Síochána receive training on all criminal matters both during their initial training and regular in-service training thereafter. In addition, the deployment of human and other resources to meet local needs is constantly assessed by each district officer to ensure that they are sufficient to meet the demands placed on them.  The need in any specific element of criminal activity will vary from district to district and the Garda authorities inform me that they are satisfied that the present strategy needs to be sufficiently flexible to enable them to meet the many demands on the Garda service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers me to provide, by way of regulations, for a national age card scheme to curb the supply of drink to persons under 18 years.  However, I consider that it is more effective to promote voluntary age card schemes and, as mentioned in the recently launched national alcohol policy, my Department will continue to encourage and facilitate identity card schemes for those of or over 18 years across the whole country.  There are over 100 voluntary age card schemes in existence at present, which I understand are operating successfully. The indications are that local schemes backed by a strong and sustained community involvement make a positive contribution to tackling underage drinking within the framework of the national alcohol policy.</P>

      <P>Six external studies have been undertaken or ordered from within my Department since I became Minister for Tourism and Trade in December 1994.  Details are as follows: (1) Arthur D. Little advised the interdepartmental steering committee set up to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the review of Bord Fáilte.  The implementation of these recommendations has resulted in a major restructuring of Bord Fáilte.  The cost of the consultancy was £100,000, of which the Department paid £40,000 and Bord Fáilte £60,000.  As this is a fourth schedule service, VAT of £8,400 was also paid by the Department to the Revenue Commissioners; (2) Indecon advised the Department in June 1995 on progressing the national conference centre project at a cost of £11,233.64, of which 75 per cent is reimbursed by the European regional development fund under the operational programme for tourism; (3) Mediawise provided once-off advice on the projection and presentation of policy by me as Minister at a cost of £1,550; (4) Public Relations of Ireland were on contract from June <Col N="1801" /> 1995 to December 1996 providing guidance and advice to myself and the Department on public relations matters at a total cost of £67,680.14, including VAT; (5) The National Monitoring Committee for the Operational Programme for Tourism appointed a firm of economic consultants to act as external evaluator for the programme. The firm has carried out 11 studies to date on specific aspects of the programme and their findings are used to guide the work of the monitoring committee.  The same firm is also carrying out the mid-term evaluation of the operational programme in order to ascertain what changes, if any, should be made in the programme as it reaches its mid-stage.  Expenditure on these consultancies amounted to £5,227.20 in 1995 and £71,111.78 in 1996, of which 75 per cent is reimbursed by the European regional development fund under the operational programme; and (6) In 1995, KPMG Stokes Kennedy Crowley completed a training needs analysis report for the Department, work on which had begun in 1994. A training and development committee was subsequently established to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.  Under the committee's auspices, prioritised training and development programmes, aligned to achieving the Department's mission and core strategic objectives, were agreed and implemented.  The cost of the study was £15,185.50, of which £6,110.50 was paid over in 1995.</P>

      <P>While the balance of the task force's recommendations remain to be fully implemented, substantial progress has been made with the partial implementation of a further 29 recommendations. These are listed in schedule II.</P>
      <P>The systematic examination and implementation of the recommendations is being pursued by the small business and services division of my Department, which has assessed all of the recommendations and is actively pursuing their implementation. In addition, the small business and services forum which I established to advise me on policy issues concerning the development of small business and services, in consultation with the small business and services division, has recently examined those recommendations which remain to be fully implemented and has listed a number of the areas for priority attention during 1997, including prompt payments, administrative simplification, and taxation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, building on the work which has already taken place, very significant additional progress will be achieved in 1997 in implementing the recommendations of the task force.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE I</P>
      <P>
        <i>Recommendations of the task force report on small business which have been fully implemented.</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  Remove or substantially relax the conditions in respect of the tax refunds for the new enterprise scheme &mdash; the seed capital scheme &mdash; that applicants are required to show that 75 per cent of their income for each of the three years immediately prior to the incorporation of the new company must have been derived from schedule E &mdash; PAYE &mdash; and also that they receive no more than £5,000 in taxable income from other sources in each year.</P>
      <P>The 1994 Finance Act substantially relaxed the rules concerning the sources of an individual's income for the purposes of the seed capital scheme by: 1) abolishing all restrictions in the year immediately prior to the year of assessment in which the individual invests in the company and 2) the introduction of a revised limitation in respect of each of the three years of assessment immediately preceding the year of assessment referred to at 1 above, the amount of income which may be derived from sources other than employment to the lesser of (a) an amount equal to the employment income, or (b) £10,000.  The 1995 Finance Act further increased the figure of £10,000 to £15,000.</P>
      <P>2.  Restore the £21 million allocated to the CEBs in the national plan 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levels of expenditure proposed by the then Government in 1993 under the national development plan were subsequently revised in the light of the completion of negotiations with the European <Col N="1803" /> Commission on the Community Support Framework 1994-1999 and agreement on the financial allocation for the three main strands of the OP for local urban and rural development.  Since 1995, expenditure on the county enterprise initiative has exceeded £20 million per annum and has consistently exceeded the levels of funding for the sub-programme in the OP financial plan.</P>
    <P>3.  Extend the period within which tax relief can be claimed on corporate donations to First Step and Enterprise Trust.</P>
    <P>Tax relief has been extended in two-year cycles under various Finance Acts to First Step and Enterprise Trust since their inception, and will continue to June 1997 in the case of first step and to the end of 1997 in the case of Enterprise Trust. The question of renewal will continue to be examined in the context of the relevant Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>4.  Consideration should be given to proposals from First Step and Enterprise Trust for limited matching funds from the Exchequer, perhaps via the operational programme.</P>
    <P>These organisations have been allocated funding under a new venture capital programme which was introduced under the industry operational programme.</P>
    <P>5.  Assess adequacy of venture capital sources in 1995, address any significant gaps that may still exist.</P>
    <P>Venture Capital scheme became operational in May 1996.</P>
    <P>6.  Encourage emulation of the Smurfit fund.</P>
    <P>The Smurfit Jobs Creation Enterprise Fund is being expanded with the aid of EU funding under the operational programme for industrial development 1994-99, venture capital scheme. This measure will also assist a number of other venture capital funds.</P>
    <P>7.  Develop a business introduction service which would seek to bring together potential investors and investees.</P>
    <P>Forbairt has developed a register of potential investors &mdash; Business Angels &mdash; which is directed mainly at prospective investors in the manufacturing and internationally traded sector.  In addition, funding was approved under measure 5 of the small business operational programme for the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland project entitled &ldquo;Invest in the Best&rdquo;, the specific aim of which is to introduce investors and investees. That project has recently commenced.</P>
    <P>8.  Ensure maximum possible amount is secured from new EIB scheme for SMEs.</P>
    <P>Discussions held to maximise loans under this scheme which is administered by ICC and AIB.</P>
    <P>9.  Government should encourage banks to lower interest rates schemes and if banks respond <Col N="1804" /> positively should consider providing a more favourable tax treatment for loans of this kind.</P>
    <P>Lower interest rate schemes have been introduced by most banks since 1994.  The bank levy was removed from the banks in 1994 and in return the banks have taken a more positive approach to the SME sector.</P>
    <P>10.  Government should discuss personal guarantees with banks.  Invite proposal re effective safeguards for family homes.</P>
    <P>The four clearing banks and ICC no longer seek the family home as security for business loans.</P>
    <P>11.  Ombudsman for credit institutions should be extended to cover incorporated business with a turnover of £100,000 or less.</P>
    <P>Announced in October 1994.</P>
    <P>12.  Banks should emulate codes of practice introduced by Bank of England to govern relations with their small business customer.</P>
    <P>Codes of practice introduced by the Irish Bankers Federation on behalf of all banks in October 1995.</P>
    <P>13.  Establish representative forums for small business customers in the main banks.</P>
    <P>Fora set up by the four main banks by 1995.</P>
    <P>14.  Extend the scope of rollover relief.</P>
    <P>Under Section 66 of the Finance Act, 1994 all business except financial intermediaries are covered by rollover relief.  Further changes were made under the 1995 Finance Act to relax some of the conditions which apply to rollover relief on equity investment by entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>15.  Encourage employers with aid of employer associations to institute prompt payment code.</P>
    <P>Prompt payment code has been launched by IBEC.</P>
    <P>16.  Increase the frequency of tax returns for self-employed on a more frequent basis by direct debit.</P>
    <P>A new direct debit facility for the payment of preliminary tax under the self assessment system was introduced in the 1995 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>17.  Businesses with an annual turnover below £40,000 should be allowed to submit three-line accounts.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners introduced a simplified form BP1 which is essentially a three-line account which has been expanded to give guidance as to what constitutes assessable recepits and allowable expenses on 6 April 1996.  This new form covers the 1995-96 and succeeding tax years.</P>
    <P>18.  Introduce single registration form for all tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have introduced two types of single registration forms, one for companies and the other for sole traders-partnerships.</P>
    <P>19.  Introduce a single tax clearance certificate <Col N="1805" /> for public sector contracts which will be renewable on an annual basis.</P>
    <P>Announced by Minister for Finance in August 1994.</P>
    <P>20.  The Revenue Commissioners should examine the information required in the monthly VAT control statement with a view to reducing the administrative burden on small business.</P>
    <P>Abolished by Section 132 of Finance Act 1995.</P>
    <P>21.  Recognition for a new category of VSEs should be sought from EU in order to permit a reduction in regulatory requirements on firms with fewer than 20 employees.</P>
    <P>The European Commission adapted a recommendation on 3 April 1996 which, for the first time, set out a common and coherent definition of what constitutes an SME.  This definition recognises a new category of VSEs by specifying that a business with less than ten employees will be considered a very small enterprise.</P>
    <P>22.  A start-up business with fewer than 20 employees to be required to complete a simple safety statement for the first two years of operation.</P>
    <P>Model safety statement aimed as small low-risk employments issued by Health and Safety authority in July 1994.</P>
    <P>23.  Duty to take reasonable care should be reenforced on employees.  Responsibility should not rest with employers alone.</P>
    <P>Duty to take reasonable care is enforced on employees through the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 &mdash; Section 9.  There is provision in the Act which makes it an offence, punishable by a fine, for a person to fail to discharge his duties under Section 9.</P>
    <P>24.  FÁS should provide short evening or weekend information seminars about starting a business, aimed at everyone.</P>
    <P>FÁS has developed a programme &ldquo;Building Business Today&rdquo; which is focused at anyone considering starting a small enterprise or those already trading.</P>
    <P>25.  FÁS to provide evening and weekend courses on developing a business aimed at owners of established businesses.</P>
    <P>FÁS services to industry division provides evening courses for small businesses wishing to expand and also provides evening-weekend management development programmes for clusters of companies.</P>
    <P>26.  Specialised training should be provided by clustering companies in groups of around ten, for programmes designed to tackle common problems and deficiencies.  It is recommended that four such pilot schemes be organised immediately and should be evaluated rigorously.</P>
    <P>FÁS initiated a pilot company development &ldquo;Cluster&rdquo; programme for small business in 3 FÁS regions in October 1994 and January 1995.  An <Col N="1806" /> evaluation of the programme in Dublin South-Wicklow found the programme to be a highly effective one and one where there is specific scope for expanison.  As a result FÁS decided to extend the programme to eight of the ten regions.</P>
    <P>27.  Expand current IBEC scheme for business teachers to gain experience in industry and this should also be extended to non-business teachers.</P>
    <P>28.  There should be an increased emphasis on project work within the existing curricula in schools.</P>
    <P>29.  The mini-company initiative should be more widely implemented.</P>
    <P>30.  There should be more enterprise education in the transition year and in senior certificate programmes.</P>
    <P>In October 1995, IBEC launched a Business and Education Links Project which aims to improve the image and increase the focus upon business within the education system and also to ensure that students emerging from the second level system are better prepared for the transition into the world of work or into further education.</P>
    <P>In 1994, there was a restructuring of the leaving certificate applied and vocational programmes, and also the transition year.</P>
    <P>In relation to 27, the Business and Education Links Project includes in-company placement for teachers &mdash; not just business teachers.</P>
    <P>With regard to 28, the vocational programme includes three link modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience. The applied programme has a strong emphasis on project and group work.  This is also one of the main features of the transition year.</P>
    <P>In relation to 29, the Business and Education Links Project includes mini-enterprise support. During the transition year, schools encourage enterprise and the development of business skills through mini-company projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to 30, the Business and Education Links Project includes participation for students on company induction programmes, focused business visits, mini enterprise support, and demonstrations of learning applicable to working.  The vocational and applied programmes include modules on enterprise education, preparation for work and work experience.  During the transition year, schools encourage enterprise and the development of business skills through mini-company projects.</P>
    <P>31.  A new limited company to be established by Forbairt and An Bord Tráchtála to undertake the development of sales opportunities on an initial five year basis.</P>
    <P>A new ABT-Forbairt Public Procurement Unit has been set up within these agencies under measure 2 of the Small Business Operational Programme (SBOP).  This new unit was approved in September 1996 and six full-time specialists are being appointed under the SBOP on a three year contract basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> 32.  The profile and professionalism of the purchasing function in the public sector must be raised.</P>
    <P>The need to raise the profile and professionalism of the purchasing function in the public sector was recognised when the SBOP was being drafted and approved and has been incorporated into measure 2.  In addition, the Irish Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management Consultants has designed a new diploma course which is aimed at improving the professionalism of public sector purchasing.</P>
    <P>33.  Reinstate the Marketplace programme, Marketing Consultancy schemes and the Techstart and Technology Management programmes.</P>
    <P>The Marketplace programme which was introduced in 1983 continues to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>The Marketing Consultancy scheme was introdeuced by ABT in 1989 on a pilot basis and it was never envisaged that it would be a long-term support to SMEs or consultants.  There was a low level of interest-uptake in the scheme by SMEs and the scheme was not continued.  The last agreement was signed in early 1994.</P>
    <P>In 1994 Forbairt ran a much reduced Techman programme and recruited fewer graduates under the Techstart programme.  In 1995, the budget was reinstated and it was possible to run more comprehensive programmes.</P>
    <P>The schemes are all operating effectively with the exception of the Marketing Consultancy scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>34.  Extend the Mentor programmes especially in the context of the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>The Mentor Programme has been extended in the context of the local urban and rural development operational programme and the industrial development operational programme.</P>
    <P>35.  Agreement with Telecom Eireann and ESB on the abolition of deposits and guarantees for start-up businesses.</P>
    <P>Both Telecom Éireann and the ESB have abolished such deposits.</P>
    <P>36.  Reduce the cost of ISO 9000 Quality Standard for firms with fewer than 25 employees.</P>
    <P>Substantial cost reductions have been effected for such firms.</P>
    <P>37.  Establish a small business division within the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>Established in June 1994.</P>
    <P>38.  Establish a Small Business Forum, comprising small business practitioners from all sectors to advise the Minister with responsibility for small business.</P>
    <P>Set up by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in September 1995.</P>
    <P>39.  Establish an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1808" /> An Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Business and Services was established in March 1995.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE II</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendations of the task force report on small business where substantial progress towards implementation has been made.</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Simplify the tax refunds for the new enterprise scheme, remove from the BES framework and introduce a simpler more accessible scheme.</P>
    <P>2.  Extend the sectors eligible for the tax refunds for new enterprises scheme &mdash; seed capital scheme &mdash; in line with the approach proposed in section 3.3 of the task force report which proposes a three-fold categorisation of small enterprises for state support, vis-a-vis fully eligible, partially eligible and minimally eligible.</P>

    <P>4.  Allocate a mentor to all businesses that receive funding from CEBs.</P>
    <P>5.  The scope for developing the informal investment market could be assisted by developing a register of investors.  This would require the co-operation of state agencies, banks, chambers of commerce and others.</P>
    <P>6.  The Government should indicate its intentions to introduce tax reforms for higher risk enterprises and, in so doing, specify a broad time frame for their implementation.</P>
    <P>7.  Repeal of section 115 which confers a kind of super preferential status on the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>8.  The PAYE allowance of £800 should be extended to proprietary directors and their spouses engaged in the family business.</P>

    <P>12.  Capital acquisition tax should not be applied to business assets being passed on to a family member where the business is being maintained in operation as a viable concern.</P>
    <P>13.  Legislation should be introduced to require public sector bodies to settle their accounts by the end of the month following the date of issue of an invoice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> 14.  Public sector bodies should also be required to give details of their payment records in their annual reports.</P>
    <P>15.  The Comptroller and Auditor General should be given a function in monitoring the payment performance of public bodies.</P>

    <P>21.  Implement full PRSI rate for public servants.</P>
    <P>22.  The construction industry should be covered by a single tax clearance certificate, valid for one year, and the C2 form issued annually should be the tax clearance certificate for that industry.</P>
    <P>23.  Introduce a single mandatory registration threshold of £40,000 for VAT, to be increased in line with the consumer price index.</P>

    <P>27.  Establish a national business information system geared towards the needs of small businesses. It should include a telephone help-line and a walk in facility; the help line facility should be available after business hours and at weekends.</P>

      <Quest>the reason third-level researchers who are looking for partners to form a research network cannot benefit from financial support for their search for partners as industrial concerns looking for partners can.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In an effort to boost participation in EU framework programmes by Irish companies, Forbairt extended their feasibility study scheme for Irish companies to those seeking to develop collaborative research partners.  To date about £250,000 in funds has been disbursed to some 47 companies.  This scheme is not open to third-level entities.  However, third-level researchers can, in addition to the measures listed below, benefit from support under the national research support fund measure 4 to collaborate with European researchers on new international research collaboration projects of specific Irish interest.  In 1996, a total of 72 researchers were funded from the £240,000 provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The EU framework programme on research and technological development and demonstration is the principal means through which Irish researchers can collaborate with other European researchers.  Since its inception in 1984, Irish third-level researchers have developed a huge network of contacts with universities, research institutes and other potential collaborative partners across Europe.  The whole process of identifying and locating new partners for new projects has been further strengthened through the EU Innovation Relay Centre (IRC) mechanism, familiar to all third-level researchers, with its network of contact points in all the member states including Ireland.</P>
      <P>COST, or Co-operation in Science and Technology, also provides a framework for European co-operation in the field of scientific and techncial research.  COST provides funding to meet the co-ordinating expenses of each action, including contribution to workshops, conferences and publications. COST is dominated by third-level researchers.</P>
      <P>Third-level research by its nature tends to be organised in teams and to be collaborative and interactive with ongoing exchanges between researchers through attendance at conferences and contributions to scientific journals.  Overall, therefore, there is a well established and thriving system of networks within the third-level system.</P>
      <P>Irish researchers have been extremely successful in exploiting these networks and in obtaining funds from the frame work programmes.  The value of contracts awarded to the third level sector from 1995 to date under the current fourth framework programme amounts to 48.58 MECU-IR£38.86 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry was obliged under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92 to establish an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS).  A specific requirement of the system was the development of an alpha-numeric land parcel identification system (LPIS) for all land parcels which are the subject of an area aid application.  The purpose of this system is to provide the Department with a database whereby land parcels being claimed for area aid purposes can be located, identified and have area values and land use attributed.  The original deadline for implementation of the system was 1 January 1996 but this was extended recently to 1 January 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The LPIS operated for the 1996 area aid scheme and is currently being updated for 1997. As part of this update, a number of applicants <Col N="1826" /> for area aid have been requested to supply maps because their 1996 applications contained nonunique references to one or more land parcels the location of which could not be identified.  I should point out that these requests for maps arose only after all documents and maps submitted by the applicants were cross-referenced.</P>
    <P>If any area aid applicant has been requested to submit a map which he supplied with a previous application, he should notify my Department in writing or by phone and identify the townland in which that parcel is located.  I have arranged for the continued operation of the freephone number 1 800 46 47 48 which farmers can ring.  My Department will then arrange for the issue of a map of the townland in question to the applicant.</P>

      <P>New national arrangements for the tagging and registration of cattle were introduced <Col N="1827" /> in 1996.  Departmental herd records for 1995 were used to identify herds with female breeding stock and to estimate the likely annual calf births and plastic tag requirements in each herd for 1996. Departmental records show that there were no breeding females on the farm to which the herd number quoted refers on 22 December 1995. Records also show that this person took over his father's herd in September 1996 and acquired 65 cows and 32 heifers.  As the person appears not to have acquired female breeding stock until September 1996, any question of reimbursement does not arise in regard to the animals tagged by his vet in May 1996.  These animals will continue to carry the brass tags inserted as the official identification. The herdowner can expect to receive 100 sets of plastic tags in the next two to three weeks. No payment will be required for the basic 1997 tag supply.</P>

      <P>Areas selected by the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel to be recommended for disadvantaged area status were defined as either a district electoral division which satisfies all criteria, or one or more contiguous townlands in the DED which together satisfy all criteria, subject in either case to the area joining onto the existing or new disadvantaged areas boundary.</P>
      <P>The district electoral division of Ballinakill, County Laois, exceeded the stocking density limit of less than one livestock unit per forage hectare, and the appeals panel could not, therefore, propose the total DED for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>On examination of the individual townlands in the DED, Lisbigney was found to exceed both the stocking density and income criteria.  It was not possible to aggregate this townland with any other contiguous townlands in order to create a group which would satisfy all of the criteria, and consequently, it could not be included in the list of areas proposed by the panel for designation as disadvantaged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 293, 294 and 295 together.</P>
      <P>Under the EU fourth framework research and development programme, my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) are involved in a specific EU nuclear fission safety programme and are represented on the management committee representing all member states set up by the Commission.  The nuclear safety fission programme is one of 18 community programmes covering specific research areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme plays a role within the European Community and in Eastern Europe in bringing about safety for all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle.  The programme has five activity areas: exploring innovative approaches, reactor safety, radioactivity waste management-disposal-decommissioning, radiological impact on man/ environment and mastering the events of the past, i.e., <Col N="1830" /> managing the consequences of Chernobyl and of radioactive areas in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.</P>
    <P>Projects under these five activity areas are invited through a call for proposals published by the Commission and proposals are submitted directly to the Commission by the proposer.  The Commission is then required to select projects based on a fair and equitable evaluation of all proposals by independent experts.  These experts are selected by the commission from different countries within and outside the Community. After an opinion is given by the management committee, the Commission finally negotiates research contracts with successful applicants.  The management committee consists of two members from each member state and advises the Commission. Selected Irish projects provide a support to Irish research in universities and laboratories.</P>
    <P>Last year, national advisory panels were established by the office of science and technology to assist members of the various management committees &mdash; their immediate objective is to address the question of Ireland's national position in relation to Commission proposals for a fifth framework programme which will shortly be presented.  Membership of panels reflect the level of technological research activity in Ireland relevant to specific programmes.  There are four members on the nuclear fission safety committee advisory panel at present: one RPII member, one from my Department, one representing the environmental radioactivity sector and one representative of the medical research sector, these latter being the two main areas where Ireland has received research funding over the past ten to 15 years.  There are no women members as of now. The panel will consider the question of enlarging its membership at its next meeting.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of EU funding under this specific EU nuclear fission safety programme for cancer research of the type mentioned, but the cancer research area of the EU biomedicine and health programme may be of relevance.  One sub-programme of the nuclear fission safety programme relates to research projects into improving the understanding of radiation mechanisms and epidemiology.  An Irish proposal for a research project was submitted into this sub-programme recently but was not supported by the Commission.  Contractual funding to Ireland to date under the current nuclear safety programme amounts to 784,000 MECU compared to 565,000 MECU under the third framework programme.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that no conflict arises in relation to the surveying of the vessel by the marine survey office of my Department.  Nor does the question of unanimity among staff in the Marine Survey Office arise in relation to the condition of the vessel.  The fact is that, since its introduction as a passenger ferry in 1983, the vessel has, as part of its annual survey, been inspected by four different engineer and ship surveyors from the Marine Survey Office, all of whom have declared the vessel to be fit for operation.</P>
      <P>The sole function of the marine survey office in relation to the design of this, or indeed any other passenger ferry, would be to either accept or reject design proposals submitted to it, from the perspective of compliance with relevant passenger ship construction rules and life saving appliance rules.  No member of the Marine Survey Office was involved in the design of the vessel.</P>
      <P>Finally, I have arranged to have details forwarded to the Deputy regarding the individual who, having been successful in his examination by the Marine Survey Office in Dublin on 17 January last, has been approved by my Department to act as Master of the vessel in question from that date.</P>

    <P>* In the case of studies for which management consultants have not been engaged, any costs arising &mdash; travelling expenses &mdash; generally fall to be met from my Department's Vote.  However, the secretary to the task force which conducted the review of biotoxin contamination and monitoring in shellfish was engaged on contract by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, at a cost of £14,213.</P>
    <P>The table does not include other reviews or studies, largely technical or operational in character, initiated in the period in question.</P>
