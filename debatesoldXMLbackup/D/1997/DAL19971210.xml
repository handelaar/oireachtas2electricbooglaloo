      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Sargent.  I now call on Deputy Sargent to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to move the adjournment of today's Dáil business under Standing Order 31 to allow the House to draw up measures to ensure the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government increases investment in primary education given that, despite years of general economic prosperity, Ireland continues to maintain the highest pupil-teacher ratio of all OECD countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8a, motion re referral of Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill, 1997, to Select Committee; No. 8, motion re draft agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on the winding up of the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust; No. 13, Financial Motions by the Minister for Finance (resumed); No. 1, Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1997 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second and Remaining Stages shall be taken on the conclusion of Private Members' Business and the Order shall not resume thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. today and business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m.; Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8 shall be decided without debate; the Second and Remaining Stages of No. 1 shall be taken today and the <Col N="722" /> following arrangements shall apply: (i) the proceedings on Second Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion after one hour and the contributions shall be as follows: (a) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister of State or of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (b) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (c) Members may share time; and (d) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes; and (ii) the proceedings on the Committee and Remaining Stages, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. tonight by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Private Members' Business shall be No. 23, motion re Irish Rail service (resumed).</P>

      <P>There are three proposals to put to the House.  Is the late sitting agreed to?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8 agreed to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 8 relates to the Irish Soldiers and Sailors Land Trust and it is appropriate to deal with the matter without debate because it is not contentious, but before we agree to do so and because it relates to Irish soldiers we should express the House's concern at the injury suffered by a member of our current Defence Forces.  I speak of Laura Guerin who was seriously injured in military exercises in Fermoy yesterday.  I am sure the House wishes to express its appreciation to members of the armed forces who undertake, even in peace time, a very dangerous and difficult job in which they put their lives at risk.  It is appropriate, particularly in the light of current controversies about other matters affecting the Defence Forces, that the House should express its appreciation for the work of the armed forces at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We extend our sympathies to Private Laura Guerin and hope she will make a successful recovery.  We also extend good wishes for the recovery of the other four privates who were also injured.  I am sure the House would also want me to ask the Minister to report on these matters in due course.  He informed me last night that he had ordered an immediate technical inquiry and that as soon as all the facts are known to him he would like to make a statement to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the concerns expressed by the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, but I am concerned about another matter.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain why a motion to note the commencement of the United Nations Human Rights Year on 10 December agreed to be taken on today's Order of Business has been removed <Col N="723" /> and why our amendments to that were not accepted without debate.  I presume the Government is not opposed to our amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Quinn correctly said, it was intended that we would have a non-substantive motion prepared to mark the commencement of the UN Human Rights Year and that was done.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of amendments were put forward by his party which were substantial and not related only to that motion.</P>
      <P>Most of the amendments related to the terms of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment but we would need time to prepare a debate on that.  A Bill is also in preparation on these issues.</P>
      <P>A non-substantive motion was prepared to mark the commencement today of the UN Human Rights Year.  This is an important year which will culminate in 12 months time in the 50th anniversary of the signing of the universal declaration.  It was not possible to deal with the motion on today's Order of Business because of the detailed amendments which were tabled.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8 agreed to?  We cannot proceed with questions on the Order of Business until agreement is reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be disruptive. Today marks the commencement of the UN Human Rights Year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may raise the issue at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Ceann Comhairle, I think this is the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is currently considering proposals for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8.  I call on Deputy De Rossa to comment on the Army incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the comments already made on the injuries to Laura Guerin and her four colleagues.  I wish them a speedy and full recovery.  To a large extent, we underrate and underestimate the role the Army plays in the security of the State, international affairs and peacekeeping.  We should find some way of marking their contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to get the agreement of the House on the proposals for dealing with Nos. 8<i>a</i> and 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will not agree to those until such time as we get an explanation from the Taoiseach on the non-substantive motion.  If we get such an explanation we will happily agree to the proposals and not divide the House on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government proposed, and we supported, a non-substantive motion to mark the commencement of this UN Human Rights Year.  In view of <Col N="724" /> the fact that a former President of this State holds the highest UN post an Irish person has ever held and has specific responsibility in the area of human rights, we thought it would be appropriate, without debate, to note that Ireland would support three particular measures.  The measures referred to are the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment and Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights.  We were proposing that these matters, which I presume are not opposed by the Government parties, be taken without debate.  The Taoiseach's reply that the Government was not prepared for a debate was not appropriate as the matter did not require any debate or preparation.</P>
    <P>The House can have a substantive debate on the issue in the new year but we wanted the UN Commissioner for Human Rights to receive some kind of recognition on the commencement of a year dedicated to human rights from the country from which she comes.  I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider this item.  Otherwise, among all the nations of the world, Ireland will be silent on the day on which the UN Human Rights Year commences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is completely out of order for the Deputy to make a statement at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was well briefed on this issue. If the object of what we are trying to do is to have a non-substantive motion prepared for this occasion, I ask the Deputy to consider supporting the motion which was tabled.  The Labour Party tabled amendments to the motion with which I have no great difficulty but they are outside of the remit of what we are proposing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was wrong with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are amendments to conventions which this country has not yet signed and which require legislation.  If amendments are introduced now, there must be some debate on them.  It is a little odd to suggest, without debate, amendments to motions regarding conventions which this country has not yet signed.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the commencement of the UN Human Rights Year with a non-substantive motion.  That is still my wish and it can be done today, tomorrow or next week.  The other issues will be debated in the context of legislation which will be introduced next year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I hope that explanation is clear.</P>

      <P>Has any progress been made on drafting a resolution to condemn racism in our community because, while it is perfectly appropriate to be concerned about human rights worldwide, we have a problem of racist attitudes being displayed, on walls and in personal intercourse between people, in this country?  The House needs to adopt, preferably before Christmas, an agreed motion condemning this phenomenon, and to show the sort of political leadership the country needs on this matter, which could get out of hand if not dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach and former Taoiseach are committed to the strategic management initiative and, therefore, are very anxious to expedite the business of the House.  We need to take No. 24 on today's Order Paper without debate.

      <P>We need a debate rather than merely to pass a motion without debate.  It is not only the terms of the resolution that are important but also the discussion in the House. This issue arose in the context of criticism of a Member's comments and the possibility that they might be misconstrued as representing a certain attitude in the House, which they do not.  We need a formal debate in the House not necessarily today but when the motion is properly prepared so that party leaders and others can clearly express their abhorrence of any form of racism in our society.  We should work on an agreed motion along those lines.</P>

Yesterday the Taoiseach mentioned that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill would be introduced in February.  Previously it was mentioned that it would be introduced in late November.  Why have the goalposts been moved? Will the Taoiseach consider establishing a select committee on food safety to ensure people can be questioned in public and public confidence in food is maintained?</P>

      <P>On the Government's legislative list there are five Bills dealing with environment and local government matters, including the housing of travellers, architectural protection and the funding of local government.  None of these Bills has been published.  Yet, this week the Minister for the Environment and Local Government published a Bill which was not included on the legislative list and which deals with the appointment of extra members to An Bord Pleanála. Does the Government attach a higher priority to the appointment of extra members to An Bord Pleanála than to the housing of travellers?  When will we see the Bill dealing with the housing of travellers which the Taoiseach promised would be introduced before Christmas?</P>

After the Bill passed Second Stage a large number of submissions and legal opinions were received.  There are enough amendments to warrant the redrafting of the Bill and the officials are working their way through them.  We can either proceed with a Bill that would be at variance with practically every group concerned or examine the submissions in detail.  If it was only a case of taking a large number of amendments, I would suggest we proceed with the Bill, but I am advised by the draftsmen and others involved that the submissions change the Bill fundamentally.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: On a day set aside as human rights day, will the Taoiseach and the Government bring forward a simple amendment to the Refugee Act which would overcome the alleged legal difficulties that are delaying its implementation and which are causing ongoing uncertainty, suffering and trauma for many refugees? It could be sorted out by an amendment which could be put through the House in a day.</P>

      <P>I answer this question practically every day.  I do not object to that, but the Refugee Act cannot be implemented until the High Court injunction is dealt with.  This is preventing the appointment of the refugee applications commissioner.  No applications can be processed until the commissioner is appointed. That is the legal advice but, as I stated earlier, the UN commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have concluded an agreement on how existing applications can be dealt with and details of that will be announced in the next few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last July the Government decided to transfer responsibility for local development and related matters from the Department of the Taoiseach to the newly created Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  My Department's mandate covers some of the core areas of local development, all of which have a common goal &mdash; social inclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key elements in the mandate include the following &mdash;to implement the operational programme for local, urban and rural development; to implement the EU urban initiative; to co-ordinate local development initiatives and prepare for the post-1999 transition to an integrated local development and local government system; to co-ordinate overall Government policy on local development through chairing the interdepartmental policy group on local development; to promote the integrated development of the most disadvantaged urban communities by ensuring their needs are addressed on a priority and co-ordinated basis in conjunction with area partnership <Col N="737" /> companies and by relevant public agencies and to take responsibility for the national drugs strategy team.</P>
    <P>I intend to focus on those areas for which I have specific responsibility, namely local development and the national anti-drugs strategy.  I refer to the issue of drugs.  I have been given responsibility for the co-ordination of the Government's overall strategy to reduce demand for illegal drugs.  The previous Government's strategy to deal with the problem of drugs demand was developed in two reports prepared by a ministerial task force chaired by my constituency colleague, Deputy Rabbitte.  I will first comment on one aspect of the Government's approach which not so much differs from that of the previous Administration, but rather reflects a different emphasis.</P>
    <P>The link between drug abuse and social and economic disadvantage is well documented and it is universally agreed that the only effective long-term solution to the drugs problem is in the area of prevention.  The emphasis is on responding to the drugs problem in the context of dealing with the wider issue of social exclusion.  This emphasis is reflected in two key policy decisions made since the change of Government.  First, by placing responsibility for co-ordinating the drug strategy in the same Department as that of local development and sport, the Government has signalled its intention to place considerable emphasis on prevention rather than cure.  Second, the Cabinet drugs committee, established on foot of a recommendation in the first ministerial task force report, has now been reconstituted into a wider Cabinet committee dealing with social inclusion, local development and drugs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national drug strategy, this committee considers issues pertaining to local development policy and the national anti-poverty strategy.  The committee aims to ensure that the considerable resources being expended on tackling social exclusion are co-ordinated and properly targeted.</P>
    <P>A national drug strategy team has been set up to ensure the effective implementation of the Government strategy to reduce drugs demand.  Under the revised arrangements, following the change of Government, this team reports directly to me.  The team effectively replicates at the centre the partnership approach of the local drug task forces which have been set up in the areas worst hit by the drugs scourge.  The team comprises representatives of relevant Government Departments and State agencies with two persons from the voluntary and community sectors.  It operates on the principle set out in the strategic management initiative for tackling issues which cut across a number of Government Departments or agencies.  The SMI approach involves a team effort towards achieving the desired result, in this case a reduction in drugs demand rather than leaving each Department or agency to its own devices.</P>
    <P>Local drug task forces have been established in Dublin and on the north side of Cork city.  They <Col N="738" /> were set up to bring together relevant statutory agencies with representatives of the community and local voluntary organisations to develop a locally based response to the drugs problem.  The establishment of the task forces was a recognition of the need to target efforts and resources in a number of key areas where the drugs problem is prevalent, to integrate drug service provision in these areas and to give local communities a real and meaningful say in the development and delivery of strategies to tackle drug abuse in their areas.  The involvement of local communities in the process is important for a number of reasons. It draws on their vast knowledge and experience of the local drugs problem and more importantly, it gives the people most affected by the problem the opportunity to make a positive contribution towards resolving it.  I am conscious that the sheer scale of the drugs problem in some areas has led to a feeling of abandonment in the local community, a crisis of confidence in the institutions of the State and wider society.</P>
    <P>The spirit of community which traditionally has been a strong feature of life in many of these areas has been severely tested and, in some instances, replaced by fear, anger and frustration. It is our intention that these communities, assisted by agencies such as the health board and Dublin Corporation will be given the support to develop their own local approach to the drugs problem.  Thirteen task forces were set up in Dublin and Cork city.  Each of these has prepared an action plan to tackle the drugs problem in its area and funding of £10 million has been provided to implement the plans.  The plans contain a broad range of strategies combining elements of treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  Many of the plans contain strategies which place emphasis on the development of youth and sport activities, to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>Recognising that communities can play a positive role in assisting the Garda and other statutory agencies in curbing the supply of drugs locally, a number of plans also include proposals for a local response to the supply issue.  The various strategies have been tailored to reflect the local situation and to meet the needs of each area but at the same time to conform to the principles of best practice.</P>
    <P>Many of the plans contain innovative ways of dealing with the drugs problem.  It is proposed to initiate a number of these proposals on a pilot basis and, if successful, to integrate them into mainstream services.  In some instances drug services will be developed on a partnership basis between the statutory and voluntary and community sectors.  In other cases, specific agencies will take the lead in delivering particular aspects of the overall strategy.</P>
    <P>Many of the plans contain proposals to fill gaps in current service provision which can occur when a number of agencies have separate responsibilities for different aspects of the problem.  One example of such a gap arises in relation to the case of treatment services for drug misusers who <Col N="739" /> come into contact with the criminal justice system. As responsibility for their welfare transfers from agency to agency, there is a real danger that they may slip through the net due to the lack of an appropriate tracking system.  Equally, agencies such as FÁS and the local employment service, whose primary objective is to create job opportunities for the unemployed, are often not structured adequately to cater for the specific needs of rehabilitated drug misusers in their attempts to obtain employment.  These are some examples of issues which are being addressed by the task forces on a multi-disciplinary basis.</P>
    <P>Efforts are also being made to eliminate duplication among agencies delivering drug programmes and services with a view to achieving better cost effectiveness.  It is hoped this can be done by pooling and making better use of existing resources.  I hope Deputies will have gleaned from this short description of the contents of the plans prepared by the task forces the tremendous contribution which they can make to tackling the drugs problems in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>A number of plans contained strategies which placed emphasis on the development of youth and sport activities.  In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance announced the Government's intention to set aside £1.25 million for a youth services development fund to come into operation from next year.  This fund will focus on the development of services for young people in disadvantaged areas where there is a significant drugs problem.  While the scheme will be administered through the youth services section of the Department of Education and Science, arrangements are being made to ensure it is effectively integrated with the strategies being developed by the local drugs task forces.  Payments will be made on the recommendation of the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs, at which I represent the interests of the drug strategy team.  The detailed arrangements for the administration of this fund are being finalised and will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Disadvantaged areas including those with a significant drug problem will also benefit from a variety of other measures announced in the budget. These include the continuing and increased commitments in relation to the targeting of sports initiatives for young people in areas of disadvantage, a community development programme of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, community based projects by the Probation and Welfare Service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the proposed tax relief scheme for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Local development is about engaging and harnessing the energies of local communities which are a tremendous resource in themselves.  They represent a huge pool of creativity, intelligence and dynamism.  That is a resource we can use or lose.  We can bring it into the system or we can lock it out.  If we lock it out everybody loses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Local development policy is about devising and supporting programmes and structures which allow the great untapped resources of our local community to be developed and applied to meeting the challenges facing them.</P>
    <P>I cannot over emphasise the importance of involving local communities as partners in the local development process.  Since area based partnerships were first introduced on a pilot basis in 1991 there has been much evidence to suggest that this approach works to benefit communities in need.</P>
    <P>My Department oversees the implementation of the operational programme for local, urban and rural development.  It is also involved with the implementation of the European Union's Urban initiative.  These programmes represent the foundations upon which community support frameworks, such as the area partnerships, can be built.  It should be noted that the local urban and rural development programme has exceeded all expectations in its job creation achievements.  At the end of June this year over 16,900 additional jobs had been created and almost 4,000 new businesses were established.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the social partners as equal participants is vital to the success of the action programmes initiated.  These include the creation of employment opportunities, education and training initiatives and community development projects.  Some of our most socially excluded, the education under-achievers, early school leavers and the long-term unemployed, are targeted by these programmes.  We know the outcome of self-perpetuating, long-term unemployment and disadvantage is stigmatised in depressed and marginalised communities.  No society can be at peace with itself in the face of such exclusion.  That is why social inclusion must continue to be at the heart of local development policy.</P>
    <P>Over the past five or six years we have been engaged in a major experiment in local development. This has generated a large number of groups, programmes and project initiatives.  Over the next year we will have to examine the best and most useful elements of the local development process.  In this examination, it is the needs of the people which must be paramount, not the vested interests of organisations.  We want to preserve what is most useful to the people in local communities.  We will then have to work to ensure these elements are preserved and strengthened in the post-1999 context.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the local development experience to see what can be mainstreamed into the work of various Departments and agencies. Our experience in local development has taught us the value of listening to our own people and of engaging the creativity and intelligence of local people in tackling challenges which confront them.  Even in the most disadvantaged communities, we have seen that engaging local people in the process of tackling their own problems can result in meaningful change. <Col N="741" /> There are many schemes, agencies, Departments, State supported organisations, etc. supplying services which impact on local development. Despite this, we continue to have severe social problems in many localities.  I conclude from this that the real needs of some of the most disadvantaged communities are not being met and the State may not be getting best value for money.  It suggests there is an urgent need for better targeting and integration in the delivery of State supported services in areas of great disadvantage. There is a need for greater co-ordination and better use of existing resources.</P>
    <P>There has been an increasing acceptance of the need for improved co-ordination across the State funded sector.  We have seen experiments under programmes like Operation Dóchas, the drugs task force initiatives and the area partnerships, and we sought to involve local communities in a more meaningful way.  There have been initiatives also to tackle certain problems in a more integrated fashion, yet there is no one programme which attempts to integrate all of the State funded services which are being or should be delivered to disadvantaged areas.  In short, there has been no model to allow for a co-ordinated, properly targeted, community informed blitz of the most disadvantaged areas with the full range of State services.  This is where the real gap arises and this is the gap we must close.</P>
    <P>That is the reason the budget contains provision for the funding of a pilot project aimed at developing a model to secure the integrated delivery of State funded services in a number of areas of severe social disadvantage.  This pilot project will be overseen by the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development, which I chair.  It will focus on areas of around 2,500 to 5,000 households and will build on the valuable experience gained by area partnerships and similar groups with whom we will work closely.  By securing greater co-ordination and integration of the range of State services, it will help to strengthen the effectiveness of the partnership process.  If the pilot project is to be effective, we will have to cut through old traditions of non consultation, non co-operation and non co-ordination. This process is fully supported by the Cabinet committee on social exclusion.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government is addressing the issues of exclusion, marginalisation and poverty. It is clear that tackling disadvantage in areas of high unemployment is a major priority.  The Government is determined State agencies must be active, flexible and willing participants in the process of tackling social inclusion.  This means defining and supporting a culture of partnership and participation and a willingness to listen, especially to those who have genuine needs.  The budget is clearly showing a commitment to a more co-ordinated and integrated delivery of services to disadvantaged communities.  The Government's commitment can be seen through the commitment in the budget of a further £282 million to social inclusion measures.  This means <Col N="742" /> that the Government has already exceeded its commitments under Partnership 2000 and has done so in two rather than three years.  Nothing could be a greater indication of the Government's commitment to tackling the issue of social inclusion.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>

      <P>This budget was a missed opportunity. The middle class will be put under further pressure and the poor will be poorer.  This was a rich man's budget, as acknowledged in a recent opinion poll, and the people will respond to that at a later stage.  We had an opportunity because there has never been as much money available, but the Minister for Finance and the Government gave in to the demands of the Progressive Democrats and to the rich people.</P>
      <P>I hope the Celtic tiger will be put down once and for all because it only benefits the rich.  It means nothing to the middle class, who are under further pressure.  The poor have gained nothing from the Celtic tiger.  They are getting poorer and every report from organisations dealing with the poor &mdash; the Combat Poverty Agency, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others &mdash; know that nothing has been done to assist these people when the opportunity existed.</P>
      <P>As the Opposition spokesperson on agriculture, I am bitterly disappointed about the blockade of agricultural food into Britain.  I am appalled the Taoiseach did not call for an EU meeting on this matter.  Britain must decide whether it is a member of the Commonwealth or the EU, but it cannot have it both ways.  Britain takes over the Presidency of the EU in January 1998, and our people are obliged to adhere to EU regulations, but I am sick and tired of all the regulations coming from Europe.  Ireland has always adhered to these regulations yet when our farmers want to bring their goods into Britain, nothing is done for them by this Government.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has let down the farmers.  Tony Blair should have been told by the EU that law and order must prevail.  Farmers blockading ports throughout Britain should not have been allowed to dump Irish beef in the sea or search lorries to see which goods were being carried.  Is that the action of a country that is a member of the EU? Britain must decide whether it is part of Europe. If it is not, it can run its own ship but if it is part of Europe, it must obey EU regulations and allow Irish farmers bring their beef into Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food to show some back-bone. The Minister for Health and Children has destroyed the boned beef industry with his reckless statement which was not even necessary.  He should issue a counter statement to the effect that Irish beef is the safest in the world.  The consumers <Col N="743" /> have continued to buy boned beef.  I spoke to a butcher yesterday who told me he never sold as much boned beef as he did over the weekend.  The consumers are happy that Irish beef is good and that message should be sent out loud and clear.</P>
    <P>The message coming from this Government to the farmers, particularly in the west, is that it does not care about agriculture.  When the Estimates were announced we saw that £35 million had been taken out of the Agriculture Vote for headage payments.  Of that money, about £23 million has had to be brought back again because of pressure from Fianna Fáil backbenchers, but there is still a shortfall.  The wrong signals are being sent out.</P>
    <P>Farmers have never had a more difficult year than this one.  They have had bad weather, weak prices and now they cannot bring their goods into Britain.  It is time the Government, and Fianna Fail Deputies in particular, showed a commitment to farmers.</P>
    <P>What kind of message is being given to young farmers?  I know farmers who wish to retire and hand the farm over to their sons or daughters, but their children will not take over the farm while the average farm income is only £10,000, £11,000 or £12,000 per year.  One could not raise a family on a farm with that kind of income.  The uncertainty surrounding farming must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the issue of social welfare. Last year, when the coalition Government was in power, there was criticism from the Fianna Fáil benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. N. O'Keeffe Mr. N. O'Keeffe">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the &ldquo;measly&rdquo; £3 rise.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State because I thought he, as a representative from rural Ireland, would fight for the less well off.  They received a £3 social welfare increase.  People in rural areas must buy petrol for their cars to bring children to school, to go shopping to and from town, and to attend church.  Most cars are ten or 12 years old.  In rural areas we have no public transport like the DART or Luas.  We depend on the car which is an essential part of rural life.  On the one hand the Minister of State gives people £3 but takes £2 back on petrol.  When they fill in their income form for the county councils, £1 is taken from them by way of an increase in rent.</P>
      <P>The budget did not benefit the small person; it benefited those earning £100,000 who will be £2,000 better off.  Such people have already gained enough with the pilot schemes, which I will discuss later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The children's allowance is the one form of income that a housewife and mother gets into her hand.  She is sure of that money.  If a husband is fond of a drink, he may not hand over his social welfare payments to his wife.  However, a woman can use the children's allowance to buy a pair of shoes, clothes or toys and to pay for items at <Col N="744" /> school.  Nearly every day a child goes to school he or she must bring a few pounds for one thing or another.  The children's allowance is the one payment women know they can depend on, yet this Government gave them a measly increase.</P>
    <P>One of the many things the last Government did right was to give children's allowance increases to women at home and they used them well.  I was disappointed the Government did not continue that because women should be looked after.  Women have been housekeepers looking after their children and husbands, but for many years they have not been given the respect and understanding they deserve by many Governments.</P>
    <P>There are many women in the workplace who would prefer to be at home.  They are not working because they wish to but because it is a necessity. They have to work to pay their mortgages and raise their families.  I was disappointed in the budget.  For many years politicians spoke about looking after women at home.  This was an opportunity to give such women some kind of income and assistance.  There are women in good jobs, and not so good jobs, who, by the time they have paid the child minder, bring home very little money.  If the Government would help such women by giving them £50 or £100 per week to stay at home, they would do so.  They would feel it was better for them to stay at home.  They would have as much out of that system as they do by going out to work at 6 o'clock in the morning, taking their children to school, coming back at dinner hour to get them something to eat, back again in the evening to look after them and helping them at night with their homework.  Some of these poor women do not get to bed until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning.  They have to do this day in and day out.  The budget presented an opportunity for the Government to recognise the role that women play in society and at home.</P>

      <P>Carers should be looked after but this Government did not do anything for them. The greatest disgrace concerns home helps.  It is a disgrace that the health boards, the Government and we as politicians have allowed such people only £2.20 an hour.  It was £1 an hour in our region up to last year.  It is time the Government told the health boards that home helps should receive at least £5 an hour for looking after the elderly at home.  They provide a good service and we should examine that immediately.</P>
      <P>I want to say something about the back to work scheme to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, as well as to social welfare officers and those in charge of employment offices.  Many people have come to me in the past 15 or 18 months who have found employment. However, they had been working for five or six months when they discovered that the back to work scheme was available.  The Government is being dishonest because if somebody is unemployed for five or six years and then gets a job, they should qualify for the back to work scheme. They should not be barred from the scheme just because someone in the social welfare office did not tell them about it, although a colleague at work did.  I have met people who were back at work for four or five weeks or even three months, but they did not qualify for the back to work scheme.  It is wrong and dishonest if people are not allowed to use the scheme because they did not know about it, yet qualified for it under every criterion.</P>
      <P>The system of qualification should be changed immediately.  The Minister should issue a directive today stating that the long-term unemployed who get a job will benefit from the back to work scheme even if they had not been told about it.  It is morally right to do so.  The Minister should deal with that quickly in the Finance Bill that will come before the Dáil in the near future.  It is only right and proper to correct this because the situation is wrong according to the spirit of the legislation. I have already written to the Minister about it and he should now change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain categories of people on low incomes who receive social welfare are allowed to have their rent deducted at source.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs should make this compulsory for anyone on the social welfare system.  Many constituents of mine are in difficulty with rent arrears and want to have their rent deducted at source from their social welfare payments but are not legally allowed to do so. The Minister should change that system so that all categories of social welfare recipients can have their rent deducted at source.  If a family knows its rent is being so deducted, at least the house is there for the wife and children who will not be threatened with eviction by the local authority. That change is a necessity.  If people want to have <Col N="746" /> their rent deducted at source they should be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>This budget was a wasted opportunity in relation to housing.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive for young couples to buy a house.  We hear much about the Celtic tiger, but many people are tired listening to reports about the Celtic tiger.  A £3,000 grant is provided for first time buyers of new houses less than 1,360 square feet, but first time buyers of second-hand houses receive no grant.  On the contrary, they are penalised by having to pay stamp duty.  I accept stamp duty should be paid on second and subsequent houses, but for first-time buyers of second-hand houses it should be abolished.  The Minister should consider that matter, particularly in view of the high price of houses.</P>
    <P>People from my town have to go elsewhere to buy property because it is too expensive in the town.  The local authority hopes to provide cheap sites for young couples on the housing list and will put forward proposals to that effect in the new year.  I had hoped the Government would reintroduce house grants for people on middle incomes, but that was not done.  There are many schemes such as the seaside resort pilot scheme, section 23 and so on, which assist millionaires. People from Cork, Dublin, London and New York can buy three or four houses in my town while the natives cannot afford them.  People from outside the area are supported by tax breaks, and this budget assists them further.  The upper class, with whom the Progressive Democrats deal, receive much support, which is unfair. I raised the question of the seaside resort pilot scheme with the Minister, Deputy McDaid.  I know of areas where 120 or 130 houses were built under this scheme and most of them were bought by people not living in the county.  The result is that the houses are empty for the winter months while the natives have to travel 20 miles to rent houses and flats.  There are no tax breaks for those people.  Where houses are built under this scheme, a percentage of them should be made available at a reasonable price to people on the housing list.  My town will be at a disadvantage as a result of the scheme because tourists will live there for six or eight weeks in the summer but they will not be there in the winter to look after schools, churches and hospitals or to support the shopkeepers.  We will pay a penalty in future for this scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister should not talk about the past.  We are approaching a new year, we have a new Government and a new Minister for Finance, but he let us down last week in terms of health services.  People are dying while waiting for heart by-passes and there is a delay of two or three years for hip replacement operations. People from the west who are dying with cancer cannot get into St. Luke's Hospital because there are no beds available.  It is time the Government got its priorities right and looked after those in need.  Ben Dunne and other millionaires are well able to look after themselves.  Public representatives should look after people who are not able to look after themselves, such as those with disabilities and handicaps.  Shame on the Government for letting down those people.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to do something about the blockades which affect this country.  If there were more people like Feargal Quinn of Superquinn, who promotes Irish goods, we would have a better country.  I compliment him and hope the people support stores such as his rather than the multinationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ring for sharing his time although he may disagree with some of my sentiments.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance on his first budget, there is much to recommend it.  On tax reductions, bands and allowances were increased in recent budgets and, while there is much to recommend that course, a large element of the PAYE sector felt alienated. I welcome the new rates of 24 and 46 per cent and particularly the intention, if resources allow it, to achieve a 20 per cent standard rate over the next few budgets.  I look forward to the day when, to help increase productivity, the benefit to workers is greater than 50 per cent of their additional earnings.  Any measure brought in to assist in achieving this goal should be viewed as a reward for hard work, not a social exclusion measure.  I find it difficult to comprehend advocates of better services, more housing and greater benefits who decry measures taken to increase incentives to create wealth, without which social services cannot be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many commentators have depicted this as a Progressive Democrats' budget, but one aspect that does not have the stamp of the Tánaiste is the £20 million grant to the GAA to assist in the refurbishment of Croke Park.  I commend the Minister and the Taoiseach for having the courage to take this step.  The GAA has initiated a radical plan to construct a state-of-the-art stadium and, while it is difficult to reconcile the grant <i>vis-a-vis</i> the provision of £3 million for people <Col N="748" /> with physical and sensory disabilities, with many people on hospital waiting lists, it gives me great pleasure to see wheelchair-bound people use the lift in the new stand at Croke Park and view matches from a sheltered location as opposed to the exposed area underneath the Nally stand.  We cannot measure the number of people the GAA have kept off hospital waiting lists over the years, by encouraging them to participate in sport. Week in, week out people give assistance to the GAA without ever receiving remuneration.  I hope, when other sporting organisations come forward with such innovations, they too will receive positive treatment.</P>
    <P>There are areas of vital importance which the Minister has neglected.  The budget has done nothing to address the serious problem of housing. It is unsatisfactory to say that take home pay has improved.  House prices have increased by 50 per cent in the past three years and there is a predicted increase of 12 per cent for the coming year.  Mortgage relief has been reduced to the standard rate in recent years while the first time buyer's grant has remained at £3,000.  I would have liked the Minister to have increased significantly the first-time buyer's grant and extended it to second-hand houses since stamp duty on second-hand houses has become very punitive. Will he consider changing the price ranges falling into the various tax categories?</P>
    <P>In the course of his Budget Statement the Minister referred to a special scheme for investment in certain hotels and listed seven counties in which there are insufficient three-star or higher standard hotels, among them Mayo where I am led to believe, according to the Irish Hotels Federation guide, there are 13 such hotels.  I wish them luck.  However, County Wicklow, which was not included, also has 13 such hotels and County Donegal, which is included, has 25.  On the face of it, there appears to be some great discrepancy there since County Wicklow, which is not included in the scheme, has 13 hotels of three-star or higher standard while County Donegal, which is included, has 25 of that standard.  I have no doubt that if I examined the assistance granted in recent years I would discover that County Donegal would have received far greater assistance than County Wicklow.  Yet County Wicklow, located on the doorstep of 30 per cent of our population, is in dire need of additional high-class accommodation but has been neglected under the terms of this scheme.</P>
    <P>I submitted a rural renewal project to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation for the Wicklow-north Carlow area and sent a copy to the Minister for Finance.  I appeal to him to seriously examine its feasibility and merits since I am convinced that minimum Exchequer investment would yield an excellent return.  I ask the Minister to include provision for that project and hotels in County Wicklow in the provisions of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tabled amendment No. 57 to the Finance Bill in April l997 which, if <Col N="749" /> my recollection is correct, involved an amendment of section 37 of the Finance Act, l995 and would include Bray as a designated seaside resort. Therefore, I am very disappointed to note he has not included it in his budgetary provisions.  When the necessary review is completed I hope Bray will be included under the forthcoming Finance Bill because I see no reason for its exclusion.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Minister's sentiments that our agriculture and food industry is essential to the wellbeing of our economy and shall monitor closely what measures will be introduced to assist this most important sector.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the grant of £20 million for the redevelopment of the GAA headquarters at Croke Park, I fear it might send out the wrong signal.  In view of a commitment to the funding of suitable millennium celebratory projects, the Minister might consider a gesture to the disabled, say, in the form of the construction of a Cheshire Home or similar project.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Timmins' contribution was very measured, I share his sentiments about the special allocation to the GAA to redevelop its excellent headquarters at Croke Park. Although many Members and their constituents experience considerable difficulty in obtaining tickets for major events there, it must be remembered that those headquarters belong to all members of the GAA throughout the 32 counties. As Deputy Timmins rightly said, those who participate in the work of GAA clubs in parishes throughout the 32 counties, who work day and night throughout the summer and winter to provide recreational facilities for our young people, deserve special commendation.  Its further development is welcomed by all right-thinking people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring must have forgotten his party was in Government up to the end of June last, or perhaps he believes, as do many people throughout the country, that Fine Gael was in Government but not in power, that that Administration was dominated by the Labour and Democratic Left parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ring also referred to hospital waiting lists for hip replacement and heart transplant operations, or other surgical procedures.  He quite rightly said it is deplorable that very many people endure enormous pain and suffering awaiting admission to hospital for such surgical procedures. However, I should point out that in l997 the relevant funding for health services was provided by the Government he supported in this House for two and a half years and that his Fine Gael Minister for Health failed to allocate sufficient resources to tackle our many health problems. Those of us who have been Members of this House for some years were well aware of <Col N="750" /> additional delays in admissions to hospitals over the past two and a half years.  I am equally aware that the present Minister for Health and Children and the Government are committed to providing the extra resources needed to speed up surgical procedures, thus abolishing those deplorable hospitals waiting lists.</P>
    <P>This budget was introduced against the background of an 8 per cent economic growth forecast for the year l997, with exports and prevailing low inflation contributing enormously to the strength of our economy which has grown even stronger through the contributions of all sectors of our society.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have been afforded an opportunity of increasing employment.  It is predicted that by the end of this year there will be 50,000 more people at work than at this time last year, which is indeed to be welcomed.  However, I am disappointed none of the inward investment here, which while very welcome, reaches any of the areas I represent in the Border region.  The Cavan-Monaghan and neighbouring constituencies on the southern side of the Border suffered immeasurably over the past 27 years from the political difficulties in the area.  Throughout those years we were told by successive Governments, of different political hues and all State agencies it was not possible to attract inward investment to these areas or create employment opportunities because of political difficulties.  While that era of violence is behind us in the province of Ulster, we have not seen any fruits in terms of economic development or increased employment in that region.  I appeal to the Government and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to give special recognition to the needs of the Border region.  It is in dire need of investment to underpin and consolidate the overall peace process on both sides of the Border within the province of Ulster.  In this respect also we need to provide our young people with employment opportunities and keep them in gainful employment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to learn that farm incomes will drop in l997.  Quite rightly the Minister for Agriculture and Food referred last evening to the scandalous circumstances which prevailed at British ports over the past ten days.  It is scandalous and unacceptable that the British Government did not face up to its responsibilities to ensure that free trade would not be impeded, and the terms and conditions of the Single European Act would be adhered to.  There is no point in Britain being at the Council of Ministers of Agriculture in Brussels, participating in decisions, agreeing to abide by various regulations if it will not then enforce them on its own soil.  I was indeed glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, travelled to Downing Street last week and made strong recommendations and objections to the British Minister for Agriculture and Food.  I was also glad the Taoiseach spoke directly to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, on this issue, one of crucial importance to our rural and urban communities alike.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> On the Order of Business this morning the Taoiseach informed the House that some progress had been made in clearing corridors to allow articulated trucks to travel through but more progress must be made if our export trade is not to be damaged irreparably.  I exhort the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Taoiseach and other relevant Government Ministers to pursue with the utmost vigour the need to ensure that our export trade is not further impeded.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with one aspect of this budget in relation to agriculture, that is that the suspension of the control of farmyard pollution scheme was not lifted.  Of course the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Yates and Fine Gael in Government, took that absolutely scandalous decision in April, l995.  I call on my party in Government to lift its suspension as speedily as possible.  We are all aware of the absolute need for proper on-farm facilities.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe knows well, farmers want to put in place proper on-farm facilities and pollution control measures, but there is a huge cost involved for the many small to medium-sized farmers.  It is not possible for them to provide those facilities without grant assistance which, if restored, would create additional employment in rural areas.  We are also aware the farming community always reinvests its income, so that a reinstatement of that scheme by the Government would be most welcome.</P>
    <P>There is much drumlin soil, not free-draining, in my county, where considerable problems are encountered in the provision of additional housing for cattle over the winter months.  That scheme is of particular importance to my region. I ask the Minister of State to pursue with his colleagues in Government and the Minister for Finance the provision of the necessary resources to reintroduce that scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ring referred to the house reconstruction grant scheme and such a scheme is necessary. At a time when our economy, country and society have developed so positively, it is unfortunate that so many people are living in deplorable housing conditions.  Probably not a day passes without constituents contacting a rural Deputy regarding the condition of their houses which lack basic sanitary facilities.  Many of them are elderly people, whose only income is their weekly pensions, and they do not have the resources to provide proper facilities.  It is not beyond the financial capacity of our Government to provide a scheme that would ensure that everybody could live in decent conditions.  It is deplorable that many elderly people are living in isolated rural houses that lack basic facilities.  Addressing this matter would cost a small amount of properly targeted money.  That would mean so much to so many people and would impose a very small charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I make a special appeal, as I have on many previous occasions in this House, to provide resources for children with special learning disabilities <Col N="752" /> and special tuition needs.  Too many schools, primary schools in particular, do not have access to a remedial teacher.  Too many children with special tuition needs are not getting that tuition.  There is no excuse for not providing the necessary resources to enable those children to get the education they need.  If they do not get the special tuition they need at primary school level they will not have any hope of remaining in close contact with their classmates.  It is vital that those children get the tuition they deserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcGuinness" hpid="Mr. McGuinness Mr. McGuinness">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGuinness</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister in the budget took significant steps to ease the pressure on the weaker members of our society while encouraging and rewarding those companies and individuals who have contributed so much to the current healthy state of our economy. He must be complimented for that.  I am sure he does not need me to tell him to ignore the groans and moans from the ghosts of budgets past and the opportunities lost by those on the benches opposite.  Deputy Ring reached new heights in his description of the previous budget, but it must be remembered that some Members of this House were members of the previous Government.  I have seen little to identify their works with the descriptions outlined by Deputy Ring.  It is surprising that he is within their ranks and the amount of work he outlined has not been achieved.</P>
      <P>If I have any quibble with the budget it is that the handicapped, a relatively small and identifiable group, should have been better provided for. Twice the funding that was provided for them would still be too little, but it would bring worthwhile benefits to a deserving and often over-looked minority.  I ask the Minister to review the funding allocated to that group and to find some way to increase it in the future.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken significant steps to generally help our underprivileged, but we still have a long way to go.  I hope that future budgets will go further in closing the wide gap between the very poor and the well off in our society.  We must not forget there are hundreds of thousands of people whom, to use the Minister's metaphor, &ldquo;the rising tide of affluence&rdquo;, will not reach.  For these people the Celtic tiger is merely an uncaring predator.  We cannot and should not count ourselves successful while so many of our people are genuinely trapped in lives without purpose or dignity. For those people Christmas 1997 will be nothing more than another reminder of how little they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country's economic success and the largely incorrect perception that the poor are doing all right because they are part of the black economy should not blind us to the reality that the majority of those on or below the poverty line benefit from neither.  Many are victims of the more dangerous aspects of the black economy.  &ldquo;Marginalised&rdquo; is a comforting description which suggests &ldquo;nearly there&rdquo;.  We should forget that because we are talking of grinding poverty with too many of our <Col N="753" /> people living way beyond the margin.  That problem and the many social problems it creates will have to be overcome before we can claim success or maturity.  Handouts such as the dole, while necessary, are not enough for people who want to contribute to and play a useful part in our society. Handouts when not part of a coherent caring programme, as is the case here, rob people of their self-esteem and create a culture of powerlessness in families and communities which is corrosive and completely unacceptable.  It is a culture which once established will take generations to eliminate.</P>
    <P>In considering this matter within the context of the budget debate, we should not forget the cost to this country of an increasing number of people who believe our society has nothing to offer them and, consequently, they do not care about its laws or standards.  The cost in terms of drug abuse, lawless-ness and anti-social behaviour of one sort or another is enormous.  The cost in human terms does not bear thinking about.  Ireland is a small country. We have proven ourselves to be an energetic and creative people and as a result our economy is booming.  Surely it is not beyond us to find a different, radical and creative means to overcome the social cancer which is making life unbearable for a significant number of our people.  We could begin by addressing the lack of social housing, which is fast becoming a national scandal.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, which I am sure is no different from other constituencies, the number of houses being provided falls ridiculously short of the number required.  The scale of the problem is highlighted by the fact that only six houses were provided in 1997 to meet the needs of 750 applicants.  A similar number were provided in Carlow.  I am sure the Acting Chairman is well aware of that position.  The number of applications is growing at an alarming rate and we will not meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>The efforts made to provide 26 houses in Carlow town are to be admired, but the Minister's steps in relations to that development are disappointing. I ask the House and the Minister to revisit that problem and to find a solution that will allow those houses to be provided in Carlow. They are required as a matter of urgency and the people involved are committed to the self-help programme, which we must encourage.  Those people are bitterly disappointed.  I urge the Minister to make amends by reaching out to those people and trying to solve that problem by securing those 26 houses which are vital to an urban centre, such as Carlow town, which is continually developing.</P>
    <P>Many young couples, some who have children, are living with their parents, with all the stress and strain that sometimes involves, or they are living in unsuitable accommodation of one sort or another.  Major investment is needed in this area if we are to give some hope to the growing number of young couples who are on the housing list. Local authority and local voluntary housing <Col N="754" /> organisations need much more funding and support. I am sure there is no need to tell the Minister that this is an unhealthy situation that gives rise to other social problems.  The problem is becoming worse and it must be speedily attended to.  I ask the Government to launch a major national housing programme, a social programme that could be directed through local authorities to deliver houses to the many thousands of people, not only in Carlow-Kilkenny but elsewhere, who are on the lengthening housing list.</P>
    <P>Education is an escape route from poverty and we should do everything possible to ensure that children are given equal rights and opportunities within the system.  Furthermore, we should introduce skills based instruction at a very early age in an attempt to maintain interest and encourage involvement in areas where it is perceived necessary. However it is done, education is the foundation on which we can build a better society.  It is also a ladder to a better life which should be available to all.  The cost of not providing a comprehensive educational programme would be far greater than the cost of ensuring the best we can provide is available to all.  This is not happening at the moment and I advise the Minister to consider the plight of the gaelscoil and a number of other schools in Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The gaelscoil has been housed in prefabricated buildings for the past ten years and the vermin problem there is so acute that Kilkenny can now boast the only Irish speaking rats outside the Gaeltacht.  The school is overrun with rats and it is no joke for the parents, children and teachers involved.  Rats are dangerous and prefabs are inadequate.  It is unacceptable, in a country doing as well as ours, that 340 children should have to be educated in such adverse and squalid conditions. I demand that the Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, takes immediate steps to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>Educational problems in Kilkenny do not stop there.  Kilkenny College, the largest boarding school in the south-east, has an application for funding before the Department seeking to upgrade a number of its facilities.  I strongly recommend that the Minister provide the funds to meet the needs of the college without delay.  I hope these will be met in terms of the 1998 budget in order to ensure that student levels can be kept at the correct level.</P>
    <P>Ormonde College, the technical education facility in Kilkenny is, to put it bluntly, falling down.  The roof and fabric of the building has not been maintained and now needs extensive remedial action.  Again, funds must be made available to deal with this problem.  A report on this is with the Minister at the moment in which the required works have been outlined.  Action is needed.  I urge the Minister, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, to take such action immediately.  This problem must be dealt with now; it cannot be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> To have problems in one school is bad enough, to have problems in two is negligent but to have three schools in Kilkenny city in need of attention of one sort or another is disgraceful and I will not rest until something is done about it.</P>
    <P>Budget debates usually centre around how much has been given and how much has been taken away.  Very little attention is given to how we disburse funds and promote initiatives or to how efficient and cost effective our systems are. This area deserves the Minister's close attention when he prepares his next budget and I would like to comment on a number of aspects which might merit inspection.</P>
    <P>It is time to stop the emasculation of local government.  I feel sure that most Members in this House will agree when I say that, for many years now, the power of local government has been steadily eroded.  That is not acceptable; indeed, it is not democratic.</P>
    <P>This erosion of power does not encourage local effort or social cohesion because it undermines local leadership and local pride.  I have no doubt that people want to be responsible for their own affairs and want their county councillors and corporation members to have more power and authority.</P>
    <P>I was Mayor of Kilkenny in 1996 and I was surprised and gratified at the respect and regard accorded to that largely ceremonial role.  It comes as no surprise to me that the Labour Government in England is strengthening the power of local authorities and is behind the move to have a Mayor of Greater London.  It clearly recognises there is a need and demand for a strong local government system.</P>
    <P>We should give our counties much greater power with as little interference as possible from central Government.  Within such a county system, local organisations of all sorts could be encouraged and helped to get involved.  Given a chance, they will get involved and do things for themselves much more efficiently and at much less cost to the Exchequer.  This is the way forward if we want a caring, inclusive and responsible society.  I am quite sure that the social and economic benefits to be derived from it would be substantial.</P>
    <P>As an example of what I mean by local effort, I draw the Minister's attention to the recent flooding in parts of Kilkenny city which affected a relatively small number of houses in John Street, John's quay and Green Street.  This section of the river Nore is the subject of a major Office of Public Works programme.  For very little outlay, a wall could be built to protect the houses regularly affected by flooding but funds are not available. Plans are already in place and a very small amount of money is required to enable local government to deal with a problem which has been causing distress and inconvenience for longer than anyone cares to remember.  I hope the Minister will find enough in his petty cash box to enable these works to proceed without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the initiative of the South-Eastern Health Board to create a medical campus in Kilkenny. This would incorporate paediatrics, an old people's home, a psychiatric unit, a recovery unit, a coronary unit and an up to date general hospital.  The South-Eastern Health Board is attempting to provide a modern medical complex which would be fully capable of providing the usual range of medical services required by a community and a growing urban centre such as Kilkenny with a hinterland which stretches far beyond.  I hope the Minister, through the Department of Health, will be ready, willing and able to support this scheme as it develops.  Department approval and funding are required and I hope the Department of Health and Children will encourage its development and will be enthusiastic in its support and funding.</P>
    <P>It must be clear that I have very little confidence in the system of semi-State bodies and agencies.  There are obvious exceptions to this such as the IDA but a considerable number of these agencies could be closed down tomorrow without anyone noticing.  The rest could be streamlined and made more efficient and cost effective.</P>
    <P>I have said elsewhere &mdash; and I have no qualms about repeating it here &mdash; that we have enough safe hands on our State and semi-State bodies to provide all the goalkeepers for the forthcoming World Cup and sufficient sound men to elect an Irish pope.  Safe hands and sound men are necessary &mdash;prudence and caution are worthwhile virtues which should not be ignored &mdash; but the bias on those boards and bodies which are genuinely worthwhile must be changed.</P>
    <P>Many of our boards and bodies are involved in the disbursement of funds, often involving risk or decisions relating to financial management of one sort or another.  It is perhaps counterproductive and even unfair to place that responsibility in the hands of management committees principally composed of officials and members whose training and possible temperament demand they be cautious and averse to risk.  There is also far too much cross membership of these bodies which only helps to reinforce the prevailing ethos.</P>
    <P>I am certain that giving funds to counties and encouraging local development would be a far cheaper and much more effective way of getting things done.  If we must have semi-State bodies, they should come under the control of individual counties and every effort should be made to encourage the involvement of managers from the highest level of local industry on their committees.</P>
    <P>I commend the budget and its contents and I ask that the relevant Ministers take account of the remarks I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for sharing his time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ring expressed concern in relation to County Mayo.  Is it not true that all the best roads <Col N="757" /> in Ireland lead to Mayo and were constructed during Deputy Ring's fellow Mayo man's, former Deputy Pádraig Flynn, term in office?  I know that we, in Cork, were extremely jealous of the amount of progress made in Mayo over the past decade.</P>
    <P>I welcome the presentation of the second 1997 budget.  I remind Deputy Ring and his colleagues that the first one was presented by the previous Government.  I know the budget is designed to maintain and accelerate the healthy growth we are experiencing in our economy.  Nobody can say this Government has not honoured its electoral mandate.  It has delivered a budget which will encourage enterprise and help create jobs.  The live register figures in Cork have dropped by 10 per cent over the past 12 months.  We have also been fortunate to secure more than 3,300 inward investment jobs in Cork since 26 June.</P>
    <P>This budget will stimulate the economy and allow it to grow at an even greater rate in 1998. It is unfortunate that Deputy Ring cannot accept that the rising tide does lift all boats and that when the economy is doing well, more resources will be available to assist people who are marginalised and in need of help.  I believe this economic growth will enable us to introduce further tax cuts.  The current 2p in the £ reduction in the higher and standard tax rates is the first step in an overall substantial reduction in tax rates.  This is essential to provide an incentive to those who are unemployed and who have justly complained for many years at what they saw as an unfair burden on the PAYE worker.  This is a long awaited first step towards giving equality of treatment to this large section of our working population.  Tax rates for employees must be in line with those prevailing in other EU countries.</P>
    <P>I am delighted old age pensioners were given an increase of £5 in their pensions.  That is the highest increase for many years and no sector deserves it more.  Their lives of hard work brought the economy to its present level and politicians cannot claim credit for that.  Widows also secured significant increases in the budget, while children's allowances have been increased.  Carers have been given increases and an entitlement to free travel.  I welcome the Minister's initiative for carers.  It is an important issue and I welcome the proposed establishment of a working group in 1998 to examine it.</P>
    <P>A sum of £16 million has been allocated to voluntary community groups.  The farming community has also done well in view of the Minister's commitments regarding headage payments and pollution grants.  The 100 per cent stock relief for qualified young farmers has been extended from two to four years.  I commend the Minister on his commitments regarding PRSI.  The income threshold has been increased from £80 to £100 while the ceiling has been raised from £27,000 to £29,000 for employers.  I urge employers to engage people who are long-term unemployed as there are substantial tax benefits in so doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> I commend the Minister for reducing corporation tax and for providing an additional 2,000 places on community employment schemes. There is also an additional 5,000 places in the back-to-work scheme which brings the total number of places on these schemes to 27,000.  I welcome the decrease in the vehicle registration tax from 23.2 per cent to 22.5 per cent.  The motor industry was expecting a larger decrease of about 3 per cent but obviously that was not possible this year.  The decrease, however, will result in savings for the motorist.  The motor industry deserves to be commended on the amount of revenue it raises through excise, customs and other taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister allocated £26 million for non-national roads.  Cork has a serious problem with its urban roads and some of the allocation should be ploughed into dealing with this problem there and in other cities.  Resources are not usually available from the local authorities.  In Cork, for example, the local authority was obliged to spend £1 million from its resources on repairing urban roads.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for sharing his time with me.</P>

      <P>I will probably be no different from other Deputies in that I will attempt to convey the concerns and requirements of my constituency, Dublin North-East, during this debate.</P>
      <P>It was fortunate for the Government partners to achieve power at a time of unprecedented economic growth and prosperity.  The Minister for Finance was extremely lucky to be appointed to that Department at such a prosperous time. Much was expected of the Minister prior to this budget but, sadly, the influence of the Progressive Democrats on his decisions is apparent.  The Progressive Democrats have always been seen as the party for the rich and this budget has copperfastened this image.  It was a budget for those who are already enjoying the effect of the Celtic tiger economy but which will change little for the less well off in society.  The Minister did little for the many families and senior citizens in parts of my constituency who have been further isolated and marginalised by this budget for the rich.</P>
      <P>In fairness, I welcome certain elements of the budget, particularly the 2 per cent reduction in the standard and higher tax rates.  It is high time the hard pressed PAYE worker was given a break and I am delighted Fine Gael, when in Government with Democratic Left and the Labour Party, was instrumental in creating the proper financial climate to allow the Minister such large leverage. However, there would have been a more equitable distribution of our country's new found wealth if a Fine Gael Minister had been distributing the goodies last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> The budget is a failure for all but the greedy. It displays no compassion for or understanding of the needs of the less well off.  I have no difficulty with the £20 million grant from lottery funds to the GAA.  The GAA makes a real contribution to the development of young people through its great network of clubs in every parish and its members who give up their time on a voluntary basis for their own and others' enjoyment.  I wish the GAA well in its endeavours and I have long paid tribute to its vital contribution to sport and culture.</P>
    <P>The question of whether Croke Park should be open to other sports is a matter for the GAA.  I wish to see good facilities for all sports.  However, voluntary youth organisations in my constituency are treated in a poor manner.  These organisations endeavour to be open to all, but they receive no support.  Funding through Government grants is unacceptably low and volunteers who work in the interest of their community, but receive little thanks, deserve better.  Two clubs in my constituency deserve mention in this regard.  Suttonians rugby club caters for large numbers of young people.  They organise teams, fixtures and social events.  For years the club has been trying unsuccessfully to secure a grant to complete its excellent clubhouse in Sutton.  When Fine Gael was in Government I made many representations to secure grants for the club but I was unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Baldoyle United soccer club has also done wonders for the youth of the area.  The people who run the club have tried for years to get grants for the club but they, too, have been unsuccessful. I mention these clubs because they have worked hard for the young people in their areas and should be supported by national lottery funds and by the Government.</P>
    <P>How can one justify an allocation of £20 million for a sports stadium against a mere £7 million for the mentally handicapped and £3 million for people with physical disabilities?  Prior to the budget I was optimistic that sufficient funds would be allocated to deal with hospital waiting lists.  The allocation of £4 million will scarcely deal with the problem.  It is also insulting when contrasted with the allocation of £20 million for the GAA.</P>
    <P>Hospital waiting lists are increasing again with 30,453 people queuing for surgery and other procedures compared to 25,959 at the beginning of the year.  These figures include 1,598 people waiting for cardiac surgery, 1,108 waiting for cardiology and 366 people waiting for dental treatment. Orthodontic treatment is not available because the health boards cannot afford to employ orthodontists to clear the work.  Queues are lengthening and people are most upset that they cannot get such urgent treatment for their children.  There are 6,592 people waiting for ear, nose and throat treatment, 440 awaiting neurosurgery, 5,983 awaiting orthopaedic surgery, 2,995 awaiting ordinary surgery and 2,521 awaiting vascular surgery.  The Government will have to <Col N="760" /> address the problem of people who urgently need bypass and hip replacement operations to relieve their suffering.</P>
    <P>If the country is doing so well, why is there no immediate funding for St. Ita's hospital in Portrane which was featured in a television programme recently and where conditions are said to be deplorable?  Something will have to be done about this.  Waiting lists are proof of the serious underfunding of our hospital services and the pain and suffering inflicted on the waiting public. The hospital services need an immediate large injection of funds to save people from this ongoing misery and grief.</P>
    <P>Little has been done to deal with the issue of poverty for families on social welfare or the elderly. A £3 increase per week means little to someone on the dole and an extra £5 per week for pensioners also falls short of what is required. Three pounds would hardly pay for two pints. Although much has been made of social welfare increases, they are terribly small.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive for those on social welfare allowances to return to work.  Through good taxation policy, the Minister could make it attractive for people to return to work.  There are many job opportunities in the low income bracket.  By better use of the money available, the Minister could have removed many people from the tax net by increasing allowances and allowing low paid workers take home the money they earn.  The Minister's objective should have been fairness in giving hope and opportunity.</P>
    <P>Where was relief for the hard-pressed first time house buyers who have been pushed further outside the city as a result of the property boom?  I would like the abolition of government stamp duty for first time buyers to ease the hardship many young couples face.  Current Government policy will eventually lead to a decline in home ownership and will force families to pay dead rent money to unscrupulous landlords.  This will not benefit the Exchequer in the long run.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise there is a housing crisis?  What effort will be made to address Fingal County Council's housing crisis?  Does the Government understand there are 1,182 applicants on the authority's housing list?  There are 632 single parents on the list, most of whom have been on it for two and a half to three years, with some applicants waiting to be housed for ten to 12 years.</P>
    <P>In the past week a small development consisting of four three-bedroomed, two two-bedroomed and six one-bedroomed dwellings became available for letting in the Baldoyle area. There were about 600 applications for those houses.  It was heart rending dealing with applicants when they learned they would not be successful in getting a dwelling.  Some of these applicants have been on waiting lists for six to eight years and now have no hope of getting housed. How has this budget helped these people who have been left behind by the Celtic tiger?  They <Col N="761" /> look to us for hope and are thrown coin &mdash; and not much of that either.</P>
    <P>Much of the housing stock in Dublin city and county is old.  The Government should consider making grants available to restore rundown dwellings and thus preserve the housing stock. This would also alleviate the housing crisis.  While there are 1,182 housing applications to Fingal County Council, the allocation of £4,525,000 from the Department in 1997 will build just 140 houses. This illustrates the enormity of the list.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's concessions to environmental issues but it is now time for the Government to take the lead in ensuring society behaves in as environmentally friendly a way as possible.  Taxation should be used to force attitude, redirect people from private to public transport and limit waste generation or future generations will look back in anger.</P>
    <P>This budget has been hailed as a victory for Fianna Fáil, yet it has the Tánaiste's fingerprints all over it.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is being hailed as an early Santa Claus, but will be likened to Scrooge by the families who have yet to feel the benefits of living in prosperous Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking a short-term view, this budget is good if one is rich.  There are merely crumbs for the poor.  <i>The Irish Times</i> poll, published this morning shows that about two-thirds of voters do not expect any improvement in their standards of living because of this budget.</P>
      <P>The combination of tax changes, particularly the cut in the top rate of tax, brings major benefits to 35 per cent of taxpayers who pay this rate. When the halving of capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent and the reduction in corporation tax are added to this, most of those in the wealthy bracket score on a number of counts.</P>
      <P>The budget will indirectly bring more benefits to the rich.  The stock market has powered ahead, increasing the value of their stocks and shares, pension funds and stock options.  The increase in the property market will add to the value of their homes, holiday homes and property investments. This budget will in time be seen as a charter to drive first time buyers out of the property market because the excess funds released to the rich will be invested in real estate or stocks and shares. The percentage increases in house prices and the ISEQ index will accelerate.  There has been evidence of that in the past week.  The ISEQ index has broken the 4,000 barrier and continues to rise.</P>
      <P>I do not begrudge those who have gained from the budget and it is possible to argue a case for each of the direct measures individually. However, this is a rich man-poor man budget. There is a huge disproportion between the combination of handsome benefits for the well-off compared to the modest improvements for the lower-paid and even less for those who are not paid. There is virtually nothing for deserving categories such as carers or the 1,000,000 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> A few weeks ago I launched a document on behalf of Fine Gael highlighting the opportunity for fair play for everybody in the budget.  The document outlined how this could be done in the financial parameters available.  This approach was not adopted and as a consequence for those seeking fair play for the weaker sections of society, this budget was a disaster.  It has been correctly described by Fr. Seán Healy of CORI as the worst ever.  While I do not agree with everything Fr. Healy says, he is a genuine and objective observer and it is important we listen to people like him.</P>
    <P>The Commission for Justice and Peace said the budget consciously redistributes the benefits of economic growth to the better off, fails to meet the Partnership 2000 commitments on social exclusion, deepens the divisions in society and fails to tackle poverty, unemployment and exclusion.  It is summed up as an insult to the decency of Irish people.  This is an objective viewpoint with which I agree in many ways.  The approach I proposed in the Fine Gael document, fair play for everybody, was not adopted, and this is the outcome. The Government attempts to justify its actions on the basis that it is payback time for taxpayers. The budget clearly involved major paybacks for those earning £50,000 a year.  For others the tax benefits tapered downwards until they reached minuscule proportions for those earning £200 a week or less.  The pre-election payback slogan has fallen further into disrepute and is now as shallow and shoddy as its sister slogan of zero tolerance on crime.</P>
    <P>Those on low and medium incomes will justifiably grumble, but the 40 per cent of the adult population who are not in the tax net will feel most let down by this budget.  Fairness, justice and equity all dictated an approach leading to social inclusion.  Effectively the budget will lead to the widening of the rich man-poor man divide. This can only result in further social exclusion, a deepening of alienation and, for the future, a damaged sense of community, and consequently a damaged society.</P>
    <P>Two-tier societies are unstable, have higher rates of alienation, crime and vandalism, and are damaging to all our citizens.  Accordingly, the huge opportunity to have a social dividend for everybody through this budget has been lost.  It is clear from the figures that the well off will gain in the short-term.  However, in the medium and long-term, the well off may also lose because essentially they may well suffer most from the loss of the social dividend.  Cutting the top rate of income tax by 2 per cent brings a benefit to one in six of the adult population.  The cost of each point reduction at the top rate is about £50 million. The total cost, therefore, will be £100 million. The total sum available for social welfare measures next year is little more than that at £125 million.  However, the majority of our people are expected to share this £125 million, including one million children who get the miserly sum of £9.46 <Col N="763" /> million to divide between them in 1998.  That works out at about 9p or 10p each.</P>
    <P>We heard much talk recently about the traveller &ldquo;C&rdquo; family of 12 children where one young girl suffered an appalling rape.  Leaving aside the court controversy, I am sure many wondered about the circumstances of our society which had such a large young family living in such appalling conditions.  I do not know the details, but I understand that the health board has made a number of efforts to improve the situation there.  I want to focus on what this Fianna Fáil-PDs Government has done through its budget to allow that family of two adults and 12 children, and families like them, to benefit from the Celtic tiger.  The father gets an extra £3 a week, and the mother gets £1.40. Incidentally, these increased sums will only be payable from next June.  Nothing extra will be payable for the children at that stage. There will be a meagre increase in child benefit payments for the 12 children of 35p a week each, but not immediately; that payment will be made next September.  Is this Government really serious in claiming to be interested in social inclusion when the figures are examined?  The stark contrast is that the household consisting of a married couple with no children, earning £50,000 a year, will gain £1,124 extra from the tax cuts in this budget whereas this traveller family with 12 children will get a total of £208.40 extra next year and £440.80 in a full year.  The two members of the first household get an increase of £11 a week each, and the members of the other household get a miserable pittance averaging 61p per person per week in a full year.  That is what this Fianna Fáil-PDs Coalition has done for the poor.</P>
    <P>Let me refer in particular to one other group for whom I and others made a strong case prior to the budget, the 30,000 carers living with and looking after people who need full-time care and attention.  They are on duty 24 hours a day every day of the year, with no holidays, no time off, no sick leave and none of the benefits and entitlements that other workers have.  Families and individuals who provide full-time care for their dependent family members are deserving of State support.  In many cases the State saves significantly by not having to provide residential care. There should be a carer's respite allowance for all such carers, irrespective of means, because of the common thread of additional cost or need from the point of view of respite or nursing care. Also, the existing means tested allowance should be adjusted by increasing the mean income disregard to allow a further 5,000 carers to get a weekly payment.  The Carers' Association had meetings with a number of Ministers, as they had with me, and were given to understand that there would be a positive response in this budget.  The outcome was an insult to carers.  There is a free travel pass to recipients of carer's allowance.  This is supplied to fewer than one third of the 30,000 full-time carers.  Furthermore, because they are <Col N="764" /> generally not in a position to have any respite, the use they would make of any such free travel pass would be nominal.  The Minister plumbed the depths when he dredged up this proposal as being a response to the legitimate claims of the 30,000 carers around the country.</P>
    <P>Spokespersons are often criticised for seeking additional expenditure when we have been critical of the level of expenditure involved in the Estimates and the budget.  I reject such criticism. What I am speaking of principally is proportionality between those who gain from this budget.  However, I am also willing to take on the expenditure question.  The Government has totally ducked this issue.  The Estimates show that there was no attempt to contain expenditure, except in the area of agriculture where it was cut. The Minister for Finance has miserably failed his own test on this score.  He who spoke of the need for expenditure control but, when in a position to apply same, ran for cover and provided phoney figures in an attempt to confuse the issue.  All economic commentators agree that the way in which the Government has framed its expenditure targets has allowed it to use the buoyancy of the PRSI receipts to fund general increases in spending.</P>
    <P>If the Government was genuinely interested in social inclusion it could have directed those moneys towards the needy.  I do not accept an approach which involves the neediest in our society being the only section to whom expenditure control is applied.  Why must the poor always have to wait?  There have been good savings in the social welfare area because of measures introduced by the last Government.  The crackdown on social welfare fraud saved the State £117 million in the first nine months of this year, and the expected saving for the year is £155 million.  This figure is greater than the increases allowed for social welfare expenditure next year.  No credit is due to the present Government that these savings were effected.  It is willing to accept the credit but not willing to take further necessary anti-fraud measures.</P>
    <P>I brought to the attention of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, an area where such expenditure control and anti-fraud measures are absolutely necessary.  I refer to supplementary welfare and rent allowances.  I raised this in the Dáil with the Minister on Wednesday, 26 November last. Despite the fact that the Minister trumpets the benefits to the State from the work of specialised staff in the area of control of social welfare expenditure and is glad to have his photograph in the paper in connection with it, he sees no need to extend this approach to the area of supplementary welfare payments for which the 1998 expenditure will be around £200 million.  This is despite the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out in his report on means testing that the Department of Social Welfare means test for new claims is more rigorous than the equivalent <Col N="765" /> test by health boards for supplementary welfare.</P>
    <P>I have a copy of a report from the internal audit section of the Eastern Health Board dated 8 August 1997 which confirms the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This audit arose following receipt of a letter from an external source stating the need to query the amount of rent supplements paid by the Eastern Health Board.  Following a full investigation into rent allowances, the audit report highlighted a number of control weaknesses in the system which require immediate attention.  It refers to area No. 3 in Dublin where more than £2 million is handed out annually in supplementary welfare and rent allowances.  Yet the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs sees no need for control measures similar to those which brought about such outstanding results in the social welfare area.  The Minister for Finance says he has no further moneys available for those genuinely in need.</P>
    <P>The truth is that senior officers in health boards &mdash;I am speaking in particular about the Eastern Health Board where the documents prove the case &mdash; are totally frustrated because of the lack of control measures.  Questions raised by them earlier this year include the reason there has been no formal acknowledgement of receipt of fraud documentation sent to superintendent community welfare officers, the resources available to deal with fraud and the number of cases pursued and to what end in 1996.  Other community welfare officers have proposed the establishment of a control unit to promote fraud awareness and as a tool to deter fraud.  However, this has all been to no avail.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, recently stated that every pound taken from the system through abuse is a pound less to spend on those genuinely in need.  I agree that where there is a need we must provide the resources and one of the ways of doing this is to ensure that those who are scalping the system are stopped.  Why has the Minister refused to ensure that control measures are introduced to cover the £200 million which will be spent next year on supplementary welfare?  I will continue to press him on this issue.  The documentation available from the Eastern Health Board highlights the fraud and abuse in the system and it cannot and should not be ignored.</P>
    <P>The overall verdict on the budget is a thumbs down.  Fine Gael believes that fair play is a fundamental value cherished by all people.  It marks us out as a nation, not just as an economy.  If we want to continue to build an inclusive society that cares then those who have not benefited from our economic success must get fair play.  There should have been meaningful increases in the key rates for families on social welfare, yet they were given virtually nothing.  There should also have been innovation and, in particular, support for child care and carers.  There was the opportunity to ensure a social dividend for everybody in a just <Col N="766" /> and cohesive society.  That opportunity has been lost and the widened poverty gap created by the budget may in time be very damaging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Tony Killeen.  I have listened to many budget debates and regard them as a charade and a circus.  When we are in Government the Opposition attack our budget and <i>vice versa</i> .  Instead of doing this we should acknowledge the good in budgets and see how we can improve on the many areas which need to be improved upon.</P>
      <P>During the past 20 years some hairshirt budgets have been introduced.  However, without these we would not have a booming economy today and the Government would not have been able to introduce a budget which gives people back some of their money.  I welcome the budget and congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  I fail to understand why he has come in for so much criticism given that he is the first Minister to keep his election promises.  As he emphasised in his Budget Statement, many measures remain to be taken in the next four budgets.  The commitment made during the election campaign to reduce the higher and standard rates of tax have been honoured.  It can be seen from the opinion polls published today that the general public agrees with this move.  I welcome the 2 per cent reduction in the higher and lower rates of tax and hope this is the first step towards much greater reductions.  I, too, would like to have seen a greater extension of the bands and hope this will be done in due course.</P>
      <P>I remind my colleagues on the Opposition benches that between 1982 and 1987 we had a super rate of tax of 65 per cent and a standard rate of 35 per cent.  No steps were taken to reduce these rates until the minority Fianna Fáil Government returned to office in 1987.  It reduced the top rate of tax to 58 per cent and the standard rate to 27 per cent, thereby beginning the reduction process. However, in its three budgets the rainbow Government only succeeded in reducing the standard rate by 1 per cent, and this despite the fact that the circumstances allowed it to improve on that.  I am not fully satisfied and much more needs to be done.  At a time when the economy is booming and interest rates and inflation are at an all-time low the effort put in by people during hard times should be recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the flat rate increase of £5 in old age, retirement and invalidity pensions for persons over 65 years.  I am glad the Minister looked after the older and weaker sections of the community and acknowledged their contribution to society.  However, I am disappointed that widows, invalidity pensioners under 65 years, the long-term unemployed, carers and the like have only received a £3 flat rate increase.  I hope this anomaly will be corrected in the next budget and that the Minister will make a particular effort to look after the weaker sections of society.  In this context I single out widows and widowers who do not have as strong a voice in society as others.  These <Col N="767" /> vulnerable people have to continue rearing their children following the death of their partners, while those in receipt of social welfare and other benefits are left to fend for themselves.  I would also like to have seen an increase in the fuel allowance which has not been increased for many years.  Hopefully, the qualification limits will be addressed in future budgets.</P>
    <P>I am annoyed at the rate of £2 per hour paid to home helps in my health board region.  These people provide a very necessary service practically on a voluntary basis.  Unfortunately, this was not recognised in the budget and perhaps it can be addressed at a later stage.  I agree with the comments made by the previous speaker about carers.  These people not only provide a very valuable service but also save the State huge sums of money by looking after their relatives at home, thereby freeing up acute beds in hospitals which cost much more money.  The practical measures outlined by the previous speaker could be introduced at no extra cost to the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fall in unemployment to less than 10 per cent.  The budget provisions will further encourage enterprise and lead to greater job creation.  A reduction of 1,000 in the live register means huge savings for the State in terms of social welfare payments.  These savings should be directed towards the poorer sections of society.</P>
    <P>Employers have got a fair deal in the budget and they have a responsibility to create employment. I hope they will play their part in creating the jobs required.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Kilkenny city and other locations in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny and neighbouring counties in the south-east have not been mentioned in employment announcements of late.  There seems to be an opinion within IDA circles that people are better off living in the south-east or other parts of the country than in Dublin but nothing could be further from the truth.  We have the same problems.  Some years ago Fieldcrest located in Kilkenny city with a promise of 650 jobs but it went to the wall within two years and has not been fully replaced. Thomastown, Callan and Castlecomer are unemployment black spots.  An IDA factory in Graiguenamanagh is lying idle.  I call on the IDA and the Minister to ensure locations such as these receive their fair share of the national cake.</P>
    <P>Few people in rural Ireland know much about the Celtic tiger, a title I am beginning to dislike. An ambitious rural development programme should be put in place immediately to revitalise towns and villages.  It is imperative something is done, although I appreciate there was an announcement recently about the Leader programme.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that £3.5 million has been allocated for the installation aid scheme.  Yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture and Food announced he would contact the farm organisations with a view to putting a new scheme in place geared <Col N="768" /> towards assisting small and medium-sized farmers. The control of farmyard pollution and dairy hygiene schemes should be improved.  Small farmers will not benefit from the tax incentives announced in the budget as they do not have a taxable income.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that pickets have been placed at Welsh ports.  This should not be tolerated by the Government.  It has led to a crisis in cattle prices. We are entitled to sell our products within the European Union which guarantees free movement. Action should be taken immediately. Those involved in the transport sector, including truck drivers, are suffering.  This year there have been two French strikes and blockades at Welsh ports.  Most people in the transport sector were affected by the Bell debacle in Waterford and Dublin.  They should receive special consideration.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the allocation of £20 million towards the further development of Croke Park to be paid over three years.  Some interesting remarks were made on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night, particularly by a friend of my colleagues in Fine Gael who was last in Croke Park in 1954 and who described himself as a Blue Shirt.  The Gaelic Athletic Association has done much good for well over a century.  It has invested money in the development of its games.  When I was Minister of State with special responsibility for sport, I would have been happy if the FAI or the Irish Rugby Football Union had presented proposals to build stadiums of their own.  I would have been delighted to make the necessary grants available.</P>
    <P>When the national lottery was established it was understood that a great percentage of the surplus would be allocated to sport.  Unfortunately, during the years this has been siphoned to other Departments to replace Government revenue. Given our strong economic performance it should be redirected towards the governing bodies of sport and the many voluntary workers who do much good work.  I hope this will happen gradually to the point where at least 50 per cent of the surplus is allocated to sport which is an antidote for anti-social behaviour in developing the minds and bodies of young people.  Sports officers should be appointed immediately in each local authority area, as recommended in our election manifesto, to assess the needs of young people and co-ordinate the activities of schools in the area of physical education.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts made to attract international events here such as the Tour de France, the Ryder Cup and the Special Olympics.  This will help to enhance our status and stimulate tourism, a major contributor to the economy.</P>
    <P>There are many matters on which I would like to dwell in the area of the environment and local government, including the performance of local authorities and the powers conferred upon them as well as the many works which require to be undertaken in our constituencies.  The road network in County Kilkenny has been sorely neglected <Col N="769" /> in recent years.  The works that require to be undertaken include the improvement of the Kilkenny to Ballyragget and Waterford roads, the second phase of the ring road, the provision of access to the Belview portal development in south Kilkenny, a second bridge crossing on the river Suir in Waterford, the construction of bypasses in Thomastown and the provision of sewerage and water schemes in the many towns and villages which lack such facilities.  The aim is to stimulate tourism and encourage people to build and live among their own.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, has specific responsibility for the school transport scheme which needs to be reviewed.  The many reports produced during the years are gathering dust in the Department. It is ridiculous that one can still be debarred on the grounds laid down in the 1960s before schools began to close.  If it is not possible to do something when times are good I hate to think what might happen in ten years time.</P>
    <P>An additional allocation is required to reduce waiting lists in public hospitals for hip replacement operations, heart surgery and other minor operations.  It is annoying that those covered by the VHI can be treated much more quickly.</P>
    <P>I commend the budget to the House.  In the next four to five budgets I hope the Minister will tackle the many other problems which need to be addressed, leading to a more just society by the end of this Government's period of office.</P>

      <P>The House will be aware that both these offices have been the subject of independent reviews in recent times.  Arising from these reviews, increased resources have been made available to both offices in terms of staffing and infrastructural areas, notably information technology which is now well advanced.  The nature of the workload in both offices is such that continuous review is necessary to ensure they provide an effective and efficient service.</P>

      <P>There are 30 people employed in the DPP's office, 14 of whom are in legal grades and 16 in general service grades.  That office has increased its staff considerably during the year and developed its information technology system.  Staff numbers in the Chief State Solicitor's office have increased dramatically, mainly due to the hearing claims from members of the Army.  There are approximately 214 staff in that office, 32 of whom are involved in the section dealing with hearing loss claims.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that, but there are 32 people working in the section dealing with hearing claims.  The difficulties relate to the number of proceedings rather than a lack of expertise.  This time last year 3,900 claims had been submitted to the office, to date this year the office has received 8,335.  As the Minister informed the House recently, the claims are increasing at the rate of 100 per week.  This is unprecedented case law that is naturally putting a strain on the office.  It is not a question of a lack of expertise, it is the sheer volume of work arising from the Army deafness claims that is causing the problem.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Taoiseach appears to be under the impression that the resources being given to the DPP's office are adequate.  Approximately four months ago the DPP stated that the office's resources were no longer adequate to provide the service which the courts &mdash; and increasingly the public &mdash; expect and demand.  He also stated it is essential to develop the public prosecution service to a standard comparable with that in other countries and that we are almost unique in that most prosecutions are proceeded with by the gardaí without any involvement of the office responsible for law for handling such cases.  The DPP has stated that he has inadequate resources to discharge his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="771" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement was included in the statement of strategy published some months ago by the DPP.  A number of additional staff have been appointed to the office.  The litigation is almost endless.  An application from the DPP will of course receive priority because of the importance of the office, but there has been no recent request from the Director.  The office has been working on the development of a modern information technology system in all the offices. They have also been working towards increasing staff to an appropriate level.  Substantial resources have been made available to all the offices, including a large amount of money for the development of information technology.  The same applies to the Chief State Solicitor's office, which has installed a major networking computer system and commenced refurbishment of the office and the extension of its premises at Ship Street which is to be completed next summer. The l998 Estimates provide for an increase of 11.5 per cent.  I admit the amount of resources taken up on the deafness claims is putting a strain on the office.  A large proportion of staff is caught up doing work they did not have 18 months ago. We will deal with any requests for additional staff in the DPP's office.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the unified prosecution service, which forms a substantial part of the DPP's report.  That is being considered by Government and the State law offices review group set up by the previous Attorney General. Following the report they agreed they did not have enough information to implement it, based on the assessment.  They are, therefore, looking at the situation to see if that is the best way of proceeding.  It would be immensely costly to do that.  Effectively, it would rule the Garda out of their present role and everything would be done on a legal basis.  It would have huge ramifications. A member of the DPP's staff was on the group, however, and agreed they would need to examine it in far more detail before they could proceed. He put it forward in a strategy statement as something he would like to see in the future.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind the explosion in the number of legal cases now characterising all aspects of society, is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate the Government's position with regard to the proposal to establish a national claims agency?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is still under consideration in a number of respects.  As the Deputy stated, one must take into consideration the number of claims coming before the State from all sources, as well as the amount of legal time involved.  It is a matter for the courts and the legal profession, but if all these matters have to be taken on an individual case basis, some people have argued that we should have personal claims tribunals for different sections. I have looked at this issue and spoken to the legal people about it.  To do that would go outside what <Col N="772" /> we always considered to be the functions of tribunals in this State because claims would not be based on a common cause or accident, which is the way they were always determined.  It would not be possible to establish clinically and beyond doubt that the medical condition which prompted the claims existed. There are other difficulties as well.  All those matters would have to be examined before we could decide to legislate to establish a claims agency.</P>

      <P>In expanding the capability of both the DPP's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office, are we not encouraging a litigious culture? This culture has now come to the conclusion that behind every conceivable human problem there is a legal case waiting to break out.  All one has to do is find somebody against whom one can file a suit.  We need to deal with this matter other than through the courts, which are costing taxpayers an arm and a leg.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I assure the Deputy that the issue of how we deal with these matters is being carefully looked at, although I do <Col N="773" /> not think there is any simple solution.  The number of claims being made against anybody and everything &mdash; the Government, newspapers, State agencies and others &mdash; is horrendous.  We must try to deal with it as efficiently as possible.</P>
      <P>In reply to the question on the broader remit that Deputy Quinn has rightly raised, we are looking at it but we are trying to make sure that the staff, resources, expertise, technology, research and library facilities within the State's law offices are the best we can provide.  We will probably always be operating on limited resources but 200 people are now working in the office of the DPP and that of the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No. It is in relation to staffing the Chief State Solicitor's office.  We sought the appointment of a claims manager.  Does the Taoiseach agree that 3,900 claims is equivalent to a claims department in a reasonably sized insurance company?  In such a claims department the staff are not necessarily all legal people. There are claims experts who can deal quickly with certain cases and save considerable sums of money if the claim is settled quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently answered a question on that matter.  To the best of my knowledge the claims officer is included in the number.  I will check it for the Deputy.  To correct the Deputy, in case I misled him, the figure of 3,900 was for last year.  The current figure is 8,335.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the question specifically arises from the difficulty in bringing prosecutions and the number of inefficiencies and inadequacies that have become apparent.  As the Taoiseach wishes to deal with the matter efficiently, and perhaps in line with the famous principle of openness, transparency and accountability, is he considering any review whereby the Chief State Solicitor and the DPP may report to the House on a regular basis?  In that way we would have the opportunity of discovering exactly what is happening.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned one of the recommendations regarding regional prosecutors.  All the suggestions that have been put forward are the subject of an examination between the relevant offices and Government Departments.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is presumably referring to the allocation provided for the Central Statistics Office in the 1998 Estimates which in gross terms reflect a decrease of 14 per cent on the 1997 forecast outturn.  The original 1997 allocation for the CSO reflected the carry-over cost of processing the 1996 census of population.</P>
      <P>When account is taken of this cost, however, there is a small increase in net allocation between 1997 and 1998.  Gross expenditure by the CSO rose from £13.8 million in 1995 to £23.8 million in 1996 to cover the costs of the conduct and initial processing of the census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the CSO needs to process further the information it has collected from the 1996 census and to provide information vital for planning at local government level and work being carried out, such as the household budget survey?  Does he further agree that, overall, the resourcing of the office does not reflect the commitment of the current Administration to more open government and provision of information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does he reconcile the reduction in the Estimates with the increase of £500,000 to the Secret Service, a body which did not even spend <Col N="775" /> its full 1997 allocation?  Is it a pointed and relevant comparison that the Government will increase spending on the secret service, yet reduce spending on the provision of information?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no information on the Secret Service for the Deputy, which I am sure comes as no surprise to him.  A sum of £13.8 million was budgeted for the CSO in 1995 and in 1996 it was £23.8 million.  Successive Governments have done their best to substantially resource the office.  The CSO is involved in four new big areas of policy, one of which is quarterly surveys which started in September in 39,000 households.</P>
      <P>The demographic results from the 1996 census were published in July.  The entire process will take approximately two years to complete compared with six years after the 1991 census.  It has been speeded up substantially and the office is also engaged in statistical releases on specific topics from time to time.  Successive Ministers with responsibility for that office, and the office itself, which is statutorily independent, have made great strides in increasing the statistical database and providing information in a more timely fashion.</P>
      <P>I am anxious this is the case as there is no point in it being a few years late.  While it is interesting, it is history at that stage.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to have useful information for planning purposes and that is why the quarterly national household survey will collect information on education, housing, health, exposure to crime and the labour market.  We are getting more accurate and timely information which is useful for planning.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the CSO declined to participate in a follow-up survey which was to be carried out in the context of the labour force survey where approximately 2,500 households were surveyed?  It revealed for the first time substantial statistically validated evidence that a large number of people claiming unemployment benefit were working while a significant number were registering for unemployment assistance but were not available for work. Is he also aware that, following its publication, the Department of Social Welfare was able to engage in a series of very effective anti-avoidance measures?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that useful and practical information is required which relates to the operation of the labour market, among other matters.

      <P>I am not aware of this but I will take it up with the office.  All Members have been aware for years of the anomaly between the labour force survey and the live register and we have been going around in circles over it.  The introduction in September of the quarterly national household survey, which was prepared by the previous Government, was an attempt to resolve it.  The idea behind it was to try to narrow the gap between them and to get more accurate and timely information on the labour force and other topics so that the figures could be reconciled between the labour market and the survey. I would be concerned if there was a reluctance involved and I will take up it up with the office.</P>

That is still two and a half years between the taking of the census and the publication of all detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 census was published in July 1997, a reasonable timescale, while the 1991 census took six years to complete the cycle.  The information to which the Deputy refers, such as the numbers <Col N="777" /> involved in the electoral wards and constituencies, was included in the July publication.  I recall a parliamentary question last week where I supplied information on a ward by ward basis in Dublin.</P>

      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the role of the Central Statistics Office in order to extend its remit to the measurement of criminal justice statistics, including court statistics, crime statistics, prison statistics and related statistics.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Criminal justice statistics are the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and, in the case of crime, prisons and probation statistics, are published in annual reports.  Some statistics on the criminal justice system are also published annually by the Central Statistics Office in its statistical abstract.</P>
      <P>Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the Central Statistics Office has the authority to co-ordinate statistics compiled by other public authorities. However, its right to access the records of public authorities does not extend to the records pertaining to a court, the Garda Síochána or the prisons administration.  While administrative records provide valuable information on reported crime, it is the view of the Central Statistics Office that estimates of actual, as distinct from reported, crime could be based only on national representative surveys.</P>
      <P>In September, the CSO launched the new quarterly national household survey, which will be an important source of statistics about the population, households and the labour market.  It involves surveying 39,000 households per quarter throughout the country.  Consideration is being given to including a module on crime in this survey for a future quarter.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Estimates for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform included a specific provision of £250,000 for research.  In the circumstances I see no need to review the role of the Central Statistics Office in respect of criminal justice statistics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree we are passing one item of draconian legislation after another, some of which are needed, but there must come a time when, viewed against the rate of crime scientifically established, we are able to measure the rate of success.  Last evening I watched the &ldquo;Cook Report&rdquo; on a British television station where it was estimated that £50 billion worth of goods are stolen each year in the UK to fund a drugs problem.  On a ratio of 10:1 the figure here could be as high as £5 billion but I doubt if it is that high, given that the heroin problem is confined to Dublin by and large but we do not know its extent.  How can we hope to tackle this extensive problem if we do not have <Col N="778" /> some basic statistical information on which to calculate success or failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness Deputy Mitchell has been consistent on this matter.  In 1993 he published a Private Members' Bill &mdash; the National Bureau of Crime Statistics Bill, 1993 &mdash; which was debated in the House in February 1994 and opposed by the then Minister.  The Deputy also had a number of meetings with senior officials on the subject.  It has had some effect because the view of the Central Statistics Office is that the inclusion of a question on crime in the new quarterly national household survey would be useful and give us some valuable information. It also urged the Government to come to the decision whereby it allocated £250,000 to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform specifically for crime research and producing crime figures.  It was helpful also in getting the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to publish its own figures.  It publishes figures in the case of crime, prisons and probation statistics in its annual reports.  The view of the CSO is that this is information on actual crime.  It is contained in the annual reports and, combined with the quarterly national household survey, it should give us the information we need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the report on crime statistics as published by the Garda Síochána is only on reported crime? Human nature being what it is, there is nothing in it for the Garda to maximise the level of reporting.  I am not suggesting the figures are tampered with but they reflect only a measure of reported crime.  Given that a new court services authority is being established, would it not be useful to know which court decisions operate more effectively than others?  For example, some judges suspend part of the sentence or bring back a criminal half way through a sentence to review how he or she is getting on and may suspend the remainder of the sentence based on their behaviour. If we had a statistical analysis of how successful these decisions were we might be able to tailor our approach to legislation and other resources in the House.  Similarly, if we had an ongoing measurement of recidivism and the effect of sentences on prisoners and on the community we might be better able to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement that I have been pursuing this matter for some time.  We cannot tackle this problem effectively and efficiently without basic analytical statistics on which to measure the success or failure of this approach.  Irrespective of the view of the Central Statistics Office and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will the Minister, who has responsibility for the whole area of statistical analysis and policy, have a fresh look at this matter with a view to arriving at a comprehensive measurement of the problem so that we might be better equipped to deal with it and to formulate <Col N="779" /> a response more in keeping with the need rather than with the imagined need?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a great believer in the dictum that if you cannot measure it you cannot manage it.  I fervently believe in measuring performance because then one can make the necessary management decisions.  I have no trouble with that concept.  I am informed in the strongest possible terms that there are two annual reports on different issues from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on crime and prisons and on the probation and the welfare service, giving full statistics.  I take the Deputy's point about reported crime.  The best way of dealing with unreported crime is for the CSO to include in the new quarterly national household survey a question on crime.  The indications are that if the surveys are taken quarterly over six or nine months we should have a clear picture of the crime incidence, given that the survey is carried out very scientifically and professionally.  It should give a good picture of unreported crime.  I will ensure that question is included in the quarterly national household survey with a view to discovering the level of unreported crime.  By definition it is hard to measure it.  The CSO has advised the best way to proceed is to use the quarterly national household survey and see what information emerges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Minister made the point that the CSO co-ordinates a range of statistics for different agencies.  In relation to the court statistics, the report on the probation and welfare service is a separate report, albeit under the guise of the prison service.  The reports on the prisons and the Garda Síochána are also separate.  There is a whole series of statistics, in many cases relating to a single individual who would have been through the entire system.  Given all the computerisation nobody synchronises or co-ordinates the data.  From the point of view of criminal research it is crucial that somebody should prepare a comprehensive and co-ordinated report in relation to all the statistics so that there can be a proper evaluation of the entire crime scene as well as proper research into the causes of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point being made by the Deputy.  Under the Statistics Act, 1993, the CSO has an overriding duty to co-ordinate statistics compiled by other public agencies. However, in the justice area &mdash; courts, prisons and the Garda Síochána &mdash; it does not have that right and as such they must compile the reports themselves.  Under the 1998 Estimates a specific provision of £250,000 has been allocated to them to improve their research.  Apart from the quarterly national household survey, the Central Statistics Office should not become more deeply involved at this stage given that it would lead to duplication.  The Department of Justice, Equality <Col N="780" /> and Law Reform is providing figures for this area and we should await the quarterly national household survey to see how it works.  I shall bring this to the attention of the CSO and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The information requested is best produced by the Department.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Deputy Quinn referred earlier to levels of unemployment.  At one time it was believed that the levels of unemployment were much higher than was the case.  The statistical analysis of unemployment shows the signing on figure does not represent the full level of unemployment.  A similar problem arises with the crime level.  For example, if we knew how much is stolen every year to fund the drugs habit &mdash; the figure quoted in the UK is £50 billion and the figure here could be £5 billion or £1 billion &mdash; it might pay us to put money into rehabilitation in the prison service and persuade the public to support that.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter on a statistical basis.  A great public service could be done by implementing the system I propose.</P>

      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concern about the level of major fish kills this year, with 39 reported incidents to date in 1997, involving more than 200,000 fish.  The comparable figure <Col N="783" /> for 1996 was 47 fish kills involving some 30,000 fish.  The main causes identified to date, which included some particularly appalling incidents, were enrichment, agricultural practices, sewage and industrial effluent.</P>
      <P>Since taking office, I have given the highest priority to tackling pollution and its causes in fisheries and fish habitats.  It was immediately clear to me, in the light of the series of incidents during the summer months in particular, that urgent action on a number of fronts was required.  I announced last August a six-point action plan on water quality management designed to ensure the resources of the fisheries boards and of all relevant agencies are co-ordinated and deployed to best effect to deal with water pollution, by tackling its causes at source and by acting swiftly whenever it occurs.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board is expediting implementation of the plan in consultation with the Regional Fisheries Boards and all relevant players, including the farming organisations, Teagasc, local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and the angling organisations.  The board is establishing a dedicated Environmental Co-Ordination Response Unit tasked with the national back-up, co-ordination and mobilisation of resources.  The board is also progressing the other elements of the plan, including developing structured dialogue and co-operation between all the relevant agencies on water quality issues, improved information systems and a programme to upgrade the board's water quality laboratory services.</P>
      <P>My overall objective is to ensure that resources are effectively deployed in the crucial tasks of pollution prevention, water quality monitoring and incident response.  I have underlined the imperative for a partnership approach across all the relevant agencies and sectors, to ensure that fisheries resources, and the habitats which support them, are protected and conserved.  The positive response to date from all organisations and agencies to my initiative makes me confident I have the co-operation of all concerned in delivering on these strategies.</P>

      <P>While respecting the Minister's efforts in this area, no doubt he will be aware that the scale of fish kills during 1997 when 264,000 were killed compared with the figure for 1996 of 33,400 is enormous, including a huge fish kill on the Mulcair river in my area.  Is the Minister aware that nobody has ever been jailed for an offence of this nature in sharp contrast with the circumstances when drift net fishermen used monofilament nets?  They were fined, many of the fines were not paid, and the offenders were subsequently jailed.  Furthermore, would he agree that incidents of deliberate pollution, as have occurred in the past, result in horrendous levels of disease?  The Minister will also be aware of the remedial action taken in the agricultural sector to prohibit the use of angel dust?  Will he agree that, <Col N="784" /> in the case of deliberate acts of pollution, that course of action will have to be considered in the case of any future fish kills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Finucane that is a course of action which should be considered in any case of deliberate pollution.  On the point he made that as yet no polluter has been jailed whereas drift net fishermen have been, I should point out that whenever a person is fined and refuses to pay he is in contempt of court and even if the amount of the fine is small, he could end up in jail.  That could happen in any case of fine imposed in respect of pollution of our inland waterways.</P>
      <P>In respect of the specific, horrendous fish kill on the Mulcair river, in its immediate aftermath I requested the Central Fisheries Board and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to commission a scientific investigation into the incident.  The study, involving the University of Limerick, is being advanced.  The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has consulted the various interested parties in the area, such as the farming organisations, local authorities and fishery concerns.  The study, when finalised, will provide a comprehensive assessment of the causes and effect of the fish kill and will inform future fisheries pollution prevention strategies for the Mulcair catchment area and elsewhere.  The Deputy will be aware there is a good deal of conflict in respect of the Mulcair incident in respect of which we initiated an investigation straight away which I hope will soon provide us with the requisite information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any.  Nonetheless, I accept the point made, that some of these fish kills are atrocious and the degree of negligence can be enormous.  Of course, there are different kinds of fish kills.  I know the Deputy is speaking of specific incidents of gross negligence and total carelessness, in respect of which the heaviest penalties should apply.</P>
      <P>The Mulcair fish kill stimulated a great deal of reaction and, in fairness to the farmers the Irish Farming Association, under the outgoing President, Mr. John Donnelly, went out of its way to rectify any pollution caused by its members.  That is very encouraging.  Subsequent to the Mulcair incident I had meetings with Teagasc who were also prepared to draw up new recommendations on the use of phosphates, so the House will see that this issue is being taken very seriously. Indeed the Mulcair incident, and the reaction of the public and the Minister encouraged that kind of positive development which I shall continue to support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree.  Indeed, local authorities, through their investment programmes, in particular with regard to sewage treatment, are being very helpful, but incidents of deliberate industrial or major farmyard pollution, with total disregard for its consequences are very serious. Even when the general level of pollution has been reduced or considerably controlled, isolated incidents may still incur.  Such irresponsible behaviour will have to be dealt with very severely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of State owned fisheries is the responsibility of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards.  However, I am glad to have this opportunity, in light of expressed concerns, to clarify for the House the practice and the process involved.  It has been the long-standing practice of the Central Fisheries Board to offer the fishing rights on a number of State owned fishing stretches, which include Land Commission fisheries, to the public in a tendering process.  Tender applications are invited in the press for licences to hold the fishing rights for periods of between one to five years.</P>
      <P>It is a stated objective of the Central Fisheries Board to maximise the opportunities for local management and development of all such fisheries. In line with this objective, it is the case that over the years the majority of these State owned fishing rights are licensed to local angling clubs and not, as intimated, to exclusive private interests.  There is no question at any time of &ldquo;selling off&rdquo; State owned fishing rights or fisheries. The tendering and licensing process to which the Deputy refers is designed to assist the management, conservation and development of State owned fisheries to their full potential, having full regard for local interests and concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I previously announced my intention to move to a catchment management approach which involves and empowers all players in decision making at local community level.  The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards are committed to driving that policy objective forward and I have already announced six pilot catchment projects by the boards which will, in a practical way, inform overall catchment management strategies. By bringing together all users to discuss and progress local strategies, the catchment management approach will ensure that concerns such as those being voiced about the management of State owned fisheries are addressed in an open way <Col N="786" /> and that consensus on future directions for local fisheries can be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the position on the different areas on offer.  I understand that in some areas, anglers who would have fished particular stretches of river over a number of years will now have to contact up to 12 different people if they want to continue fishing these stretches.  That will create major problems because it will prevent local anglers, as well as tourists, fishing stretches of river they have fished for numerous years.  Previously, these anglers' licences gave them fishing rights but they will now have to make contact with the contract owners of the different stretches of river.  This will cause major problems for people pursuing their pastime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy a general answer about the way the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards operate. A separate question has been tabled &mdash; I do not have it to hand at the moment &mdash; about the River Robe in particular which is perhaps the one to which the Deputy refers.  It was discovered that one area belonged to the Land Commission which was included with the other State controlled rivers, and similar offers were made for it. The local angling clubs frequently take up that option and that ensures the proper development of the rivers.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised in the House previously and no action will be taken in relation to it.  No tenders were submitted in any event.  The fisheries board, at my request, will meet local Deputies directly interested and who spoke about this matter on the Adjournment, and it will consider how this should be developed.  The specific issue will be dealt with in reply to another question which has been tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the River Robe, how many tenders have been received for the other stretches of waterway, some of which are in the Leinster area, and was there any foreign contact in relation to same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that specific information but my understanding is that where it applies, that procedure is used extensively.  It is normally local people, particularly the local angling clubs, who take up the offers.  Some of the licences could be five years old because they are given for periods of one to five years.  It is just a lease over that period.</P>

      <Quest>the reason his Department does not reveal details of vessel licence transfers and if, in the interest of accountability and transparency, he will reveal details of tonnage which has been replaced or amalgamated since 1989; and the criteria involved in determining the eligibility of the transfer of these licences.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Sea fishing boat licences are not transferable.  When a vessel is sold the new owner must apply for a new fishing boat licence.  Similarly, a fisherman who replaces his vessel must apply for a new licence in respect of the replacement vessel.</P>
      <P>It is one of the requirements of fishing boat licensing policy, reflecting mandatory EU fleet capacity requirements, that a licence may only be granted for the introduction of a new vessel into the fishing fleet where the applicant has first removed tonnage and engine power from the current sea fishing boat register.  This must be of at least equal capacity to the tonnage and engine power of the boat to be introduced.  A fisherman may, therefore, remove his existing vessel from the register and use the tonnage and horsepower of that vessel to bring a replacement vessel of equivalent size into the fleet.  Tonnage and horsepower may also be sold on to another fisherman. The purchaser may then use that capacity to facilitate the introduction of a new fishing vessel into the fleet.</P>
      <P>Stated licensing policy requires also that a vessel offered as replacement capacity for a new vessel must come from the segment of the fleet into which the new vessel will enter.  For example, where the new entrant to the fleet is introducing a pelagic trawler, the capacity being withdrawn must be from the pelagic sector.</P>
      <P>While current licensing procedures and criteria are generally understood by the fishing sector, I intend to publish comprehensive guidelines for the industry on the licensing process, procedures and criteria which will set out all the policy considerations taken into account in the granting of fishing licences.  I am fully committed to ensuring there is transparency in licensing policy and procedures and that the industry has confidence in the process.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has asked for comprehensive details of the numerous tonnage and horsepower transactions since 1989.  This would involve an enormous commitment of staff time and resources.  However, apart from the practicalities of delivering this information, the question of commercial and individual confidentiality arises in relation to these data.  I am favourably disposed in principle to making register data public and will review the position on availability of the register to ensure the principle of transparency is commensurate with commercial confidentiality concerns.  I intend to consult the industry before coming to a final view on this issue.</P>

      <P>Last February, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, as Opposition spokesperson on the marine, said he was informed there was considerable confusion and lack of transparency in the area of licensing, and that a much more open and transparent system <Col N="788" /> was needed.  A number of criticisms were made at the time.  The Minister must be aware there is a great deal of concern about this matter in the fishing industry, particularly in regard to past practices now solely the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources. There is a feeling that a cloak of secrecy prevails which is not healthy.  That cloak of secrecy has been compounded over the years by the failure of the Department to change.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will introduce guidelines.  He stated there will be openness and transparency in regard to the issue of salmon licences in the Central Fisheries Board areas but there should also be openness and transparency in regard to sea fishing licences.  The register of sea fishing vessels should not gather dust in the Department but should be accessible to people who may want to obtain information in it.  I call on the Minister to make that information accessible in the future because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there can be misunderstandings in relation to different areas.  The Department has done its best to rationalise the position. Changes initiated in Europe create new positions, whereby something that might have applied three years ago can be altered at EU level.  Some people may feel aggrieved at the implementation of such a change, particularly if they paid out money in respect of tonnage, part of which may be allowed for other reasons at a future date.  This is a developing process.  My predecessors would have been keen to reach this point of openness in the sense of having everything on the table in so far as possible.  The Deputy mentioned the Minister, Deputy Smith, who, when shadowing the Minister for the Marine in Opposition, calling for transparency and openness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has not, to date, made the sea fishing boat register available for public inspection. On the basis that individual fishermen have provided information on a confidential basis, details in respect of a particular fishing vessel may be obtained from the mercantile marine register, which is maintained by the local registrars of shipping around the coast.  Therefore, details are available up to a certain point.  I intend to review the position on the availability of the sea fishing boat register taking account of the principle of transparency and considerations of commercial confidentiality.  In conducting that review it will be necessary to have regard to the provisions and requirements of the Data Protection Act and the <Col N="789" /> Freedom of Information Act, particularly when dealing with commercial matters.  I plan to consult the fishing industry before finalising the criteria and the guidelines on this area and I want as much openness and transparency as possible in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is often disagreement about the measurements of boats.  An individual may have had a boat measured in Holland, England or Northern Ireland and may get a different measurement here, but there can be good reasons for that.  I want to have those set out clearly so that people can in an open and transparent way know what is happening and how a vessel is measured because that aspect causes a good deal of trouble.</P>

      <P>Irish Fish and fish products from all sources, including the Irish Sea, are subjected to a wide range of regular tests carried out by or on behalf of my Department.  These include physical freshness checks for microbiological and viral contamination.  Samples are also referred regularly by the Department to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland for radionuclide testing.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute carries out radionuclide tests on a regular basis on fish, shellfish, seaweeds, sediment and water from all our coastal waters.  In addition, regular sampling and testing for chemicals and heavy metal residues is carried out by the Marine Institute and by a number of analytical laboratories around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of ongoing testing of fish from the Irish Sea have not to date given rise to any concerns which would be significant for public health in Ireland.  There is some concern about the levels of technesium in lobsters close to the outfall from Sellafield.  Such levels have not been recorded <Col N="790" /> here.  Notwithstanding the current safeguards however, there is no room for complacency in marine environment and public health matters and I assure the Deputy that testing results will continue to be monitored very closely indeed.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have established a task force on dumping of radioactive waste following the revelations about dumping of such waste over the period since the Second World War by the UK authorities.  The task force has almost completed its report and I intend to publish it, with a full statement by me of the action I intend to take on foot of its findings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is taken very seriously by me, the Department and was taken seriously by my predecessors.  It came to a head with the reported dumpings, particularly in the l950s and after the Second World War, by the UK authorities. We have had excellent co-operation from the British authorities on this matter and have had regular meetings with its representatives. Because of the findings I was determined that a document would be prepared outlining the current factual position.  Irrespective of whether we like it we should know the position.  That information was available in the form of the official documents released for inspection, but nobody spotted it until recently, and in that sense it was not hidden.  Since then, in co-operation with the British authorities, we have undertaken a thorough check of those records and further incidents have been discovered.  As Deputy Wall may have seen in the media, not so long ago there were further findings which were not of great significance but they were noted.  The Deputy may also have noted that the UK National Radiological Protection Institute recently completed its report on the dumping activity of the l950s, l960s and l970s and that is being taken into account by our task force.  The UK institute's report concludes that the impact of the dumped materials on human dosage levels is insignificant.  However, while I do not see any reason to doubt that, I will await the view of my task force on this matter. More importantly, we need to establish a base position and to establish what monitoring is needed from now on.  The UK has given further commitments not to be involved in the dumping of any kind of material in the Irish Sea.</P>

If they do, will he indicate if the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is carrying out any special examination of the fish caught in that immediate area and if results of any such examination are available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Results are available and a comprehensive and detailed report has been published on the levels recorded there and across the Irish Sea.  The results show that the levels which were discovered there, particularly in lobsters, did not occur in any catches of Irish marine produce.  They indicate that the damage occurs only in the immediate outfall area because the fish do not travel very far and because the outfall is taken up very quickly.</P>
      <P>In all the studies which have been carried out, it was found that the areas more immediate to Sellafield were in greatest danger.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has looked at these and continues to monitor radiation levels there.  We will include a summary of the findings in the task force report to indicate what exactly happened and how it is possible for it to influence only the area immediate to Sellafield and not the rest of the Irish Sea.  This is something we must continue to monitor.  I want the task force report to be factual and up to date so that we can establish a baseline which we can subsequently monitor.</P>

While I am advised that there is a ro-ro ramp at Berth 44, South Bank Quay, this ramp has not been in use for some years.  Dublin Port Company has no plans, at present, to bring this terminal into use.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the terrible problems experienced in Dublin 4, particularly in Ringsend, Irishtown and Sandymount because of congestion at the port and the fact that facilities were moved from Dún Laoghaire to Dublin Port?  The quality of life in these areas has deteriorated rapidly and there was an accident recently in Irishtown which could have had serious implications for schoolchildren.  Will the Minister give an assurance that he will take every precaution to ensure traffic levels do not develop to such an extent that the quality of life in Sandymount, Ringsend and Irishtown is obliterated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans to proceed any further along these lines.  Any plans would have to receive planning permission and Dublin Corporation would obviously be very concerned about that.  There are five ro-ro operators based at Dublin Port namely, Irish Ferries, Pandoro, Merchant Ferries, Sea Containers and Stena Line.  All these operate from termini on the north side of the river, none operates from the south side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate they may cross the bridge but one would need to put a tunnel along the front of Sandymount to allow them access there.  I am aware that traffic problems can occur in the areas referred to by Deputy Gormley. There is no question but that Dublin Port is growing apace.  The completion of the north side tunnel would make a great difference to traffic levels as people would be able to take the M50 and join the road at Whitehall to access the port.  That is probably what will happen in future.</P>

      <P>Considering the phenomenal success of Dublin Port over the past years and the increased economic activity at all our ports, what progress has been made on the proposal to develop a new ro-ro port at Arklow?  This would obviously have the effect of providing an additional facility on the east coast and would have the added benefit of siphoning off much of the port traffic which is currently congesting the city and overloading Dublin Port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to put down a question on the matter, I can give him a detailed reply.  I met the Arklow port committee which is anxious to have its port developed.  Its members pointed out that such development would remove some of the traffic from Dublin Port.  That proposal would have to be analysed in great detail to assess its feasibility and viability.  Some aspects of the proposal are being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this question is about the ro-ro terminal on the southside.  There is one there but it will not be used for that purpose. The other ro-ro facilities are on the northside.  Besides, if there were to be a future use for the facility, there would have <Col N="794" /> to be planning permission for it.  There is a general problem but it relates to the roads infrastructure.</P>

She asked me to point out the general problem with traffic in the area, to which Deputy Gormley referred.  Have consultations taken place between Dublin Port and representatives of the communities in these areas to allay their concerns and to discuss the issue?  A truck overturned there recently and caused chaos. People were held up for more than three hours. It would be a good public relations effort if Dublin Port at least met the communities and discussed their concerns.</P>

    <P>A categorisation of the fleet by vessel length is not readily available for the period 1993 to 1996 and it would not be practicable, having regard to the enormous commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved, to compile this data.</P>
    <P>Over the next year the composition of the fishing vessel register will be altered significantly by the inclusion of 900 smaller vessels which have been part of the fishing fleet for many years but which have not been registered to date.  Approval has finally been secured from the EU Commission for a scheme to regularise the position of these boats and I expect the issuing of certificates of registry to commence shortly.</P>
    <P>The composition and profile of the fishing fleet will be influenced over the next few years by ongoing fleet modernisation by the industry itself, in line with fleet capacity targets set under the recently agreed fourth EU multi-annual guidance programme.  The objective is to enhance the efficiency and economic viability of the Irish fishing industry, and the whitefish fleet in particular, assisted by funding for modernisation under the <Col N="796" /> present Operational Programme for Fisheries.  I have also announced my intention to introduce a programme of grant aid for new whitefish vessels under the operational programme.  Work is under way to finalise this programme for approval by the EU Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked this question in the hope that we might examine how to ensure a future for our smaller fishing boats.  The Minister will be as keen as I to tackle the problem of depleting fish stocks while ensuring the future of the industry. When he is negotiating fish quotas with his European counterparts, will he ensure that cognisance is taken of the need to discriminate in favour of smaller vessels which will not remove the same quantities of fish from the sea but which have a high employment element?  They are perhaps more important in the fishing industry than the larger boats when one takes the number of people employed on smaller vessels into account. Is it possible to divide the quota between larger and smaller boats so that smaller ones do not sink economically by paying the price for a quota which is too generalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's tonnage figure applies up to 5 December 1997 because we have not reached 31 December.  The average tonnage for 1997 is 46 gross registered tonnes, in 1996 it was 43.69, in 1995 it was 40, in 1994 it was 37 and in 1993 it was 35.  There is an overall trend towards larger boats.</P>
      <P>The inclusion on the sea-fishing boat register of about 900 smaller boats which are part of the fishing fleet but not registered will regularise the position of a large number of small fishermen. EU approval has been obtained for a special registration scheme and the process of issuing certificates of registry will commence shortly.</P>
      <P>The registration of smaller vessels will enable the owners to apply for modernisation grants under the EU funded operational programme for fisheries.  This is an important development in recognising and registering them.  This Government and the previous one negotiated an additional tonnage to include smaller boats to enable the owners to participate in grant schemes.</P>
      <P>Small fishermen are not being pushed out of business.  In some cases owners of smaller vessels are upgrading to larger and more modern ones. This demonstrates their confidence in the long-term viability of the fishing industry.  In addition, upgrading is beneficial from a safety point of view.  When upgrading, frequently owners of smaller boats will want to get bigger boats.  Our fleet is still quite small in size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the average gross tonnage.  Does he accept that the increase in average tonnage demonstrates smaller vessels are paying the price for the need to conserve fish stocks?  We need to stop dividing the quota across the board because this militates in favour of larger vessels and reduces employment <Col N="797" /> potential.  Will the Minister consider dividing the quota so it is reduced for smaller boats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The quota is divided in relation to a boat's tonnage.  The Deputy suggested there should be a differential in favour of smaller boats so if there is a fish shortage they have a better chance of continuing.  It is a reasonable point and I will examine it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that 900 smaller fishing vessels may be registered although I assume the number will be smaller because it will be voluntary.  Will the Minister confirm criteria will be laid down for registration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>More boats will seek registration but 900 will be eligible.  The Deputy may have referred to those boats which are not included, of which there will be many.  Many boat owners did not apply.  It was only possible to get a certain amount of tonnage from the commission for this process.  When that was agreed, applications were accepted.  There are cases where people did not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned about the continuing trend towards larger vessels? Seven per cent of the fleet is catching 60 per cent of fish.  As this trend applies elsewhere in Europe, does the Minister think the time has come for a fundamental overhaul of European fishing policy so that the emphasis is put on the needs of coastal communities and conservation rather than on the requirements of larger boat owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a constant problem and conservation is a major issue.  The review of the Common Fisheries Policy is beginning now with a view to looking beyond 2002.  I hope to initiate a root and branch examination of the criteria and how they are implemented.  Deputy Gilmore, as a former Minister of State for the Marine, knows the difficulties and complexities.  Nevertheless, we should not be drawn into these too much.  While we must deal with them on a daily basis, it is important there should be a radical appraisal to see how we can put forward proposals to meet future needs.  I agree that a review is necessary.</P>

      <P>One of the great wonders of each year's budget debate is the ease with which Deputies on the Government side find items in the budget which they can commend and Deputies on the Opposition find provisions with which to find fault.  That is stranger in recent times when parties have been moving from one <Col N="799" /> side of the House to the other fairly frequently. Budgets have not been very different, being confined by the Maastricht guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is to be commended for being consistent, in this his first budget, with the philosophy he has expressed for many years in the House and outside and which does not always find favour with people in his own party.  His philosophy shines through in what he is proposing.</P>
      <P>Tax breaks provided for employers and others who are perceived in certain circles as having a good deal of access to finance have been criticised. In that context, the Minister will look to employers to deliver more jobs.  Provisions in the budget that allow greater flexibility and man-oeuvrability by the people who control the provision of employment and finance is an important aspect which will ensure a return in jobs in the short term and also in the medium to long-term, and it will be very important to undertake an ongoing assessment of the effects of these moves.</P>
      <P>Regarding taxation, Ministers have been faulted for the direct effect of their budget provisions on taxation.  On this occasion the Minister for Finance has been universally praised for having improved the lot of the worker.  It is important to put this year's developments in taxation, especially personal taxation, into a fairly short-term context.  It is not very long since the standard and higher rates of tax were 14 or 15 points higher than they are this year.  A 2 per cent reduction may not seem significant, but in the overall context of the past five or six budgets, or more particularly in the context of the past ten years and the improvement in national finances over that time, there has been a truly massive improvement in terms of direct taxation on workers' incomes.  All Ministers for Finance over that period of ten years or so have reason to feel proud of their efforts.</P>
      <P>The Minister is imposing some restrictions relating to the business expansion scheme, but he has allowed some exceptions in the short term. The lead-in period for many of these projects is very long and initial costs are relatively high.  The Minister should, therefore, err on the side of being liberal in allowing business expansion schemes which have not quite got off the ground to be completed in the format in which they were initially envisaged.  I do not have specific examples in mind, but I have no doubt there are worthy schemes which have reached a certain stage and which ought to be nurtured rather than dispensed with.</P>
      <P>I welcome the specific provisions for the long-term unemployed, particularly the double relief for employers of people in that category.  It is a measure which will need to be monitored to ensure that in 12-24 months' time there will be something to show for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the innovation in regard to donations to charity and the inclusion of disadvantaged schools in that category.  It is a way to <Col N="800" /> make additional finances available to worthy charities and schools in a manner that does not directly cost the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>There are a number of developments in the area of sport and tourism.  First there is the fact that they have been put together.  It is clear that under the Minister, Dr. McDaid, sport is getting a more central role.  I welcome that very strongly. One of the elements of the budget which was singled out for particular criticism was the £20 million provision for Croke Park.  I welcome that provision.  As the debate has developed, more and more people are coming to the view that money will be well spent.  In the publicity which surrounded it, other elements of the package relating to sport were forgotten, and they are also worthy.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a new tourism marketing fund directed at areas which have been losing ground or failing to benefit from the growth in tourism from which certain areas have benefited. That is a welcome innovation for which I commend the Minister.  I hope it will be directed specifically at areas which have the capacity in the short term to deal with tourism numbers and which have not been showing the level of growth that some areas, particularly the capital city, have been enjoying over the past five to 15 years.  The longer term assessment is more dramatic in terms of the growth of tourism in Dublin and the Dublin area as against other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The pilot resorts scheme was to come to an end next summer and is being extended for a year for people who have expended 15 per cent of the cost of their project.  For people purchasing land, the cost of the purchase of the land would generally be allowed to be included in the 15 per cent. However, there are some people who were already owners of property at the inception of the scheme who, for one reason or another, were not able to develop it, in many instances for reasons outside their control; there may have been short-comings in the sewerage or water services which meant that planning permission could not be applied for or granted sooner, or there might have been title difficulties or any one of a number of other difficulties.  Some of those people would have extreme difficulty in meeting the 15 per cent requirement by the end of July.  I urge the Minister, when adding detail to this in the Finance Bill to allow people who have done a certain amount of work and who were clearly intent on developing certain projects to go ahead.  There has been much negative publicity regarding developments under the seaside resort scheme in Lahinch and Kilkee in my constituency. However, there has been little reference to the adverse effect of these developments on the surrounding areas and resorts.  For example, Liscannor and Lisdoonvarna have suffered badly from the dramatic developments in Lahinch.  It is important that the person carrying out the assessment of the scheme should also consider its effect on the surrounding areas. <Col N="801" /> I welcome the rural renewal scheme being introduced for the upper Shannon area.  A case can be made for the introduction of similar schemes in small areas along the Shannon, Erne and other waterways which have not benefited from the huge growth in surrounding areas.  The same applies to the scheme for hotels.  A county base may be convenient for the administration of the scheme but this does not always reflect the reality on the ground.  For example, some of the towns included in the scheme may already have a number of hotels, while many smaller towns in adjoining counties have not benefited from the developments in the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to note the 5.1 per cent decline in farm incomes this year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food said that during his previous term in office between 1992 and 1994 there was a cumulative growth in incomes of 24 per cent.  I do not know who he was trying to blame for the decline in incomes during the interim but it is a problem which the Government, this House and the EU must face up to.  This decline is particularly evident in the beef sector which is suffering many problems, for example, the blockade in the UK, the BSE crisis and the release of intervention beef in world markets at very low prices. I urge the Minister to address these problems and ensure that current beef production secures the prices which are possible and necessary.</P>
    <P>Many sectors of the agricultural industry are experiencing difficulties.  I welcome the additional headage payments for sheep farmers this year. There is much debate about farm incomes and their subsidisation by the EU.  It is clear that the provisions put in place for 1994-9 will not be sufficient. One debate relates to the Santer proposals post 2000, while another debate relates to the shortfalls in the funding provided by the EU. I am glad the Minister for Agriculture and Food managed to secure an extra £23 million for next year as this will ensure that headage payments will be at the level they ought to be.  I also welcome his undertaking that small farmers will retain the level of headage payments they received heretofore.</P>
    <P>There has been much controversy about installation aid for farmers.  The funding for this purpose ran out some time during the summer and I am glad the Minister has provided adequate funding for the processing of existing valid applications. He has been very successful in introducing measures which will ensure that young people are willing to take over farms in the future.</P>
    <P>The increases in social welfare benefits always receive considerable airing.  When compared to recent years, the increases this year are decent. Nevertheless, all Deputies agree that we must provide generously for older people.  I commend the Minister for the increases he has given them this year.  The cumulative increase over the past three or four years is impressive but we must avail of the opportunities in the coming years to increase payments even further.  This also applies to many other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> I welcome the change in the family income supplement whereby the payment will be calculated on the basis of net income.  This will make an enormous difference for many people and make the scheme much more attractive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ulick Burke.  I am pleased that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for whom I have great respect, is in the Chair.  He also represents a Border constituency and has scaled the heights in terms of ministerial appointments.  Later I will quote the remarks he made ten months ago during the debate on the Financial Resolutions.  I hope someone on the Government side will explain these comments to me.  In my capacity as a cynic, I wonder if this House is an asylum, whether it has any relevance and whether more sense is spoken in public houses.  I am referring to the effect of the increase in petrol prices in Border areas.</P>
      <P>Before I deal with this issue I will refer to the budget.  Some people will always pick holes in a budget, but this is a reasonable and good budget which distributes a fair amount of largesse.  My racing friend and colleague, the Minister for Finance, looked after the elderly and gave them an increase of £5.  No previous Government gave them a similar increase.  Even if he had given them a £10 increase there are people who would have found fault with it.  Unfortunately this is the nature of our business.</P>
      <P>He has also begun a cycle which hopefully will lead to a significant reduction in income tax rates. There may be some credence to the charges by Members on this side of the House that it will benefit the higher paid more than the lower paid, but middle income earners have been persecuted for many years.  These people do not expect the State to give them a house and do not look for handouts.  Young couples should have the courage to buy a house.  These people need help and the Minister gave them some relief.  Given the good state of the economy, I hope future budgets will move further in this direction so that people will benefit.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with the budget other than the impact of the increase in petrol on Border areas.  I have had this beef for the past 16 years. I represent a deprived area.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows that this area has been neglected by successive Governments, including Fine Gael Governments.  We have been the victims of the war in the Six Counties, yet we have received no help.  During the 1970s we should have been given a special status but this was not done.  In my native town of Dundalk businesses went from the pinnacle of success down to an abyss.  Today the unemployment rate in the town is double the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the increase of 20p in the price of a gallon of petrol, ten months ago on budget day the then leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern, asked the Taoiseach to justify the increase of 11p in a gallon of petrol.  He went on to say that the <Col N="803" /> increases were penal and against the spirit of removing the burden of taxation.  The Leas-Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, said at columns 1005-6, volume 473 of the Official Report for 22 January:</P>
    <P>The Government has no commitment to the Border region..  This increase will have serious consequences for competitiveness in the Border region because higher transport costs will lead to an increase in the cost of all goods..  This Government is anti-motorist, anti-rural. and anti-Border.  The Taoiseach must address this matter urgently.  It is a major mistake to increase the price of petrol by 11.5p per gallon.</P>
    <P>Was the Leas-Ceann Comhairle joking?  Did he mean it or was he simply playing politics?  The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The same could happen on this side of the House but not with me.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said at column 1002: &ldquo;Deputy Carey was appointed a token Minister of State with responsibility for the Border areas.&rdquo;.  With no disrespect, he was appointed as a token Minister of State.  He had responsibility for western development.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>What chance is there for Border areas as far as input at the Cabinet table is concerned..  The Government had the opportunity not to touch petrol prices but unfortunately it did the opposite.  This must be because of the lack of knowledge of the Border area and lack of input by someone from that region.</P>
    <P>That could be said of Deputy Carey but it cannot be said of the Minister whose appointment was acclaimed in Dundalk.  I was proud of him because for the first time in many years we are represented at the Cabinet table.  The local newspaper, <i>The Argus,</i> assumed the role of John the Baptist, the man who went before, and predicted that Dundalk and County Louth would be in seventh heaven.  Five months on, the unemployment figure in Dundalk remains the same.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced the creation of jobs all over the country, except in the Border region which has been devastated economically.  Even if the peace holds it will take many years to rectify the damage caused by 25 years of warfare on our doorstep.  We are crying out for special status and recognition by the Government.  The Governments of which my party was part failed to grant it.  I hope the Leas-Ceann Comhairle, as a Border Deputy, will concentrate on securing it for this deprived area.</P>
    <P>I am an ex-league of Ireland footballer and had the pleasure of playing with Dundalk at the age of 17.  I follow all sports, racing being my favourite. I will not begrudge the GAA the money it was given.  I acknowledge the contribution it has made but baulk at the amount and the lack of conditions attached.  It is wrong to make fish of <Col N="804" /> one and flesh of another.  The amount should be smaller.  An equal amount should be given to the FAI and the Irish Rugby Football Union.  Can we afford to give £20 million at a time when so many people are awaiting hip replacement operations and life-saving heart surgery?  People will die while waiting to be called.  We should not put sport before people's lives.</P>
    <P>The GAA is an amateur association.  What has it done with the huge amounts of money it has taken in during the years?  It has built grounds in every townland.  When the local club is beaten in the first round there is a lack of interest for a further year.  GAA grounds should be shared and the GAA should explain what it does with the money it takes in each year.</P>
    <P>The cigarette industry has been a major contributor in my county for many years but the bell is tolling for it.  I accuse all Governments of hypocrisy for failing to acknowledge the damage caused by the drinks industry.  There is at least one victim in every family.  Alcoholism is an awful illness.  The youth of Ireland are swimming in a sea of drink and the social problems caused are legion.  More people die from drink related illnesses here than from smoking related illnesses. A cigarette smoker does not go home and sexually assault his child, beat his wife or leave them without food.  It is tragic that all Governments have failed to address this problem honestly.  We should curtail the seductive advertising which appears every ten minutes on television at night aimed at young people.  We are told there are teenage alcoholics and how the single mother phenomenon has increased due to the consumption of alcohol.</P>
    <P>The number of road deaths is unacceptable. More people are killed on the roads here per head of population than in any other country in Europe.  We have turned a blind eye to this.  In recent years when the Minister of Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, presented good proposals to curb the problem of drink driving we witnessed the power of the drinks lobby and backed down. The death toll continues to rise.  Last week six people were killed, including a young girl from my own town whom I knew well.  We lack courage in addressing the problem.  Drink, not drugs, presents the biggest problem.</P>
    <P>I criticise the Government for not including any location in County Louth in the hotels scheme.  I am thinking in particular of the lovely village of Carlingford which is the jewel in the crown.  It is hidden from the view of the masses of Irish people who will not go near the Border. It is a beautiful place which will develop when there is a major hotel located there.  It will become the Kinsale of the east.  It is a shame the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, did not insist on its inclusion in the scheme.  With Omeath and, more particularly, the Minister's home village, Blackrock, it too could have benefited from the designated seaside resorts scheme.  Having said that, my criticism of the Minister's lack of assistance <Col N="805" /> for the Border region is muted because I accept he has been only five months in Government.  I wish him well and hope that during the next five years his influence in Cabinet will be felt in Border areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke" hpid="Mr. U. Burke Mr. U. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGahon for sharing his time.  Like many other Members, I welcome the opportunity to contribute.  No matter what criticisms Members may level at the Minister, some aspects of the budget must be welcomed because they are long overdue.  However, an opportunity has been squandered.  A Minister for Finance may never again have such an opportunity to create a more just and caring society as the current Minister had on this occasion, but he failed to grasp it.</P>
      <P>The budget widens the gap between the rich and the poor.  The low paid, the poor and the disadvantaged have once again been told they must wait.  This is another blow for them.  The number of long-term unemployed will not be reduced substantially and waiting lists for hospitals and housing will persist at an unacceptably high level. The budget failed to focus on areas such as poverty and exclusion of the long-term unemployed. The homeless have been forgotten.  It failed miserably to recognise the crisis in agriculture and no thought was given to reform of the tax system.  While it is an acknowledgement of PD demands, a mere 2p off the higher and lower rates will not reform the overall tax system. Where is the imaginative reform we were promised when the Progressive Democrats were in Opposition?  It has evaporated.  If this is tax reform, we will have to wait a long time to achieve the goals set by the Government when in Opposition.</P>
      <P>High earners benefit most.  A total of 75 per cent of those polled in an MRBI poll in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> indicated that they believe high earners will benefit most from the budget.  This is not a case of the Opposition making jibes at the Government, it is the reality of the public perception.  The lower paid and middle class earners have gained least from the budget. Some 40 per cent of the population will not benefit from the tax cuts and nothing has changed for the 26 per cent who do not have qualifications beyond junior certificate level.  Permanent exclusion and helplessness will become a reality for greater numbers of society.  The unemployed gain nothing from pay increases and tax reductions.  While I welcome the additional tax free allowance of £3,000, plus £1,000 for each child in the first year, that will be made available to the long-term unemployed returning to work, it will help only a few.  It will take a much greater effort to make a worthwhile dent in the number on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget was presented on European Day for People with Disabilities, but the Government's response in this area was inadequate.  The provision of £3 million for people with physical and sensory disabilities does little to show we are <Col N="806" /> serious about tackling this problem.  The £7 million provided for the mentally handicapped is welcome, but also inadequate for the 3,000 or so people nationwide who need funding.  These funds will not even begin to address the need for adequate and appropriate services for all persons with learning disabilities.  Many of these people are placed in services that do not address their needs.</P>
    <P>Despite the growing population with learning disabilities in the Ballinasloe area, new services have not been provided there for the past ten years.  People requiring services have to be taken by bus to Athlone, Portumna or Galway city. Some of them travel for up to six hours in a mini bus to get to their place of service.  Is this how the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, intended to address the problem when he stood for a photocall outside the Dáil with a disabled person before announcing the sum of £7 million for the mentally handicapped and £3 million for the physically disabled? An adequate and appropriate service for the Ballinasloe area would cost in the region of £800,000 per annum and £1.6 million in capital allocation.  Where does that leave the £7 million provided for new services for the nation as a whole?  It is totally inadequate.  These figures are not good enough in the light of the Celtic tiger and the great need that exists for proper services for people with learning disabilities.  When will the Government, which is supposed to care for their interests, provide adequate services for one of the most marginalised and discriminated against sections of our community?  The handicapped feel betrayed, frustrated and bitterly disappointed with the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government has abandoned our most important industry, agriculture.  Provision was not made for the restoration of grants for the control of farmyard pollution or dairy hygiene.  Those grants are essential to farmers who until now were unable to invest to improve their production capacity.  How can new entrants to REPs comply with the regulations of the scheme if grants are not provided to carry out the work of farm pollution control?  The grants must be restored as a matter of urgency because many farmers will not be in a position to invest in capital works on their farms if farming incomes continue to decline.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food must wake from his slumber and tackle three major problems currently facing us.  I am not sure the Government is making a reasonable and whole-hearted effort to lift the blockade against exports of beef and other products to England.  The question of the live export trade has been dangling around the necks of farmers for the past six months, but little, if anything, has been done to resolve the matter.  It behoves the Minister to actively pursue maximum tenders for the 5,000 tonnes of beef next Friday.  It is incumbent on him to ensure the price of beef does not go below 85p. The Minister must tackle those three matters urgently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> Are we serious about the future of farming and encouraging young people into the industry, while at the same time refusing to reintroduce installation grants for all young farmers?  It has been said that commitments given to previous applicants will be honoured and that certain other applicants from small farm backgrounds will have their case reviewed, but that is not good enough.  We cannot divide and conquer as a way of solving the problem. We are talking about farming across the board and those young people who may enter it. There is no likelihood whatever of many young farmers entering agriculture at present.</P>
    <P>If the Minister draws a line he will exclude the very people who might have an opportunity to make a whole-time income from farming in future.  If he excludes them from installation grants he will drive more off the land.  These two important promises were given by the former Minister prior to the last election, yet the current Minister has failed to honour them.</P>
    <P>Another commitment given prior to the election concerned grant aid for abattoirs.  Ten years ago there were over 900 abattoirs, while now there are only 400 plus.  In the 1988-9 period huge pressure was put on abattoir owners to modernise their facilities as a result of EU directives to upgrade them.  They are now being asked again to come up with an average figure of £50,000 each in order to meet new EU regulations.  This will be impossible for many abattoirs, which are usually family run businesses, without a response from the Government.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, as a matter of priority not to allow any more of our small abattoirs to close.  It would have a snowball effect because if we lose competition for beef at local marts, which is always provided by local butchers, prices will be further depressed.  That would be to the advantage only of the few major players in the beef sector.  If more abattoirs close, local employment in rural areas will be further depressed.  No Minister could stand over that and refuse to assist abattoir owners.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the matter of what is happening in the Department of Agriculture and Food with regard to general applications for schemes.  In 1993 the Department refused 5,487 applications for various schemes and in 1994 the figure rose substantially to 7,705.  In 1996, some 9,191 applications for various schemes were refused by the Department.  Something must be seriously wrong if the Department of Agriculture and Food cannot devise simple application forms which can be processed so that people can be paid appropriate grants without such a scandalous level of refusals. The fact that such refusals have increased by approximately 100 per cent in three years is a national scandal.  I do not know what the 1997 figure is, but I have no reason to doubt it is anything less than last year's figure.  Close to 10,000 applicants have probably been refused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="808" /> The Minister should undertake a root and branch review of activities in all sections of his Department as a matter of urgency.  It cannot be the farmers' fault that 10,000 applications for schemes, which were made in good faith, have been refused.  I am asking the Minister to rectify this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the total collapse of dental services in East Galway and in County Galway generally.  The reason is simply that the health board and the Department will not offer permanent contracts to dentists in the area.  There is an urgent need for the provision of finances to appoint dentists and orthodontists on a permanent basis in the Western Health Board area, of which County Galway is a part.  The school dental service has been decimated and the problem it is now creeping further up along the various age groups.  The Minister for Health and Children should institute a thorough review as to why County Galway cannot have a school dental service at a time when the finances are there to provide it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution of £20 million to the GAA by the Minister for Finance.  It is important that our national stadium for Gaelic games is of the highest standard and, more importantly, that it is safe.  If that £20 million saves one person from being injured while attending matches it will have been money well spent.</P>
    <P>The president of the GAA is young and imaginative.  In due course, as the GAA has received a generous £20 million grant from the Government, he will respond by saying that Croke Park might in the very near future be made available to other codes on major national or international sporting occasions.  If the grant was given in the hope and anticipation that this might be a step in that direction, it will have been worthwhile.  It may release funding from GAA headquarters to provide facilities throughout rural areas so that younger people can become involved.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Finance, on introducing a budget aimed primarily at maintaining and further promoting economic growth.  I am well aware that his critics are reluctant to accept that or to attempt to look at the various measures in an objective light.  If they did so they would be forced, by logical assessment, to the same conclusion as those of us on this side of the House &mdash; that the Minister has achieved all he set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me repeat the Minister's objectives, which are those of a Government with a social conscience and with the good of all sections of society at heart.  The Minister has attempted to <Col N="809" /> control the expansion of public spending, to correct tax inequities and to acknowledge the role of the elderly over the generations.</P>
    <P>I recall several Ministers representing various Governments crying into their budget scripts about the contribution of the elderly to this nation in their younger years.  Those Ministers would then proceed to hand out a miserable pittance as a pension increase.  The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has declined to shed crocodile tears but he has handed the recipients of old age pensions the biggest increase they have ever had.</P>
    <P>Whether the Opposition likes it or not, the reality is that pensioners never before got an increase of £5 per week.  Deputy McGahon acknowledged that, at least.  I seek no plaudits for it and neither does the Minister.  It is a time of relative plenty when deficiencies can be rectified and living standards raised by some measures all around.  However, the Minister and the parties in Government might expect to have that achievement acknowledged at least, however much it may disappoint the Opposition and reduce their popularity in the eyes of the public.</P>
    <P>While I am as wary as the next Deputy of the value of opinion polls, I would be less than human if I did not take account of, and take a certain pride in, the popularity of this Government as detailed in this morning's opinion poll.  I am always ready to acknowledge the astuteness and perceptiveness of the electorate.  It has once more got it right in regard to the budget.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the fuel allowance was not increased from £5 per week.  This figure was arrived at some years ago because the price of a bag of coal was £5.  Since, then the price of a bag has risen to £7.50, although Deputy Noonan maintains it can still be bought in Limerick for £6.50. It must be an inferior quality to what we get elsewhere in the country.  There was a saying among old people that a good fire was a half a meal and it still holds true for those who are too infirm to exercise for warmth or are too poor to eat well.  I look forward to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs reviewing the fuel allowance and know he will not be found wanting.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has also set a target of eliminating tax inequities.  It was inevitable, given the climate in which we had to live over the past two decades, that there would be dissatisfaction with the tax system and genuine tax inequities interlaced in its various provisions.  I am pleased the Minister has addressed the first and most important problem, the amount of tax paid by each individual.  I acknowledge there is more than one way of tackling the various problems and regardless of which route he chose, he would have had his loud and hysterical critics.</P>
    <P>It is important that as a result of his measures people will pay less tax.  The budget will not have the affect of disadvantaging the employer by raising production costs and, therefore, will not have an adverse affect on our national performance.  I do not expect the Minister to reverse the trends <Col N="810" /> of almost two decades of injustice to the PAYE sector in just one budget and I look forward in future years to an adjustment of the tax bands which will further reduce the liability of ordinary workers to income tax and take more of them out of the tax net.  The net effect of his actions will be to put more money in people's pockets and reduce the intrusiveness of the State into their ability to earn a decent living.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acted in the interest of the environment even in the matter of the increase in the price of petrol.  There are few cars built in the last decade which cannot run on low octane unleaded petrol.  The effect of the scrappage scheme has been to remove even greater numbers of deficient cars and gas guzzlers from our roads and the move to unleaded petrol could not be made easier.  Deputy McGahon was selective in his remarks on this issue.</P>
    <P>Advertising measures do not seem to work in getting drivers to change to more environmentally friendly fuel.  The only way to get the message across is to hit their pockets and that is why there was a significant increase in the price of premium petrol while the price of economical unleaded remained unchanged.  It is simple, yet it will prove a very effective teaching aid for motorists.</P>
    <P>I represent the Waterford constituency and would fail my constituents if I did not point out to the Minister that Waterford has seen little of the economic success the country is enjoying.  The biggest economic news in Waterford this autumn was the takeover of Waterford Foods by the more powerful Avonmore group and it will prove to be a bitter winter for many of its employees.  I deliberately refer to this deal as a takeover and not as a merger as portrayed to shareholders, workers and the public.  Accountants can point to factors which show better percentage profits for the Avonmore group in the last reported year, while there are special short-term factors which have kept Waterford Food's profits lower than they would otherwise have been.  This disadvantaged the Waterford group when the time came to marry the two agri-giants.</P>
    <P>However, Waterford finds itself with the prospect of losing 200 well paid jobs in the coming year.  The closure of the Dungarvan milk plant defies logic as all reports suggest it was a most successful enterprise in that it not alone made substantial profit, but made one of the finest brands of butter worldwide.  This is not a proper merger.  If it was, the cuts in employment would be borne equally by both sides, but the axe seems to be falling only on the Waterford side.  This is a disgrace and while there is a fund of £7.5 million for assistance towards finding alternative industry in the worst hit areas, this is little consolation for the workers who know they had a product to be proud of, a plant which was viable and a future which seemed assured.</P>
    <P>They were less than secure in their jobs and were deluded in their belief that they would be anything less than players on a checkers board to <Col N="811" /> be swept aside as expediency demanded.  A genuine and sustained effort will have to be made to identify alternative industry for Dungarvan, Kilmeadan and other hard hit locations and to provide employment for those who want to work.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in Dungarvan, the provision of the new technical college has been progressed.  I am delighted the Minister has given his approval to a full investigation of the proposed new site and that under his guidance and direction, the long awaited and much needed new building will soon be a reality far from the position under the previous Administration, when there were three different plans on the table.  I am confident a new air of realism obtains and the dithering of the last Minister has been replaced by the confident forward looking and positive approach of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>Waterford city is the capital of the south east but, despite this, there has been a gradual erosion in the status of the city through the transfer of the functions of many public authority headquarters to other population centres in the region. Of the five other town authorities which have a mayor, outside of the five major cities, the south east has three located within its boundary.  Other cities have no threat to their status as capital, but the claim of Waterford as capital of the south-east is threatened by the presence of Clonmel, Kilkenny and Wexford as its near neighbours. The region loses out because of the natural tension between the various cities and boroughs and the inevitable jockeying for position between the various large centres of population.</P>
    <P>Waterford should not only be recognised as the <i>de jure</i> capital, but it should have the right to act as a <i>de facto</i> leader of the region as well.  It is without the administrative regional headquarters of the South Eastern Health Board, the IDA, the South East Regional Authority, the ESB and more recently, the Garda Síochána which inexplicably &mdash;discounting a political motive by the previous Administration &mdash; was allocated to Kilkenny.  I fully support the concept of decentralisation and any realistic moves to spread the fruits of economic success to all parts.  It is not possible, however, to underpin the social and economic fabric of any region without strengthening its administrative capital.  A strong regional capital has been established in the cities of Cork, Limerick and Galway and it would be equally unthinkable that an official body's headquarters would be established in the eastern region in any area but Dublin.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, therefore, that when I was Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications, I was able to effect the transfer of part of the Department of Social Welfare and the Land Registry office to Waterford, thereby adding not only to the status of the city, but also to the pool of employment. Waterford Regional Airport has been less favourably treated than other regional airports.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners have yet to be promoted <Col N="812" /> to the status of a State sponsored body, although I recognise other factors are involved.  It is extraordinary that such a situation should have been allowed to arise in one of the four major ports of the nation, a fact recognised not only by the Government, but also by the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government must make a very significant investment in the reinstatement of Waterford as a major growth centre.  This is in the interests, not only of the city and county of Waterford and the south east region generally, but, more fundamentally, it is vital to the balanced regional development of the entire country.  Ireland needs a number of strategically positioned national and regional growth centres.  The national growth centre is Dublin and that must necessarily remain the position.  The principal regional growth centres are the four cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.  In recent decades Waterford has been allowed slip behind other cities.  There was a time when Waterford was the second city of the entire island of Ireland and was its principal port. Waterford is still strategically situated and its position could be reinstated in trading terms.</P>
    <P>In 1993 the Government designated the port of Waterford as the principal lift-on lift-off freight port for traffic between Ireland and continental Europe.  This is hardly surprising as it enjoys a closer location to the continent than any of the other four cities.  The time is right to designate the port of Belview as a special tax area, as was done in the case of some airports many years ago and more recently at Knock.  If we are serious about the development of the south east generally, the improvement of the port of Belview and the creation of regional capitals, this would be a positive step in that direction for Waterford.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this proposal in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Belview also needs an improvement in the provision of public infrastructure, which is essential to underpin the development of the port.  I have in mind the need to improve the national primary routes which give access to Waterford, including the N9 and N10 from Carlow and Kilkenny, together with the upgrading of the N30 from Enniscorthy to New Ross.</P>
    <P>It is vital, from the access transport viewpoint and to relieve traffic congestion within Waterford City, that the long awaited second river crossing be provided with the utmost speed, as soon as the planning details have been finalised by the local authorities involved.  This has been a live issue for more than a quarter of a century and the time is long past when the premier city of the south east should have the measure of independence and security which would be endowed by this greatly needed facility.</P>
    <P>In relation to underpinning high added value, high skills employment in Waterford and the south east region, it is vital that the Government proceed immediately with the expansion plans which have been announced for the Waterford Institute for Technology.  Development of the <Col N="813" /> WIT is an essential prerequisite to the establishment of Waterford as a major location for high technology industry and for a wide range of professional service industries, which are much needed to give a more balanced employment profile in the city and the region.</P>
    <P>Employers who are complaining bitterly about the budget should face up to their social responsibilities and pay their workers a decent wage.  The day when one paid £1.20 per hour for adult work is long past and the sooner people realise that the better.  The concept of a minimum hourly rate is a contentious one and agreement will not be achieved without a great deal of negotiation and concessions.  If we are to truly espouse the principle of an honest day's pay for an honest day's work we will have to grasp the nettle and make a start on the road to social justice.</P>
    <P>This budget has made a reasonable start towards resolving some of the major economic problems of our society.  I look forward to the several budgets which the Minister will present. At the end of the natural life of this Dáil the country will be fitter and more vibrant to tackle any outstanding issues effectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government and especially my Fianna Fáil colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on his budget presentation on Wednesday, 3 December l997.  It was heartening to listen to the Opposition speakers this afternoon who lavished praise on Mr. McCreevy for his good deeds but also criticised him for certain things he could not do.  They should take into account that this is the first of five budgets.  This is one of the most innovative budgets of modern times and I look forward to the next four to be presented during the lifetime of this Government.  We in Fianna Fáil set high but achievable targets and goals in our election manifesto.  We are well on the way to achieving these aims.  Not only are we benefiting from the effects of the Celtic tiger in the budget but we are taking steps to ensure the economy remains strong and healthy in order that society will prosper in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the budget changes regarding the elderly in our society.  The increase of £5 per week is another indication of Fianna Fáil's commitment to our senior citizens.  In the past my party demonstrated a recognition of the part played in society by our elder fellow citizens.  The introduction of free travel by my party was regarded as a landmark decision.  This increase, while not of the same magnitude, must rank as a generous gesture.  The Minister demonstrated our commitment to the elderly by altering the capital acquisitions taxation provisions regarding the position of elderly brothers and sisters who share the family home.  I was pleased to see this as the anomaly was a serious one and had been over-looked by Governments for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to increase the relief from inheritance tax from 60 per cent of the value of the home, or £80,000, to 80 per <Col N="814" /> cent of the value, or £150,000, whichever is the lesser.  Another example of our commitment to social inclusion is the increase of £1,000 per annum in the carer's allowance for the physically incapacitated and the mentally infirm.  I welcome the allocation of £1.2 million to the marriage and child counselling and the family mediation service. As public representatives we have encountered the hardship and heartbreak of marital breakdown, particularly the effects on children.  I readily acknowledge the great work done by many counselling and mediation services throughout the country.  This work cannot be done on a shoestring.  Society must accept its responsibilities in this field.  I sincerely hope this is the beginning and I am sure this allocation will greatly assist these services in their good work.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to allocate £20 million from the national lottery towards the continued development of Croke Park.  The Minister has come in for some criticism in this regard. Everybody acknowledges the immense voluntary work carried out by the GAA in every parish.  As a rural Deputy I fully appreciate the integral part played in community life by the Gaelic Athletic Association.  The young people in our society are provided with recreational facilities by the GAA and the unselfish giving by members of the GAA of their time towards the development of our young athletes has been recognised by the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats through this allocation.</P>
    <P>State funding of a project of this nature is not uncommon elsewhere.  We have only to look across the Irish Sea to Wales where the national sport is rugby and its national stadium, Cardiff Arms Park, is undergoing a complete reconstruction fully funded by the UK Exchequer.  In the forthcoming Finance Bill I ask the Minister to examine the imposition of VAT on hurleys.  This is one of the most serious problems encountered by the GAA, given that hurleys are quite expensive and that it takes considerable funds to run these clubs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiatives in the budget dealing with agriculture.  The full livestock headage will be paid to farmers in l998, towards which the Minister allocated £23 million, bringing the total to £110 million.  This will ensure future competitiveness under the CAP.  VAT refunds have been increased from 3.3 per cent to 3.6 per cent, which is equivalent to £8 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>As regards young farmers, an allocation of £3.5 million has been made available for existing applicants and a new scheme for small farmers will be introduced next year.  The current 100 per cent stock relief for young farmers will apply for four years instead of two.  That clearly demonstrates the Government's commitment to young farmers.  There will be an increase in expenditure of special capital allowance on pollution control from £20,000 to £30,000 from 5 April 1998.  This will allow farmers to claim 50 per cent of capital expenditure up to £30,000 in any one year as an allowance.  The support for farmers in the budget <Col N="815" /> should stimulate on-farm investment and help young farmers through the initial years of taking over the farm.  Coupled with those measures are the general taxation changes which also benefit farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to continued taxation reform is evident in this budget.  There has been much debate about whether it is better to widen the tax bands or reduce the rates.  The compromise introduced by the Minister will please many people, as can be seen from the opinion polls published in the national newspapers today. Cutting 2 per cent off the higher rate will encourage a willingness to earn higher income without people feeling that efforts made and overtime worked are not rewarded.  A motivated workforce will help keep our booming economy on track.</P>
    <P>On the business expansion scheme, the Minister has fine-tuned the legislation by reducing the amount of money which may be raised from £1 million to £250,000.  That will have the desired effect of focusing on smaller indigenous enterprises as the legislation intended.</P>
    <P>The State was founded 75 years ago this month. With that historic event, the dreams, ideas and aspirations of our founding fathers were realised. However, some people believed the new State would not succeed, that Ireland would not take its place among the nations of the world.  It is uniquely appropriate that this budget should be presented by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the State.  The budget clearly demonstrates that the hopes and aspirations of that time have been realised, that the economy is soundly based and that as a nation we have taken our place.  Fianna Fáil has done more during the past 75 years to achieve that than any other political party or organisation.  In the coming years we will build on that and keep faith with the people who have supported us during that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackWall" hpid="Mr. Wall Mr. Wall">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wall</NameTxt>
      <P>The headlines about this budget declare it to be a give-away budget, but if the opinion poll in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning is to be believed, the public is already aware at whom the give-away has been directed.  The majority of taxpayers believe they would have done better if the Government had taken different options.  It is difficult to fathom why the Government chose to take the route it followed.  Fianna Fáil often claims credit for initiating social partnership.  The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, put together the first Programme for National Recovery, but Fianna Fáil seems to have lost touch with developments since then.  Social partnership represents an approach to the management of the economy which goes much further than mere pay agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partnership 2000, the latest partnership agreement, is among the most ambitious of the agreements. It contains commitments to the spending of £525 million on social inclusion measures as well as the customary tax reliefs for people in <Col N="816" /> work.  Because of the social position inherited by the Minister for Finance, the Government has been able to allocate this money in two years instead of three, as envisaged by the agreement, and that is welcome.  In this context it is astonishing the Government has chosen to abandon the implicit understanding in the agreement that tax reliefs would be directed at people on lower and middle incomes.  The reaction of the trade union movement, particularly SIPTU, to the Government's decision is understandable.  A constituent of mine said the budget is worth an extra £3 in her pay packet, but given that this woman has to travel 150 miles per week to work, taking into account the increase in petrol, the extra money goes towards her transport costs.</P>
    <P>Trade union leaders secured agreement to Partnership 2000 in good faith.  As the economy expanded in recent years there has been a growing sense of frustration among workers that they are not getting a fair share of the cake they help to bake.  When one sees the number of new cars on the road, particularly large cars such as BMWs and Mercedes, it is difficult not to have sympathy with that sentiment.  Workers are aware the disparity between the well off and those on the other side of the spectrum has increased in recent years. They are entitled to expect that the Government's tax package would tackle this problem, but the contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticism of previous budgets by some commentators who agree the rich fare better than those on low and middle incomes.  The policy of increasing personal allowances and widening tax bands benefits those with money.  In that sense a reduction in taxation is not a sufficient mechanism for reducing income disparities. This budget is unique in ensuring the well off fare better than the less well off in terms of the percentage of income they will gain from the tax reliefs announced in the budget.  That has been described by many commentators as scandalous, and they are right.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising SIPTU has reacted negatively to the budget.  In short, the Minister has sold it a pup.  Responsible trade unions which realise the advantages of partnership are aware this budget will make it more difficult for them to secure consent to future agreements.  As a result of the Minister's actions, trade unions have a credibility problem with their members.  I listened to the exchange between Des Geraghty of SIPTU and the Minister on the radio over the weekend.  It is of concern that the Minister does not seem to understand, never mind acknowledge, the fundamental damage he has done to the strategy which underpins current economic success. The problem is compounded by some of the other measures announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>There is no absolute measure of poverty or success in an economy.  People at the bottom rung of the ladder fare much better than people in a comparable position 100 years ago.  The only true measure of how one fares in society is by comparison with one's peers.  Similarly, the only way <Col N="817" /> one can determine how an individual has benefited from this budget is by comparison with how others have fared.  In that context, the reduction in capital gains tax and the upper rate of corporation tax are inflammatory.  The halving of capital gains tax is incredible.  For a person selling £200,000 worth of shares after next April, the gain from the budget will be £20,000.  The old adage that money begets money is truer now than ever, yet those who earn their living by their labour have fared badly in this budget.  The reduction of 4 per cent in the upper corporation tax rate, as opposed to a 3 per cent reduction in the lower rate, is evidence that the Government has ignored the needs of small, mainly indigenous producers and given large companies and banks &mdash; whose recently announced large profits demonstrate they are doing extremely well &mdash; a huge dividend.</P>
    <P>On this occasion also the Government eschewed a widening of the tax bands about which all one can say is that they are consistently bad and inequitable.  This budget represents a missed opportunity to solve some of our pressing problems, for example, to tackle the interaction between our social welfare and taxation systems. Since simplicity is the key issue here, by far the easiest way to have resolved this problem would have been to raise personal allowances, thereby taking many people out of the tax net altogether. A special tax allowance for the unemployed is not available simultaneously with other employment schemes.  Our taxation system is littered with poverty and unemployment traps and it is the responsibility of Government to tackle them.</P>
    <P>I will cite one issue my party has attempted to raise.  The Minister for Education and Science recently announced that families who hold a medical card would be exempt from State examination fees in respect of the junior and leaving certificates.  This is a decision I support, but I must admit it will create additional problems.  I ask the House to imagine the case of a family whose income exceeds the medical card eligibility limit by a mere £5 and who, despite that low income, will not benefit from this well intentioned move but instead will be penalised for working.</P>
    <P>These are the kinds of issues needing urgent attention by the Government but which have been ignored in the preparation of this budget. However, it does contain some welcome provisions, such as the £5 increase for pensioners, an appropriate recognition of their efforts in building our society.  I was disappointed to note that the fuel allowance, which is of special benefit to those living alone over the winter months, did not receive equal attention.  Any such increase would have been welcomed by those unfortunate people who must travel the highways and byways to supplement their present miserly £5 fuel allowance.</P>
    <P>The social welfare package is less than impressive when one examines it in detail.  For example, I had hoped the widow's pension would have been increased by more than 4.4 per cent because, over the past four and a half years, I have had numerous representations made on their behalf.  They appear to be the forgotten <Col N="818" /> people in our society.  On this occasion, when so much money was available, it is a pity their needs and concerns were not addressed more positively.</P>
    <P>Numerous people coming to my clinic have been in receipt of disability benefit for more than 12 months and have not obtained the relevant medical clearance beyond that period to enable them claim invalidity pension.  Yet other persons have been in receipt of disability benefit for anything between 18 and 21 months.  When the 12 month term has expired, it is my belief that such persons should also be entitled to other allowances because invariably they experience enormous hardship which should be alleviated.  I appeal to the Government to investigate the matter of those in receipt of disability benefit who exceed the 12 month time limit and to enable them apply for an invalidity pension and benefit from the provisions of other free schemes over that extended period.</P>
    <P>The previous Government concentrated on addressing family poverty by substantially increasing child benefit.  When in Government with my party, Fianna Fáil exerted considerable influence in granting the initial substantial increases in child benefit but, under the influence of the Progressive Democrats, it appears to have abandoned that sensible approach.  There is nobody, ranging from commentators to the ordinary person in the street, who would not argue that there is no better means of improving the family structure than increasing the child benefit of each family unit.  There is no other means of ensuring that mothers are guaranteed substantial support in the maintenance of their family structures. I hope the Minister will quickly realise this mistake and in his next budget revert to the agreement between the parties of the previous Government, when once again child benefit will be perceived as a major bulwark in maintaining the family structure.  That departure from proven policy is all the more regrettable when one takes account of the fact that child dependant allowances in the case of social welfare recipients have been frozen.  This is yet another example of an ideal opportunity to uphold the family structure having been ignored by the Government.  That is inexplicable and means that families have fared worse under this budget than single people which, given the Government's rhetoric on families, is deeply disappointing.</P>
    <P>As my party spokesman on finance, Deputy McDowell, indicated over the past weekend, none of these decisions is surprising.  The Minister for Finance is one of the most ideological Members of the House, with a strong belief in the trickle-down effects of wealth creation and distribution. While he is entitled to his view, I had expected that the Taoiseach &mdash; who in the past was shown to have held different views &mdash; might have put a brake on his Minister but, on this occasion, with the Minister for Finance being backed by the Tánaiste, it appears he was unable to rein-in his Minister.  This failure was unfortunate <Col N="819" /> and, I suspect, already regretted by many Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>
    <P>There has already been mention of the problems being encountered in the provision of various dental services.  I ask the Minister to examine them since some families have to wait anything up to 28 months for orthodontic treatment for their children.  Surely in our present strong financial climate, this should be rectified so that no child should have to endure orthodontic problems in this modern era.  These problems sometimes lead to their being jeered in school by their fellow pupils.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of the home help service operated by the Eastern Health Board. Sometimes a home help has to travel anything up to 15 miles for a miserly £2 per hour.  Something must be done about this.  Is it evidence of the great Celtic tiger, about which so much is spoken, that we require someone to travel anything from ten to 15 miles to be remunerated at that level for an hour's work?  While that would not even pay for their petrol, I am aware of many people who, out of sympathy for the dependent person, will undertake such work regardless of the rate of remuneration.  It is also my belief that the pilot programme initiated in respect of home attendance should be developed further to assist dependent people.  Many senior citizens are badly in need of assistance at home, even with the dressing of wounds and other minor difficulties.  The Department of Health and Children should consider expanding the home attendants service as the job of the home help is mainly to clean the house or light the fire.</P>
    <P>In regard to the carer's allowance, many people look after their much loved kin.  I became aware of a person recently who is caring for her sister 24 hours a day.  I made an application on her behalf for the carer's allowance but the application was overruled on income grounds.  I made further representations to the Eastern Health Board and, amazingly, it decided to give this person £2.50 per week.  To make matters worse, that sum was to be paid on a monthly basis.  We hear much talk about our booming economy, yet a person who is looking after her sister 24 hours a day receives a mere £2.50 per week.  I strongly urge the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children to examine cases such as this to ensure they do not arise in the future.  A person should not have to care for a family member for 24 hours per day.  I have no doubt that person is giving tremendous care to her sister and that she would, if the finances were available, employ somebody to allow her have a break from her caring duties.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Kildare South, there is an urgent need for industrial development.  I have asked Ministers in the past to set up a task force in relation to this but I was told there was a great deal of industry in north Kildare, that the American methods of employment should be <Col N="820" /> used and that the people of south Kildare should travel up to 50 miles to seek employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement on rural development referred to a pilot project in one area of Leitrim. The Minister does not live very far away from me in Kildare and I can assure him that similar projects will soon have to be initiated in south Kildare.  Rural development is urgently needed because many of the people living in the area will have to move away because of a lack of initiative by relevant Ministers in respect of industry.</P>
    <P>We have a major problem with drinking water supply in south Kildare.  Six hundred students in the various schools in Castledermot had to beg for drinking water from one of the major suppliers of natural water to allow them attend their classes and prepare for their examinations, despite the existence of the south Kildare group water scheme.  When I asked the Minister about this matter I was told that there were no finances available.</P>
    <P>There is a similar problem in relation to road development.  The infrastructure in certain parts of north Kildare is excellent but in the southern areas of the county such as Castledermot, Moone, Timolin and Athy, there is urgent need for road improvements to allow for industrial development.</P>
    <P>I want to make an observation in regard to the budget day process.  It is ludicrous that the Opposition is asked to respond immediately to a budget as soon as the Minister concludes his Budget Statement.  It would be more appropriate to suspend the House at that stage or immediately following the passage of the necessary financial motions to allow the Opposition carefully consider the budget and all its details.  Such a system would allow for a more reasoned and informed debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, but particularly as the first Minister for Sport and Recreation, I welcome the opportunity to state that this budget delivered handsomely to both sport and tourism.  The provisions made by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will have a significant impact on the development of sport and tourism.</P>
      <P>For the first time the Government of the day fully recognised the importance of sport both in our national life and in our local communities. Minister McCreevy's first budget will be recognised as an historic one for the development of Irish sport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former Minister for Tourism, Deputy McCreevy also recognised the enormous importance of tourism to our national economy.  Tourism is our second largest industry and accounts for one job in 12.  Tourism has turned out to be <Col N="821" /> the Celtic tiger's most vivacious cub.  However, I remind the Minister and the Department of Finance that tiger cubs have a propensity to devour unless they are catered for.  Thankfully, the Minister addressed that in the budget.  The strong must always look after the weak and tourism has been one of the strengths of this economy.</P>
    <P>On budget day, amidst other concerns, some of the important details of what was provided for my Department may have been lost in the usual verbal melee.  Let me set out exactly what this Government has done.</P>
    <P>Croke Park will receive £20 million over three years &mdash;£7 million in 1998.  A total of £20 million will be provided towards the development of a national stadium for Gaelic games at Croke Park. The £20 million will go towards the £81 million cost of completing the different phases of the GAA's development plan.  This will include the construction of a new stand at the canal end, the replacement of the Hogan Stand, the redevelopment of the Nally Stand and integration with Hill 16.  A total of £7 million will be provided in 1998, £7 million in 1999 and £6 million in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>There will be a special scheme for investment in certain hotels in particular parts of the country where the unrestricted availability of capital allowances to individual investors will continue. The areas I have in mind are counties where there are insufficient hotels of three star or higher standard and where an investment in upgrading facilities will help spread some of the tourist traffic to those parts of the country which, up to now, have not shared fully in the overall increase in tourist numbers.  The counties proposed are Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo, excluding the designated seaside resorts in those counties.</P>
    <P>The special tourism marketing initiative of £3.5 million was announced for 1998.  The increased provision will provide for tourism marketing initiatives on special projects such as the Ryder Cup, overseas marketing in a wider spread of countries and an increased emphasis, of which I have spoken previously, on regional tourism promotion. This provision is in addition to the £5 million already provided for extra marketing funds in 1998.</P>
    <P>The current sports expenditure of £1.75 million in 1998 will allow for a number of significant initiatives in sport which are at an advanced stage of preparation.  One such initiative will be to provide for drug testing in sport which I made a priority on coming into office.  Other initiatives will be designed to support our high performance athletes and our ever-increasing sporting talent. These additional moneys represent 21 per cent increase over 1997 in current sports spending.</P>
    <P>Capital sports expenditure of £3 million in 1998 represents a 50 per cent increase on the £6 million already provided for 1998 and will be a significant boost to sporting activity at community level where individual clubs and schools benefit.  The interdepartmental policy committee's pilot programme on integrated <Col N="822" /> service delivery in disadvantaged areas was allocated £750,000 for 1998.  That committee will oversee that project which is aimed at securing the integrated delivery of all State funded services in a number of urban areas of severe social disadvantage and deprivation.</P>
    <P>This budget delivers on the promise of synergy and innovation which was implicit in the establishment of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  The Dáil is fully aware of the importance of the tourism industry in Ireland and its ever increasing growth has been well documented. By establishing the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Government not only continued to acknowledge the important role tourism plays in our economy but also recognised that sport and recreation can make a valuable contribution to it.  As the Taoiseach said in this House on 26 June last, &ldquo;sport has the same importance for national well-being as, for example, arts and culture&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the additional moneys allocated in the budget to current and capital programmes for sport for 1998.  In total they amount to an increase of 95 per cent in 1998 over 1997. Spending on sport in 1997 was £13.348 million while in 1998 it will increase to £25.996 million. Leaving the £7 million for Croke Park in 1998 out of the equation, that will mean a sizeable increase compared to spending on sport in 1997.  My Department will take over responsibility for swimming pools from the Department of the Environment, a matter which is currently under discussion.  The provision in this regard, which was £3.5 million in 1997, will increase to £4 million in 1998.  I also remind the House that the Government is committed to building a 50-metre swimming pool in 1998 and I will bring proposals on this to Government after I have received the tendering proposals which I hope to have early in the new year.</P>
    <P>The increase in current sports spending will enable me to implement a range of new initiatives and to enhance a number of existing programmes in the development of sport.  Areas of social and economic disadvantage are a priority for me and for the Government, and I am anxious that such areas should be targeted in particular.  Sport can play a very special role in tackling problems of disadvantage.  The provision of opportunities to take part in sport can greatly improve the quality of life, counteract the dangers of drug abuse and involvement in crime and provide positive and challenging activities for children and young people at risk in areas of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Addictions of all kinds lead to ill-health and misery, whether it is addiction to drugs, drink or tobacco.  I would like those addictions among our young people replaced by an addiction to sport. Where stands the medical profession on this matter today?  I compare the medical profession's position to that of someone attempting to wipe up the mess caused by a tap left running in a basement sink with the stopper in place.  We should <Col N="823" /> pull out the stopper and initiate prevention measures at the other end.</P>
    <P>The timing of this increase is also connected with my plans to introduce a Bill early in the next year to put the Sports Council on a statutory basis and to facilitate the establishment of the council as an independent statutory body before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The additional funding will enable me to enhance the level and quality of support for our emerging and high performance sports people.  A holistic support system will be put in place to include coaching, competitive, medical, physiological, scientific and financial backup for our top competitors.  This is particularly important as we work towards success in the Sydney Olympic Games in the year 2000.  National governing bodies of sport will also be encouraged to raise standards in competition and coaching as well as increasing participation in sport, especially by children and young people.</P>
    <P>I regard the funding of sport as a sound investment in the health of our people.</P>

      <P>A commitment to the level of fitness and the healthy lifestyle required for participation in sport would surely lead to significant savings in expenditure on health and medicines for the State and for individuals.  We have increased our health budget by £1 billion in five years.  That is something we should consider and we should pull out the stopper and initiate measures in the preventive area.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention, in particular, the Government's decision to allocate funding to the GAA.  It surely says a lot about the place the GAA holds in the hearts and minds of the our people that of the many measures dealt with in this budget, probably more column inches of newsprint and hours of air time have been directed to the allocation of £20 million to the development of Croke Park over a three year period.  The Gaelic Athletic Association holds a unique position at the very core of Ireland's sporting and cultural heritage and has done so for more than a century.  In that time it has provided our country's youth with facilities for recreation, training and community involvement on a scale unequalled by any other organisation.  Throughout its history the association has consistently ploughed back the profits from its efforts into the developing and upgrading of facilities at club, county, provincial and national level.  Nowhere is this policy more apparent than in the magnificent development that has already taken place at the association's headquarters in Croke Park.</P>
      <P>It is in that context the Government considered the association's submission for assistance towards the completion of its £138 million development plan which will turn Croke Park into a showcase stadium of international quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> The funding will be provided from national lottery funds amounting to £7 million in 1998, £7 million in 1999 and £6 million in the year 2000. It is a contribution towards a massive investment programme in Croke Park, which has been the flagship stadium for the GAA, the biggest and most successful amateur sporting organisation in the world.  The UK Government gave £120 million to Wembley Stadium.  Croke Park will have a capacity of 84,000 people and anyone who called there recently to see the developments would have seen the new museum that has been put in place, which I am sure will be an important additional tourist attraction on the north side of Dublin.  The GAA has invested more than £1 billion in the provision of aid, whether in Munster, Ulster, Connacht or Leinster.  What it has done over the past years is to its credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cooper-Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy McDaid, for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy.  It is a courageous and balanced budget which shows an element of foresight and recognises the needs of people living in rural communities, such as me and others in the county I represent.  This budget was introduced at a time of record growth in our economy. The forecast growth for 1988 is 8 per cent and we also enjoyed that growth rate in 1997.  This compares very favourably with other EU countries which have growth in the region of 2 per cent.  Inflation is at 1.5 per cent and as a result of those economic indicators 50,000 additional jobs will be created this year and hopefully a similar number in 1998.</P>
      <P>I welcome the tax changes introduced in the budget by the Minister, Deputy McCreevy.  I am delighted he decided to reward the PAYE sector because when we were in a financial crisis and needed money the business and the PAYE sectors were targeted.  Now when we have a booming economy with a record level of growth it is time to return some of the benefits gained by the economy to the taxpayers.  I welcome the 2 per cent reduction in the standard and higher rates of tax. It will mean a significant increase in the take home pay of all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision to reduce capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  This decision rewards the business sector but releases a great deal of money for potential investment in our economy.  It also legitimises many business deals.  In the past, people may have hoarded money and attempted not to sell off their assets because of the very punitive level of capital gains tax to which they were subject.  The 20 per cent rate is to be welcomed as is the fact that we have a Minister for Finance who is not afraid to reward the business community and the PAYE sector.  Ministers seem to have shied away from that for too long.  I also welcome the reduction from 36 to 32 per cent in corporation tax.  That reduction is greatly welcomed by members of the business community. <Col N="825" /> As well as rewarding the taxpayer and the business community, this has also been a very caring budget.  It is the first time anything significant has been done for the long-term unemployed.  A married man with four children who has been out of work for a number of years now enjoys an extra tax free allowance of £3,000 plus an additional allowance of £1,000 in respect of each of his children. Such a man can earn an extra £7,000 per year in addition to his other allowances before entering the tax net in year one.  He will receive two thirds of that amount in year two and one third in year three.  There is now no reason for an unemployed person to shy away from returning to the workforce.  This is the first time any real incentive has been given to an unemployed person to rejoin the workforce and I welcome that development.  While I know that bodies representing the unemployed will always argue that we have not gone far enough, they do recognise this as a significant step.  There are large numbers of unemployed people in my county and this will help to create the correct environment to get many of those back in the workforce.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's decision to increase the number of places on the back to work allowance scheme from 22,000 to 27,000. That goes to prove that this budget has achieved the proper balance between reductions in taxation and caring for the people in society who must be looked after.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the old age pension and related pensions by £5 per week is particularly commendable.  We have heard a lot of talk from the Opposition benches on this issue.  When they were in Government, the Opposition parties did not have the courage to give something of substance to old age pensioners.  This Government is giving them an extra £5 per week or more than £20 per month.  Across all levels of pensions, this represents an increase of between 6 and 7.5 per cent.  I could even sense Opposition Members' embarrassment on this issue on budget day when they held their heads low.</P>

      <P>I sense Opposition Members' embarrassment again today at the fact that it took a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government to introduce increases in the region of 6 to 7.5 per cent for old age pensioners.  These people have contributed to our society and they deserve, in their old age, to reap some of the rewards of our economy at a time of unprecedented economic growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted to see an increase of £36.8 million in expenditure on health in 1998.  In a full year this will amount to £61.8 million.  This brings the total funding available to health services in 1998 <Col N="826" /> to £2,964 million, a 9 per cent increase on 1997 figures.  Excluding the funding of £100 million for hepatitis C, it is a 7.25 per cent increase.  This is very significant at a time when it is much needed. I welcome the additional funding in the areas of dental services, cancer services, the reduction of waiting lists for our hospitals, mental health services and services for older people, to mention a few.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the area of agriculture which is particularly relevant in my constituency where many farmers rely on headage payments for their total income.  I welcome the Minister for Finance's decision to provide £23 million additional expenditure for headage payments. That is very welcome and the farming bodies in this country recognise that this is a good and positive budget for farmers.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to note that £3.5 million is being provided to pay outstanding installation aid applications. I am also happy to note that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is about to enter into negotiations to introduce a new focused scheme of installation aid in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the farm pollution control allowance from £20,000 to £30,000.  These benefits have improved the lot of Irish farmers.  I am somewhat disappointed that funding was not made available for the control of farmyard pollution grant.  However, we must recognise this is year one of a five year programme and I am optimistic that something may happen in this regard in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation mentioned he would like to see young people addicted to sport.  That is an excellent theory.  I would like to see a reduction in the number of people addicted to cigarettes.  I am delighted the Minister for Finance has added 10 pence to the price of a packet of cigarettes and I am sorry it is not 50 pence.  I also welcome recent EU decisions in relation to the banning of tobacco and tobacco-related products.  It is unfortunate that in a society where 70 per cent of people do not smoke and 75 per cent of those who do want to stop smoking, we are confronted with glossy tobacco advertising every time we open a Sunday newspaper.  These advertisements attempt to lure young people into this habit. Given that so many smokers die each year, tobacco firms must attract young people to this dirty habit in order to survive.  Smoking kills 6,000 people in Ireland each year and 500,000 people in the EU.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children for supporting the EU measure to ban tobacco products.  Every possible measure must be taken to outlaw the introduction of this habit into young people's lives.  It is neither sexy nor cool to smoke cigarettes; it is a dirty habit which endangers people's health.  I believe that if cigarette advertising were not so glossy and attractive, fewer people would take up the habit.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on a very innovative scheme for rural renewal.  I am only sorry he chose to introduce the pilot scheme, which will <Col N="827" /> offer a number of tax incentives, in the Shannon region although I do not begrudge this to the people there.  I am delighted that the pilot scheme will be introduced if it receives EU approval but I am sorry it will not operate in north Mayo.  The plight of the people there is very serious indeed and in the interests of rural revival something concrete must be done along these lines.  I am confident that if the scheme receives EU approval and is successful, it will be implemented in other regions.  I am hopeful that north Mayo will feature strongly next year when the Minister delivers the second of his five budgets.</P>
    <P>The hotel scheme is good news for county Mayo.  Under the scheme, unrestricted capital allowances are provided for investors in hotel projects, particularly in the counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo and Sligo.  Last year, a number of towns in County Mayo benefited under the seaside resorts scheme.  I am delighted to note that scheme is being extended by one year to allow projects which are currently in the pipeline to be completed where difficulties were being experienced in reaching the June 1998 deadline.  The hotel project is a very interesting and innovative development which I believe will bring investors, who might have contemplated investing their money elsewhere, into County Mayo and the other six counties.  The scheme will benefit tourism in all of these counties because, if any tourism product is to be successful, one must have adequate bed nights in the county.  That is an area in which there is a shortfall at the moment and I am delighted the Minister has included County Mayo in this scheme.</P>
    <P>This is year one of a five year programme. Fianna Fáil entered into a contract with the people; prior to the general election we drew up a manifesto on which we were subsequently elected.  I am confident the Minister for Finance has commenced the implementation of that programme and I am confident, having read the contents of the budget, that contract will be honoured by this Government.  I compliment the Minister.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy McDaid, and Deputy Cooper-Flynn for sharing their time with me.  I am happy to speak on the remarkable budget delivered last week.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on the first of five, and possibly more, budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget offered tax reform, investment in the economy, a great deal of progress towards social inclusion and an aspiration to reduce our national debt in a single package.  That is remarkable by anybody's standards.  Everybody gained, including those who work, those who have no work, those who are categorised as too old or too young to work and those who are unable to work. Workers are pleased by the lowering of both the standard and the higher rates of tax.  The elderly <Col N="828" /> received an increase of £5 per week, which is far greater than the level of inflation, and an increase in income tax limits for people over 65.  Welfare recipients will receive an extra £3 per week which is also above the level of inflation.</P>
    <P>An important change is the increase in the thresholds for family income supplement.  From October next year eligibility will be judged on net rather than gross income.  There is an increase in child benefit and real recognition for people with disabilities.  Small changes will have a large impact.  The entitlement to a travel pass for all recipients of the carer's allowance might look small but it is important for the recipients.  The 7.25 per cent increase in the health service budget, excluding moneys for hepatitis C, will be significant for many people.  The introduction of tax relief for donations to domestic charities is also important.</P>
    <P>Reductions in vehicle registration tax will be significant for the competitiveness of car dealers in Border areas.  An important development for people who are trying to move into employment is the expansion of the community employment schemes.  There is an increase of 5,000 places on the back-to-work scheme and generous tax reliefs for the long-term unemployed to encourage them back to work.</P>
    <P>There are many other important elements in the budget and few people lost out.  The price of unleaded petrol and diesel will remain the same &mdash;another important issue in Border areas &mdash; as will the price of drink.  I welcome the extra £23 million for headage payments for farmers, which is of great significance for rural Deputies.  It is important that this money is spent in disadvantaged areas and that farmers in these areas continue to receive such supports.  We are anxious to keep people in rural Ireland and they need our support to stay.  The £3.5 million installation aid was vital and I urge the Minister for Agriculture and Food to introduce another such scheme, albeit with tighter criteria.  That scheme is of great importance in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Other general and specific taxation provisions in relation to capital gains tax, increases in farmers' flat rate of VAT, refund extensions of the stock relief and so forth are also welcome.  The commitment to examine the cross-Border personal taxation issue given by the Minister is most important for my constituency.  The Minister promised to look at the issue in the context of the Finance Bill and the Taoiseach underlined that commitment in his speech on the budget.  I welcome this development.  I hope the Minister will continue to understand the importance of this issue for people in Border areas, particularly County Donegal.</P>
    <P>My constituency is an area of disadvantage and peripherality and I congratulate the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on the policy to develop high quality hotels in such areas. However, when the seaside resorts scheme is being reviewed I hope places such as Moville and Buncrana, which have suffered isolation as a <Col N="829" /> result of the troubles, will be included.  If better quality hotels are to be built, there must be a parallel measure to deal with valuations.  If people improve a facility in an area which has not developed to a great degree it would be unfair to impose a high valuation on the property.  In that case the value they have achieved in one pocket will be removed from another.</P>
    <P>The proposal of a review group to examine housing aid for the elderly appears to be a small measure but it will be highly significant.  Bodies such as the North-Western Health Board are doing tremendous work in this area with small amounts of money.  They are starved of resources so I look forward to the results of the deliberations of the review group.  They could have important repercussions for the elderly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of funds for Croke Park, positive youth developments in relation to sport and recreation are most important.  Access to funding for sporting and recreational facilities will be vital, not only in Croke Park but in every part of the country.  I will call on my constituency colleague, Deputy McDaid, for assistance for local clubs in our constituency. They need every assistance to overcome their peripherality and to ensure that Donegal can soon reclaim the Sam Maguire.</P>
    <P>This budget puts money in people's pockets. No area should be handicapped geographically and there should be more job creation in my constituency. There should also be further decentralisation of offices and urban development.  Tourism is the way forward for Donegal and there should be more infrastructural investment, especially in marine facilities.  There should also be greater cross-Border co-operation in matters such as developing the A5 and the train and air services.  There are many problems in the education, health, farming and fishing sectors.  There are other problems in the lives of the elderly, workers, those unable to work, the young and those without work.  However, this budget takes the country a constructive and positive step forward. I look forward to the next four steps and to many more in the next century.</P>

      <P>During the election campaign the parties proposed to make an assault on disadvantage and to halt the continuing drift towards the development of a two tier society.  For a while it appeared that Fianna Fáil in Government would implement these promises.  Leaders of the employers' group IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trades Unions and ISME were told over a month ago that the tax package would benefit low and middle income earners.  This was to be achieved by increasing tax free allowances and widening the tax bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> Under this budget a single person earning £10,000 per year will get an increase of £213 per annum, a benefit of 2.9 per cent, whereas a person earning £50,000 will take home an extra £1,045, or 3.7 per cent more in real terms.  The Government has pointed to the increase of £5 per week in the old age pension and £3 per week in social welfare payments in support of its claim that the vulnerable were looked after.  Five pounds is a small increase.  Huge increases in the cost of living, particularly fuel costs in winter, mean that £5 is, in effect, the price of a bag of coal.</P>
    <P>The Government cites changes in corporation tax and capital gains tax as measures which will encourage investment and boost employment.  In the context of employment, the measures to improve work incentives and the employment chances of the unemployed, such as assessing eligibility for family income supplement on net income, double tax allowance for employers who hire the long-term unemployed and extra places on the back-to-work scheme, are welcome. However, there appears to be confusion among the unemployed about the practical details of many of the schemes and payments in existence, in addition to the many agencies which provide them.  Does the Government intend to simplify these schemes, perhaps by reducing their number and by making direct employment schemes more focused on the long-term unemployed?  While the schemes are welcome, many long-term unemployed people are unable to get work.</P>
    <P>The current FÁS scheme in rural areas only allows a 10 per cent re-engagement, which is a major disadvantage.  While there is a huge boom in the economy it does not appear to be reducing the number of unemployed dramatically.  An incentive could be given to employers to offer in-house training to the unemployed whereby funds could be made available to employers who take the time to train personnel.  That would be money well spent.</P>
    <P>The budget widened the gap between the rich and the poor.  This is not desirable as a number of people have not benefited from the economic boom.  People borrow unnecessarily and are committed in the long term.  Financial institutions are making money available too readily and people will borrow beyond their limit, which will cause problems in the future.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the reduction in the amount which can be raised by a company under the BES scheme, I am disappointed that some fund managers such as AIB and ICC and clearing houses do not intend to raise BES funding because the figure was reduced.  This is a mistake because the reduction in the amount from £1 million to £250,000 is a good measure.  It was welcomed by the small industrial sector which is creating a huge number of jobs, particularly in the west. People should be encouraged to go into business because it is not easy.</P>
    <P>The Government should discuss the matter with the big lenders to dispel the fear about the <Col N="831" /> reduction of the amount.  About 51,000 jobs are created by small firms.  The BES scheme should be encouraged, particularly in the service industry. I support the reduction and I hope financial institutions take it on board.  Small firms are disappointed by the reaction of fund managers but I hope this will change.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the hotel expansion scheme in the industry blackspots and the fact that Sligo is included.  There is no hotel in south Sligo and I hope the scheme will be taken up there.  While tourism is promoted in areas which have been neglected up to now, hotels are important structures which are needed in all the counties included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The reduction of 2 per cent in both tax rates will boost most pay packets from next April. However, it is disappointing that the standard rate band was not widened more.  The band was increased by £200 to bring it to a round figure of £20,000 for a married couple.  A single person, as distinct from a widowed individual, is placed in the top rate of 46 per cent on pay levels close to average industrial earnings.  When the employee's PRSI contribution of 6.75 per cent is added, the merged tax and PRSI rate is 52.25 per cent on earnings up to £24,000.  In addition the employer has to pay a 12 per cent contribution.  The net effect is that it costs a total of £23.45 to give an employee an extra £10 per week in take home pay.  This discourages the service industry from taking on staff.  The difference of £13.45 is an infamous tax wedge much loved by economists and I hope it is reduced considerably in future budgets.  Reducing the employer's contribution will increase the opportunity to recruit additional staff.</P>
    <P>While the Celtic tiger roars everywhere else, the west needs major support.  While I welcome some of the schemes which will promote the development of tourism, particularly in the hotels sector, much remains to be done.  While 55,000 jobs were created in the south, only 2,000 were created in the west.  The Minister could have done more to help the peripheral regions which need advantages.  I hope the Minister will look at tax designation for rural renewal schemes in villages and towns.  It will be a sad day for the west if we lose the structure of development.  We should encourage the business sector to invest in communities.</P>
    <P>There seem to be major problems with the development of the rail network.  The Government indicated it is seeking Structural Funding which it said will be difficult to obtain.  Given the buoyant economy, the Government should spend Exchequer funds on the rail network.  It is a sad state of affairs that in 1997, tilley lamps are being used as the transmission system on the Sligo to Mullingar line.  Carriages are also outdated.  Half a million people travel from Sligo to Dublin by rail.  For £10 million, the cost of one bypass, the Government would get a huge return on its investment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies do not seem to understand that this Santa Claus budget has a sting in its tail.  I welcome the increase of £5 per week in contributory pensions.  However, why did the Minister increase the non-contributory pension by only £3 per week?  The bulk of pensioners are under the impression they will get an increase of £5 per week.  They will get a big surprise when the increase comes into force next June.  This has created a two-tier society in the elderly community.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave dependent relatives of non-contributory pensioners an increase of £1.20 per week whereas dependants of contributory pensioners will get an increase of £1.50 per week. There is a variation of 30p between both categories of dependants.  Is it cheaper for a non-contributory pensioner to rear a dependant than a contributory pensioner?  The same increase should apply across the board.  This is an example of penny pinching at a time when the Celtic tiger dominates our economy.</P>
      <P>The Minister saw fit to increase the children's allowance by 37p per week, which would pay for a bar of chocolate for a child.  The second child did a little better and was given the equivalent of two bars of chocolate.  What a big deal for the recipients of the children's allowance.  The Minister should be ashamed to give out increases of pennies to the most vulnerable section of our community at a time when the Celtic tiger is raging.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister not generously increase the winter fuel allowance?  The present rate of £5 per week would not purchase a bucket of coal. Everyone knows that the cheapest one hundred-weight of coal costs £12.  The Minister forgot about increasing the £5 allowance.  This is cold comfort to the shivering old age pensioners. When the unemployed get their rise of only £3 next June, they too will have sad memories of this Minister and his famous Santa Claus budget.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the family income supplement and the new criteria for calculating the allowance based on net income.  It should apply to all benefits, for example, eligibility for medical cards, grants for third level education, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Minister say why increases in pensions will not be introduced until June 1998, increases in child benefit will not be introduced until September 1998, family income supplement will not be increased until October 1998, the increase in the carer's allowance will not be introduced until September 1998, and changes in the free schemes will not be introduced until September 1998, shortly before the introduction of another budget in November 1998?  This is a three-card trick by this Government to deny all sections of our community their meagre increases until at least three quarters of the year has elapsed.  It is amazing that increases provided for in a budget early in December will not be given before the best part of the fiscal year is up.  Who does the Minister think he is fooling?  Does he think people are <Col N="833" /> fools?  They thought the increases would be paid from 1 January.  When they realise they will have to wait nine months before they get the meagre increases announced by the Minister they will not be impressed.  Nor are they impressed with such meagre increases at a time when the Celtic tiger is creating a boom in our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very generous in giving £20 million to Croke Park.  I do not begrudge the GAA the money.  It is a great institution which plays its part in catering for young people, and I appreciate its efforts.  However, there are other major playing pitches that could have done with some of that £20 million.  One example is Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork where our recent county final had to be played on a quagmire.  However, the Minister has put all his eggs in one basket.  Is it because Croke Park is in the Taoiseach's constituency?  I hope the Minister waves his magic wand and gives the GAA more money for the provincial centres which are so much in need of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister did nothing about the long waiting lists for hip, optical and other medical procedures. Is he aware of the serious lack of funding for hospitals?</P>
    <P>What is the Government's policy on country roads?  Some roads in my county have not seen a drop of tar or a shovel of chippings for the past 30 years.  West Cork lost its railway in the late 1950s.  On that occasion we were promised an upgrading of our road network to secondary and national status.  However, there is not one mile of national primary route from Cork city to Mizen Head and Dursey Sound, an area bigger than some counties of Ireland.  We have no train service, no national primary road, and we get no grants to upgrade our road system or replace seriously flawed bridges.  We have been left out in the cold.  I do not understand why the Minister did not do something about that.</P>
    <P>The budget gave nothing to agriculture.  No money was provided for the reintroduction of the farm installation grant, which was terminated by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, in August this year.  The farm installation grant was the only thing to which young trained farmers looked forward when they got their EC green certificate.  Two thousand young farmers were presented with EC green certificates this year.  Of those, 500 are in Cork county, the home of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. However, he does not seem to have had any clout at the Cabinet table.  It seems he was unable to persuade the Minister for Finance to fund the reintroduction of the farm installation grant.  I am informed that interest in the EC green certificate has faded since the abolition of the £5,600 farm installation grant for young farmers.  I call on Deputies Healy-Rae and Mildred Fox to vote against the Government if it does not reintroduce it.  That is the only way to teach this Government a lesson.  What will the people of south Kerry and Wicklow think of their representatives if they do not stand up and fight for their share of the cake?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The Minister promised to reintroduce farm improvement grants on his return to office.  What about the export of live cattle to the Middle East? The last shipment of cattle left Greenore for the Middle East in November l996 and no beasts have been exported since then.  In a glossy pamphlet containing a photograph of him and the Taoiseach which was issued to farmers last May, the Minister said that, if returned to office, he would send a boat packed with cattle to the Middle East within six weeks.  However, the boat is still anchored and I am afraid it will remain that way for a long time.  The price of cattle is down approximately £200 a head compared to this time last year.  This has been caused by the mis-handling of the problem by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What has happened to the promised aid for family butchers?  Last May the Minister said he would give financial aid to family butchers to upgrade their abattoirs.  However, they have not been paid one penny for this purpose.  Even though butchers' backs are to the wall the Minister proposed upgrading an abattoir in Cairo so that it could handle the shipment of cattle which was supposed to be sent to Egypt.  However, the boat never arrived.  I hope the Minister has not given money to the Egyptians to improve this abattoir without first getting an assurance that they will take our cattle.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not provide funding in the budget for the promising aquaculture and mariculture industries.  He did not even refer to the marine industry in his Budget Statement.  It is a sad day for the fishing industry when the Minister for Finance ignores it on budget day.  The Minister does not seem to be <i>au fait</i> with what is happening in rural areas.  What measures are being introduced to promote fish processing?  Last year we imported 14,450 tonnes of fish at a cost of £51.4 million.  At the same time we are dumping fish because they have not realised a flat price. Why has the Minister not made sufficient finance available to the marine industry to promote fish processing?</P>
    <P>The Germans, Danes and Norwegians process herring fillets and export roe to Japan at a very high price.  They also export herrings in wine, brine, mustard and cider to many countries.  Yet our fishermen can do nothing with the herring caught in the Celtic Sea.  The miserable £3 per box they receive does not even pay for the fuel burnt by the trawlers which catch the fish.  When I asked the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to pay a subsidy to herring fishermen for three months to offset the disastrous low price of £3 per box he told me politely this could not be done.  No help has been given to misfortunate fishermen who have to make high repayments on their fishing vessels and who have to sell their product at a rock bottom price.  Ten years ago herrings made £10 per box, while today they make only £3.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources decentralised more sections of his Department to rural areas.  Why has he not seen <Col N="835" /> fit to decentralise the aquaculture and mariculture sections of his Department to my town of Bantry, the Mecca of the aquaculture industry?  I made this appeal to the Minister at the meeting of the Select Committee yesterday and I hope he does not turn a deaf ear to it.  This section of the Department should have been decentralised to Bantry many years ago.</P>
    <P>It may not be too late to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to cover the important items highlighted by me.  I hope my appeal will not fall on deaf ears.  South-west Cork could also benefit from the hotel expansion scheme.  There are some very good hotels in the area but they need to be upgraded.  The same applies to other counties in the west.  I hope the Minister accedes to my request and ensures reason prevails.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide the necessary investment to upgrade the national railway network with continuous welded rail, automatic signalling and adequate rolling stock to ensure a safe, reliable and efficient public transport service.</P>

      <P>The motion is timely in view of what has happened in recent weeks on the railway system.  The number of accidents and the risk to life and limb have been well documented in the past 24 hours.  It is well known from my time in Government that I am a supporter of public transport.  As a tourist destination, the need for an effective and efficient rail service is greater than ever.  There are, however, serious problems.</P>
      <P>One could discuss this issue from a local perspective or a national point of view.  There are lines on which there is a particularly good service and others on which the service lags way behind what I would regard as acceptable as we approach the turn of the century.  The service between Dublin and Cork is second to none.  It is one we all envy.  We would like to see the same standard applied on all lines.  It is of the highest standard, for which management should be complimented.  The same could be said about the service between Dublin and Belfast.  We are not talking only about comfort, speed and efficiency but safety also.  We should be able to guarantee reliability, efficiency and effectiveness as well as passenger safety.  That is the most important criterion.  Given our experiences in recent months this is highly questionable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has commissioned an independent consultancy.  I hope this is not a gesture that is too late because there are serious problems. We should be able to identify the weaknesses in the system to the extent that we can give the guarantees mentioned.  Some years ago we secured £275 million in European funding but it is apparent that this will not be effective in relation to a certain number of lines, including the lines to Mullingar, Mayo, Sligo, Rosslare, Kilkenny, Waterford, Killarney and Tralee.  It appears jointed track on timber sleepers is no longer acceptable and does not have a future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect to this debate.  We have all heard about the increase in the volume of traffic and fatalities on our roads.  It is important that we are in a position to offer a viable alternative, particularly to those who wish to travel from peripheral areas, Kerry, Wexford, Galway, Mayo and Sligo.  Difficulties have been encountered at weekends in transporting students and sports fans.  We do not have the capacity to offer a reliable service to all those who want to use public <Col N="837" /> transport.  It behoves all of us, as public representatives, to ensure funding is available to provide a service second to none which is able to carry the public at reasonable expense in a safe and reliable manner.</P>
    <P>I have listened to what the spokespersons for Irish Rail have had to say in recent weeks.  While our track record during the years has been satisfactory and one we could defend, there is substandard track and a risk to the travelling public. The Minister did not give the impression that she acknowledges there are serious problems and that she will argue at Cabinet to secure the necessary funding.  It is known that millions of pounds are required for track, signalling and rolling stock on the lines mentioned.  One gets the distinct impression that it is the Minister's view there is nothing she can do about it.  She was always the first one into the Chamber to find the responsible Minister.  She is now responsible for passenger safety.  I am not being alarmist but realistic.  I have been at pains to defend workers in Irish Rail.</P>
    <P>The time has come to make decisions.  The Minister should outline how she will find the funding required for investment in passenger and freight services.  We all accept there are no absolute guarantees in life but the test is one of reasonableness. I would like to think that we can have renewed confidence in the service on offer and that a viable alternative will be offered to the travelling public who should not use their cars because they are afraid the train will not be on time owing to obstructions on the line, because they are afraid of derailments and because they are hearing about the quality of the service on offer.  The Minister should indicate that in the next two to three years she can guarantee development of the service.</P>
    <P>I am particularly worried about the line between Killarney and Tralee which has not been upgraded.  I have been told that EU funding is not guaranteed.  There have been some improvements on the line between Mallow and Killarney. As the premier tourist destination, the rail service is extremely important to the county.  Funding is required to maintain a quality service.  If one were to grade services, the service between Mallow and Tralee, apart from the first train out of Tralee at 7.30 a.m. and the evening train from Dublin, leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>The motion is timely.  We are facing serious problems in terms of the quality of the service on offer.  The Minister has ultimate responsibility for providing a safe and reliable transport system.  Her efforts to avoid this responsibility do not augur well.  I hope she will outline how she will upgrade the services which are badly needed.</P>

      <P>The Minister announced a £275 million investment programme to renew the railways between 1994 and 1999.  This programme was negotiated by the former Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Cowen.  Investment post-1999 is also an important matter.  The question of safety on our railways has been raised on a number of occasions recently.  The Minister intends to commission a consultancy study into all aspects of safety on our railways.  The recent rail accidents have caused some concern and if circumstances were different they could have been much more serious.  If people had been standing between the carriages on any of those trains, there could have been fatalities or serious injuries.  The person who provides the trolley service on trains and looks after the needs of passengers has a very difficult job.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I suggested that Iarnrod Éireann should provide morning newspapers and other reading material on trains.  While safety must always be a priority, this matter should be considered.  Despite the best efforts of Iarnrod Éireann there have been many complaints about the services from Dublin on Friday evenings. Many of the trains travelling to Galway are over-crowded, but the extra service at 4.50 p.m. is a welcome development.  Overcrowding may be acceptable on trains taking large groups of people to sporting events or concerts, but there is no excuse for people standing on trains that are taking people home on Friday evenings.  The £275 million investment programme will benefit lines radiating from Dublin.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann has failed to address the question of the western corridor.  I am a member of the western inter-railway committee which has been trying to secure a radial route from Sligo to Limerick to Rosslare and even to Derry.  I am disappointed Iarnród Éireann and recent Governments have not given this serious consideration. The Minister should endeavour to secure Structural Funding for that purpose in the post-1999 period.  Some of the £200 million that will be made available to the western development commission should be spent on our railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the western region achieves Objectives One status I hope extra funding will be made available for railway development.  Funding for roads in the west out of the last round of Structural Funding was 20 per cent less than for the rest of the country. Iarnród Éireann has invested £350 in the eastern corridor, but it should not forget the western corridor, which has great potential for tourism and the transport of goods, particularly timber. There is a rail link to the <i>Louisiana Pacific</i> plant in Waterford, to Medite in Clonmel and to the new Masonite plant in County Leitrim.  CIE and Iarnród Éireann should adopt a positive approach to these types of developments.  As well as being used for tourists, the new rail cars could be used to take commuters to Galway, workers to their place of work and students to school.  I hope we can quantify the amount of timber, <Col N="839" /> cement, fertiliser and other bulk cargo travelling north-south and south-north.  An actively used railway would relieve the traffic on our roads.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the section of line from Portarlington to Galway will be co-funded by the European Union and Iarnród Éireann to the tune of £20.8 million, bringing the total figure to £22.4 million.  That is a welcome development for that Cinderella line.  Passengers will be delighted the route is to be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn" hpid="Mr. O'Flynn Mr. O'Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I give my unqualified support to the Minister's approach to the Fine Gael Private Member's motion.  I agree with her view that while investment is an essential ingredient, it is not the only factor that will contribute to rail safety.  Her decision to have an external review of larnrod Éireann's rail safety policy and practice announced in Dáil Éireann was a timely and wise assessment of the position.  The brief of the independent consultants to be appointed will be to ensure that safety standards comply with the highest international standards.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has a strong commitment to developing our national railway.  The current major investment programmes will be completed and further investment will be pursued.  The railway is a vital part of our transport infrastructure. If it is made attractive and competitive people will use it.  There is cross-party agreement that we cannot have anything less than the maximum level of safety on our railroad.  The help and advice of the consultants will be greatly appreciated by all Members.</P>
      <P>There has been a dramatic increase in the number of people using mainline and commuter services. This is a direct result of the investment already in place which has resulted in major upgrading of infrastructure, signalling, locomotives and rolling stock.  The introduction of the Arrow railcar on the Cork-Cobh line has been welcomed by the public.  The recent introduction of this diesel railcar has shown that people will use a decent commuter rail service.  Passenger numbers have grown substantially since the new railcar was introduced.  The associated improvements in the stations at Cobh, Fota, Glounthaune and Little Island have guaranteed a continuation of the 25 per cent growth in the past two to three years.  A similar investment in the closed Cork to Midleton line would make a major contribution towards getting the east Cork public to use the railroad.  Commuter services from Mallow, Blarney, Kilbarry and Blackpool are also urgently needed.  There is untapped commuter potential in those areas.  The availability of an alternative transport system would be of great benefit.  It would ensure a substantial decrease in the road carnage which is occurring every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork, all approach roads have become more congested.  Routes from north, south, east and west are clogged from early morning.  Statistics related to this traffic show an alarming multiplication in the number of accidents each day.  Commuter <Col N="840" /> services, with strategic vehicle parking areas, would encourage drivers to avail of this safer and less stressful mode of transport.  For example, the boom in population in Midleton alone would guarantee support for a rail service. All road users are becoming increasingly conscious of the risks they face daily and of the time they lose sitting in endless queues.  There is no need for a debate on the desirability of providing the service, it should be put it in place The Government is continuing the biggest ever investment programme in the history of the railway. This £275 million investment programme supported by EU Cohesion and Structural Funds is well under way and is transforming the mainline railway.  The Government is determined to see this programme through to completion in 1999 when the current programme runs out and it will continue to seek further EU assistance.  As part of this programme I understand that more than 300 miles of new track will be relaid.</P>
    <P>The Cork, Belfast and Limerick lines are completed and work is under way on the Sligo, Galway, Waterford and Tralee lines.  Modern computerised signalling will also be installed on those lines.  The 32 new locomotives will greatly improved reliability.  New trains have been acquired for the Belfast service.  The new enterprise service on the Belfast line compares with the best in Europe.</P>
    <P>Many stations have been upgraded and it was reassuring to pass through Heuston Station recently and see a new concourse being provided. The old draughty and uncomfortable layout will be replaced with a state of the art modern facility.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that Cork will have a new station shortly because the board of CIÉ agreed to it last week.  This investment is already beginning to have an impact as passenger carrying is at record levels and growing.  Railway passenger numbers are now almost twice the volume they were in the 1970s.  The railway has an important role in reducing congestion on our inter-urban roads and in our major towns and cities.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Cork and Dublin-Belfast services show what a good rail service can achieve.  Trains travel from Cork to Dublin, for example, in two and a half hours, while motorists can often spend this amount of time battling with congestion on the outskirts of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>Public railways have an excellent safety record despite recent derailments.  One must go back to Cherryville, 14 years ago, for the last passenger fatality while, over the same period, some 400 to 500 people died every year on the roads.  Train derailments provide dramatic media coverage but we can easily shrug off and accept multiple deaths due to road accidents.  However, there is no reason for complacency.  The recent derailments are worrying and we must take cognisance of them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to appoint external consultants to review rail safety is a welcome development and will serve to reassure the travelling public.  Our railway network has suffered <Col N="841" /> because of under investment and while some of the railway network has been modernised there are lines which urgently require investment. Much of the problem can be sourced back to the 1980s when the then Fine Gael-Labour coalition had an official policy of making no substantial investment in the main line network.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil led Governments of 1989 and 1992 reversed this policy and paved the way for the current EU investment programmes which commenced in 1993.  The Mayo, Rosslare and Mullingar-Sligo lines fared badly up to now, but we are determined they will be upgraded.  We will be pushing hard to include those lines in any future EU investment programmes. In the meantime, Iarnród Éireann will continue to invest in these lines from its own limited resources.</P>
      <P>Rail passenger carrying is at record levels despite recent incidents.  Overcrowding is a problem for many services and will have to be tackled as a matter of urgency.  New rolling stock is required to replace some of the 30 to 40 year old carriages which are still in service.  This is needed to cater for the huge demand for a decent rail service.</P>
      <P>Commuter services in Dublin will also benefit from investment with DART extensions and new DART stations.  The suburban railway in Cork could play a much bigger role in reducing car travel in the Cork area.  The successes of the Cork and Belfast lines can be repeated.  In the interests of safety on our railroads I urge support for the Minister's common-sense approach towards tackling this problem.</P>

On many occasions not enough seats are available for the numbers of passengers travelling west.  It is a disgrace that people cannot pre-book their seats when buying a ticket.

      <P>I have no doubt that Deputy Yates, as a recent convert to the portfolio, will understand what some of his colleagues left behind them.  If he came from my part of the country he would realise that when taking the Dublin-Sligo train one is liable to arrive home three or fours later than the scheduled arrival time.  It is not unknown for trains to remain overnight on the line due to breakdowns caused by the lack of investment by the previous Government. Upgrading work has been done on the line as far as Mullingar.  CIE proposes to upgrade the line to Sligo over the next few years but we are looking at the provision of a secondary service.  Colleagues speak of the service between Dublin and Cork which is a Rolls Royce service.  We have the nearest thing to a stagecoach because the train is liable to be pulled from one station to the next by a supplementary engine called up from Sligo to Longford or from Dublin to Mullingar.</P>
      <P>No one can accept such a rail system and I continually receive, as do all of my colleagues from the north-west, complaints from people with regard to late trains, which can be a major problem. If an individual decides to leave Sligo or Leitrim for Dublin for a hospital appointment at noon, the train is due to arrive at 11 a.m. but it is more likely one will arrive an hour later.  The number of breakdowns and late arrivals on this line is probably the highest in the country.  Everyone is worried about safety on our rail lines and the public has a right to be worried when the number of derailments and near misses (s considered. The reason is that there has been a lack of investment in the rail system over the past few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was horrified to hear Deputy Yates make excuses and say that it was a problem for the Minister for Public Enterprise.  She has been in the Department for approximately four months and in that time one cannot expect to overturn what had been done during the previous two and a half years.  Deputy Yates spoke last night about <Col N="845" /> upgrading or closing such lines.  Some of his colleagues have been extremely vocal about the Dublin to Sligo line.  What would they think if he were in office and contemplated closing all or sections of it?</P>

      <P>The Minister has put in place a programme for the development and rejuvenation of the rail system and that is what is needed.  We need to be able to go to the people and say that we will give them a proper service.  I have no doubt people would pay a little more for the security of knowing that they would have a proper rail service which would run on time</P>
      <P>The last train to Sligo from Dublin leaves Connolly Station at 6.20 p.m. Many people need a later service but CIE is not in a position to provide it.  Iarnród Éireann needs to look at a number of issues, such as the condition of rolling stock and the need to maintain a proper and regular service and I have no doubt it will.  At weekends, as Deputy Cooper-Flynn said, one is lucky if one gets a seat by the time the train reaches Mullingar, while if one is unlucky one must stand from Dublin to Sligo.</P>
      <P>As far as Deputy Yates is concerned there is a reasonable service to Rosslare and he is happy and does not care about the rest of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford)</i>: I welcome the new-found interest of Deputy Yates in the national rail system.  However, I compliment the Minister for Public Enterprise because at least she has a direct interest in upgrading our rail lines.  I tabled a number of parliamentary questions to the former Minister, Deputy Lowry, about the Dublin to Rosslare link and he refused to answer them on the basis that rail lines were being funded by the EU.  He was so out of touch with reality, it was unbelievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rail line between Dublin and Rosslare does not have a Rolls Royce service and is one of the worst in the State.  There is a state of the art harbour in Rosslare which has a very substandard rail link running into it.  On the odd occasion I have travelled from Enniscorthy to Dublin, it <Col N="846" /> took approximately two and a half hours.  One of my daughters made that journey today.  She left Enniscorthy at 8.20 a.m. and arrived in Dublin at 10.50 a.m. using a rail system that is obsolete and out of date.  The track is shaky and trains must slow to a crawl on certain sections.  It hangs over the bay as one approaches Bray and many people refuse to travel on the line because of that.  The rolling stock is outdated with carriages which were cast off from the Belfast and Cork routes. There are no facilities for wheelchair passengers and dining facilities are basic when any are to be found.  Old-fashioned signal systems are used and comfort in stations between Wexford and Bray is practically nil as these stations are obsolete.  This does not encourage people to travel, but from Bray onwards one finds state of the art facilities and modern stations.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to move as quickly as possible with Iarnród Éireann to upgrade the Dublin to Rosslare route.  One million passengers pass through Rosslare Port annually but very few of them travel on trains.  It is important that a modern railway system is created to take people to Dublin as quickly as possible.  Even at peak times, such as Christmas, people have very little time to spend shopping in Wexford or Dublin as they arrive at 11 a.m. and return at 6 p.m. when on a day trip.  Surely some person in Iarnród Éireann has the ingenuity to put on later trains at Christmas, Easter, etc.  When Wexford were on the march to All-Ireland glory last year, trains were packed every Sunday.  People are prepared to travel on trains if proper facilities are made available.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's review on safety as it is very important.  Iarnród Éireann's safety record is very good and while I am naturally concerned about safety, I am more concerned that the line between Dublin and Rosslare be upgraded and that passengers on that line are provided with the same facilities as those travelling from Dublin to Cork, Belfast or Galway.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I listened with amusement to Deputies O'Flynn and Cooper-Flynn.  Neither was in the House in 1994 when the last gravy train left for Brussels and we put the national development plan through the House.  We submitted a five year plan, 1994-9, to Brussels to secure the last big drawing down of Structural and Cohesion Funds for roads, rail, airports, ports and the agricultural sector.  We put through this House a plan that omitted three railway lines.  At the time all the Deputies in the constituencies involved made the strongest possible case.  We pleaded with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications at the time, Deputy Cowen, to put the Claremorris-Castlebar-Westport and Ballina lines in the plan.  Likewise, my colleague, Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> Yates, pleaded with him to include the Rosslare line in the plan.  He was asked also to include the Sligo line and it got a partial reprieve although it did not get the money.  The line on the map was changed but the investment did not arrive.</P>
    <P>In Mayo there was a deep-seated resentment and, understandably, we highlighted the fact that Mayo was left on the hind tit because we got nothing.  We got a blue dotted line which meant there would be no investment from Europe &mdash; Cohesion or Structural Funds.  Any resources had to come from the national kitty, in other words we would get the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table some time in the next millennium.</P>
    <P>This more than any other issue was the one that decided the last election.  When the people of Mayo went to the ballot box they gave the first two seats to Fine Gael, the third to Fianna Fáil, the fourth to Fine Gael and three outgoing Fianna Fáil TDs fought for the final seat.  The people of Mayo have not forgotten that.</P>
    <P>I do not take any comfort from the speech in the House last evening by Deputy O'Rourke given that there is still no sign of any money for the railway line in question.  We are now carrying out a mid-term review.  There is no reason the strongest possible case could not be made to Brussels but that is not being done.  The people of Mayo have long memories and this will be remembered on the occasion of the next election unless there is a substantial improvement in the quality of the rail service.</P>
    <P>To fully appreciate the trauma of travelling on the Dublin-Westport line or the Dublin-Ballina line one must use it and I have being using it consistently since 1981 when I was elected to the Seanad.  It was not great but it was adequate: the train departed and arrived on schedule.  The service was spartan enough but the basics were sound.</P>
    <P>A few elections ago Fianna Fáil coined the phrase &ldquo;health cuts hit the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.  Travelling on the safari train to Mayo is a hazard.  The 18.05 train from Heuston Station on Thursday, Friday and Saturday is an experience.  The queue starts 50 minutes before the train's departure.  People queue for the best part of 45 minutes while the train is being cleaned following the upward journey.  After the whistle goes and the green flag is raised there is a stampede. On occasion I have seen elderly people tumble, children crushed and people left behind. With ten minutes to go the train is choc-a-bloc.  I am amused sometimes at the sign inside the train in Irish, ná fágtha bágaiste ins na pasáiste &mdash; do not leave baggage in the passages.  There is bágaiste, pasáiste, daoine de dhuile shórt, people who have had hip replacement operations in Cappagh Hospital standing in the aisles or between the wagons and litter everywhere.  People who entered a contract with a State company for £25 to take them on a journey have to stand until they reach Athlone.  This is not good enough.  It is more like the Calcutta express than the Castlebar <Col N="848" /> express.  It is chaos.  If one thinks the Westport train is bad the junction from Manulla to Ballina can only be described as wanderly wagon because it literally wanders all over the track.  I doubt whether Iarnród Éireann is covered by insurance in terms of the safety of its passengers.  Any insurance company would not be in a position to cover the chaos that ensues on the train.</P>
    <P>The upward journey is not much better.  The train never departs or arrives on schedule.  Its arrival time is not as late as the downward journey. It does not sit down on the track as often, it has to yield to the Arrow train going to the city to take commuters from the perimeter of the Pale but it is never on time.  It is impossible to make an arrangement for a hospital appointment, an interview, a job, a plane or the boat, based on the standard timetable as it operates.  There is no standard, no safety guarantee and no satisfaction. It has come to a head.  I have no doubt there are other accidents down the line.  It was probably a blessing in disguise that the accident at Roscommon took place because it focused attention sharply on the situation.  There was a similar accident on the Tralee line a few days later, and likewise on the Carlow line.</P>
    <P>We can have all the inquiries we want and we can bring in as many international consultants we want but all we need is a plan, imagination and investment.  Unless we get the investment we are not going anywhere.  It grieves me because I like the train.  Many people have genuine goodwill for the train service and the staff but if they are not given the tools and the wherewithal to operate they cannot provide the service.  Unfortunately they are the people at the butt-end of the criticism.</P>
    <P>The train service is not the same as any other service and should not have to answer to a commercial remit.  Its huge potential is not being exploited.  There is goodwill from the passengers. From the point of view of freight there is a strong argument for ensuring it realises its full commercial potential.  Many more people would use it for the transport of their goods and services if the service was reliable.  There is a case to be made for major investment on the railway line.  One has only to look at costs and investment.  One mile of rail track replacement costs £330,000 while one mile of road costs up to £6 million.  One articulated six axle lorry and heavy suspension will do more damage than 3,000 cars on the roadway.  I ask for a commitment to those three lines.  I ask that a case be made to Europe and that we do not take no for an answer.  We have enough friends in Brussels who will listen to our case.  We are not asking for the sun, moon and stars but a reliable train service that departs and arrives on schedule.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely incensed by this topic.  I live in north County Dublin and along with many others I frequently use the mainline service when travelling outside the constituency. Fianna Fáil backbenchers are impressed by the allocation of £275 million under the Operational <Col N="849" /> Programme for Transport 1994-9.  If they were to look, instead of listening, at the Minister's propaganda they would note that the spending on roads is astronomical &mdash; £1,655 million compared to the £275 million for the rail lines.  It is time we began to compare the reality and tried to focus on the larger picture.  How can the Government be content with the allocation for the rail service under the that operational programme?  Clearly Iarnród Éireann is not content.  It has to borrow from private banks to fund capital investment.  A considerable amount of the subvention goes to private banks to pay interest on loans which it has been forced to take out to continue operating and prevent accidents happening.  Meanwhile, the needs of the rail service are great.  It needs new lines, new signalling and more carriages.  In my constituency at rush hour there is only a two-carriage Arrow train available, onto which people are crammed and there is no suburban rail service on Sundays.  There is no late night service and there are two hours between train times on Saturday afternoons.  The last train leaving Dublin on Saturday night is at 8.40 p.m. while the last train from Balbriggan is 7.11 p.m. What kind of service is that?</P>
      <P>Wheelchair users have to be very courageous and swallow their pride to seek help getting on and off trains because there are no ramps.  People do not know when the Arrow train will arrive because there is no timetable.  There is lack of priority in terms of public transport.  We should work towards achieving an efficient service.  While 450 or 500 people are killed per year on our roads, it is a miracle nobody has been killed on our rail service.</P>
      <P>It is stated in the operational programme that the policy of traffic restraint is difficult to pursue in the absence of high quality public transport services.  Is the Government seriously saying it will provide a high quality public transport service? That must be done, but it is not possible without doubling the subvention.  There is no point talking about money on the horizon.  The money available in this area is infinitesimal compared with the provision for road transport. There are one million cars on the roads and it is estimated that by the year 2011 that number will have increased to one and a half million.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's policy on transport? Will Ministers come back from Kyoto and tell us climate change is a threat and we must take direct action?  Scientists say a 60 per cent cut in CO is needed, meanwhile we are doing very little to reduce the number of cars on our roads.  In most cases cars come from France, Germany and Japan and those countries benefit from the fact that so many of our people buy cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1996 CIE report states that as a result of congestion, the cost to Dublin alone is £1 billion every year, ten times the annual subvention.  We are throwing money away on short-sighted policies that do not solve the problem.  Is there a prejudice in that money made available for road <Col N="850" /> transport is called investment but for rail transport it is called a subsidy?  It is illogical to differentiate between the two.</P>
    <P>I have more than 4,600 letters from disgruntled railway users in Dublin North, begging the Minister to take decisive action on measures to which I have referred.  It was difficult enough to get a meeting with the previous Minister.  I ask the Government to stop trying to placate train users by soft talk.  It rings hollow and is not working. Ministers should use trains and see the position for themselves.  The Government must invest in a proper rail service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be unashamedly parochial in my comments.  I represent the two fastest growing areas in the State, Blanchardstown in Dublin 15 and Lucan.  Some people may have heard on radio or television today the prediction that to buy a new, reasonably sized house in Dublin next year will cost £100,000.  We are fast approaching that position in the Dublin 15 and Lucan areas.</P>
      <P>Traffic on our roads is so heavy that people leaving their houses, worth £90,000 to £100,000, in the morning can hardly get out of their estates and when they return in the evening they can hardly get back in, and the position is getting worse almost daily.</P>
      <P>Since the last election I received a large number of letters, telephone calls and other representations on the subject of transport.  One, signed by a number of people from the Castleknock area, states:</P>
      <P>The following is our list of concerns:</P>
      <P>(a) Lack of safety due to overcrowding on most trains.</P>
      <P>(b) Infrequent service at peak times.</P>
      <P>(c) Frequent lateness of trains causes hardship for passengers.</P>
      <P>(d) Inadequate number of carriages for the number of users.</P>
      <P>(e) Trains are dirty and therefore uncomfortable.</P>
      <P>(f) No long-term plan to cater for the expansion of West Dublin.</P>
      <P>Another letter from the same area in Dublin West states:</P>
      <P>My main gripe lies with the extremely poor west bound service in the evenings.  If like myself a commuter cannot make the 17.52 service from Connolly, there is a wait of over three hours before the next train at 20.54. In practice of course no-one waits that long and instead make alternative arrangements for their return journey . or don't bother using the train in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point of concern lies with train overcrowding.  Both the 08.00 and 08.20 services are crammed to capacity by the time they reach Coolmine.  Whilst I would rather stand <Col N="851" /> than not have the service at all, it is a sad reflection on the Irish public transport system that every morning, fare paying commuters consider themselves lucky to find a safe standing spot against the end of a pair of seats or on the edge of a table (do we need tables on commuter trains?).  Most others are forced to balance, sway and heave in the aisles and passageways of trains which were never intended to cater for standing passengers (i.e. no hand holds etc).</P>
    <P>Those are just two of the many letters and phone calls I have received from people concerned about the dangers of travelling on trains.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to appoint independent consultants to carry out a strategic review of rail safety, hopefully, within six months, although she seemed to be vague on that commitment. That review will not be a day too early for my constituents.  I recognise there are problems with finance.  I listened with interest to a Fianna Fáil Deputy from Mayo, as if the problems with the railway system started when the rainbow coalition came to power &mdash; that Government was in power for two and a half years.  Obviously the present state our railway system is a sad reflection of the resources made available to it over many years.  That is no reflection on the people who work on the railways.  I have the greatest admiration for those who work on the railway line to which I have been referring, that from Connolly Station to Maynooth, who have some awful tasks to perform.  For example, there is a regulation stating that a train may not stop at a station unless that station's platform is sufficiently long to accommodate the longest train.  The fear is that people will alight from a train in the dark where there is no platform.  The staff on that line have the intolerable task of endeavouring to prevent passengers alighting from coaches in such circumstances. One can well imagine the position on a Saturday or other evening trying to dissuade some people from stepping out into the dark, one of the tasks of those unfortunate staff in whom I have the greatest confidence.</P>
    <P>I recognise that no real improvement will take place on that line until such time as there is a double line in place between Connolly Station and Maynooth.  It is unacceptable that there is a single track between those locations.  I look forward to the money being made available by this Government to ensure that that is done in addition to the necessary improvements at Connolly Station.</P>
    <P>Very soon Blanchardstown will have a population in excess of 100,000 whose inhabitants should have a DART-type service, probably utilising the tunnel under the Phoenix Park, to provide the type of rail transport required by inhabitants of a town of that size.  Neither am I forgetting the other end of my constituency.  I hope the Lucan south station will be reopened because of the phenomenal growth there also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> The number of houses being built and those scheduled to be built between Lucan and Newcastle &mdash;in my opinion too many &mdash; will certainly justify the opening of that station, hopefully in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Currie for affording me an opportunity of saying a few words on this subject.</P>
      <P>As a regular rail commuter from Dundalk to Dublin over the past 15 years, I want to express my appreciation of the improvements recently carried out by Iarnród Éireann.  I also thank the European Union for the large amounts of money made available for the upgrading of that line and congratulate Northern Ireland Railways on its initiative in prodding Iarnród Éireann and the Irish Government into providing matching funds, the net effect of which has been a tremendous improvement on that line.  I invite everybody to take a journey on the new express train from Belfast to Dublin, which is on a par with any European railway on which I have travelled.  I also commend the tremendous initiative of Dundalk railway station manager, Mr. Brendan McQuaid, and his staff who have carried out delightful work at that station.</P>
      <P>Next I want to express my fear about safety regulations on Irish trains.  On sitting days I stay in Blackrock, County Dublin and travel on the DART, a magnificent facility for those living along its line north and south of the city. However, in the mornings, scenes at many stations defy description, as passengers endeavour to gain access to already over-crowded carriages, hanging on in a fashion reminiscent of trains one sees on television in Delhi in India. That leads me to question whether safety regulations are observed on our trains or whether safety is a high priority of Iarnród Éireann.  Many a morning I have allowed four or five trains to leave a station rather than cram into the scrum on them.  If there were even a minor impact, there would be severe casualties because too many passengers are allowed on that excellent DART service.  Surely Iarnród Éireann could organise its train services more efficiently, guaranteeing greater safety for its passengers.</P>
      <P>I also draw the attention of the House to the scene at Amiens Street as the 5.20 p.m. train departs from there.  It also defies description.  As Deputy Sargent said, it is like a cattle train, lurching backwards and forwards almost to the extent that one cannot draw breath such is the density of passengers.  The risk of a collision or derailment is always present and it would result in significant casualties.</P>

    <P>When I heard of this motion being tabled I wanted to avail of the opportunity to air those concerns.  I expressed them to high ranking personnel in Dundalk recently but was dismissed in a rather cursory fashion.  I had a very unsatisfactory interview with them and was treated in a rather flippant manner.  My concern is to ensure that reasonable, stringent safety conditions are laid <Col N="853" /> down and implemented on all rail lines nation-wide. Unfortunately, a tragedy will probably occur before any such action is taken, following which there will be much hype and public relations announcements to the effect that such action was intended.  As a matter of urgency, I ask the Minister to ensure a limit is placed on the numbers of passengers permitted to board any train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McGahon for giving me an opportunity of contributing to this debate.</P>
      <P>As a frequent rail traveller, I too should like to express my concern at the quality of our rail services. Rail travel has become ever more popular in recent years, principally because of the traffic congestion on roads and the dangers involved in driving.  Greater numbers of people now possess cars, usually with more than one per household, in both urban and rural areas.  Our roads have not the capacity to accommodate these levels of traffic.  Despite the many road improvements implemented in recent years, subvented by EU Structural Funds, they are not adequate to meet the present demands.</P>
      <P>For that reason alone, there will have to be greater investment in our rail network generally, similar to that taking place throughout Europe and in the United States &mdash; which I visited recently &mdash; where major emphasis is being placed on investment in its rail network.  It is all the more important, therefore, that even greater emphasis be placed on upgrading ours.</P>
      <P>Some years ago one could be guaranteed to arrive at a destination on time but that is no longer the case.  On two occasions last week trains from Dublin to Limerick and Cork were delayed a number of hours.  On Tuesday morning, the Dublin train to Limerick was delayed by an hour and a half because of some incident on the line.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there was a serious incident on the Mallow-Tralee line a few weeks ago which was raised in the House by concerned Kerry Deputies.  It was fortunate that nobody was injured on that occasion as there could have been carnage.  Unfortunately, the Minister is not here. We all know that our rail network does not have the capacity to cope with existing demands but we need a programme of action, not another inquiry.</P>
      <P>As Kerry is the premier tourist county, it is vitally important that there is immediate investment in that line.  One-third of the tourists visiting our county use the rail network and it is important that there is investment in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make the closing remarks on this important motion.  I was pleased that Deputies took the opportunity to compliment the staff of Iarnród Éireann who have had to operate the railway system in difficult circumstances.  The future is much brighter now and I am sure the staff at all levels will rise to the challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Last night the Minister focused her contribution on two areas &mdash; investment and safety. The existing programme of investment on the railways is a complete turnaround from the unhappy period in the 1980s when financial support for the railways was allowed to decline.  To be fair to the people at that time, there was probably a widespread view throughout the world that railways had a poor future and that enormous investment could not be justified.</P>
    <P>There has been a marked change of attitude in most countries since then.  The key cause of this change has been a growing awareness of the problems of traffic congestion and air pollution. Where once there was a general belief that the traffic problem could be solved by building more roads, it is now clear, even in countries where the motor industry is an important part of the economy, that we cannot continue to dig up our fields to make more roads.</P>
    <P>Deputy Stagg yesterday cited the experience of the Lucan bypass, which is typical of roads everywhere. Only a few years after its construction traffic congestion on what is now a much larger road is as bad as it was on the old road which it replaced.</P>
    <P>In July 1996, the EU Commission published its White Paper entitled A Strategy for Revitalising the Community's Railways.  This is a watershed document clearly underlining the practical role which railways should play in our transport systems. In that paper the Commission was critical as well as supportive of railways.  It pointed out that railways had failed to improve their share of the transport market even though they have been sheltered from market forces.  It also stated that a clearer division of responsibilities between railway authorities and Governments is essential.  In particular, it said there is a need for explicit accounting for the public service aspects of the railways.  The Commission also underlined the opportunity provided by our railway systems in the fight against congestion and pollution.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Kenny alleged that, at any one time, 45 rail carriages are undergoing repair in the Iarnród Éireann workshops and if these could be maintained more quickly and put into service it would help to alleviate overcrowding.  I have checked with Iarnród Éireann and I understand that approximately 28 carriages are undergoing maintenance at any one time.  The recent accident at Knockcroghery caused this number to peak at 35 but matters are now back to normal.  The numbers using the railway at peak times are currently at an all time high and Iarnród Éireann is making every effort to minimise the number of carriages out of service.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies commented on the lack of EU funding for the westernmost extremities of the rail system.  I assure Deputies that this was not for want of effort by Ministers or officials.  As with everything else in life, resources are limited and difficult choices have to be made.  In our negotiations with the Commission, its emphasis was on the economic impact of investment.  This meant <Col N="855" /> that priority was given to the most heavily used sections of the network.  Nevertheless we succeeded at our first attempt in getting its agreement to invest in a substantial part of the network.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated last night that she intends to make the best possible case for further EU funding under the next round of Structural Funds.  I am sure that public support for railways as a means to deal with transport problems will continue to grow and that the case for further funding will continue to improve.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Stagg for putting the issue of safety into perspective.  Rail travel is significantly safer than road travel.  This is due to the care and attention given to safety by railway engineers everywhere.  From the earliest times, railway operators realised, that as with airlines, an unsafe system would be economic suicide.  Passengers would simply not travel if they considered trains unsafe.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann has a good safety record and management at all levels is fully committed to maintaining and improving safety standards.  It is worth pointing out that without sufficient public attention, Iarnród Éireann has significantly upgraded its passenger rolling stock in recent years.  All the carriages are now steel bodied and over 65 per cent have automatic doors.  The position will improve further with the arrival next year of a further 27 diesel railcars.</P>
    <P>While it is obviously essential to maintain the infrastructure in a safe working condition, passenger safety also relies on investment in good quality rolling stock to provide protection when, on rare occasions, accidents occur.  As the Minister said, operating a safe railway system requires attention to all aspects of the work.  Investment on its own would not be enough.  Neither would the most exhaustive inspection system be sufficient without investment.  The purpose of the safety review the Minister announced, and which I am delighted has been welcomed by all sides of the House, is to gather the facts based on the latest thinking about rail safety.  Without that all-embracing view of the complex interaction of activities on the railway, it would be all too easy to spend an enormous sum of money on improvements which may only marginally improve safety while other more important issues are neglected.</P>
    <P>I commend the amended motion proposed by the Minister.  The current £275 million programme of investment marks a new and exciting beginning for the railway system.  The railway safety review will complement this investment by providing the information necessary to take the right decisions so that passengers can continue to enjoy the high level of safety provided by our railway system.</P>

      <P>The Dublin-Sligo line has three daily passenger services each way.  Over 500,000 people use these services each year.  There is a daily commuter service from Longford to Dublin in addition to a daily scheduled liner train carrying freight.  According to Iarnród Éireann, a large proportion of the trackwork on the line is reaching life expiry leading to speed restrictions and uncomfortable travel.  Approximately 25 per cent of the line has modern continuously welded track.</P>
      <P>The EU Cohesion Fund recently approved grant assistance towards a £12.5 million investment programme which is to be concentrated between Dublin and Mullingar.  This decision was made on cost benefit grounds which indicated that the busier section of the track showed the best returns.  The Dublin-Mullingar section is in good condition but substantial investment is required between Mullingar and Sligo where a further 80 miles must be renewed if the line is to remain competitive with the ever improving road network.</P>
      <P>The total cost of completing the remaining 80 miles between Mullingar and Sligo is approximately £30 million.  The trains currently in use are second generation carriages.  The entire line is currently undergoing a transmission signal improvement scheme.  The future of the railway line in the west depends on Iarnród Éireann working in partnership with the local community and local development agencies.</P>
      <P>Will a copy of the application made by Iarnród Éireann for upgrading the Sligo-Dublin line be made available?  Also, will a copy of the EU consultants' report on this application, which apparently rejected the allocation of funding to the Mullingar-Sligo section, be made available?  Who were these consultants?  Did they visit the west and did they seek the observations of any economic development agencies, community groups, local authority or public representatives in Sligo, Roscommon, Leitrim or Longford?</P>
      <P>Ireland is one EU region.  The case has been accepted in Europe for a trans-European network between Belfast and Cork serving the east and south of the country, including Waterford and Galway.  While the west is committed to maintaining and increasing its population, it is incomprehensible that there is a lack of commitment to upgrading the railway infrastructure.  If EU resources are not available for railways in the west, the Exchequer should commit itself to funding it from its own resources.</P>
      <P>In her reply two weeks ago, the Minister stated that £2.5 million would be spent between 1996 and 1998 on the Mullingar to Sligo line.  Will that money come from the operational budget because, if so, it means that no track will be renewed.  If track is to be renewed, will the Minister indicate the location and when the work will commence?</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I thank my colleagues for sharing the restricted time available.  I emphasise <Col N="857" /> the importance of the Sligo line for Longford and other parts of the midlands.  Four or five years ago it was strongly rumoured that the future of that line was in danger.  A major campaign was launched at that stage by communities from Sligo to Dublin, especially by communities from Sligo to Mullingar, including my town of Longford. It was only at that stage the importance of the railway line to that region was emphasised. The future of the line appeared to be secure and we were given guarantees that improvements would be made because the service was particularly poor.  At that time the locomotives were not working properly on some days and on others the signalling system was wrong.  There is also the general problem of overcrowding on that train route.  I asked the Minister about that rail line in a recent debate on our railways.  I now ask the Minister of State to ensure something is done to improve the rolling stock on that line and to alleviate the overcrowding problem.  This matter should be taken up in the not too distant future with Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Sligo line has always been given the hand-me-downs in rail transport; the rolling stock taken off the southern lines.  It would remind one of the dinky cars passed by one family to another.  That is not good enough.  The people of the midlands, counties Leitrim Sligo, and Donegal deserve as good a service as that enjoyed by others.  Will the Minister of State ensure the Sligo line is provided for?  The signalling system and the rolling stock must be upgraded to the standard of other lines. There have been problems in the recent past and, knowing the Minister, her announcement on television yesterday that there will be a report on this was dramatic and timely.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to my colleague Deputy Yates who was the prime mover in getting action from the Minister on this matter.  I hope her announcement was not a PR exercise by the Minister and her commitment will be fulfilled.  If not, I will raise this matter again, as will my colleagues, particularly Deputy Yates, with the Minister and ask her to upgrade the tracks to get the trains moving.  That is what we want and what the people deserve.  Funding for that is available from Europe and it will be most unfortunate if our Government does not avail of it.  If that money is spent now, more funding may be made available. I compliment Deputy Yates on moving this motion and bringing this important matter before the House.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies on both sides of the House who spoke in this debate.  The number who have spoken is a clear indication of the genuine strength of feeling about this matter in the constituencies affected by this issue.  There is no doubt it has a resonance and an echo on the east coast and particularly in the west and north-west where people have always valued their railways. They consider them an integral part of a national transport policy and regional policy <Col N="858" /> which gives their communities access to the capital city.</P>
      <P>Regarding the two ministerial speeches, I welcome the terms of reference of the study.  Some weeks ago I called for an independent international assessment of a safety review of our railways. I am concerned that Iarnród Éireann is the judge and jury as well as the practitioner in all aspects of rail safety.  While its track record cannot be questioned, an external evaluation would be useful.</P>
      <P>A lack of investment is the key to this issue.  A number of Deputies opposite began their contributions by praising Deputy Cowen's commitment, as Minister, and the Fianna Fáil Administration for investing £275 million in our railways in 1994 and by the same token they then skipped a jump and said Fine Gael was to blame for the lack of investment in our railways.  They complimented the investment plan that excluded the Mullingar to Sligo route, the Dublin to Rosslare route and the Athlone to Ballina and Westport route.  My point is that the decision not to provide £85 million for those three routes is the reason for tonight's debate.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the safety of level crossings and I ask the Minister of State to take up that matter.  There are two types of level crossings here, one is operated by automatic signalling or manually and crosses roadways and the other is private level crossings which cross people's lands in respect of which farmers must commute back and forth.  Various people have told me there are tens of thousands of those level crossings throughout the country and their safety is very questionable.  If the response to this motion is a focus on safety, I hope that aspect will be clearly included in the terms of reference of the study.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, who I regret has not had the time to be present for the full debate, has a penchant for commissioning studies to deal with difficult issues.  I welcome this study only on the basis that it will not be a substitute for action.  There is a study commissioned on Luas, multi-channel TV, a strategic alliance with Aer Lingus, the ESB and there is endless pro-crastination and paralysis by analyses, but if a rail accident occurs, it will be too late.  In this regard, the House does not need £85 million in l998, but an indicative commitment that £15 to £20 million will be provided over a four year period for step by step upgrading of the railways.  We should bear in mind that if a rail accident occurs, Bus Éireann, Irish Rail and Dublin Bus do not have insurance. They carry their own insurance and, therefore, the taxpayer has to fund the current claims arising from the Claremorris accident some years ago and they will have to fund claims arising from any future rail accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point there is no such thing as risk free travel and she is right.  She said there is no point in saying that if an accident happens it might necessarily be the Government's responsibility.  If a motorist drives on the wrong <Col N="859" /> side of the road, the chances of him being involved in an accident are greater than if he drove on the correct side of the road.  The Minister has fair warning and after the accident at Knockcroghery it has been put up in lights that jointed track with metal fatigue on fishplates is a recipe for disaster in a derailment.  Concrete sleepers, continuous welded rail and automatic signalling are the only way to secure the types of speeds that intercity rail needs to be reliable, safe, popular and efficient.</P>
    <P>Crocodile tears shed by certain Members from a constituency perspective will not be enough unless they exert leverage.  I noticed during this debate that the real Taoiseach, Deputy Healy-Rae, fleetingly came into the House and I welcome his interest in this matter, but I want the Independent Deputies to put their feet down on this vote and exercise their leverage.  I call on <Col N="860" /> Deputies Fox and Blaney to do that.  We know the people who hold the balance of power in this country and the Members who hold the balance of power in this House.  They have appointed a special programme manager to look after their specialist needs.  They need only moan and groan about this issue to get action.  This debate has been a constructive and positive one but at the end of the day, the Minister, who was so quick when in Opposition to come into this House to find the Minister accountable for everything that went wrong, is now in the position where the buck stops with her.  She is responsible for railway investment and consequently for railway safety. There will be no hiding place in the event of a horrific accident occurring.  I hope the Minister will bring a memorandum to Cabinet in the near future and get results on this issue.  We will then have a national railway network of which we can be proud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) John O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  This short but important technical Bill amends the law contained in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979.  Its purpose is threefold: first, to give additional powers to tribunals of inquiry in relation to costs that may be ordered to be paid by a tribunal; second, to allow orders generally of a tribunal to be enforced; and third, to provide for immunity from suit of persons who supply written statements or documents to a tribunal.</P>
      <P>In the tribunal of inquiry under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice McCracken, on 28 October 1997, two issues arose in relation to the matter of costs.  The first was whether the tribunal had power to order, of its own motion, costs to be paid to persons before it by any other person.  The second related to whether the tribunal had power to award costs to itself against any person where the tribunal had incurred costs because of the non-cooperation of a person before it.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979 gives a tribunal of inquiry power to order that the whole or part of the costs of any person appearing before it be paid to that person by any other person named in the order, including the Minister for Finance.  The tribunal must be of the opinion that, having regard to the findings of the tribunal and all other relevant matters, there are sufficient reasons rendering it equitable to make such order.  The costs which may be ordered are those as taxed by the Master of the High Court.</P>
      <P>Judge McCracken indicated that, on the basis of the provisions of section 6 of the 1979 Act, he was satisfied that the only persons who can get costs are those persons who have been given representation and are represented by solicitor or counsel before the tribunal.  He concluded that he had no power under the Act of 1979 to order a person to pay the cost of the tribunal's expenses as such.</P>
      <P>The solicitor on behalf of the public interest had sought counsel's opinion on the matter and on the basis of the advice given, decided not to proceed with an application to have any person pay some or all of the costs of the tribunal.  Judge McCracken indicated his agreement to the approach that was adopted by the solicitor.</P>
      <P>It was also established in the McCracken tribunal that costs could only be awarded by the tribunal on the application of a person appearing before the tribunal and that in the absence of such an application the tribunal had no power of its own motion to award costs to any person.</P>
      <P>In view of those developments it is important that the law in relation to tribunals of inquiry be strengthened.  The need to do so quickly is evident because two important tribunals, one under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty and the other under Mr. Justice Flood, have recently been established under resolution of both Houses.  The orders governing the work of both these tribunals includes reference to the fact that it is the desire of the Oireachtas that &ldquo;all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the inquiry should, as far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the main provisions in the Bill. These are section 2 which deals with certain immunities, section 3 which deals with the matters in relation to costs and section 4 in relation to the matter of enforcement generally of orders made by a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law as it stands in subsection (3) of section 1 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, a witness before a tribunal is entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court. However, the Act makes no reference to the position <Col N="863" /> of persons who produce or send documents to a tribunal pursuant to an order of the tribunal. I am, therefore, proposing in section 2 to amend section 1 of the Act of 1921 by the insertion of a new subsection (4) which provides that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal pursuant to an order of that tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier section 6(1) of the Amendment Act, 1979, which empowers a tribunal to order the costs of any person appearing before a tribunal to be paid by any person named in the order but does not, as we now know from the McCracken tribunal, empower a tribunal to order that costs which are incurred by the tribunal be paid in favour of itself, and, ultimately, the State, through the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill substitutes a new subsection (1) in that section 6 of the Act of 1979.  The new subsection repeats the substance of the existing subsection (1) in the Act of 1979 but, in addition, allows a tribunal to recover its own expenses where they have, in effect, been incurred by the non-co-operation of any party before it.  I have provided in the new subsection (1) that the tribunal may of its own motion order that the costs of any person coming before it be paid by any other person named in the order. Section 3 of the Bill also provides that the new subsection (1) in the Act of 1979 shall apply to costs incurred after the Bill comes into effect.  The section 3 provisions in the Bill will, therefore, apply to both the Moriarty and Flood tribunals.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to mention that on the Order of Business in the Dáil on 18 November 1997, the Taoiseach indicated in response to a question from Deputy Quinn, that the Government intended to amend the Act of 1979 so that a tribunal would have the power to award costs to itself against any person where the person's actions had incurred costs for the tribunal. Deputy Quinn subsequently furnished the text of an amending Bill and I would like to thank him for that and to say that it has been taken fully into account in the Government's Bill.  His Bill was confined solely to the matter of allowing a tribunal to award costs to itself.  The Government's Bill goes that bit further by allowing a tribunal to award costs of its own motion.  Section 4 is also new and is additional to that contained in Deputy Quinn's proposal.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is intended to strengthen the position of tribunals of inquiry so as to ensure that its orders can be enforced.  The section provides that where a person fails, refuses to comply with, or disobeys an order of a tribunal of inquiry, the High Court may, on application to it in a summary manner in that behalf by the tribunal, order the person to comply with the order and to make such other order as it considers necessary and just to enable the order to have full effect.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Constitution in relation to trial of offences are such that a tribunal cannot <Col N="864" /> have the same powers as the High Court has to commit a person for failure to obey orders. However, in framing section 4 of the Bill I have taken into account section 3 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, which provides that where a person disobeys a direction of a committee the committee may seek an order of the High Court to have the direction complied with.  Section 4 of the Bill is similar to the provisions in the 1997 Act and is intended to provide an effective method of enforcement of a tribunal's orders.</P>
    <P>Those are the main provisions in the Bill.  The changes provided for are important and timely.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I welcome the provisions of this Bill.  It is another step in putting in place the necessary powers to enable tribunals of inquiry to have all the necessary powers to discharge the roles assigned to them.  The beef tribunal, originally designed to unearth the unseemly business practices of the Goodman empire, ended up as a seemingly endless voyage into the world of the beef industry because its terms of reference were too broad and unspecific.</P>
      <P>Admittedly it dug deep into the myriad of scams and frauds carried out by the favourite son of Mr. Haughey and his Government, the chosen one for preferential treatment from the State in terms of a monopoly on export credit insurance and special treatment from the State agency, the IDA, in getting grant-aid and the setting aside of performance clauses.  It cost millions of pounds and the irony is that, apart from a few fingered relatively minor individuals who took the rap, none of the major managers or manipulators were brought to book.</P>
      <P>Mr. Goodman has, through an elaborate financial arrangement which was facilitated by legislation in this House, worked his way back to being one of the major players in the beef market. This is despite the fact that volumes of paperwork describe his activities in detail and major and criminal irregularities were uncovered.  However, none of the principal perpetrators, including Mr. Goodman, was asked to pay the costs either literally or metaphorically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribunals are a painful and costly learning experience.  However, lessons were learned when the Dunnes stores payments to politicians tribunal was established.  The terms of reference were more tightly drawn.  There were definite parameters, a preliminary report and a clear focus.  The McCracken tribunal final report was a model of conciseness and clarity.  It was delivered in simple, unadorned and effective language.  The tribunal eventually extracted from Mr. Haughey the admission that he lied successively to the tribunal and that despite his numerous denials he had accepted £1.3 million from Mr Ben Dunne. It established that this amount was made up of several payments and merely helped to fund Mr. Haughey's lavish lifestyle for a relatively short <Col N="865" /> period.  It gave a damning denunciation of politicians in positions of power putting themselves in situations of compromise.  In 11 separate paragraphs it condemns the blatant lies and omissions of an unrepentant Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>By establishing a figure of £1.3 million the clear inference is that there must have been numerous other unaccounted for benefactors who enabled Mr. Haughey to finance his many other years of luxurious lifestyle.  It did not spare the use of unorthodox business practices of Deputy Lowry and his company, Streamline Enterprises.  The tribunal did tremendous work in bringing into the public domain the existence of the £38 million Ansbacher accounts and the Guinness and Mahon (Ireland) Bank link with same.  It was clear that the Central Bank regulations were flouted, particularly in the breaching of exchange controls.  It was also established that the late Mr. Des Traynor who, according to Mr. Haughey, had total control of his finances had also total control of the Ansbacher accounts of £38 million deposited with Guinness and Mahon.  The McCracken tribunal suggested that, in some instances at least, the mechanisms were designed to evade tax.  The Ansbacher audits were clearly sounding the most ominous of alarm bells about lack of internal controls of various aspects of the management of the accounts.  The comments of the auditor were included in the McCracken report:</P>
    <P>Lack of internal control over this activity, coupled with the fact that the Ansbacher deposits constitute nearly 35 per cent of the bank's liabilities, expose the bank to serious risks of loss and embarrassment.  These risks together with the legal position of the bank <i>vis- a-vis</i> the maintenance of offshore customer deposits by a bank employee and on the bank's premises need to be evaluated by the board.</P>
    <P>These comments raise major questions as to what sanctions if any the Central Bank in its role as banking policeman and licensing authority imposed on Guinness and Mahon.  Did it make a formal report to the Minister for Finance?  Did it believe that tax evasion was afoot, and if so what did it do about it?</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Moriarty tribunal is empowered to make recommendations &ldquo;for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as a regulator of the banks and of the financial services sector generally&rdquo;.  The Moriarty tribunal therefore is in a position to ask all the relevant questions and to demand answers because it would seem that the role of the Central Bank in this whole affair leaves much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a further permanent stage in the development of tribunal procedures. The granting of immunity and privilege for those who submit documents to the tribunal is to be commended.  It goes without saying that no obstacle must stand in the way of access to all <Col N="866" /> information to enable a tribunal henceforth to discharge its functions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendment to section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act 1979, to enable tribunals of inquiry to order those who do not co-operate to pay not just the costs of other persons appearing before the tribunal but also other tribunal costs.  The terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal state that &ldquo;all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the enquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of Justice, be borne by those individuals&rdquo;. It is quite clear that Mr. Haughey's attempts to frustrate the determination of the McCracken tribunal led to unnecessary journeys to London and the Cayman Islands.  Furthermore, expensive work was undertaken by Guinness Mahon Bank and Irish Intercontinental Bank as requested by the tribunal.  This all amounted to several hundred thousands of pounds which could have been obviated had Mr. Haughey co-operated fully and come clean at the start.</P>
    <P>I wish the tribunal well.  I hope that when its work has been completed no aspect will be left unfinished.  It must get to the bottom of all aspects of the funding of the affairs of Messrs Haughey and Lowry.  I do not say this out of political vindictiveness, but I believe we are at a watershed in political life.  There has been much pain and damage to the system arising from revelations in relation to the conduct of people who recently held high office and, in the case of Mr. Haughey, the highest office in the land.  If there is a well founded public suspicion after the tribunal has completed its work that for some reason all aspects of the finances of both individuals are not known to the tribunal, more damage than good will ensue as a result of the process now being undertaken.</P>
    <P>There are two issues in particular which would seem to commend themselves to the tribunal.  The first is the Mafouz passport issue.  Not alone was every rule in the book dispensed with but Mr. Haughey personally delivered the passports to people who were subsequently involved in the biggest banking scam in history.</P>
    <P>The decision by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and Mr. Charles Haughey as Taoiseach to jointly oversee and facilitate the handing over of £8 million of taxpayers' money for the unnecessary purchase of Carysfort Training College by UCD from Fianna Fáil activist Pino Harris, thereby handing him a cool £1.5 million profit for holding on for six months to a property he was desperate to sell, continues to be one of the major unanswered causes of public disquiet.  To pretend that it has been adequately investigated by the Committee of Public Accounts is simply not credible.  The key witnesses were not before the committee. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, the former Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and the main beneficiary, Mr. Pino Harris, were not interviewed or present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> Tribunals can constitute one member or several members with a chairman.  From the point of view of balance as well as from the point of view of safety, tribunals should constitute more than one member.  I say this in particular with reference to tribunals which run for a long time, where a large volume of evidence has been taken and considerable costs have been incurred.  In such one member tribunals, the death of the tribunal member would inevitably lead to a situation where all of the work done and all of the evidence garnered would have to be set at nought.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the Bill and hope it will put in place a further procedure in the development of the tribunal process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very welcome.  It is, in effect, a replica of a Bill the Labour Party recently introduced.  I give my sincerest welcome to the decision of the Government Parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, to adopt our proposals.  I thank the Minister for the gracious manner in which he acknowledged the contribution of Deputy Quinn and the Labour Party to the formulation of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill essentially builds on and updates the current law on tribunals.  The Tribunals Act, 1921 provides that both Houses of the Oireachtas can establish a tribunal to investigate matters of urgent public importance.  Tribunals are conferred with all the powers of the High Court. They can secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents.  This Bill also provides for the hearing in public and legal representation of people who appear before the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The 1921 Act was followed by an Act in 1979 which corrected a constitutional fault in the original Act relating to the procedure for the punishment of failure to comply with orders of the tribunals. More important for the present purposes, it also gave the power to order costs of any person appearing before the tribunal where there was sufficient reason to render it equitable to do so.  In those circumstances it provided that costs should be paid to any other named person.  In other words, the power of the court was established to award costs as between party and party arising from the terms of the 1979 Act.  However, there was a flaw in this Act that became apparent in the McCracken tribunal.  A great deal of delay and costs were incurred as a result of the non co-operation of Mr. Haughey with this tribunal. However, the costs which arose from this non co-operation were not borne by any other party at the tribunal.  Instead, the costs were incurred by the tribunal itself.  Trips to London, the Cayman Islands and an inordinate amount of research and backlog work which arose from the non co-operation of Mr. Haughey could have been avoided if he had co-operated with the tribunal.  This gave rise to additional costs which had to be incurred by the tribunal, yet could not be ordered to be borne by Mr. Haughey since he was not within the terms of party and party costs.  In effect, Mr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Haughey cost the public a great deal of money and there is at present no way of getting him to account for it.</P>
    <P>The new legislation, which primarily arose from the initiatives taken by Deputy Ruairí Quinn and accepted by the Taoiseach, is to correct this defect in the 1979 Act.  In future a tribunal will be able to order that its own costs can be awarded against a person appearing before it. This is the provision contained in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are some other welcome changes in the Bill.  Section 1 extends the 1921 Act by providing that not only witnesses before the tribunal but also a person who produces or sends a document to it should be entitled to the same immunities as a witness before the High Court.  This provision clarifies what has been understood to be the position as of now, and that is very welcome.  The Labour Party has put down an amendment to extend immunity to those who send or produce documents pursuant to an order of the tribunal. In addition we are proposing that that immunity shall be extended to those who send documents to the tribunal arising from a request of the tribunal. In practice a great deal of a tribunal's preliminary work is done on an informal basis and by way of request.  People who respond to requests should be given the same immunity as those who respond to orders.  This would considerably reduce the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the remit of this short, technical Bill has not been extended to cover the £38 million in the Ansbacher accounts which has huge implications in terms of taxation.  The Labour Party sought to have the Ansbacher account included in the original Moriarty tribunal but, although supported by the main Opposition party, our proposal was voted down by the Government.  This has happened in the context of a budget which greatly benefits the well off.  Tax equity is as important as tax reduction and it is crazy that the Government did not extend the investigation to cover the Ansbacher accounts. This decision is puzzling given the preoccupation with taxation prior to the general election and which was an important engine in returning the Government to office.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a missed opportunity in terms of addressing these issues.  It is a great pity action was not taken to deal with the Ansbacher accounts.  The failure to act on these accounts enforces the impression that there is one law for the rich and another one for the rest of the public. This is very regrettable given that tax equity is as important as tax reduction and more important than it in many respects.  It helps to stimulate the long held impression that the wealthy have an inside track and that regardless of the regulations they can work their way out of a corner.  It is a pity action has not been taken to tackle this issue and my party will continue to highlight this deficiency.  Leaving aside these concerns, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill for the reasons outlined.  It is interesting to note the change in the environment in terms of the commendable speed with which the Government reacted to shut off a shameful loophole and the response to the report of the Goodman tribunal. The climate and environment have changed almost beyond recognition.</P>
      <P>I remember well the debate on the Goodman report on the day of the ceasefire.  Deputy O'Donoghue was one of the leading defenders of the conduct, exposed in the report, of his Fianna Fáil colleagues, the Fianna Fáil Government and the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey.  He defended that conduct without the slightest shame.  I do not have the report with me partly because it is late and partly because I do not want to use this opportunity to embarrass the Minister. However, it is worth noting that in respect of the unfinished business of the McCracken tribunal we are no longer prepared to condone actions which a majority of the House were prepared to condone at the time of the Hamilton tribunal.</P>
      <P>The reason for this is the public outrage at the conduct of the former Taoiseach who refused to come out of the bunker and surrender and who at the very end came out into the sunlight to wave at those he thought were his traditional admirers. Having obstructed the work of the tribunal and lied to it and having been criticised by the tribunal for having done so, he incurred serious costs which the taxpayer must pay.  The former Taoiseach effectively refused to comply with the law of the land and taxpayers regard it as unfair that they should have to pick up the bill for him. It is this loophole we are seeking to shut off in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Nobody seeks to defend that conduct now but Members were sent in here on the day of the ceasefire &mdash;which I am sure was coincidental &mdash; to defend what was exposed in the report of the Goodman tribunal.  Will the Minister deal with the decision by the sole member of the tribunal not to make the principal offender amenable for his costs before the tribunal?  Does the Minister believe there is anything in the Bill which provides for this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In brief this case involved a major corporation which had been found guilty of the biggest organised tax evasion scam in the history of industrialisation. A sum of £8 million was subsequently retrieved by the Exchequer based on documentary evidence which I submitted to the tribunal and which was corroborated by Mr. Patrick McGuinness.  The extraordinary decision which offended the public was that Mr. Justice Hamilton found, on his reading of the relevant Acts, that he had to allow Mr. Goodman his legal and other extensive fees for consultants.  He received hundreds of thousands of pounds for someone who acted as a spin doctor during the tribunal and who interpreted the workings of the tribunal for the assembled press corps.  The fees for all the other consultants were also discharged by the tribunal and paid for by the taxpayer.  The sole <Col N="870" /> member of the tribunal believed he was not able to make him amenable and to require him to pay his fees.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the myriad matters on which the tribunal made findings, some not as conclusive as one would like and perhaps not as conclusive as they would be if the sole member was seized of them again post McCracken, does the Minister believe it is fair that someone found guilty of organised tax evasion on the multi-million pound scale the Goodman corporation was found to be guilty of should have his fees discharged by the tribunal?  If he agrees that this is unfair and that it offends the sense of justice of the ordinary citizen, is there anything in the Bill which will ensure, in a repetition of the Goodman affair, that the sole member of the tribunal will feel enabled to have deducted from a corporation or principal the cost of their appearance before the tribunal and any other such costs as he thinks proper?  That is an important question and I would like the Minister to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on the provision in the Bill under which immunity will be conferred on a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal?  What is the situation of a person resident outside the jurisdiction?  The genesis of the Flood tribunal is in the documents purportedly in the hands of a group of solicitors outside the jurisdiction in Newry.  It appears they have been leaking information.  Is there anything in the legislation or we can insert in it a provision under which persons outside the jurisdiction who submit or produce documents to a tribunal can be made amenable?  I hope the people for whom the solicitors in Newry are acting will produce documents. Immunity will be conferred on them even though they are not citizens of this jurisdiction.  Could they be required to appear before a tribunal?</P>
    <P>I would like to have had the opportunity to underline some of the points made by Deputy Higgins.  Deputy Upton is correct that a motion dealing with the Ansbacher accounts was defeated in the House recently.  It is extraordinary that we are prepared to inquire into these accounts only as they relate to two former Members of the House and, apparently, allow people outside who hoarded money for the purposes of tax evasion to escape scot-free.  That is not right.  I hope we will have an opportunity to return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who addressed the House on Second Stage.  I indicated that the Bill is about strengthening the powers of tribunals of inquiry.  It does so in three specific ways.  It gives additional powers to tribunals of inquiry in relation to costs that may be ordered to be paid by a tribunal.  It provides for a mechanism whereby orders of a tribunal can be enforced efficiently and for immunity from suit of persons who supply written statements or documents to a tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> A number of issues have been raised in relation to the further measures that might be taken.  I will outline briefly the Government's overall approach to this area.  Consideration is being given to extending the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include the functions of monitoring and investigating possible breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  This would involve extending his powers to enable him to carry out investigations by the making of certain forms of orders such as orders for the discovery of documents and possibly by allowing him to have recourse to the courts to seek letters of request to courts in other jurisdictions to enable witnesses to be examined and documents produced in such jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>The Government is examining recommendations in this regard.  Its consideration will include reconciling the tribunal recommendation with the recommendation of the all-party committee on the Constitution on the establishment of an electoral and ethics commission.  As the all-party committee stated in its first report, a single commission incorporating the Public Offices Commission, the Constituency Commission and the proposed independent Referendum Commission would guarantee its independence and impartiality, generate greater confidence in public life, create greater transparency in public institutions and provide an independent source of advice and information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of making it mandatory for a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas to produce a tax inspector's certificate to the Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, as the case may be, to the effect that his or her tax affairs are in order, accompanied by a statutory declaration to that effect.  The Government's programme outlines support for such a proposal.  The matter is being examined.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised regarding the Government's commitment to the introduction of legislation which would provide that a person found guilty of an offence under the Ethics in Public Office Act would be ineligible to become a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, either for a limited period or permanently.  The necessary amendments to that Act to implement the McCracken tribunal's recommendations in regard to the creation of a criminal offence for breaches of the legislation and the consequent barring of a convicted person from standing in a subsequent election are being prepared.</P>
    <P>Decisions which arise from Government consideration of these matters will not prevent existing authorities such as the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General from exercising their statutory powers as they deem necessary.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners has stated publicly that the proceedings of the tribunal were monitored closely and that all appropriate action will be <Col N="872" /> taken.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that any additional investigative powers required by the Revenue Commissioners can be introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins referred to the Minister for Public Enterprise.  I sincerely hope he did not intend, by innuendo or otherwise, to call into question her probity or integrity which is respected by her colleagues in this House and the people.</P>
    <P>It is obvious the contents of the Bill cannot deal directly with the question of the Ansbacher accounts.  I have no intention of wasting the time of the House by discussing all over again the contents of the beef tribunal report but when I entered the House I ascribed certain descriptions of Deputy Rabbitte's testimony to the chairman of the tribunal.  The accusations or allegations levelled by the Deputy were held to have no foundation. Perhaps the less said, from his perspective, about those allegations the better.</P>
    <P>With regard to the decisions of the tribunal, it is not for me to decide whether it should have done X, Y or Z but it is clear a tribunal of inquiry does not have the power to impose penalties.  It could not have such a power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked whether this legislation changes anything in relation to the powers of a tribunal to ensure certain persons who appear before it pay costs.  The answer is yes.  Provision is made for the conferring of immunity on persons who submit documents, whatever their source, to a tribunal.  There are clear powers relating to the ordering of documents by a tribunal.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill persons who send or produce documents pursuant to an order of the tribunal are given the same immunity as witnesses before the High Court.  We are simply suggesting similar immunity should be extended to people who send documents to the tribunal arising from an informal request by the tribunal.  Such requests would be similar to the letters we received in the past month seeking information on an informal basis. People might feel obliged to protect themselves from exposure to legal risk by waiting for a formal order before producing documents.  This amendment would speed up the informal work of the tribunal.  I understand a large proportion of the work done at the early stages of a tribunal is carried out on an informal basis.</P>

In every day language Deputy Upton's amendment seems perfectly reasonable, but does any letter from the tribunal constitute an order?  Is every communication from the tribunal an order within the definition of subsection (4)?</P>

      <P>I doubt that.  Section 2 provides that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal, pursuant to an order of that tribunal, shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.  Deputy Upton's amendment proposes that the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo; should be inserted after the word &ldquo;order&rdquo; so that a person who produces or sends a document to a tribunal, pursuant to an order or request of that tribunal, shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court.  The amendment is of a drafting nature only.  All directions by a tribunal to persons to furnish documents are sent on foot of an order of the tribunal.  Consequently, as intimated by Deputy Rabbitte, the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or request&rdquo; are not necessary.  The parliamentary draftsman was consulted and agrees the amendment is not necessary.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte's question which he posed originally on Second Stage, the documents the tribunal would request or be furnished with would be the subject matter of the immunity and the fact that the individuals concerned were outside the jurisdiction would not adversely affect that position.  Perhaps the reason Deputy Rabbitte was straining his ears regarding the other question he raised about the possibility of those people being made amenable to the tribunal was that he did not ask it on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 27 to 29, to delete &ldquo;(including the terms of the resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas relating to the establishment of the tribunal)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;such as a failure to co-operate or provide assistance to the tribunal in the course of its functions; knowingly providing the tribunal with misleading information; the terms of the resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas relating to the establishment of the tribunal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the rate we are going, there will be a blue moon every night because I think we are in broad agreement on this amendment also.  Section 3 is an amendment to section 6 of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979.  The tribunal or the chairman may order that the costs, in whole or in part, of any person appearing before the tribunal, or costs incurred by the tribunal, should be sought in certain circumstances. We should set out in more specific terms what we mean by sufficient grounds to grant such costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill arises from the frustration of the previous tribunal with a person appearing before it who not only failed to co-operate and refused to tell the truth but, as stated by the chairman in his report, told a tissue of lies.  The Minister said that I was casting doubt on the propriety of the Minister for Public Enterprise.  The purpose of this measure is to give further teeth and effect to the <Col N="875" /> tribunal to draw down payments from people who frustrate it.  We want to ensure people do not fail to co-operate with or attempt to frustrate the work of the tribunal.  Essentially, we are talking about the co-operation of Mr. Haughey, Deputy Lowry and others who may have facilitated their lifestyles or finances.</P>
    <P>I correctly drew the attention of the House to two particular instances.  The first is the Mafouz passport affair in which, by any standards, Mr. Haughey had an extraordinary hands-on involvement. Huge amounts of money were involved with a major individual who was subsequently found guilty of the biggest banking scam in history. The second is the Carysfort issue.  I have pointed out that this was not sufficiently investigated at the time by the Committee of Public Accounts in view of the fact that the key personalities did not appear before the committee, although civil servants and representatives of the Higher Education Authority did.</P>
    <P>It will require the co-operation of everybody involved to enable the tribunal to discharge its function properly.  In the case of Carysfort we are talking about an unfathomable decision where a large sum of taxpayers' money &mdash; a neat round sum of £5 million &mdash; was given to an individual, who had a particular affinity with a political party, for holding a property for a mere six months.  The co-operation of everyone involved &mdash;indirectly or, more importantly, directly &mdash; in facilitating this project is required, including civil servants and Ministers.  I mention Ministers because that is where the buck stops in such cases.  I am making that point in the context of substantiating this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the gravamen of Deputy Higgins's amendment.  Taking the phrase included in that amendment, &ldquo;knowingly providing the tribunal with misleading information&rdquo;, Deputy Higgins has a very strong case in this regard.  One can go back over the history of tribunals and, unfortunately, we require a certain jurisprudential knowledge of tribunals in recent times.  I am satisfied, however, &mdash; and I say this with a full sense of consciousness &mdash; that misleading information was knowingly provided to the beef tribunal.  Surely we should take this opportunity to at least specify the situation where someone sets out not just to obstruct the work of the tribunal but to provide misleading information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give a separate instance that does not have a political dimension to it and, therefore, the Minister may be more amenable to hearing me clearly.  In the case of the beef tribunal, it accidentally emerged that a civil servant in the Department of Agriculture admitted that he had changed a material document submitted in evidence before the tribunal.  The significance of that change was it would have shown that the origin of the beef, the subject of export credit insurance, had been sourced outside the State.  The original <Col N="876" /> CBF documents had that section in them, but this official took it on himself, for whatever reasons. to excise that.  It emerged by accident at the tribunal. I am not imputing to that civil servant any malevolent purpose or anything like that, I am merely saying it is a fact.  It is not for me to pass judgment as to why it happened, but it happened. The enormity and significance of it can be seen in terms of an outstanding case against the State, that has never been withdrawn, for £120 million or £180 million.  That was the subject of the famous row that broke the Government.  The row was between the then Minster for Industry and Commerce and the then Taoiseach over precisely how much was at stake, but that would have shown that the beef in question was sourced outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Surely we ought to take the opportunity of Deputy Higgins's amendment to provide against the situation where misleading documents are deliberately or otherwise provided.  Let the tribunal be the arbiter of whether they were provided for a purpose to subvert the work of the inquiry, but we ought to have a provision that where it is knowingly provided the tribunal can act accordingly.</P>

      <P>The general effect of amendment No. 3 from Deputy Higgins and my amendment No. 4 would be to expand the examples of issues which the tribunal might take into consideration when assessing costs.  The examples in each of the amendments are the same.  On that basis I accept the principle of his amendment, but I suggest that in technical drafting terms my amendment be favoured.  I am, therefore, asking Deputy Higgins to withdraw amendment No. 3 in favour of amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>With regard to the comments of Deputy Rabbitte, I have no doubt he is correct when he states that much misleading information was given to the beef tribunal.  If the pun can be excused, I have no wish to rake over the bones of that tribunal. However, nobody is more qualified to know that misleading information was given to the beef tribunal than Deputy Rabbitte because, in the chairman's own words, many of the allegations that Deputy Rabbitte made simply did not stand up.  The logical conclusion, therefore, is that the information given to the tribunal regarding these matters was misleading.</P>
      <P>In so far as I recall it, and I have no wish to fight old battles, Deputy Rabbitte stated that one of these allegations was made to him by a man in a public house.  I do not think that allegation stood up.  So, when pursuing these matters in future, I strongly suggest that Deputy Rabbitte should carry a breathalyser kit.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Higgins will permit me I would like to say something.  It is profoundly <Col N="877" /> disturbing that the Minister either has not got the confidence or the seriousness to deal with a serious point made here.  He seems to be implying that I cannot draw on the experience of the beef tribunal to make a point in support of an amendment proposed either by Deputy Higgins or himself. What else are we here to discuss but to try to shut off a loophole in the legislation that provides for the establishment of tribunals of inquiry?  The Minister has made a trivial and non-sensical point.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong, of course, about the point made to me in a pub, as he puts it.  The point concerned Master Meats and giving £10 million export credit insurance to Paschal Phelan, a friend of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, even though he had made no application for export credit insurance and even though Halal in Ballyhaunis had complied with all the requirements but did not get it.  When Paschal Phelan, with Oliver Murphy of Hibernian Meats, went to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds in his office, Deputy Reynolds said to Mr. Phelan: &ldquo;There is £10 million left, Paschal, would you like to take it yourself?&rdquo; Mr. Phelan was not doing business with Iraq and did not contemplate doing business there, yet that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I defer to your ruling, but it is infuriating that recent experience of tribunals has shown up defects in one sense or another.  Mr. Justice McCracken dealt at some length in his report with the defects he encountered.  We are having this debate because Mr. Justice McCracken highlighted them and put it up to the Oireachtas to do something about it.  When one adduces arguments from the jurisprudence which is on hand from recent tribunals, the Minister reacts in a purely partisan political way, making nonsensical and irrelevant attempts at petty point scoring and refuses to deal with any of the gravamen of the complaints that have been raised.  It is profoundly disturbing and I instanced the case of a civil servant because I did not want to raise the Minister's political hackles but he responded in an entirely political way.  One wonders whether the Minister can stand up and deal with legislation he brings before the House without having a note put into his hand to read out, and if he misses a comma or mistakes it for a full stop everyone is at sea.</P>
      <P>I expect more from him because he is an intelligent and honest man.  I do not know why he is sensitive and defensive and while I am not trying to hang the sins of his predecessors around his neck he is provoking me to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;5 &mdash; An application to the High Court by a tribunal pursuant to Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution shall be made in a summary <Col N="879" /> manner, on notice to the Attorney General, every person represented before the tribunal pursuant to section 2 (b) of the Principal Act appearing to the tribunal to have an interest in the application, and any other person specified by order of the High Court.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment sets out a procedure that is not provided for whereby a tribunal could refer to the High Court a question on whether the Cabinet confidentiality rule should be lifted by it.  There is no procedure in the Bill to cover this eventuality. It will be a matter for the High Court to determine whether Cabinet confidentiality should be breached and we are simply proposing a means by which this can be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference in Deputy Upton's amendment is to Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution as accepted by the people in the recent referendum.  It provides that the confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances, save only that the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter in the interests of the administration of justice by a court and by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application on that behalf by a tribunal.</P>
      <P>The tribunal must be one appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.  The tribunals in question are of the kind covered by the Tribunals of Inquiry Evidence Acts, 1921 and 1979.  The Deputy's amendment does not attempt to change the law in Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution because what is in question is a fundamental provision in regard to the Constitution nor does it attempt to change the substance of law in those Acts.</P>
      <P>The amendment is an attempt to prescribe what form the applications from a tribunal should take where it applies to the High Court for disclosure by the Government of confidential Cabinet material.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide that where a tribunal makes such an application, it must be made on foot of a summary summons.</P>
      <P>I will outline the manner in which civil proceedings are commenced in the High Court in the context of the amendment.  All civil proceedings with the exception of petitions are commenced in the High Court by way of either a plenary, special or a summary summons, all of which are provided for in the rules of the superior courts.  A plenary summons is used for cases requiring pleadings and oral evidence while a summary summons is used for proceedings to be heard on affidavit without pleadings and may in certain circumstances be supplemented by oral evidence.  A special summons is used mainly for equity claims, such as probate matters or the administration of trusts.  The summary summons procedure in the High Court is the exception rather than the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> Given the fundamental nature of the applications from tribunals that would be in question, it would be wrong in principle and practice to rule absolutely that all applications to the High Court should be made in a summary manner.  The experience may be that a good proportion of applications from tribunals should more appropriately be made on the more particularised basis provided for in the plenary or special summons.</P>
    <P>The range of matters the Oireachtas may decide need to be inquired into by a tribunal may be extensive.  It is not possible to determine at any time what issues may be the subject of a tribunal of inquiry or in what circumstances it may be necessary for a tribunal to apply to the High Court for disclosures of confidential Cabinet material.  To specify now by way of legislation the form the applications should take is not the way to proceed.  The procedure that should apply before the High Court is in question.  Legislation already empowers the various court rules committees to make rules on pleadings, practice and procedure before the courts.  As Minister, I must concur in the making of any such rules.  The rules for the purposes of applications to the courts under Article 28.4.3º would, therefore, be a matter for consideration by the superior courts rules committee.  Where rules are not specially prescribed allowing for procedure by summary or special summons Order 1, Rule 6 of the rules of the superior court provide that in all proceedings other than to take a minor into wardship commenced by originating summons procedure by plenary summons should be obligatory.</P>
    <P>However, should the House continue to have concerns in the matter of rules that should apply for the purposes of Article 28.4.3º, I would be happy to bring them to the notice of the rules committee but I cannot favour the amendment and I am unable to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I might get further with the Minister if I asked him to explain something rather than saying something that he could deem to be critical.  What are we saying here?  We are prescribing the fashion in which an application may be made to the High Court.  Does Deputy Upton's amendment require that it shall only be done with the assent of the Attorney General?  It is desirable that the tribunal ought to have freedom to make such application as it thinks appropriate. We can remember a case in recent history where the Government was divided in itself and where counsel for the State was acting only for some Ministers in Cabinet on the instruction of the Attorney General and not on behalf of other Ministers in the same Cabinet or former Ministers. I would be obliged if the Minister would explain this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three ways of originating the proceedings: the special summons, a summary summons and a plenary summons.  The summary summons which Deputy Upton proposed <Col N="881" /> in his amendment, would be made only on foot of a notice to the Attorney General.  Therefore, Deputy Rabbitte's interpretation of the amendment is correct.</P>
      <P>There is a superior courts rules committee to deal with the question of practice and procedures before the courts.  My considered opinion is that it would be a matter which would be better considered by that committee.  If the House has concerns in relation to whether it should be by summary summons on notice to the Attorney General or by summary summons &mdash; as Deputy Rabbitte said &mdash; without notice to the Attorney General, this would be best considered by the committee which is charged with framing the rules by which our superior courts operate.  I would be happy to ask the superior courts rules committee to look at the suggestion put forward by Deputy Upton in his proposed amendment, though the argument can certainly be made that the plenary summons is the more appropriate way of initiating the relevant procedure.  It is not open to me to accept the amendment but I am prepared to ask the superior courts rules committee to look at the matter and report back.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.  &mdash; For the avoidance of doubt, a person shall not be entitled to refuse to disclose information to a tribunal, pursuant to an order of that tribunal, by reason only of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the provisions of section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, relating to disclosure of information, or</P>
      <P>(b) any other rule of law or provision of an enactment providing that such information may be required by a court only in connection with criminal proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises primarily from indications which have emanated from the Central Bank in relation to rules of disclosure of information which is available to the bank in relation to transactions and proceedings with it regarding accounts located outside the country, set out in section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  The amendment proposes that section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, should not apply to the tribunal and that recourse to this section of the Central Bank Act, 1989, would not provide the Central Bank with a basis for refusing to make disclosures and information available to the tribunal if it so requests.  As I understand the position, there is some doubt about this question and <Col N="882" /> the Central Bank seems to have made some oblique indications to suggest that this section of the Central Bank Act would prevent it from making available relevant information to the tribunal in event of a request to this effect being made. For this reason we have tabled the amendment.  I sincerely hope the Minister will accept it to allow whatever relevant information is needed by the tribunal to be made available by the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect, Deputy Upton's amendment is flawed.  He uses the words &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt&rdquo;.  The law does not operate in that matter and it is wrong to suggest it does by attempting to remove doubts. The law governing the confidentiality requirements of the Central Bank is clear, it is subject to extremely strict confidentiality requirements set out in section 16 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, and subsequent amendments.  Under pain of severe penalties no former or current governor, director or officer of the bank may disclose information about the business of individual persons or entities to third parties other than in exceptional circumstances, which are specified in the legislation.  These exceptional circumstances <i>inter alia</i> allow for the provision of information as required by a court in connection with any criminal proceedings.  Further, non-disclosure requirements in the Central Bank Acts is subject to the rider that disclosure is permissible to enable the bank to carry out its functions under the Central Bank Acts, 1942 to 1997, which will include exchange control regulations.  The exceptional circumstances do not include proceedings before a tribunal because those proceedings are and cannot under the Constitution be criminal proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has consulted the Department of Finance concerning the implications of Deputy Upton's amendment for the Central Bank of Ireland.  I understand the Department of Finance consulted the Office of the Attorney General which has advised it would not be possible to comply with paragraph (a) of the amendment as it would entail a serious breach of European law.  Article 12 of the first Council Directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure that the Central Bank maintains very strict confidentiality.  The Directive, while prescribing certain exceptions, does not permit the proceedings of the tribunal to come within the exceptions prescribed.  The amendment also purports to provide in paragraph (b) that a person can be required to disclose information to a tribunal notwithstanding any rule of law or enactment providing that such information may only be disclosed in connection with criminal proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> It is strange we are asked to accept an amendment that would remove a doubt which does not exist.  In any event if such a rule of law were to be overridden as suggested, it would fly in the face of our European Union obligations.  The amendment appears to demonstrate a certain lack of appreciation of the role and function of tribunals and the law in relation to them.  A tribunal is an inquisitorial body and is not a court of law.  Clearly proceedings before any tribunal are not criminal proceedings.  Tribunals cannot impose sanctions.  For a tribunal to have a person before it comply with its orders, it would have to apply to the High Court for enforcement of its orders and, where criminal proceedings before the courts are concerned, which arise out of proceedings before a tribunal, it is in those proceedings that disclosure of information by banks may arise.  It is wrong to suggest, as this amendment does, that proceedings before a tribunal are criminal when clearly they are not.  It is wrong to suggest the law allows disclosure by banks of an individual's business in tribunal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill is confined to amending the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts of 1921 and 1979.  Should Deputies be concerned about the law as it operates under the Central Bank Act or Acts in relation to the disclosure of information I suggest those concerns be addressed in the appropriate way to the Minister for Finance, who has responsibility for those Acts and the financial institutions generally?  For the reasons outlined the amendment cannot be supported.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and his guidance on the finer points of drafting amendments.  We all learn a little every day and it would be foolish, short-sighted and simple-minded of me not to learn the art of amendment production.  I will take account of that.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 November 1997 states: &ldquo;The Central Bank is expected to challenge the legal authority of the tribunal to investigate its supervision of the Guinness Mahon Bank in Dublin and the extent of its knowledge of Ansbacher accounts, according to reliable Bank sources&rdquo;.  That is the reason this amendment was put down.  I am aware that reliable bank sources are not infallible and legal challenges may succeed or fail, but there is cause for concern when the Central Bank specifies its intentions in this regard.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Minister would accept the amendment, even if it is modified, to remove doubts about the provisions of the Central Bank Act regarding the disclosure of what may be fundamentally important information.  It would be a great pity if the tribunal proceedings came unstuck or alternatively &mdash; this is a greater possibility &mdash;if it got bogged down in a turgid visit to the court, as happened day in day out during the Goodman tribunal.  I am anxious that should not happen and that is the purpose behind the amendment.  I hope the Minister will reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I support the thrust of the amendment.  The putting together of proper procedures for tribunals is a gradual process, and this is another stage in that process.  If we are serious about getting the truth in a tribunal we must remove all obstacles to establishing that truth.  We must not allow for subterfuge, shelter or evasion. In the last tribunal the Central Bank was not glorified. The Moriarty tribunal is to set down recommendations, rules and procedures relating to the bank and other financial institutions.  I have expressed the hope that the Central Bank will be called in to give details of its performance in regard to the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the absolute right to Cabinet confidentiality was removed.  Certain procedures were set down whereby Cabinet confidentiality may be set aside.  In effect, we have gone to the heart of decision-making and set aside a time-honoured procedure, yet the edifice of the Central Bank is left intact.  We are not trying to prise open every case.  It is not a case of going into the archives and digging out information for spurious reasons or for the sake of inquisitiveness.  We are talking about such information as may be required by a court or tribunal, about rare circumstances. When trying to establish the truth about a serious matter of public concern, there should be no exceptions.  Leaving aside the comments about drafting, I wholeheartedly support the thrust of the proposal put forward by Deputies Upton and Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from the expression on the Minister's face he finds Deputy Upton's parliamentary draftsmanship sloppy beyond contemplation. I would ask him to set that aside and deal with the net point of the amendment.  Will he consider the following proposition?  Suppose that a tribunal of inquiry was set up into a matter of alleged wrongdoing and in the course of the inquiry the tribunal discovered the existence of offshore deposits to the tune of £38 million.  If the tribunal was of the opinion that there was a flagrant breach of a number of laws dealing with exchange controls and tax evasion which ought to be inquired into, the Oireachtas decided a further tribunal should be established for that purpose and the Central Bank of the day was called before the tribunal to give evidence, is the Minister saying the Central Bank could plead under the Central Bank Act that it need not answer reasonable questions of the tribunal such as how it escaped its attention that such deposits could be organised offshore, arguably for illegal purposes, certainly for purposes of minimising tax liability either by tax evasion, breach of exchange controls or whatever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Justice Brian McCracken observed that some of these moneys might conceivably be abroad for a legal reason, but he made clear that other moneys in the account are manifestly not there for normal commercial purposes.  Is the Minister saying it is acceptable that the Central Bank should not explain to the tribunal how that state of affairs came about <Col N="885" /> under its supervision, that under the Central Bank Act it does not have to answer that question?  If he believes that is not acceptable, as most citizens believe is the case, he should take on board Deputy Upton's amendment.  I am sure his officials, who have tremendous experience of the various Acts that have led us into the House tonight, will get the wording right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal has been asked to make broad recommendations to enhance the role and performance of the Central Bank as a regulator of banks and financial services generally, but how can it adequately address that question if it is not allowed investigate the manner in which the Central Bank supervised the behaviour of Guinness Mahon in terms of the Ansbacher accounts?  I would have thought that would be essential background information in making recommendations.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude to this matter.  The public is already close to saturation point in relation to tribunals and if we go down the road of citing law cases and all the rest of it and this becomes a third, difficult tribunal, it will undermine the capacity of tribunals to undertake the tasks for which they were established.</P>

      <P>Acceptance of Deputy Upton's amendment would be in flagrant breach <Col N="886" /> of European law.  Article 12 of the First Council Directive on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relative to taking up or pursuing the business of credit institutions requires the State to ensure that the Central Bank maintains very strict confidentiality.</P>
      <P>It is entirely wrong for a Member to suggest that in my not accepting the amendment, there is some attempt, covert or overt, to prevent criminal investigations since the opposite is the truth. Section 16(1) of the Central Bank Act, l989 states:</P>
      <P>A person, who at the commencement of this section is, or at any time thereafter is appointed, Governor or a Director, officer or servant of the Bank or who is employed by the Bank in any other capacity, shall not disclose, during his term of office of employment or at any time thereafter, any information concerning&mdash;</P>

      <P>The facts are simply as I have outlined them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the continuing debate on the Ansbacher account, at this point, surely it must be of some interest to somebody that Mr. Justice McCracken found that the Ansbacher account certainly held funds for the benefit of Irish residents, and that the holding of those accounts was not <i>prima facie</i> evidence that any law had been broken.  A very serious legal question arises as to the premise or basis on which one could establish a tribunal of inquiry into a matter in respect of <Col N="887" /> which there was no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing.  I fully accept this is something which may be quite unacceptable, but it must be faced. In any event, the Bill before the House relates to certain matters concerning costs, immunities and enforcements, to the strengthening of the power of two eminent tribunals of inquiry and does not relate to extending the terms of reference of any tribunal which cannot engage in such an activity even if it wanted.</P>
    <P>The facts are as I have outlined them.  I cannot put the case any stronger than I have already.  If those facts are unpalatable, I can understand that but I cannot understand why incontrovertible facts cannot be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss.  The Minister has not dealt with the points raised.  The issue is whether having those deposits effectively offshore, was in breach of exchange controls.  The simple question being put to the Minister is if the tribunal is entitled to inquire into that, even in so far as it relates just to Mr. Charles Haughey &mdash; leaving out the red herring about seeking to extend the terms of reference of the tribunal, which is not the issue here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be the issue.  Let us just deal with it as it relates to Mr. Charles Haughey.  Is it the Minister's opinion that, even if it were found that these moneys were held offshore in breach of exchange controls, the Governor of the Central Bank, or whoever appears on his behalf at the tribunal, is precluded, as a result of the confidentiality clause the Minister has read into the record, from answering the reasonable inquiries of the tribunal?  I hope that net point is understood.  Perhaps the Central Bank itself has found only now that these moneys were offshore in breach of exchange controls. Leaving aside the business of broadening the terms of reference, is the Minister saying that, even though they were held offshore in breach of the law, the Governor of the Central Bank cannot answer questions because of the confidentiality imposed by the relevant section of that Central Bank Act.  I would appreciate an answer to that.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious as everybody else that the tribunal dealing with this matter gets to the full truth.  If there is a breach of the law in relation to accounts held, the tribunal may investigate that but Deputy Rabbitte is operating from the hypothesis that there definitely was a breach of the law.  Then, the problem is as I have outlined it.  The difficulty is that, whether we like it or not, Mr. Justice McCracken found that the Ansbacher account held funds for the benefit of Irish residents&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am grateful to your office for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. My Parliamentary Question No. 91 of 20 November 1997 asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the special measures, if any, which would be taken to attract inward investment to County Cavan; if her attention had been drawn to the fact that a number of centres throughout the county need new employment opportunities; if a special effort will be made to create much needed employment in County Cavan in view of the difficulties Border counties had endured in the past 28 years; if she will instruct her Department and the industrial development agencies to undertake special promotional <Col N="889" /> programmes to ensure that County Cavan would obtain at an early date some of the welcome inward investment coming to this country; and if she will make a statement on the matter. The Tánaiste replied that she intended to actively implement the Government's policy of regional industrial development and job dispersal. I welcomed the Tánaiste's statement that regional development is now a primary industrial objective.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to renew my appeal to the Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the State development agencies to give special consideration to the needs of the Border region, particularly County Cavan.  Fortunately for this country, there has been substantial inward investment recently but, unfortunately, none has come to my county or constituency.</P>
      <P>The information age offers this country an enormous opportunity to enhance our economic future, and that opportunity needs to be properly grasped.  All regions of the country deserve to benefit from such opportunities as new technologies can be used to encourage economic activity, particularly in rural areas such as Cavan. IDA Ireland has made provision for the construction of an advance factory of 23,000 square feet near Cavan town and this is a welcome measure.</P>
      <P>Cavan, with a population of 53,000, is predominantly an agricultural county.  Its industrial base is built around the indigenous food sector which represents the largest sector of manufacturing employment.  The development of the county's economic potential has been impeded in the past due to a number of factors, including over-dependency on primary agricultural activities, lack of inward investment, absence of suitable work space and industrial buildings and a negative perception due to its Border location.  With our heavy reliance on agriculture, quota restrictions and other measures to control production will have a negative effect on employment in the county.  Rationalisation in the dairy co-operative sector and other areas continues to have a negative impact on the performance of our traditional secondary industries which represent the core industrial base of Cavan.  Consequently, effective measures are necessary now to meet the future labour market needs of the county.</P>
      <P>Cavan has had limited investment over the past 15 years from international mobile corporations. In fact, no inward investment of any consequence has come to the area in more than ten years.  The area is thus entirely dependent on local entrepreneurship and indigenous development generally. Foreign investment, accounting for 27 per cent of the county's manufacturing employment, is substantially below the State average of 46 per cent.  This limits the potential for development in the sub-supply sector of the local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cavan has suffered socially and economically as a result of the negative impact of more than 25 years of troubles in the North.  Cross-Border trade and inward investment have been seriously curtailed and the development of our natural <Col N="890" /> resources, particularly tourism, was undermined in those years.  All too often in the past we were told by Governments and State agencies that it was particularly difficult to attract industry to the Border region.  With the cessation of violence in the North, we in County Cavan and others deserve the economic dividend of the establishment of peace.  Our people need work and they want those employment opportunities in their own county.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a new advance factory is being constructed near Cavan town, and I appeal to the Tánaiste, the Minister of State and the industrial development agencies to market that facility as vigorously as possible.  I hope that a project providing employment in the information technology or knowledge industries will be attracted to that site.</P>
    <P>A number of towns in the county need new job opportunities.  Another advance factory should be provided in the county and such a facility should be constructed to European Union food standards. The county has a strong and highly regarded tradition in the food industry and a town like Killeshandra, which is synonymous with the dairy industry, should be chosen for such a facility.  Obviously, there will be further opportunities to develop our food industry and centres such as Killeshandra should be targeted and marketed in that direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sincerely thank Deputy Smith for giving me the opportunity to debate this important issue.  Our Department intends to continue to actively implement the Government's policy of regional industrial development and job dispersal.  This is now a primary industrial policy objective and, in this regard, IDA Ireland and Forbairt are making renewed efforts to encourage new inward investment in Cavan.</P>
      <P>As part of these efforts, IDA Ireland has swapped several of its smaller sites and factory units in the county, which over time have not facilitated the attraction of inward investment, with Cavan County Council in return for approximately 40 acres of the council's landbank near Cavan town, the capital of the Deputy's county. IDA Ireland has now undertaken a comprehensive site development programme.  This includes major site levelling works, the provision of a new access road network and further ancillary works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To underline its commitment to refocus new inward investment in County Cavan, IDA Ireland has arranged for an advance factory of 23,000 square feet to be constructed by private investors on the Cavan town site.  Planning permission has been granted by Cavan County Council and construction of the new facility is now under way, with completion anticipated by mid-1998 at the latest.  Promotion of the new advance factory by IDA Ireland has already commenced in this regard.  IDA Ireland will continue to actively promote <Col N="891" /> regional locations, including County Cavan, for new overseas investment.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is also seeking to win new inward investment from overseas food processing companies for County Cavan, with counties Louth and Monaghan, which are well placed to take advantage of current opportunities in the convenience food sector.  The Deputy will be aware of the Government's decision to designate seven counties for special capital allowances for the hotel industry and other tourism facilities in the budget.  That will continue to be the type of policy we will pursue to ensure an equalisation of investment opportunities for counties such as Cavan.</P>
    <P>To date, more than 30 companies have been assisted through a number of pan-Atlantic partnership programmes, such as the Forbairt-IFI North American partnership programme, the US-sponsored Forbairt administered AMBIT programme and the Forbairt SBA programme.  A range of such alliances, including joint ventures and technology transfers, are currently being explored or negotiated and their successful outcomes will help accelerate the growth of local companies, with its attendant employment opportunities in the medium term.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Smith's contribution.  He has a major interest in industrial development in County Cavan and one of its adjoining counties, as have the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and his colleagues. I know Deputy Smith has a particular interest in information technology facilities which we believe will provide major assistance to further ensure equal opportunities for rural and urban areas.  As a result of many of the initiatives we have taken and proposals we have put forward to the European Commission, we are confident we will be able to harness some of those opportunities for rural as well as urban areas in the years ahead.  I am also confident that given the efforts we have made County Cavan will be a beneficiary in at least the medium term.</P>

I take this opportunity to express the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party to Private Laura Guerin and her family and to the other four soldiers and their families in respect of the injuries sustained in an explosion at Kilworth Camp in Cork last night.  It is devastating for Private Laura Guerin to have been involved in an accident with such consequences. I hope she gets all the care, medical and otherwise, in the short and long-term which the Defence Forces can offer her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The men and women of our Defence Forces face a challenge of growing complexity in their <Col N="892" /> home and international duties.  Training for the Defence Forces is critical to prepare our soldiers for their peacekeeping duties as well as their defence work at home.  I pay tribute to the contribution the Defence Forces make to this country, but it is not enough just to pay tribute to them. That must be matched by the necessary financial resources and backup agreed in this House.</P>
    <P>While it would be impossible to remove the danger in such work, one hopes that no personnel would be subject to unnecessary risks.  Our armed forces should have adequate support services and the most modern and effective equipment to carry out their critical role.  The new policy of continuous recruitment must be put into action if morale is not only to be maintained but to be improved at this time of major change in the Defence Forces.  Members of the Defence Forces over the years have taken heroic action on behalf of this country and they deserve our best support.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give us whatever information he has on this incident and to report back to the House on the full report as soon as he can. I hope any questions that arise from that report will be immediately addressed.</P>

I am not aware of the stage of the investigation into yesterday's explosion, but I am concerned about a report on this evening's news which referred to a mishap in the Glen of Imaal yesterday. We are led to believe that the weapon and ammunition involved were similar to those used in Kilworth.  Have there been other mishaps with the use of that ammunition in the recent past?  I ask the Minister to consider prohibiting the use of that weapon and ammunition until the cause of that accident can be established.  I look forward to the Minister giving a full report on that incident to the House on completion of the investigation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Timmins for raising this matter this evening and providing me with an opportunity to report on the incident which occurred at Kilworth firing range last night. I take this opportunity to wish the soldier who was seriously injured in that unfortunate incident a speedy recovery and to say how much I regret that an incident like that should have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At approximately 18.00 hours on 9 December 1997 at Kilworth firing range an accident occurred during firing practice with a 60 mm light mortar.  The exercise was being conducted by the Defence Forces personnel of the Southern Command. During the firing of a high explosive mortar bomb an explosion occurred in the vicinity of the gun position resulting in injuries to five personnel. Immediate medical attention was rendered to those injured. <Col N="893" /> The most seriously injured of the personnel, Laura Guerin, was admitted by military ambulance to Cork University Hospital at 7.05 p.m. The four other personnel who were injured were transported by military ambulance and were admitted to the General Military Hospital, Cork, at 8 p.m. approximately.  Three of the four persons who were admitted to the General Military Hospital suffered abrasions and were discharged from hospital at 12.15 p.m. today.  The fourth soldier who was also admitted to the General Military Hospital had no physical injuries and was detained overnight for observation.  He, too, was discharged from hospital at 12.15 p.m. today.</P>
    <P>Laura Guerin who was admitted to Cork University Hospital suffered a serious injury to her left arm and underwent surgery last night.  She is still in hospital and her condition is described as comfortable.  I took the opportunity earlier today to speak on the telephone to her father, who is retired from honourable service in the Army and I expressed to him my sympathy, that of the Government and this House on what has happened. All those discharged are due for medical review next week in the General Military Hospital, Cork.</P>
    <P>The military authorities initiated an immediate investigation into this incident.  Military police and ordnance personnel were dispatched immediately to the scene at Kilworth.  The site was preserved overnight and the investigation was recommenced at 7.30 this morning.  The investigation is being carried out by the assistant provost marshal of the Southern Command.  He is being assisted by explosive ordnance disposal personnel and engineer special search team personnel.  A platoon of soldiers is also on hand to assist as required.</P>
    <P>In accordance with established Defence Forces procedures following a serious injury or loss of life, a court of inquiry has been established which will inquire into the incident and will make recommendations on all relevant procedures relating to the firing of the weapon.  While this inquiry will be exhaustive and detailed, requiring the input of specialists, preliminary inquiries have already established that the weapon and ammunition in use at the time had been inspected within the last month and found to be serviceable.</P>
    <P>While the details of this incident are the subject of an investigation which was immediately initiated, I am satisfied that adequate precautions were taken during the training of the personnel involved.  Safety procedures for military exercises are continually reviewed and the current regulations were in place during this exercise.  These regulations provide for the testing of personnel in basic skills before firing.  They include safety precautions and misfire drills.  Pending the outcome of the court of inquiry, no firing exercises using the weapon type involved in this accident will be conducted by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy Timmins, from a preliminary inquiry I made in relation to the incident in the Glen of Imaal it appears to have <Col N="894" /> been a freak development and thankfully it did not result in any injury.  I am as anxious as the two Deputies to get the final report and I assure the House that any steps that are necessary in the course of training to ensure even greater safety precautionary measures will be undertaken.  I give a commitment to the House in that regard.  It is another telling testimony to the risks sometimes undertaken by people in our name so that they will be best equipped to face the challenges presented to them at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of extreme regret to me that I am reporting to the House on an incident such as this and I hope we will not have a repeat of it ever again.  I will make sure that whatever steps are necessary will be taken.  I assure the House that when I have the final report I will immediately make it public.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House at this late hour to address this issue. I have not yet had an opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture. I am sure he is delighted that the geography of my constituency does not require me to raise items pertaining to his Department.  I wish him well.</P>
      <P>The issue I wish to highlight is the financial crisis in the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  The DSPCA is a registered charity, established in 1840, which is part and parcel of the fabric of Dublin.  Dubliners all over the city are familiar with the work of the DSPCA over the past century and a half.  The society now faces a financial crisis and is appealing to the Government, through me and others, particularly Dublin Deputies, for support in the form of an annual subvention.  Such funding would bring this wonderful society into the next century and beyond.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the vital services the society provides in terms of animal care in this city, among which is an animal ambulance service.  There is an increasing incidence in the city of people mistreating animals; in my own constituency, dogs fight other dogs while 30 men look on and place bets.  Sick animals who suffer ongoing cruelty must be looked after and it is the DSPCA to which people turn for advice.  Last year the DSPCA looked after 286 lame and injured wild horses.  Those horses could have caused untold damage on the city's roads.</P>
      <P>The society deals with more than 100 calls a day from the public with people simply wanting to know how animals should be treated.  At Christmas time every year animals are bought for children but these are subsequently discarded after a period.  The DSPCA intervenes to protect and provide shelter for those animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The organisation is undergoing rapid increases in expenditure.  In 1994 its expenditure stood at £266,000; in 1995 it was £259,000 and in 1996 there was a massive increase to £298,000.  The <Col N="895" /> society spent almost £300,000 last year protecting the animals of this city.  It cannot meet that kind of expenditure and that is why it is seeking a subvention from the Government.  I am aware the Government did provide a once off grant of £50,000 to the society last year.  That is not enough; we need to put this funding on a statutory basis if possible.</P>
    <P>If this charitable organisation goes to the wall, which it inevitably will if the Government does not take action, the State will have to intervene to establish a new service to protect the city's animals. Additional costs will be incurred unless funding is provided for the DSPCA.  The DSPCA will close very soon unless it gets a cash injection from the Government.  The society is already considering voluntary redundancies and much of the on-line services it provides will cease to be provided. I appeal to the Minister to consider this organisation.  In a booming economy, it is time we put some resources into this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hayes for raising this matter.  Let me, in the spirit of graciousness which he displayed, welcome him to the House.  Like me, the Deputy has been a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on 3 December last, I recognise the extremely valuable work done by the DSPCA.  It carries out work which would otherwise have to be carried out by the State.  The society is a reputable organisation which has been in existence for more than 150 years.</P>
      <P>I am an animal lover as are the vast majority of Irish people.  There is a need for a society such as the DSPCA to look after animals which stray, are badly treated or afflicted with wanton cruelty. Some people regard cruel sports as enjoyable and they bet on these from time to time.  That is illegal and must be condemned.</P>
      <P>The DSPCA does exceptional work and I cannot praise it sufficiently.  I was absolutely amazed, when I contacted local authorities in Dublin, at the number of wandering horses in the city.  In many cases, these horses are badly maintained, improperly fed and have a great deal of cruelty inflicted on them.  I assisted in developing the Cherry Orchard Project which I hope will benefit the animals' welfare and that of young people who enjoy equine pursuits.  Although a small one, I hope that pilot project will lead to valuable development work in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The DSPCA is a voluntary organisation and assistance is provided to it from time to time by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I understand that grants totalling £100,000 have already been paid to the society by the Department since September 1995.  The society raises quite substantial amounts of money from other sources.  I do not want to see any office closing down or any people losing jobs.  I am pursuing the question of providing further assistance for the society, I look forward to doing so if resources <Col N="896" /> permit and if I receive approval from the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This has not been a good night in relation to closures and I hope the Minister can reverse that trend.  I have been contacted by many parents in the Shranamoragh area near Ballycroy in County Mayo.  Shranamoragh is a disadvantaged area which has a church and schools but no industry or employment.</P>
      <P>It is a rural village which depends on the post office, the public house, the church and the school.  I have received telephone calls from past pupils of the school in America and London asking that I and the other public representatives in the area ensure the school is not closed at Christmas.</P>
      <P>The school principal has been appointed to be a remedial teacher in Achill.  A temporary teacher has been appointed and negotiations have been taking place between the Department of Education and Science, the management board and the local priest.  The parents concerned have contacted me because they do not wish the school to be closed.  They believe it would be a retrograde step for the Ballycroy area.</P>
      <P>The Minister and this Government gave major commitments before the election, some of which will be honoured in the new year.  The Minister promised that no school would be closed and that any school with ten pupils or more would be allocated a second teacher.  This school has 14 pupils. The Government also made major commitments to invest in rural areas and revitalise them.  I do not intend to get annoyed with the Minister tonight because I hope this matter can be resolved now.  If not, I will raise it again at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I am due to attend a public meeting with the parents tomorrow night to which local representatives have been invited to hear their views.  The parents who contacted me said they were opposed to the closure of the school.  They want it to be left open and seek the appointment of a principal teacher.  They also want the Minister, in his budget for 1998, to appoint a second teacher to the school.  The reply I received from the Department last week was that the Department was conducting negotiations with the board of management and the local priest.  However, the priest, who is a friend of mine, might only be in that parish for a few years before being moved to another parish.  He will not be there forever unlike the parents and the local population.  We are trying to entice young families to live in Ballycroy, particularly emigrants in England, and the closure of the national school in the area will send the wrong message to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the board of management he will not close the school, to give a commitment that he will appoint a new principal and a second teacher in the new year and give this <Col N="897" /> school the status it requires.  It is important that Ballycroy does not lose this school.  There is only a public house, post office and community hall in the area.  There is no industry and the Garda station is manned only for an hour each day.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have good news.  I do not doubt that when he gave commitments on rural schools before the election he intended to honour them.  I hope this matter will be concluded and that we will not have to return to it again before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it gives me an opportunity to clarify the position of the school in question.  Schools such as this are in difficulty with decreasing enrolments because of the failure of previous Ministers to utilise demographic dividends and to come to the assistance of small schools such as this through the appointment of a second teacher.  It was when I, in Opposition, made an issue of one and two teacher schools that it was catapulted to the top of the political agenda.  I brought a focus to their plight for the first time.  The Government intends to deal with the issue in the context of the staffing schedule for the 1998-99 year, when there will be leeway in terms of resources.</P>
      <P>This school is located about 12 miles north of Mulranny.  It was built in 1962 at a time when there were 95 pupils on the roll.  It became a one teacher school in 1987 and since then the enrolment has gradually declined to the point where there are 14 pupils enrolled in the current school year.  There are now only six families with children attending the school.</P>
      <P>Under the existing staffing schedule an enrolment of 14 pupils would entitle the school to a staffing of principal teacher only.  The principal teacher of the school concerned recently resigned and has taken up a teaching position elsewhere. Pending examination of the future viability of the school, my Department has sanctioned the appointment of a replacement teacher, on a temporary basis, to replace the former principal.  In the circumstances, and in view also of the steady decline in enrolments in recent years, it was considered appropriate to consider the longer term future of the school at this stage.</P>
      <P>Following discussions and an in-depth evaluation, the chairperson of the board of management, the board and parents indicated to my Department that they were generally agreeable to the transfer of the pupils to another school in the parish.  This agreement was subject to putting in place suitable transport for the pupils concerned. The chairperson of the board has provided a list of pupils who would be seeking transport to the other school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school transport section of my Department has been asked, as a matter of urgency, to report <Col N="898" /> on the position of transport and the school authorities will be notified of the outcome as soon as possible.  The crucial issue is to ensure that permanent arrangements are in place which will be agreeable to and in the best interests of the local community.</P>
    <P>This Government will put in place a range of proposals which will support the position of small rural schools.  I have already ensured that 24 two teacher schools, including five in Mayo, which were due to lose one of their teachers this September, as a result of the staffing schedule approved by the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 45, 46 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>On 10 July, 14 October and 13 November 1997 I briefed the House on revelations by the UK authorities that radioactive material had been dumped in the Irish Sea and elsewhere around the coast of the United Kingdom in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  An archival search by the UK revealed that dumping had taken place at a number of locations including Beaufort's Dyke, the Holyhead Deep, the Firth of Forth, the North Sea, the Firth of Clyde, and off the Isle of Arran. In addition, a number of instances were identified where liquid wastes containing small amounts of radioactivity were dumped at sea.  These instances occurred in the North Sea, the Firth of Forth, Liverpool Bay and, possibly, Morcambe Bay and the Humber Estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then, on 24 November 1997, the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Dr. Jack Cunningham MP wrote to advise me that the UK National Radiological Protection Board had published the results of its independent assessment of the dumping of radioactive waste. On the same day a delegation of senior officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the NRPB travelled to Dublin to brief officials of my Department, the Radiological Protection <Col N="900" /> Institute of Ireland and members of the task force which I established on radioactive dumping.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that all the past dumpings which were identified during the searches of records would give rise to maximum doses well within the International Commission on Radiological Protection's recommended dose limit for members of the public.</P>
    <P>The NRPB report gives rise to some concern. It states, for example, that potentially high doses could arise from the dumping of sludge in Liver-pool Bay or from the return of two anti-static devices dumped off the Isle of Arran on the southwest coast of Scotland.  Nevertheless, the report considers that the risk of exposure to these doses is extremely low.  In the case of the anti-static devices, the UK authorities have informed me that they envisage advising fishermen and relevant organisations on the steps that should be taken by anyone who suspects they have encountered one of these devices.</P>
    <P>In view of this I immediately instructed the task force to carry out a comprehensive examination of the NRPB report and to liaise closely with the NRPB on any issues or questions arising.  I want the task force to satisfy itself that all the issues of potential public concern have been addressed.</P>
    <P>I have kept both the House and the general public advised of all the information I have received on this matter.  I note the UK authorities have adopted a similar approach and that the recent report of the NRPB has been published.  It is my intention that the report of the task force will also be published, along with a clear statement by me of the action, if any, I intend to take in the light of its findings.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the level of co-operation I have received from the UK authorities since these incidents of dumping were first reported in July.  As I previously advised the House, I travelled to London to met the Minister Dr. Cunningham shortly after details of the dumping were first made public and he has kept me up to date with developments since then.  In addition my Department has been in constant touch with the UK authorities and a number of meetings has taken place between Irish and UK officials both here and in England.  I consider that the continuing co-operation between Ireland and the UK at political, official and scientific levels is significantly contributing to the process of bringing all facts on this issue into the open.</P>

The overall aim of the strategic plan is to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to the national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>A vigorous forestry programme is currently being undertaken by my Department to achieve these aims.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to brief the House on the forthcoming Fisheries Council.  The critical item on the agenda next week will be the annual negotiations on the total allowable catches.  The EU Commission has tabled its proposals for 1998 in light of latest scientific recommendations and assessments of the state of the stocks.</P>
      <P>The detailed scientific advice in relation to a number of fish stocks is extremely pessimistic. The Commission has followed the advice in its own recommendations for significant cuts in the TACs of most stocks in order to let the stocks build back up or even to prevent collapse.  The context within which we are working to maximise Irish fishing possibilities next year is therefore very difficult.  I am working closely with the fishing industry, which has been fully briefed on the proposals, to negotiate the best possible deal for Ireland in the Council.  My overall objective in these difficult and tough negotiations will be to maximise the fishing possibilities for Ireland next year, while ensuring that conservation objectives are met through the setting of sustainable TACs, geared to protecting the long-term viability of stocks.  Council will have to seek to strike the right balance between biological and economic imperatives that is to secure the future of stocks while providing realistic economic opportunities for the fishing industry next year.  The achievement of the balance will be very difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other major items on the agenda are proposals for the allocation, for the first time, of national quotas for horse mackerel and bluefin tuna.  First <Col N="902" /> time allocation of quotas is usually based on the relative track record of each member state, over a number of years.  Since the allocation key will stand for future years, it is therefore critical that Ireland gets the best achievable allocation first time around.  Ireland has a significant catch record over recent years in the horse mackerel fishery but does not have any significant recorded catches of bluefin tuna.</P>
    <P>The horse mackerel fishery is increasingly important for the pelagic segment of the fishing industry and I will be seeking a quota for Ireland to reflect our catch trends.  It is also, however, a very important fishery for a number of other member states who will equally be fighting to get the best possible deal for their fishermen.  There will be a very tough battle at Council to maximise the share for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In relation to bluefin tuna, the position is that the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has recommended a 25 per cent reduction on catches of bluefin tuna to protect stocks.  It is against this background that a first time share out of this stock in Community waters will be discussed.  While we do not have any real track record to date for bluefin tuna to support an individual quota for Ireland, there is a growing level of interest in the industry in this high value fishery reflected in a pilot programme of technology transfer with Japanese interests last summer.  I intend to pursue at Council the setting aside of a reasonable &ldquo;unallocated&rdquo; quota which would allow several member states including Ireland without individual quota to fish against this unallocated quota.  There will doubtless be strong opposition in Council, from member states with significant track records, to the setting aside of any &ldquo;unallocated&rdquo; quota but we will be working with likeminded member states to overcome this opposition.</P>
    <P>The agenda for Council will also include a formal signing off on the EU Norwegian fisheries agreement for 1998.  The annual negotiations with Norway concluded last week.  The 1998 overall mackerel TAC has been set at 484,000 tonnes which gives Ireland an additional 10,000 tonnes next year.  This is good news for the Irish pelagic fleet.  In addition, under sustained pressure by Ireland, Norway's share of the blue whiting stocks in western waters has been cut by 10,000 tonnes for 1998.  This will give scope for the Irish industry to further develop this promising fishery in 1998. I am satisfied that we have achieved a good deal for Irish fishermen in these negotiations.  The industry representatives have welcomed the package which will certainly improve the outlook for the Irish pelagic catching and processing industry next year.</P>
    <P>This will be a tough Council and I do not underestimate the difficult challenges of delivering on our objective to maximise fishing opportunities for 1998 for the Irish industry.  As I have said I am liaising very closely with the industry on our negotiating stance.  The House can be assured of my full commitment to getting the best <Col N="903" /> deal possible for the Irish fishing industry next week.</P>

      <P>A stock management programme which involves the removal of predators (including pike) from the western lakes is a key element of the EU-assisted development programme which is designed to restore the lakes as prime wild brown trout fisheries.  The EU Commission has been kept fully informed of developments on this project, which is funded under the tourism angling measure of the Tourism Operational Programme.  The development programme began in 1995, and to date over IR£1.2 million has been approved for the western lakes project.</P>
      <P>The primary objective of the investment programme is to reverse the significant decline in brown trout stocks in these lakes.  It is estimated that game angling visitors to the lakes could double over the next five years as a result of this development.  The Western Lakes Monitoring and Advisory Group, which comprises representatives of the Marine Institute, the Western Regional Fisheries Board and the game and coarse angling representatives, monitors and advises on the detailed implementation of the programme.</P>
      <P>In order to address concerns raised by pike anglers in relation to the stock management programme, an agreement was reached with their representatives which provides among other matters for the transfer of a number of pike to other suitable waters and for the promotion also of coarse angling in the western lakes.  The Department and the Central Fisheries Board have recently confirmed their commitment to the full implementation of that agreement, in light of re-emerging expressions of concern about the stock management programme.  A further review of the programme has been undertaken to ensure that all necessary systems are in place for its effective implementation.  I am confident that the valuable consensus reached on the project can be maintained. The Commission, which had raised a number of questions about the programme, has, for its part, recently indicated its agreement to the implementation strategies now in place.</P>
      <P>The western lakes project represents a real opportunity to restore the fisheries to their former glory with resultant economic benefit in terms of tourism angling jobs and revenue.  I look forward to its successful completion.</P>

      <P>A new register of fishing vessels was established in December, 1989, pursuant to the Merchant Shipping (Registry, Lettering and Numbering of Fishing Boats) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 344 of 1989).  All owners of fishing vessels were obliged to apply to the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources within six months to have their vessels registered.</P>
      <P>I can confirm for the Deputy an application for registration under the 1989 regulations was duly received from the owner of the vessel in question in March 1990.  In making the application the owner indicated that a new engine had been installed in the vessel.  The Department subsequently advised the owner that in order to finalise registration the capacity of the vessel's new engine would have to be verified.  The Department has written to the owner of the vessel on three occasions between 1990 and 1993 requesting that the engine capacity be verified by the Marine Survey Office.  No reply has been received to date.  It will not be possible to progress the registration application until the necessary information relating to the engine is supplied by the owner and verified.  As soon as that information is supplied the process of registration will be reactivated.</P>

      <P>As I outlined to the House on 13 November 1997, the Investigation of Marine Accidents Policy Review Group was established in November, 1996 to review the existing policy, procedures and legislative framework for maritime casualty investigations in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The group is being chaired by Mr. Vincent Power, and the membership includes representatives of my Department, including the Marine Survey Office and the Irish marine emergency Service, as well as persons with relevant knowledge and experience in accident investigation and from the legal and maritime professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of this group is an expression of the importance which my Department attaches to tackling this issue.  The policy aim underpinning the review is to put in place a modern casualty investigation system for Ireland, in accordance <Col N="905" /> with the highest international practice, which will provide greater clarity as to when such investigations shall be held, how they should be conducted and as to what their role and scope should be. It is my intention that this policy will meet the needs and expectations of the various interested parties in relation to casualty investigations.  I hope any problems encountered in carrying out previous casualty investigations, and any lessons learned, will be examined with a view to ensuring that the Department's procedures particularly concerning communication with bereaved families, the industry, media and other State agencies, are sensitive, clear and useful.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the chairman that the group have met on over 40 occasions and have conducted the most thorough and wide-ranging examination of maritime casualty investigation in Ireland.  I understand that another meeting is due to be held within the next week in order to finalise the report of the review group and that it is the chairman's intention to present their report to me by the end of this month.  The necessary arrangements will then be made by my Department in order to publish the report as soon as possible in the New Year.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the outcome of this review and can assure the Deputy that whatever recommendations arise from the group will be given urgent and full consideration by my Department.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland is forcing the pace at EU level in pressing to ensure that fisheries enforcement at sea and on land is implemented consistently by all member states in accordance with EU policy.  I agree with the views recently expressed by the chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation. Control must be rigorous, across the board and demonstrably evenhanded throughout EU waters.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied, frankly, with the standards of enforcement and the level of penalties elsewhere and I will continue to pursue with other member states and the Commission the need for firm action to put a stop to their boats committing offences in EU waters and our waters in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination of aerial surveillance and entry-exit reporting data enables increasingly accurate and effective targeting of illegal fishing activity by our patrol vessels and is providing a <Col N="906" /> detailed overview of both the patterns and levels of fishing activity in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>We have won agreement in the last few months to additional EU measures including the introduction of satellite monitoring together with &ldquo;realtime&rdquo; catch reporting from next year.  These will further enhance our ability to monitor and, deal with, illegal fishing activity in our waters.  I will continue to pursue at EU level enhanced control measures to protect fish stocks which are under increasing pressure.  I am determined to safeguard stocks and eliminate illegal fishing in our waters.  I expect no less from other member states and the Commission.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to inform the Deputy that negotiations between the EU and Norway have been concluded and the agreement reached addresses the concerns expressed in relation to the negotiations by the chief executive of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation.  The agreement provides for a 19 per cent increase in the total allowable catch of mackerel next year.  The additional quota for Ireland of 10,000 tonnes will give a significant boost to the Donegal based pelagic fleet.  In addition Ireland, has forced a reduction in Norway's share of the blue whiting stocks in western waters.  Ireland has consistently maintained that Norway, as a non EU member, should not benefit unduly from EU fish stocks in western waters.  This stand has been vindicated in this year's deal with Norway.  The additional quota for blue whiting which will be available in western waters next year will allow the Irish fleet to significantly increase its activity in this promising fishery.</P>
    <P>I am committed to working with the Irish fishing industry in our joint efforts to ensure that illegal fishing activity by vessels of other member states in our waters and elsewhere is vigorously tackled and that there is a level playing field for the Irish fishing industry <i>vis-a-vis</i> its European counterparts.  I welcome the industry's support for my agenda in this regard.</P>

    <P>The conservation and protection of fish stocks in Irish waters, with the aim of securing the future of the resource and the viabiity of the Irish fishing industry, is a key priority.  It is essential to ensure <Col N="907" /> also that the legitimate fishing activities of Irish vessels are not unlawfully impeded or their safety threatened.</P>
    <P>The objective of Irish sea fisheries protection and control, therefore, is to ensure that all vessels, including foreign vessels, fishing in Irish waters are strictly monitored and controlled.  To that end, there is an on-going process of consultation and liaison between my Department, the Department of Defence, the Naval Service and the Air Corps to ensure that the resources applied to fisheries protection, which have increased significantly in recent years with EU assistance are utilised to best effect.  The agencies concerned will continue to co-operate closely with a view to optimising the effectiveness of fisheries protection.</P>

      <P>EU Council Regulation 2847/93 is designed to ensure compliance with all the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy covering all operations from catching to the processor, transporter and consumer.  Control is an integral part of fisheries management which aims to conserve fish resources at a level which will ensure the long-term viability of the industry.</P>
      <P>Conservation of fish stocks is the overriding imperative and generally speaking the control and enforcement effort has, therefore, focused in considerable part on the EU catching sector to date.  I have already outlined to the House my view on the need to ensure that enforcement is delivered effectively and evenhandedly by all member states.  Control must be delivered by all member states right through the supply and demand chain at sea, on shore and at transport and market points.  I will press at EU level for all member states to tighten up on every stage of the control process right through to final destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall that following the revelation that dumping of radioactive waste had taken place in UK coastal waters, including the Irish Sea, in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, I announced the establishment of a task force to assess the information received from the UK Government and to advise on the extent and impact of all information becoming available and <Col N="909" /> the measures to ensure marine life and human health are fully protected.</P>
      <P>Since then the task force has held a number of meetings and has been engaged in a detailed examination and analysis of the information made available by the UK authorities.  Members of the task force have also been involved in bilateral contacts with the UK authorities with a view to seeking clarification and a mutual understanding in respect of the assessments on both sides of the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>Most recently, members of the task force, together with officials of my Department and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland were briefed in Dublin by a delegation of senior officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the UK National Radiological Protection Board on the results of the independent assessment carried out by the NRPB of the radiological implications of dumping in Beaufort's Dyke and elsewhere, which was published on 24 November 1997.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the NRPB report I immediately instructed the task force to carry out a comprehensive examination of the report and to liaise closely with the NRPB on any issues or questions arising.  The task force has since met to commence its assessment of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for safety of life at sea I am committed to achieving significant improvements in the area of fishing vessel safety.  To that end, I intend to implement the recommendations and objectives of the Fishing Vessel Safety Review Group to the greatest extent and with utmost speed which resources will permit.  Considerable progress has already been made in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety training is vital to protect the lives of fishing vessel crews and the Department has been working closely with BIM in order to ensure that new and more accessible training facilities are provided for fishermen at strategic locations around the coast.  Earlier this year BIM launched two mobile coastal training units for this very purpose and I understand that these facilities have already delivered basic safety training to around 250 fishermen.  Another significant development <Col N="910" /> in this regard is the establishment of a new fisheries training facility at Castletownbere.  BIM has also increased its safety skills instruction capacity through the recruitment of three additional training staff.</P>
    <P>The absence of mandatory social insurance cover for fishermen was highlighted by the review group as the reason for many trained deckhands leaving the fishing fleet.  This situation has since been addressed and share fishermen now qualify for full PRSI cover.</P>
    <P>I can also report progress in the area of on-shore marine radio communications.  The Department has installed new medium frequency transmitters at Belmullet and Rosslare which will enhance radio coverage and improve emergency response to fishing vessels operating off the north west coast and in the Irish Sea.  In addition, it is proposed to upgrade the Irish Marine Emergency Service radio communications network through the installation of VHF digital selective calling equipment at coast radio stations.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the modernisation of fishing vessels, I announced at the end of October an £11 million investment in the modernisation of the Irish fishing fleet.  This involved some £3 million in EU grant aid for 112 fleet modernisation projects under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99.  This investment is aimed primarily at the whitefish fleet to enhance safety on board vessels and will help maximise the return to fishermen and maintain jobs in the sector.</P>
    <P>I am also working to put in place, with EU agreement, a new grant aid scheme to support investment in new whitefish vessels.  I am also pursuing other options which will assist investment in the fleet notably to make the industry atractive to providers of capital by examining the scope for the provision of fiscal incentives.</P>
    <P>In addition, agreement has been effectively secured on Ireland's national programme under the EU Fleet programme 1997-2002, MGP IV. The MGP IV programme for Ireland provides that safety improvements may be excluded, on a case by case basis, from vessel tonnage calculations, for the purposes of the programme.  The objective is to ensure that vessel owners are not penalised for making safety improvements to their vessels.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended the introduction of comprehensive safety regulations for fishing vessels and their crews.  The necessary administrative and technical staffing resources to progress this considerable body of legislation are currently being put in place.  Three additional marine surveyors are expected to be appointed shortly and recruitment of an additional marine radio surveyor is under way.  These surveyors will afford the technical expertise required in the drafting of the safety regulations and in their subsequent enforcement by means of a strict inspection regime.</P>
    <P>The implementation of an overall safety strategy for the sea fishing sector will be steered by a fishing vessel safety management committee <Col N="911" /> which is in the process of being established.  A fishing vessel safety unit is also being set up within the Department to support the work of the committee and facilitate the development of a co-ordinated safety programme for the industry.</P>
    <P>A safety awareness campaign which will aim to highlight safety issues of particular relevance to fishermen is currently being developed by the Department.  Earlier this year the Department's marine safety working group published a series of safety brochures entitled Safety on the Water. This included a practical booklet on fishing vessel machinery failure, which is the main reason for emergency call-outs to fishing vessels in distress. Skippers of all fishing vessels on the register have been sent copies of this booklet for distribution to their crews.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry itself has a vital role to play in developing a safety culture among fishermen. Not least to inform the industry's own role and responsibilities it is clearly necessary to maintain ongoing dialogue with fishermen's organisations on safety.  Department officials had constructive discussions with industry representatives only last week on the implementation of recommendations in the report of the fishing vessel safety review group.</P>

      <P>I understand Ireland is not the only EU member state to which the European Commission has addressed complaints regarding their afforestation policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Ireland's position, the European Commission has lodged five complaints over the past five years on issues which include afforestation. Of the five, two relate to phosphorous pollution in lakes and a number of activities, of which afforestation is but one, are cited as being contributory factors.  A third relates to an aspect of Ireland's transposition of the EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment (85/33/EEC); that is the level at which EIA should be required for certain classes of projects, one of which is afforestation.  The remaining two relate solely to afforestation, one to the acidification effects of forestry in County Wicklow and one to damage alleged to have been caused to an Area of Scientific Interest in County Mayo.  These complaints are at various stages of investigation and response and may not of course be upheld.  I should also emphasise that it is a general condition of grant-aid that forestry development is compatible with the environment and a range of controls are in <Col N="912" /> place for the prevention of environmentally destructive afforestation.</P>

      <P>My six-point action plan is designed to ensure that the resources of the fisheries boards and of all relevant agencies are co-ordinated and deployed to best effect to deal with pollution, both by tackling its causes and by acting swiftly when it occurs.  The plan will include a mobile emergency response unit, an Inland Fisheries Forum to ensure regular co-ordination and information exchange on water quality issues between all involved bodies, the development of a code of practice, a review of pollution prevention and response strategies, a review of current penalties and investment in the laboratory services and equipment available to the fisheries boards.</P>
      <P>The Central Fisheries Board is actively progressing the various elements of the plan in consultation with the regional fisheries boards and all relevant players and agencies and is in the process of establishing a dedicated environmental co-ordination unit to advance this strategy.</P>
      <P>My overall objective is to ensure that resources are effectively deployed in the crucial tasks of pollution prevention, monitoring and incident response.  This requires a partnership approach across all the relevant agencies and sectors, to ensure that fisheries resources, and the habitats which support them, are protected and conserved. I am confident that I have the co-operation of all interested groups, including the farming organisations, in the task of delivering on these goals.</P>

      <P>The commercial value of an oilfield in the Irish Continental Shelf would depend on many factors, including: (i) the size of the field; (ii) the amount of oil technically recoverable; (iii) the productibility of the field; (iv) the nature of the oil; (v) duration of production; (vi) the distance of the field from land; (vii) the depth of water where it is located; (viii) the capital expenditure costs involved in bringing the field into production; (ix) operating expenditure costs; (x) the market price for oil (and associated gas) during <Col N="913" /> the life of the field; (xi) cost of money; and (xii) Corporation Tax.</P>
      <P>A present there are no oilfields in production in the Irish offshore and as no two oil fields are the same, it would not be possible to put a commercial value on a field which could be discovered in our offshore.</P>
      <P>An oil discovery of current interest is the Helvick Field off the Waterford coast.  A lease undertaking in respect of the field is held by Providence Resources plc.  The field is small and estimated to contain six million barrels of oil which are technically recoverable.  The manner in which the field might be brought into commercial production is currently being addressed by Providence in consultation with my Department.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, the Irish Fish Producers' Organisation is calling for tighter controls at the sales end of the chain to target illegally caught or &ldquo;blackfish&rdquo; entering the Community markets.  I too believe that effective and evenhanded control right throught the supply and demand chain, at sea, on shore and at transport and market points is essential for rational management of fisheries and the fishing sector as a whole.  The Irish control and enforcement effort will continue increasingly to target all components of the distribution chain.  I will also be pursuing the need for similar commitment by other member states.</P>
      <P>The Community fisheries control system covers all aspects of the Common Fisheries Policy and Community control applies throughout the entire sector from the producer to the consumer.  Primary responsibility for implementing the system rests with the individual member states.</P>
      <P>The initial analysis of the EU situation presented by the IFPO merits consideration and debate and the Department will be taking forward the issues with the industry as a whole (both catching and processing) in the New Year.</P>

      <P>My policy objective for the fishing and fish processing sectors is to maintain and <Col N="914" /> strengthen their contribution to the national economy and in particular their contribution to jobs and growth in coastal communities.  Within the available funding envelope, I am supporting targeted investment strategies to deliver on that objective.</P>
      <P>Current investment support strategies under the Fisheries Operational Programme are designed to improve the efficiency, safety and age profile of the fleet.  I announced recently a new round of Exchequer and EU supported investment of £11 million in the modernisation of the fishing fleet.  The package provides some £3.5 million in EU and Exchequer grant aid for 112 fleet modernisation projects under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries.  This investment is aimed primarily at the whitefish fleet to enhance safety, quality and competitiveness in the sector.</P>
      <P>In addition to my plans for a capital grant aid scheme for a number of new whitefish boats which are currently being finalised, I am pursuing other options to facilitate and attract investment in the fleet, in line with An Action Programme for the Millennium which gives a specific commitment to making the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the provision of fiscal incentives.  My aim is progressing the various initiatives which I have outlined is to achieve a significant turnaround of the whitefish fleet.</P>
      <P>Investment of over £20 million involving some £8.3 million in grant aid has been supported to date for the fish processing sector.  The grant aid was allocated to both upgrading and development projects.</P>
      <P>The objective of investment in upgrading was to assist processors to meet criteria laid down in EU Health and Hygiene Directives.  The upgrading programme, which is now complete, was an essential first step in securing the long-term future of the processing industry.  All remaining EU funds are now being directed at the development of the processing industry.  An additional tranche of development projects will be approved in the near future.  The remaining funds available will not be sufficient to fund all projects which are in the pipeline and I will be seeking additional funding to support capacity expansion in the processing sector which has the potential to deliver real jobs in coastal communities.</P>
      <P>Investment strategies for the sector as a whole have paid dividends to date in terms of significant increases in fish landings exports and revenue recorded since 1994.  There are numerous challenges still to be addressed in delivering on the potential of the fishing industry as a whole, particularly in relation to quality, competitiveness, price and overseas markets.  I look forward to working with the industry to deliver on that potential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 53 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>A number of fishing stretches on the River Robe in County Mayo are it has transpired vested in the Land Commission and Land Commission fisheries are managed by the Central Fisheries Board.  It has been the longstanding practice of the Central Fisheries Board to offer the fishing rights on a number of State-owned fishing stretches, which include Land Commission fisheries, to the public in a tendering process.  Tender applications are invited in the press for licences to hold the fishing rights for periods of between one to five years.</P>
      <P>It is a stated objective of the Central Fisheries Board to maximise the opportunities for local management and development of all such fisheries. In line with this objective, it is the case that over the years the majority of these State owned fishing rights are licensed to local angling clubs on the ground and not as intimated, to exclusive private interests.  I would stress to the House that there is no question at any time of selling off state owned fishing rights or fisheries either in the River Robe or elsewhere.  The tendering and licensing process to which the Deputy refers is in fact designed to assist the management, conservation and development of State owned fisheries to their full potential, having full regard for local interests and concerns.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the River Robe has been fished as an unmanaged free fishery by local anglers in the area.  These stretches were recently identified as a Land Commission fishery in title research carried out by the Central Fisheries Board.  Accordingly, in line with the standard practice of CFB it was advertised for leasing along with other State-owned fisheries.  It was this potential change from the unmanaged free fishery which has given rise to concerns at local level and among Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the event I can confirm that no tenders were received for any of the 12 Land Commission fisheries <Col N="916" /> on the River Robe.  I can confirm that a meeting has been arranged in Galway on 15 December between CFB officials, the Western Regional Fisheries Board and representatives of the Carra-Mask Angling Federation to discuss all the options for the future management of the River Robe.  At my request the CFB has confirmed that it will consult intensively with local interests and with interested Deputies on the way forward for the future management of this fishery. I have asked the board to keep me fully apprised of developments in this regard and to work to deliver consensus on the way forward which will facilitate the better management and development of these fisheries in line with local concerns and needs.</P>

      <P>The House will recall that on 13 November 1997 I advised Deputies of my intention to attend the 20th General Assembly of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to address it on the subject of the Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF) Code and to press the assembly to agree that the code, which governs the transport by sea of irradiated nuclear fuels, be adopted as a mandatory binding code by IMO member states.  The assembly considered a progress report on the review of the INF code by the various technical bodies of the IMO which had been requested by the previous assembly in a resolution sponsored by Ireland.  I am pleased to be able to advise Deputies that agreement has now been reached at the IMO to make the code mandatory and the draft final document has been referred to the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO for adoption.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been campaigning for some time for improvements to the conditions under which nuclear materials are transported around our coasts, and the adoption of the INF Code as a binding code by IMO member states marks an important step forward in this process.</P>

      <P>The horse mackerel fishery is increasingly important for the pelagic segment of the Irish fishing industry and I will be seeking a quota for Ireland in this fishery which reflects our track record to date.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have previously advised the House, I received numerous requests this summer for extensions to the commercial fishing season in various regions around the coast.  Having carefully considered all the submissions made to me, the advice of relevant regional fisheries boards and the scientific assessments by the Central Fisheries Board and the Marine Institute, as well as the particular local circumstances, I decided, as an exceptional measure, to grant extensions in just three specific areas; the North Western Fisheries Region, the Rivers Cashen-Feale, and the Waterford Fisheries District &mdash; effectively <Col N="919" /> allowing fishermen in the relevant areas up to five days additional fishing time.</P>
      <P>My key policy objective remains to secure the future for salmon in its own right and in the economic interests of the rural and coastal communities which it supports.  I am therefore working to conserve and enhance salmon stocks in the interest of all legitimate stakeholders in the resource.</P>
      <P>In that context, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season, and I have asked the Marine Institute, the Central Fisheries Board and the Salmon Research Agency to provide me with a comprehensive assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the salmon conservation measures taken this year.  I hope to have this shortly, but I can say that initial reports available to me on catches and stocks highlight the need at least to continue with existing conservation measures.</P>
      <P>On salmon management strategies generally, I have already announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management, involving and empowering all users and beneficiaries at local community level.  The catchment approach will address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies, through ongoing review and consultation with all stakeholders in the salmon resource.</P>
      <P>In the context, the Marine Institute has recently forwarded to this Department its feasibility study on the introduction of a total allowable catch, quota and tagging regime for salmon which was a key recommendation of the Salmon Management Task Force.  In parallel with the Department's own examination of these proposals, I propose to disseminate the document very shortly to all relevant players in the salmon sector and invite their views.  This wide-ranging consultative process will inform decisions on this new management strategy and is in my view essential if we are to continue to build on the hand-won consensus on future directions for salmon management which the task force achieved so admirably.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer, EU and own resource funding envelope for the development of inland fisheries by the central and regional fisheries boards will be kept under review during the period the CFBs five year strategic development plan.  The availability of EU funding for inland fisheries development post 2000 will be addressed in the context of Ireland's overall negotiations with the Commission on the next Structural Funds round.  The emphasis by the Commission in its document Agenda 2000 on rural development and environmental quality objectives will be a useful starting point in framing the case for continued EU funding for Ireland's inland fisheries resource.</P>

Drilling operations wil be carried out under the company's Standard Petroleum Exploration Licence No. 1/96, which covers a five block area, blocks 33/16, 33/17, 33/18, 33/21 and 33/22.

      <P>During 1997 three other groups holding offshore petroleum authorisations undertook drilling programmes in the Irish offshore.  Statoil, who hold a lease undertaking over the Connemara oilfield in block 26/28 in the Porcupine basin, conducted a two well appraisal programme on the field to determine whether it could be put into long-term commercial production.  Statoil concluded, in the light of the results from the two wells, that they would not declare the field commercial. Present indications are that three wells will be drilled in 1998.</P>

      <P>I led the BIM seafood trade mission to China last month.  This was the largest Irish trade delegation to visit China to date.  It involved participation by BIM and 18 Irish seafood companies at the China Fisheries and Seafood Expo 1997 as well as an intensive round of meetings with Ministers, State officials, State companies and seafood importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strategic aim of the mission was to significantly boost Irish seafood exports into the Chinese market which is the largest seafood market in the world and which imports over $1.5 billion of seafood each year.  The trade mission has confirmed that there are promising commercial opportunities for a range of Irish fish products in the Chinese market notably salmon, mackerel and herring and high value shellfish including crab, scallop and whelks.  Ireland already exports around £600,000 worth of seafood products to China and sustained development of this market <Col N="927" /> potential will expand our presence in the Asia seafood scene generally where Irish seafood exports were worth £30 million over the past five years.</P>
    <P>The promising commercial links, particularly on the specific products mentioned, which were established during the visit are now being systematically followed up by BIM and the Irish companies concerned.  Our high quality image for seafood products gives us a competitive edge and I believe that in the medium-term we will see real commercial outcomes from this initiative.</P>
    <P>During the visit I also signed an agreement on co-operation and technology exchange in the aquaculture field.  China is a world leader in production technology for a number of shellfish species such as abalone which are at development stage in Ireland.  The information exchange will be of commercial importance to the Irish shellfish sector in developing new areas of potential.  In return Ireland has offered technical services and expertise in the area of quality and hygiene standards for shellfish and fish products in which the Chinese authorities showed particular interest.</P>

      <P>As of 30 June 1997 a total of 75 merchant shipping vessels of 100 gross tonnes and over were entered on the Irish register totalling some 189,859 gross tonnes.</P>
      <P>Development of the shipping sector must take account of its international nature.  Irish shipping interests need to be in a position to compete effectively with those from EU and third countries. Seafarer training must meet the highest international standards to maintain high levels of professionalism and safety requirements.  The State's role is to create a suitable framework to enable the shipping sector to achieve its full potential.</P>
      <P>Initiatives undertaken or under consideration by my Department include:</P>
      <P>Fiscal Concessions</P>
      <P>Reliefs introduced in the 1996 Finance Act. These enable vessels dry leased by Irish interests to qualify for 10 per cent corporation profits tax and double ring fencing against tax-based ship leasing has been removed; refund of employer PRSI in respect of seafarers is the provisions which were introduced in the Social Welfare Regulations, 1977 represent considerable cost savings for Irish registered and controlled ships; provisional arrangements have been made to initiate the scheme pending necessary approval from the European Commission; seafarer taxation is the possibility of introducing reliefs is under active review; seafarer training is the Shipboard Training Subsidy introduced in 1996 has helped to secure essential training placements for students at Cork Regional Technical College, and a task force to examine all aspects of seafarer training with representation from those engaged in the shipping sector including shipowners and trade unions together with education and training interests will commence its work very shortly.</P>

The French authorities understood and accepted these conditions.  The granting of permission was in full conformity with the provisions of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I am at present conducting a review of Ireland's diplomatic representation overseas.  While the resources available for its expansion are limited, I am conscious that our diplomatic network is small by comparison with other EU member states of similar size and that we are particularly under-represented in certain parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of this review, both Turkey and the continent of South America, where Ireland has only one resident embassy at present in Argentina, would merit very serious consideration for the establishment of resident embassies <Col N="930" /> in the event of additional resources becoming available.  Any proposal to open a new resident embassy would have to be agreed with the Government of the country concerned before a public announcement could be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.  Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected or handicapped.  Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment on both a medical needs criteria and on dental fitness in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department for the provision of secondary care orthodontic treatment and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity or handicap.</P>
      <P>In relation to the dental health status of the patient, the guidelines state that &ldquo;patients should be free from untreated dental caries with all lesions satisfactorily restored and they should be free from active gingivitis and-or peridontitis&rdquo;. The guidelines also provide that prior to commencing appliance therapy all patients and parents should be assessed to ensure their understanding of the need to comply with the instructions of the orthodontist and to co-operate fully in preventive measures for the entire period of treatment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there is great disappointment if a patient is refused orthodontic treatment due to a low level of oral hygiene when treatment is due to be carried out.  Accordingly, my Department has advised health boards that patients on waiting lists and their parents should be routinely circulated with a standard letter advising them of the necessity to maintain their oral health to the highest possible standard while awaiting treatment and highlighting the possibility of the refusal of treatment if oral hygiene is not of the highest standard and the reasons the highest standard of oral hygiene is required before orthodontic treatment is commenced.  Teeth overcrowding is not an obstacle to maintaining a high standard of oral hygiene.  I am not aware that these guidelines are being misused by health boards as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I understand from St. James's Hospital that the person in question has been on a waiting list for cardiac surgery since November 1996.  The hospital is not in a position at present to give a date of admission and the scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority. The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <P>The scheme of community support for older people was established to address the security needs of vulnerable older people in the community by providing once-off funding for certain types of security equipment.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme once-off grants can be made towards the cost of small scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security equipment and socially monitored alarm systems.</P>
      <P>Funding is not available under the scheme for conventional intruder-burglar alarms.</P>
      <P>The maximum grant available under this scheme is 90 per cent of the cost and grants are provided only towards the once-off cost of obtaining and installing the necessary equipment. Under the terms of the scheme it is not possible to provide funding towards the ongoing monitoring fees charged by the monitoring companies.</P>

      <P>The Maternity Protection Act, 1994, <i>inter alia</i> provides that a pregnant employee must be granted health and safety leave from work in circumstances where a pregnancy related risk has been identified in the workplace and it is not possible either to remove the risk or to move the employee to other suitable work.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Pregnant Employees etc.)  Regulations, 1994, which are enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, require an employer to conduct a risk assessment in relation to pregnant employees, employees who have recently given birth and employees who are breastfeeding.  Guidelines published by the Authority advise that such risk assessment should, <i>inter alia</i>, include chemical substances including solvents.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the Health and Safety Authority, in its advisory and enforcement functions, recommends that pregnant employees who are significantly exposed to perchlorethylene at work should be removed from work, for example at dry cleaning machines, and moved to other suitable work.

As the Deputy will appreciate, it would be premature to consider making a decision on funding a specific neighbourhood watch project until such time as the national evaluation has been carried out and a decision made about funding generally.</P>

      <P>On 8 December 1997 approximately 50 per cent of all prisoners in custody were accommodated in single cells.  This figure takes into account offenders in open centres where accommodation is generally of the dormitory type.  The proportion of prisoners in single cells would be substantially higher but for the multiple occupancy of some cells directly attributable to the serious overcrowding problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cell accommodation in the new remand prison, beside Wheatfield Place of Detention, is designed specifically for short-term occupation.  With the appointment of additional judges and speeding-up of trials, remand prisoners could, on average, be expected to spend only a few weeks in custody and, in many cases, not more than 48 hours.  In the main, cells in the new remand prison are designed to accommodate up to three prisoners each in bunk bed style accommodation and have a floor area of 10.7 square metres.  The remainder of the cells have a floor area of 8.3 square metres, are for single person occupancy and will be used to accommodate individuals remanded for longer periods.  Provision of single occupancy cells for all <Col N="947" /> remand prisoners is not considered necessary and could not be justified on the grounds of either cost-effectiveness or operational needs.</P>
    <P>Prisoners remanded by the courts, especially those imprisoned for the first time, are often in a somewhat distressed condition, mentally and/or physically, on arrival at the prison and as such the risk of attempts at self mutilation or suicide must be borne in mind.  Experience has shown that shared accommodation is often the preferred option in such cases.</P>

I await the groups report.  It is not possible to say, at this stage, what the cost of developing the special unit will be because the tenders for the unit have not been received.

The programme involves the following: (a) the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism; (b) the delivery of specially tailored educational programmes to meet the needs of these children; and (c) the delivery of special in-service support to the teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>These special classes are attached to schools located in Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin and Cratloe, Ennis, County Clare.  A further special class was established in St. Brigid's special school, Dundalk, County Louth in the 1996-97 school year.  Each of the special classes caters for a maximum of six children.  A total of 46 children are currently catered for under the pilot programme.</P>
    <P>My Department's inspectorate is currently reviewing the operation of the pilot programme and will be consulting with the Irish Society for Autism as part of this process.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>

      <P>A national survey of the reading attainment of pupils in fifth class in primary schools was carried out in 1993.  The Education Research Centre, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, conducted the survey in co-operation with the Inspectorate in my Department.  I have made arrangements to carrry out such a survey again in 1998.  It is normal practice in conducting national surveys to establish an advisory group of the partners to advise on the running of the survey and this will also be done in the case of the 1998 survey.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the early retirement provision which was notified to schools in September 1997.  Applications from teachers who wished to retire with effect from 19 December 1997 were invited.  Teachers were given until 24 October to apply.  In all, 63 applications have been received &mdash; 28 from primary teachers and 35 from second level teachers.</P>
      <P>All applicants have been advised of the outcome of their application or have been requested for further information, as appropriate.  Successful applicants have two weeks in which to make up their minds as to whether they will, in fact, retire.  As retirements will not take effect until 19 December, all applicants are currently in receipt of salary and will be paid salary up to 31 December.  If they decide to retire, the amount paid in respect of the period from 20 December to 31 December will be treated as an advance of pension.</P>

      <P>Irish is an essential element of the school curriculum at both primary and second levels.  All pupils are required to study the language unless granted an exemption from doing so.</P>
      <P>As made clear in the Government's policy document, An Action Programme for the Millennium, I am committed to a thorough review of the methods used to teach Irish in schools and to the establishment of a resource centre to facilitate learning the language.</P>
      <P>Teachers at both primary and second levels are enabled to participate as full partners in syllabus design and review through their representatives on NCCA committee.</P>
      <P>A review of the primary curriculum, including Irish, has almost been completed by representative committees under the aegis of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  After this work has been brought to fruition, a revised Irish programme for primary schools together with detailed guidelines for teachers will be published.  These will be followed by a comprehensive programme of in-career development for teachers and the publication of new teaching resources and materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level, a comprehensive process of review and revision of syllabi and examinations has been completed.  Provision is made for the <Col N="952" /> teaching of Irish at three levels &mdash; Bonnleibhéal, Gnáthleibhéal and Ardleibhéal &mdash; to pupils preparing for the Junior Certificate and for the established Leaving Certificate, and to those following the Leaving Certificate vocational programme. This ensures that all pupils have the opportunity of studying Irish at a level appropriate to their particular needs and aptitudes.  Gaeilge Chumarsáideach within the leaving certificate applied combines a practical orientation with a strong emphasis on active learning methodologies. All these programmes are sufficiently flexible to allow teachers to adapt their approaches to the particular needs of their pupils.  Support is provided through comprehensive guidelines for teachers and through quality in-career development and support programmes.</P>

      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
