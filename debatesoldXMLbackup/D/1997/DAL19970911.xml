      <P>Before I call the Taoiseach on the Order of Business, I wish to make a brief comment.  A complaint was made yesterday about the ringing of mobile phones in the Chamber.  I indicated at that time that the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges made rules banning the use of such phones in the Chamber.  Since the Committee on Procedure and Privileges ban goes back to 1993, I re-emphasise today for the benefit of this Dáil that the use of mobile phones is totally banned in the Chamber, the lobbies, the press gallery, the visitors gallery and anywhere that could be seen to interfere with the proceedings of this House and its committees. I trust that Deputies and members in the press gallery will adhere to this ban and that there will be no further cause for complaint in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 4, motion on the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) and No. 5, the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <P>Before agreeing to the Order of Business, there is something the House might like to do.  The President of Ireland leaves office tomorrow.  She is the first President to have addressed this House and, as the House will not be sitting tomorrow, it is appropriate that we should pay tribute to the seven years of service which President Mary Robinson has given to this country.  She has used that high office to make people who might not otherwise have felt part of the Irish political system fully part of it for the first time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has not made any proposal in that regard and I wish to ensure that it is done.  I am proceeding now, if I may, to say what I must say in tribute to the President.  I hope that the Taoiseach, as the Leader of the House, will agree with me now and also pay tribute to the President before we commence the business of the House.  It would be inappropriate to interrupt what will otherwise be potentially contentious business to have these well deserved tributes to the President.  We ought to do it now before we enter into these contentious matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the House feel that this is the most appropriate way to do it?  I do not think the Order of Business is the most appropriate way.  Certainly a more appropriate way could be found.  Does the Taoiseach want to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no precedent for discussing the President in the Chamber.  We are completely departing from precedent if we discuss the role or performance of the President in the House.  I wish to draw that to the attention of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this matter was mentioned a week ago.  The view then was that the President has never been the source of debate in the House and it was more appropriate that the tribute to the President should take place when the Dáil resumes.  Having said that, the President will then have taken up another office outside the country.</P>
      <P>We, as party leaders, will have an opportunity tomorrow.  If we were paying a tribute, I would like to think all Members would be here to hear it.  On that basis, I would like to do it at the end of the business today.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that tributes to the President in the middle of a debate would not be ideal, but I would be very glad to make arrangements with the Whips to do it at the end of the business this evening, which will be some hours before the President leaves office.  A Cheann Comhairle, if you would consider that during the course of the day, we will certainly make arrangements with the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter should be discussed by the Whips.  Perhaps they will consult with the Chair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not need any great time to prepare our remarks.  We all know the President has served us well and we can find it appropriate to say what needs to be said here and now. I do not wish to be contentious on this matter and <Col N="755" /> if the Taoiseach insists that we should not pay the tribute now but pay it after the votes this evening, I will go along with that.  It is not the ideal way of doing it.  We should start the business with a tribute to the President.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Taoiseach has proposed but I think that, with the atmosphere now and the position of everybody involved, it is preferable for it to be done now rather than after a vote when Deputies will be travelling in different directions.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I am looking for your guidance on No. 5 on the Order Paper.  There are some 29 amendments to this motion on the establishment of the tribunal of inquiry.  I am certainly not clear as to how it is proposed that we take those amendments.  The Taoiseach indicated that, following reflection on Members' contributions, he may be amenable to taking some of the amendments on board.  I believe the House is probably agreed that those which deal with the narrow focus on the Ansbacher accounts ought to be reconsidered. For example, one of the amendments suggests the inclusion at the preliminary stage of the tribunal, namely, the sifting process, of the matters that were the subject of yesterday's statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>How will the amendments be processed?  Will Members have an opportunity to make a brief case in respect of each of the amendments, some of which are quite complicated?  What arrangements will be made to permit Members to contribute on the more important amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the order of the House stipulates that the debate must end at 4.30 p.m., at which time the amendments will be taken.  The majority of the 29 amendments, with the exception of two, could be the subject of separate decisions, if required.  This is a very complicated area but it will become clear <Col N="756" /> when we come to deal with the amendments.  If Members wish to group some of the amendments for the purpose of decision, it will have to be done by an order of the House.  That would be a matter for the Whips in the first instance to see if it could be achieved and an order would then have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Members would be obliged to contribute on the amendments during the course of the debate and each would have to be voted on individually after 4.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the debate must conclude at 4.30 p.m. and the amendments will then be put to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be necessary to move each amendment separately following the conclusion of the debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct.  Separate decisions can be made on each amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that there will be a type of hybrid Second Stage/Committee Stage debate during which Members will be permitted to speak on amendments which interest them and that there will be no response from the Government in respect of any questions raised regarding proposed amendments, some of which are of a precise nature?  At the end of what will, in effect, be a Second Stage debate, is it correct that each amendment in turn will be put to the House and voted on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider asking the Whips to meet in order that time be made available before 4.30 p.m. for a debate to enable us to discuss the amendments?  I accept that the Ceann Comhairle is obliged to obey the rules of the House but the proposed arrangements are unsatisfactory because there is no facility for a Government spokesperson to reply to each amendment following contributions on them by individual Deputies.  I suggest that the Whips might meet to consider a way in which a discussion of the amendments could be structured within the agreed Order of Business, given that the debate must conclude at 4.30 p.m., and introduce <Col N="757" /> an order of the House to modify the business of the House, if necessary, during the course of the day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government intends to accept any of the amendments, given that it had time to consider them overnight?  If so, which amendments does the Government intend to accept?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that the House will rise at 4.45 p.m.?  What will happen if we have dealt with only half of the amendments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House must dispose of the amendments when the debate concludes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a position to comment on a story on this morning's 9 a.m. news regarding an interview given to <i>An Phoblacht</i> on behalf of a spokesperson for the IRA in which it was indicated that that organisation had reservations about the Mitchell principles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I support what Deputy Quinn has said.  Given that the IRA and Sinn Féin are one and the same organisation, in terms of its political direction the interview in <i>An Phoblacht</i> is extremely disquieting and casts doubt on Sinn Féin's commitment to the Mitchell principles.  If that is the attitude of the IRA, we may be dealing with just an empty formula from Sinn Féin.  It is very important that this matter be clarified by Sinn Féin.  Deputy Quinn is to be complimented for bringing it up.</P>

      <P>Given that we were expected to be on the verge of a breakthrough next week in the talks in Northern Ireland, it is of the utmost importance for the Government to clarify who speaks for the republican movement. Is it Mr. Gerry Adams MP or an unnamed person who gave an interview to <i>An Phoblacht</i>?  That interview seems to be an attempt to scupper the talks next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quinn for raising the issue.  I have just heard the preliminary reports and seen some of the news lines but it is a matter of major concern.  On Tuesday last Sinn Féin signed up to the Mitchell principles and I expect them to be honoured by the entire republican movement.  That includes the way forward, which is that matters are dealt with by democratic and peaceful means and that the issue of disarmament will now be dealt with by the commission.  I expect the entire republican movement to honour that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's clarification of the Government's understanding of the obligations and responsibilities of Sinn Féin.

      <P>We now proceed as agreed with tributes to the President.  The Chair has already made his views known on this matter. I remind the House that under the Constitution the President is not answerable to this House and Members should keep this in mind in their contributions. There should be no criticism, direct or otherwise, of the President.  I suggest that a time limit of five minutes be applied to party leaders. Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say some words of tribute to the President just 24 hours before she leaves office.  President Mary Robinson has represented the people of Ireland with great distinction for almost seven years in what has been, by common consent, an outstandingly successful term of office.  The very best wishes of everybody in this House and throughout the country go to her as she takes up her new and challenging role as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights after the formal ceremony in Áras an Uachtaráin with the party leaders.  We know she will bring the unique style, insight and personal commitment to her new position that she has brought to every position she has held whether in her professional office, in the legal world, as a Senator or in relation to other challenges she undertook in the voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>From her earliest involvement in public affairs President Robinson has always espoused human rights issues.  This honour bestowed on her confirms the quality of her work, the strength of her convictions and the length of her committed public service.  Her appointment comes at an important time, the eve of the 50th anniversary of the historic UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the fifth anniversary of its modern day equivalent, the Vienna Declaration.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Government, the party I have the honour to lead, and the nation, I thank her for the tremendous job she has done, her success in making the presidency so inclusive, and the amount of travelling she did to achieve that aim. Regardless of the occasion, the function, the parish, the community, the religion, she participated whenever she was asked.  Let me say, on a lighter note, that I know that because she was in attendance at every place I visited.  That was an extraordinary commitment by her and her family.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that what she did for Irish exiles around the world will always be remembered. In speaking of the Irish diaspora she told the Dáil that the communities she had visited in Australia, the United States and further afield had a longing to be part of the Irish nation but that they felt alienated.  She worked particularly hard to make them feel included, just as she worked to make everybody in the Irish community feel included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the Government and Irish people at home and abroad, I wish the President, her <Col N="762" /> husband, Nick, and her children, Aubrey, Tess and William every success and happiness as they move into a different career.  I thank them all for their selfless pursuit of the public interest on behalf of the nation over seven years.  We owe them a great debt of gratitude.  It is not just a great personal honour for the President but an honour for this nation that she takes up this office.  We thank her for serving a remarkable term of office and bid her a fond farewell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the seven years of service to this nation that President Robinson has given.  She brought the institutions of this State into contact with people who were previously excluded.  People who felt they were the subject of discrimination in our society felt that they had a friend and, to an extent, a home in Áras an Uachtaráin.  That concept of the presidency is uniquely one that was brought about by Mary Robinson herself.  She enlivened the office of President in a very human way.  In her seven years as President she epitomised the modernisation of Ireland.  She was able to present on an international stage a view of Ireland which she personalised and embodied that was very different from the traditional view that many people who were relatively unfamiliar with this country might have had.  In a sense, her presidency showed that Ireland had entered the second half of the 20th century, whereas many people had previously seen it as mired in the second half of the 19th century.  Without the election to office of President Robinson, many of those who now have a modern and realistic view of Ireland would still hold that traditional view which is out of date.</P>
      <P>It is important that Mary Robinson emphasised Ireland's role in working for justice in international relations.  Her visits to Rwanda and to other areas in the world where people were suffering epitomised the generous spirit of the Irish people <i>vis-à-vis</i> those less fortunate than themselves. She was someone of whom we could be proud.</P>
      <P>As Taoiseach it was my privilege to advise and consult with the President in the exercise of my office.  Obviously, this is not a matter I can discuss publicly.  However, the President showed immense personal warmth to me in all my consultations with her, which I appreciated very much. The office which it is the present Taoiseach's privilege to exercise, which was mine to exercise for a time, is a lonely, difficult and stressful one. It was of great help to me that the President was someone with whom I could speak freely and with whom I was able to enjoy such warm personal relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay particular tribute to Nick Robinson. It is clear that the role of husband of a President is a particularly difficult one, probably more difficult than that of a wife of a President.  Nick Robinson performed that role in an exemplary manner.  We can be as proud of him as we are of the President.  As the Taoiseach has said, we also <Col N="763" /> pay tribute to their children who helped them both do the job so well.</P>
    <P>We can rejoice that the first citizen of this country is now taking responsibility for universal human rights.  The world economy is being globalised and trade and the making of money are to be governed by international norms.  Profit and profit making are to be enhanced by the existence of international norms in finance and trade.  It will be an inhuman and heartless world if that introduction of global rules for trade and moneymaking is not matched by equally strong global rules for the protection of human and social rights.  I believe the work President Robinson will do as a lawyer in introducing global human rights and her distinguished service in the office which she enters tomorrow will make the world a more humane place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow in Áras an Uachtarán, President Robinson will effectively resume her status as an ordinary citizen of this State.  It is a measure of the sophistication and development of this country that we have put the concept of dynastic succession behind us forever.  Ordinary citizens can be selected by others to fill the role of Head of State and to have the responsibility of representing this Republic.</P>
      <P>President Robinson took office seven years ago with a series of commitments, among which was her desire to expand the role of the office within its constitutional powers, to become a voice for the voiceless and to ensure that as Ireland modernised and became a more wealthy and materially secure society those who felt excluded or were excluded would be brought into the wider family of the nation.  It is an extraordinary tribute to her ability as a constitutional lawyer, to her skills as a politician and to her sensitivity as a human being that she managed to do that within the narrow constraints and confines of the constitutional definition and role of our President.</P>
      <P>She did more than that.  Any one of us who has travelled in any capacity across the globe will have encountered people of Irish extraction or people who were born here but left, not for economic reasons, but because they did not feel comfortable or free in the narrow closed valley of the squinting windows which reflected the Ireland of the late 1940s, the 1950s and in some respects the early 1960s.  She enabled those people to once again be proud of being Irish.  She put Ireland on the world map in a way we had not previously seen our country represented.  As Deputy Bruton and the Taoiseach said, she reached out to the Irish diaspora, which we failed to do for many years.  It is estimated that approximately 73 million people throughout the world describe themselves as either Irish-American, Irish-Australian or British-Irish and in an extraordinary way she enabled us to connect with them and them to connect with us.  I pay tribute to the sensitivity and manner in which she did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="764" /> I was chairman of the campaign committee that successfully campaigned for her election.  I do not know of any other candidate who continued to increase his or her support after being elected. The skills she manifested in her role and the generosity of the Irish people in recognising the wonderful job she did enabled her to do that.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the two candidates she defeated, in particular the late Brian Lenihan, a former Member of the House who, with characteristic generosity, stated on a radio programme some years later that on reflection he believed she was doing a better job than he could have done.  That typical act of generosity from Brian Lenihan reflects the admiration across all parties that people have for President Mary Robinson. Like the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, on behalf of my party I wish her success, happiness and more family time than she has had in the past seven years.  I thank her sincerely for what she has given to this Republic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="The Tánaiste Mary Harney">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to pay tribute to President Mary Robinson.  Yesterday we mourned the passing of two of the world's most remarkable women.  President Mary Robinson can be included in the list of the world's remarkable women.  Her election as President of Ireland redefined the presidency. While its constitutional role did not change, in the way she behaved as President she sought to take it to its limit and in doing so won the support of people all over the country.  As the Taoiseach stated, it was an inclusive presidency; everybody empathised with her.  Last Friday many Members of the House were in her company at a business lunch.  It was encouraging to witness up to 1,000 business people applaud her enthusiastically, empathising with her and paying tribute to her remarkable work.</P>
      <P>It was not only the business community or important people that Mary Robinson included in her presidency.  She made the office open to the most vulnerable and marginalised in society. She spent a great deal of time visiting deprived areas seeking to give encouragement and support and was willing to listen.  As the former Taoiseach said, she was always warm and human in the way she dealt with individuals.  In any encounter I had with her, I found her extremely relaxed and she made me feel very much at home on the few opportunities I had to visit Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
      <P>It is right that we should pay tribute to her because she has been an outstanding role model for women.  We are all proud that a woman has done the best job ever performed in the presidency, although that is no reflection on her predecessors. Hers was not a sleeping presidency and the person who will succeed her has an onerous task.  I am delighted to see such interest in the job but when the nation votes for a successor to President Mary Robinson it will place him or her in a difficult position, because she will be a hard act to follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> It is right that she should now have responsibility for international human rights because no one is more qualified to take on that role.  She has been a great ambassador for Ireland and for human rights.  I know she is daunted by the task but I have no doubt she will perform it as she has all the others she has taken on in the past.</P>
    <P>As others have said, the wider diaspora also empathised with the President.  In the past they might not even have known who the President of Ireland was.  When I was in the United States recently, I was surprised at the number of times I was asked about her.  People knew where she was going and what she had done.  Our economy has benefited enormously from the image she portrayed of a modern, progressive nation.  In the way she carried out her role, President Mary Robinson personified the new, modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We can be rightly proud of what she has done and it is fitting that we should thank her today.  It would be ironic if the procedures of this House were such that we could pay tribute to her if she passed away but not when she moves on to another job.  We must examine our more archaic procedures to ensure they do not prevent us doing what we have now succeeded in doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the last day of Mrs. Mary Robinson's presidency.  I was proud to have supported her campaign and to have actively campaigned with and for her.  I was also pleased that, as Deputy Quinn said, her support grew after her election.  That is a tribute not only to President Mary Robinson but to our people and politicians who recognised the values she brought to the job.</P>
      <P>She made an enormous contribution to the self-confidence and pride of our people and the many millions outside the country who regard themselves as Irish.  She did not do that in a chauvinistic way &mdash; she did not identify or define her Irishness in a narrow sense but rather she broadened it.  She made it clear that Ireland was now a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic society. Importantly, she also suggested that we had not reached the end of our development, that there were many things we needed to do to live up to our aspiration to be a just and fair society.  She remained within the boundaries of the law relating to the Irish Presidency while at the same time challenging us to think and do more to end the disadvantage and alienation which, as practising politicians, we see all around us on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>She showed a new face of Ireland to the world. As has been said, there is hardly any corner of the world where she is not known and where she has not created a positive view of the country. She came into office at a time of a growth in self-confidence for a whole range of reasons, not least to do with football and at a time when we needed a person like her to represent this new, self-confident Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She promised to be an imaginative President and she was.  I have no doubt she will bring the <Col N="766" /> same imagination and innovation to her new job as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  Too often, human rights are regarded simply as the right to vote, free speech, a free trial and so on.  While those are very fundamental rights, equally fundamental are the rights to a roof over one's head, to make a contribution to society, feed and rear one's children and to education.  I have no doubt she will bring that view to her new job.</P>
    <P>Far too many conflicts are based on a sense of alienation, of not being fully part of the society into which one is born and to which one seeks to make a contribution.  If we can learn anything from the presidency of Mary Robinson, it is that we must have this broader view of the rights and role of the citizen.  Mary Robinson succeeded in presenting that broader view and the best tribute we can pay her is to seek to apply the views she expressed and the approach she adopted to the politics we pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>Mary Robinson was by far the most popular and accomplished President we have ever had.  She gave us a sense of pride and represented the modern and pluralist Ireland with great success.  I am proud the Green Party supported her campaign, which support she was delighted to receive.  Ironically, she was a failed Dáil candidate which shows we can look outside this House for a successful President.</P>
      <P>I got to know Mary Robinson during my term as Lord Mayor of Dublin when I became aware of her great interest in Northern Ireland.  Her advice to me on becoming Lord Mayor was to build links with the two communities in Northern Ireland.  She was, of course, respected in the Unionist community.</P>
      <P>She believed in the notion of self empowerment.  On visiting many communities throughout Ireland, she gave that sense of self belief to women's groups in particular.</P>
      <P>I wish the President well in her new role.  She was always a champion of human rights.  I particularly remember her visit to Rwanda.  Our loss will be the UN's gain and I know she will do an outstanding job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned last night I was discussing how the Minister, Deputy Ahern, dealt with the issue of the Ansbacher accounts and why it appears the Government is not willing to accept either of the amendments which seek further investigation of these accounts in respect of activities other than payments to politicians.  He offered three reasons for his belief that there should be no further investigation of these issues.</P>
      <P>The first reason was bizarre.  He suggested the issue had not been raised in preliminary discussions regarding the terms of reference of this tribunal and that the Opposition was jumping on a media bandwagon.  That seems to betray a very strange understanding by the Minister of the purpose of debates in this House.  The purpose of those debates is clearly to listen to one another, to listen to public concerns expressed in the media and to attempt to achieve the best possible terms of reference.</P>
      <P>The Minister's view of the role of the media in drumming up wider interest in the Ansbacher accounts than the Government is willing to accept sits uneasily with the lavish and justified praise the Taoiseach offered to journalists whose persistent questioning unearthed the information which ultimately led to the tribunal.  The Minister's view is decidedly not reassuring.</P>
      <P>The other more substantive reason the Minister offered for not looking into the Ansbacher accounts in another way is that the McCracken tribunal is being encouraged by the Government to pursue the court case in the Cayman Islands. However, it is obvious &mdash; the Minister said nothing to suggest otherwise &mdash; that the McCracken tribunal is circumscribed by its terms of reference regarding the pursuit of a court case and any subsequent use it would make of information it acquired.  Its terms of reference dealt solely with the Ben Dunne case and payments by him to politicians.  The McCracken tribunal has no right to look beyond that aspect and no remit to consider issues such as whether offshore accounts, for example the Ansbacher deposits, were used as a systematic vehicle for tax evasion. Its terms of reference do not cover these matters.</P>
      <P>I understand the court case it is pursuing in the Cayman Islands relates solely to the point that it is investigating in the public interest, the behaviour of politicians.  Its interest in the Ansbacher accounts derives solely from that and the court case it seeks to win in the Cayman Islands relates to possible information contained in the accounts which reflects on political behaviour.  The Government's encouragement of the McCracken tribunal to go further is good in itself but it will not deal with the broader issue of public concern about the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the Revenue Commissioners have the power to investigate the Ansbacher accounts.  However, he failed to recall the point, as outlined in the tribunal's report, that evidence <Col N="768" /> concerning the accounts which was available in Ireland has been destroyed.  The Revenue Commissioners would only have access to information that is available in the country.  It is obvious the tax laws of countries such as the Cayman Islands are constructed to ensure that the revenue authorities of other countries cannot draw aside the veil over offshore accounts for revenue pursuit purposes.  The Revenue Commissioners do not have the opportunity to pursue this issue further.</P>
    <P>I was most disappointed at the way the Minister dealt with this important issue which has been raised by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party in its amendment.  I expected to hear a clear explanation from him regarding how he intends to deal with the obvious public concern that offshore accounts are being used improperly by businesses or individuals.  It is important to recall the conclusion the tribunal drew regarding the operation of these offshore accounts.  It stated:</P>
    <P>This was a very ingenious system whereby Irish depositors could have their money offshore, with no record of their deposits in Ireland, and yet obtain an interest rate which was only one eighth of one per cent less than they would have obtained had they deposited it themselves in an Irish bank.  It is not the function of this Tribunal to examine these deposits in any detail, and it may well be that a number of Irish depositors may have been people engaged in international business which was greatly facilitated by having a sterling account abroad which did not require exchange control permission to operate.  No doubt there were others who deposited the monies in this way for other motives.</P>
    <P>The tribunal clearly sets out that there is an unexplored issue regarding the way the Ansbacher accounts were operated.  We know from the tribunal's meticulous description that Irish residents gave money to another Irish agent who had set up accounts offshore, redeposited that money in an Irish bank and took instructions from the Irish resident depositors as to how the money in the deposits ultimately in Irish banks was to be deployed.  To all intents and purposes these were Irish accounts but a vehicle was being used to make sure there was no record of the deposits. Two approaches have been suggested in the amendments that have been tabled by the Labour Party and the Independent Deputies.  The Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs stonewalled on these issues and did not deal with the amendments proposed, which suggest investigating every Ansbacher account and the motives behind them.  That would be an enormous investigative task and also raises the question of why one should investigate one set of offshore accounts for tax evasion and not investigate others.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> It also creates a problem regarding the focus of a tribunal.  We do not want a tribunal that carries out immensely detailed investigations of individual accounts or seeks to replicate the powers of the Revenue Commissioners relating to individuals. However, a view is clearly expressed by the tribunal and mirrored by public concern that there were mechanisms in place being used by Mr. Traynor, as the effective agent, by which people were using these offshore accounts illegitimately.</P>
    <P>There are legitimate reasons for using offshore accounts and we cannot point an accusing finger at everybody who has one.  If one has legitimate offshore activities and a company earning income overseas, it is quite legitimate to open an offshore account and to have the dividend generated by that company overseas managed in a low tax location such as the Cayman Islands.  That is legitimate.</P>
    <P>However, it is not legitimate in Irish law for an individual to stash away his income in that way. Companies are entitled to manage their affairs, but an individual resident in Ireland is taxed on his worldwide income.  We must look further into these Ansbacher accounts, not in a way that opens all holders of offshore accounts to scrutiny but in a way that examines the mechanisms and the way in which those mechanisms were being used illegally, as I suspect in some cases.  There is a need to investigate this seriously and a need for recommendations to be made to deal with it.  The financial institutions involved need to look beyond the minimalist approach they would take with these accounts.  There is an obligation to look beyond an Irish-based person giving instructions about certain deposits to see if nonresidents are operating these accounts.  The tribunal must look at the mechanisms behind the Ansbacher accounts and how they were managed and come up with recommendations on how tax evasion may have been perpetrated through this and how we can deal with this in the future.  Then we can remedy this potential problem with our tax code.</P>
    <P>That is why we feel the mechanism should be examined by the tribunal rather than every offshore account.  That is not called for at this stage. In many ways that is a key issue and it is important that the Government returns to this issue today because when the dust settles on this debate and people look at how we conducted it, the remaining and lingering questions will be whether there is systematic tax abuse of offshore accounts and if the Dáil has taken proper action to ensure such abuse is addressed.  As it stands, the Government is seeing, hearing or speaking no evil and it must address this issue if it is serious. The best way to proceed is that which we have outlined in our amendment, although I would have expected the Government, with access to financial advice and the advice from the Revenue <Col N="770" /> Commissioners which it has at its disposal, to have been able to advise the House on the merits of the two amendments tabled &mdash; one by the Labour Party and others and the other by Fine Gael, which we will press.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is pleased to support other amendments tabled.  I suspect there will be some confusion later today as we reach these amendments and I would like to signal Fine Gael's view on a number of them.  We support the need to look at the issue of Glending Wood in County Wicklow. We have seen the repeated involvement of those central to the McCracken tribunal in this case.  It is important to allay public concerns and include this issue, which figures in amendments Nos. 16 and 20 and which Fine Gael will support, in the investigation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is pleased to support amendment No. 22 in the name of Deputy Spring which is worthy and picks up on the recommendations from the McCracken tribunal.  Many Members on both sides of the House feel there is further work to be done on what action will be taken in the future.  Yesterday the Fine Gael Party Leader outlined a number of necessary changes in our corruption laws and in other areas of law to remove the corruptibility of the system.  Deputy Spring's amendment sets out for the tribunal the need to look beyond what happened and to what will be done about it in the future in areas such as company law, the independence and operation of the Revenue Commissioners, the Central Bank and so on.  Fine Gael is pleased to support that amendment.</P>
    <P>We have some doubts about amendments Nos. 25 and 26 which appear to seek to remove the private phase of the investigation.  I, like the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Ahern, see merit in the private phase of those investigations.  The reasons outlined by the Minister are cogent and provide the tribunal with the opportunity to sift through evidence in private without names coming into the public arena if there is no evidence of wrongdoing.  It also allows it to operate in a way where people are not forewarned of a possible investigation into their affairs which might be undertaken. From the point of view of not breaching natural justice for those who are innocent and of being effective in pursuing those who are guilty, the private phase has merit.</P>
    <P>There is merit in amendment No. 29, which Fine Gael will support.  If someone is found to have failed to co-operate with the tribunal and costs are generated as a result, those costs should fall on the individual or individuals who create them.  Fine Gael does not support the suggestion that we should investigate each person who availed of the tax amnesty and seek to reopen their affairs to determine if any may have made payments to a political party.  While it would be a fruitless task to pursue so many cases, there are <Col N="771" /> also the limits set in the amnesty law in relation to confidentiality of the tax amnesty which remain intact.  We cannot unpick them at this stage.</P>
    <P>I take no pleasure in reading the sad account of Mr. Haughey's style of leadership as outlined in the McCracken tribunal.  I have shared a constituency with Mr. Haughey for all of my political life and I know the respect in which he has been held by many constituents.  However, a very bleak picture of Mr. Haughey's style of leadership has been portrayed.  His belief in an entitlement to lead a lifestyle which he did not earn seems incredible.  His willingness while in high office to have agents dispatched to raise money from wealthy businessmen to support his lifestyle was a serious flaw.  The persistence of this behaviour even at times when there was huge public concern about the golden circle and the potential influence of wealthy businessmen on decision making defies belief.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey's intimate knowledge of the tax laws side by side with blatantly ignoring his tax obligations is a sad testimony to his style.  This was followed by the provision of misleading information in writing to the tribunal and the subsequent non acceptance of 11 major points of evidence provided by him when he appeared before the tribunal, despite a claim to be making a clean breast of the sources of payments made to him. It is more than a tragic end to his career.  It is a demonstration of the deep flaw which characterised his conduct and it places many of the controversial events of his career in a new light.  This is why it is necessary to pursue the money trail and to get to the bottom of the many issues which occurred in his life to see if the arbitrary exercise of power which we have seen time and again related to payments he received.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the contribution of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to this debate.  Perhaps it was the late hour, but we were treated to a speech more attune to the 1930s in his characterisation of Fine Gael and his eulogy of Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps it was valuable archive material and I am aware of academics interested in such issues. However, it struck me that the Minister or his speech writer must be suffering from the problem which is affecting word-processing software, namely, the inability to distinguish the early part of the 20th century from the onset of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The essence of the Minister's charge against Fine Gael was that it needlessly questioned the probity of political acts under the Haughey Administration and the payment made in 1989 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke. This attitude from a senior Minister is disturbing. Has anything been learned from the unfolding events of the past months?  Is Deputy McDaid saying the discriminatory allocation of export <Col N="772" /> sales relief, against official advice and after a private meeting with the beneficiaries, was acceptable behaviour?  Such behaviour is not acceptable.  Is he saying that interference in the IDA's statutory right to alone negotiate the terms of grant agreements with companies was acceptable? I do not accept such behaviour.  Is he saying pressurising bodies to purchase Carysfort and sanctioning public moneys without proper Cabinet procedure was acceptable?  I cannot accept that.  It is clear that by coming before the House and accusing other parties of being crass or poorly motivated, the Minister has missed the point of the debate.  The type of behaviour and style of leadership thrown into sharp relief by the tribunal is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDaid's scorn on the temerity of the Opposition to question the Minister for Foreign Affairs is equally amazing.  Is this the Deputy who was part of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench which proposed that bankers be obliged to disclose any unusual or large financial transactions involving politicians?  That proposal, outlined in the tribunal report, was designed by Fianna Fáil to flush out just such a contribution as Deputy Burke received.  Admittedly, had Deputy Burke received a cheque rather than the cash he appears to have received, bankers might never have seen the evidence of such a payment.  Deputy McDaid was part of a Front Bench which recommended that as soon as any such transaction would occur, there would be immediate disclosure by the bank. Fianna Fáil also proposed that a permanent ethics commission should be established to investigate such a contribution, not under the rather desultory rules of Dáil Question Time where answers must be accepted without further recourse but with the forensic powers of the High Court. Where has the zeal to deal with issues of public concern such as the probity of public office gone?</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke's statement yesterday was, at times, bizarre.  It was difficult to understand the manner in which he handled such a large contribution. He did not question the possible compromising position in which he placed himself or the reason such a large contribution was given to him.  Deputy Burke is unable to account for the expenditures which occurred even in broad terms. He indicated that he used the money for political purposes other than the election yet he apparently had no method to ensure the distinction between personal and political uses.  Such a distinction is an essential element of our tax laws.  If Deputy Burke is to claim such payments were not taxable it was necessary for him to maintain such a distinction.</P>
    <P>There are inconsistencies in the statements of the Minister, Deputy Burke, and those made by Mr. Bailey which were reported in the press.  On the other hand, there is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of any wrongdoing and Deputy Burke has categorically <Col N="773" /> denied that he did anything to benefit those who made the payment.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here; the Fine Gael party believes it would be unfair to include Deputy Burke's case in the full terms of reference of the tribunal as has been indicated in amendments Nos. 12 and 19 which say Deputy Burke should be subjected to the same detailed investigation as is to be applied in the cases of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  On the other hand, Fine Gael will support the amendment which has been tabled by Democratic Left in respect of Deputy Burke's case.  The procedure in the tribunal is essentially a two phase one where initially there will be the potential for private investigations of issues which may warrant further public investigation.  That is unfortunately the position in which Deputy Burke finds himself.  There is no <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing but there are many unanswered questions.  There is a clear need on the part of the Government and on the part of Deputy Burke to have this issue laid to rest completely.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's preferred approach to this issue is to have a mechanism for the banks to disclose such information and that a permanent ethics commission should be established to deal with it. There is not such an ethics commission at present but the logic of the Fianna Fáil position indicates that it should accept the amendment tabled by Democratic Left.  Acceptance of the amendment would allow the issue to be investigated in a private manner and a report could be made to the Dáil in a number of weeks to the effect that Members of the House have satisfied themselves there is nothing in these payments which warrants further investigation.  That would be a very satisfactory end to this saga.  If such action is not taken this issue will continue to be a problem for the Minister, Deputy Burke.  Since his statement yesterday people in the media have taken issue with specific replies which he made and evidence which he put on the Dáil record.  People are saying the Minister misquoted sources and there are other accounts of lands with which he had been associated.</P>
    <P>Questions will continue to be raised and Deputy Burke will remain under a cloud of public concern.  In the interests of this House, Deputy Burke's interests and those of the Government in which he serves, the Democratic Left amendment, which would allow this matter to be investigated in a private manner without embarrassment to Deputy Burke and without affecting the way he conducts his business, should be accepted by the Government.  That would lay the matter permanently to rest.  The logical position for the Government to take is to permit this preliminary type of private investigation to take place with the setting up of the new tribunal in the same way it envisages an ethics commission operating in the long-term.  That would finally clear the air in <Col N="774" /> regard to Deputy Burke.  Neither I nor my party have a vendetta against Deputy Burke but we want to see this matter resolved.  Unfortunately, it is linked to the broader debate taking place today.  We must set new standards for the future and this would be a good way for Fianna Fáil to demonstrate that it will genuinely set those standards.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Honourable Mr. Justice Brian McCracken on his tribunal report.  I read the report from cover to cover and, without being facetious, I found it to be a great read.  Not since John Grisham's novel <i>The Firm</i> was I so enthralled by a book.  The report gave an incisive view of the operation of offshore accounts and it flowed in an easily readable manner. I enthusiastically lent my copy of the report to my colleagues and to friends and they were all in awe of the way the story was told.  The 112 page report did not hold back any punches.  Judge McCracken reinstated the faith and confidence of the whole country in our justice system.  More than anything else the report highlighted the fact that there are tax evaders in society and that some tax evaders have been elected to this House.</P>
      <P>During the recent general election I found that Charles Haughey was held in very high esteem in my constituency, and that of Deputy Mitchell, in areas such as Drimnagh, Crumlin and Walkinstown. He was praised for introducing free bus travel passes, the decent increases in widows and old age pensions, succession rights for spouses &mdash; an important issue, his support for the arts, his involvement with Temple Bar and the development of the International Financial Services Centre. With Ray MacSharry as Minister for Finance and Deputy Bertie Ahern as Minister for Labour, in partnership with the social partners, he set about turning around the country's finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The esteem in which Mr. Haughey was held has been considerably lessened as a result of the findings of the recent tribunal.  The political system has suffered and, unfortunately, the perception of Ireland abroad has also suffered.  It must be remembered that, in regard to Mr. Haughey, the tribunal report states on page 51 that there appears to have been no political impropriety involved.  The report states on page 31 that there was no political impropriety on the part of Deputy Lowry.  It further states on page 32 that Deputy Lowry's motive was &ldquo;to enable him to evade tax&rdquo;.  On page 73 the report states that Mr. Haughey was involved &ldquo;in an attempt to ensure that the Revenue authorities would never know of the gifts&rdquo;.  I suggest that perhaps he was more <Col N="775" /> concerned that &ldquo;Seán Citizen&rdquo; would never know of the gifts, particularly taking into account the evidence that he rejected an offer of £1 million to sort out his tax affairs.  The Exchequer is owed serious sums of money in tax from both of these men.  There are others outside the political arena who had evaded taxes in the past and who have paid the cost.  We must remember there is no evidence of political impropriety in either case.  We should leave it to the independent tribunal to inquire further into this matter.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (k) of the motion the Dáil requests the tribunal to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary to ensure that the relationship of politics to private contributions and influence is always seen to be entirely above board and that the standards by which public policy is conducted are held in the highest esteem.  I would like to offer advice to the tribunal on that matter.</P>
    <P>I am beginning my Dáil career and I am not happy with the ethical standards we have set for ourselves or the way in which we regulate ourselves. As previous speakers said, we are members of the profession of political practitioners. It is a profession to which I and other Members give unstintingly of our time and effort. We continue to improve our art and ability to serve our constituents and the country well.  We do this without a code of ethics or comprehensive set of standards.  As a profession, we are in the dark ages in this regard.  We should form ourselves into an association like doctors, a society like lawyers or an institute like accountants and lay out a code of ethics and set of standards by which we must act.  That would give confidence to the public.</P>
    <P>In 2005 I do not want to suffer the anguish and trauma the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, suffered in the House yesterday merely because uncodified 1997 standards applied to actions which occurred eight years previously.  It is only by setting down a code of ethics and set of standards that we can avoid such an occurrence.</P>
    <P>I am a new Member of the Dáil and I am very disappointed at the level of distrust among Members.  We must get rid of this distrust, which is evident throughout the House.  I serve on Dublin County Council with councillors from Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Democratic Left and the Green Party.  We work together in the interests of the council and I would like to see a similar ethos in the Dáil.  In my constituency I work with Deputies Gay Mitchell and Pat Upton and Mr. Eric Byrne.  We support each other at meetings in the interests of our constituents.  I would like to see a similar trust among Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Burke, said:</P>
    <P>As all Members of this House will be aware, the last 25 years have seen a fundamental change in the operation of politics, with public <Col N="776" /> representatives or prospective public representatives having to operate ongoing and expensive constituency campaigns and services between and not merely during elections, such as newspaper advertisements, race nights, community contributions, leaflet drops, clinics and so on.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing financial requirement to fund these events and Deputies to whom I have spoken cannot afford to fund all their expenses from the constituency allowance provided by the State.  Ongoing political funding is necessary not only for election purposes but to meet day-to-day costs.  There must be accountability and transparency in all these financial matters.  The only statutory reference to the ongoing financing of the political expenses of a public representative of which I am aware is that personal donations from an individual or company which exceed £500 <i>in toto</i> over the period of a year must be declared to be Public Offices Commission.  This is not sufficient accountability.  The local branch of a political party that might have a cash flow of £500 in a year would normally have before its annual general meeting a financial report on its position setting out the funds raised and expenses incurred in a year.  Local residents' associations and small local organisations go through the same process.  The politician of today must be accountable to some other body for the funds used and for the discharge of their responsibilities as public representatives.</P>
    <P>We have a profession.  We practise the art of politics.  We have a duty to each other as politicians to do so to the highest ethical standards and in a regulated manner.  Doctors, lawyers, accountants, engineers and so on have such codes and standards.  Are we above having a code of ethics and our own regulatory body with perhaps the public interest being represented by the Ombudsman's office and compliance with the regulatory standards we ourselves set being assisted by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office?  There is a need to build up a belief and trust in politicians which the vast majority of politicians that I know deserve.  It is time to make it difficult for those politicians who do not live up to such demanding standards to continue in public life and to make it more attractive for those who are prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken in his report recommends criminalising breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act and that we consider legislation to bar any person found guilty of an offence under that Act from being eligible to become a Member of either House in the future.  I would like to see the possibility of any person who seriously breaches the ethics or standards set down for our profession being expelled from this House.  I sincerely hope that I do not see the need for the expulsion process in my time in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> Mr. Justice McCracken in his recommendations in the report does not consider it practical to prohibit all political contributions and to rely solely on public funding of political parties.  The magnitude of the sums discussed is huge.  A sentence in the report touches the public nerve.  It reads: &ldquo;the possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts or even be given without being sought is very high&rdquo;. The report further states: &ldquo;it is also not acceptable that any person or commercial enterprise should make such gifts in conditions of secrecy no matter how well intentioned the motives may have been&rdquo;.  We must examine the phrase &ldquo;such gifts&rdquo;.  In this instance it was £1.3 million, but what if it were £130,000, £13,000, £1,300 or £130. At what stage can such gifts be given secretly and be all right or be free from the possibility of favours being sought or given?  The only way I see around this quandary is to keep a transparent account of all donations and expenditure, to report all transactions on a yearly basis to a public offices commission and to have the Comptroller and Auditor General audit those accounts on a basis similar to that used by the Revenue Commissioners for revenue audits.  It is not right that all donations be made public as they would dry up, but it is right that public accountability be demonstrated by the involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Deputy Richard Bruton is strongly in favour of including the Ansbacher accounts in the terms of reference of the new tribunal.  I am strongly of the opinion that it is for the tax authorities to deal with the Ansbacher accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners stated that they were in attendance at the hearings of the tribunal.  In addition to that they confirmed to the Minister for Finance that following the tribunal report any action needed to uphold the implementation of the tax code in the light of the information contained in the report is being taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated that if Revenue seeks any additional powers to tackle this problem they will be included in the Finance Bill. There is also a realistic difficulty in that the Cayman Islands will not entertain any investigation into bank accounts which are a result of breaches of the tax code.  There is no way I would agree to remove the need for the Revenue Commissioners to investigate independently any breaches of the tax code.</P>
    <P>Part (ii) of amendment No. 3 should also be included.  This relates to &ldquo;the source of any money held.in any other bank accounts discovered by the Tribunal to be for the benefit [etc.].&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In regard to item (f) in the matters to be considered there is the question of &ldquo;the source of any money held.in accounts for the benefit or in the name of Mr. Lowry or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office.&rdquo;.  A number <Col N="778" /> of banks have been named, including the Allied Irish Bank in the Channel Islands and in Dame Street, Dublin, the Bank of Ireland (I.O.M.) Limited in the Isle of Man and the Irish Permanent Building Society, Patrick Street branch, Cork.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that others, to whom the tribunal of inquiry does not apply and to whom it was not intended that it would apply, may be inadvertently brought into the inquiry.  This could happen for many legitimate reasons.  Take, for instance, a wealthy tea merchant in Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanArdagh" hpid="Mr. Ardagh Mr. Ardagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ardagh</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have held funds in the Irish Permanent Building Society in Cork.  Ministers and their families have to buy houses.  It is not unlikely that he may have had money there. Why should he be brought into it on account of this matter?  If so, why are the banks in Tralee, Finglas or in County Meath not mentioned in this item?  It is unfair to include the words &ldquo;or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office.&rdquo; in this section.  That is one reason I would like to see the private investigations being held first before the public inquiry.</P>
      <P>The other matter of which I am glad the private investigations will be carried out in the first place is in connection with the Revenue Commissioners. In his speech, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has not specifically approved the inclusion of item (j) which refers to &ldquo;Whether the Revenue Commissioners availed fully, properly and in a timely manner in exercising the powers available to them in collecting or seeking to collect the taxation due by Mr. Michael Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey of the funds paid.&rdquo;.  The Minister set out a stout defence of the Revenue Commissioners.  I fully concur with him in his praise of the work of the Revenue Commissioners.  In the charter of rights for taxpayers it assumes that taxpayers will deal honestly and will fully disclose all income.  It further states that in deference to all taxpayers who are compliant it will impose heavy penalties on tax evaders.  Over the past ten years or so since this ethos came into the office of the Inspector of Taxes, taxpayers have become more compliant and tax revenue collection has improved substantially.</P>
      <P>To change that ethos now and to have action taken on the basis of allegations and pub talk would put the system of tax collection back ten years.  Revenue officials attended all the tribunal hearings and are taking whatever action is needed to uphold the implementation of the tax code.  It is important the inquiry into the action of the Revenue Commissioners relating to Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry should be in private. Only if serious breaches of conduct are suspected should that section of the inquiry be made public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Mr. Justice Brian McCracken on his report on payments to politicians which we asked him to investigate on <Col N="779" /> our behalf.  The report has rehabilitated the tribunal of inquiry as a device which this House and the Upper House can use to investigate matters of serious public concern.</P>
      <P>The earlier report by Mr. Justice Finlay, the former Chief Justice, likewise rehabilitated the reputation of tribunals of inquiry.  The effect of both reports is to confirm in our minds the utility of this particular procedure.  Parliament enacted the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, because it was found that parliamentary committees were not suitable bodies for investigating issues which involved contested facts.  Regrettably the natural prejudice which to some extent is associated with the practice of our profession as public representatives does not allow us to take a very detached view when issues of fact are at stake.</P>
      <P>That was brought out well yesterday in the question and answer session to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs consented.  It was clear that the process of questioning was directed, and very properly, by the Opposition to a particular political end.  However, that form of questioning and that type of approach is not a suitable method of investigating grave allegations.  Of course, in the case of the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday there was no substance in any of the allegations and that is why the matter is not being subjected to a tribunal of inquiry.</P>
      <P>It is important that we use the tribunal of inquiry device when there are serious and genuine allegations because it permits them to be investigated in a detached, calm and impartial manner.  That has clearly happened in the case of this report.</P>
      <P>Having read the report, the sad fact remains that misconduct on the part of a small number of office holders has sullied the reputation of the great majority of us.  The vast majority of public representatives come to this House to transact the public business of this State without thought of any private favour, advantage or interest. While it is inevitable, given the way modern communications operate, it is also disappointing that every Member of this House will be sullied by the findings of this report.  The popular assumption will be, and the popular judgment has already been made, that the vast majority of us are in some sense not up to any good in here.</P>
      <P>That is so far from the truth in the limited experience I have had of this House extending a little over a year.  It is obvious that the vast majority of public representatives work long hours and in a diligent manner on behalf of their constituents and in the consideration of the business of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various findings of fact which were arrived at in the report have already been considered at length in the various speeches and contributions. I do not want to go over them again but I noticed yesterday evening that Deputy John Bruton took the opportunity of suggesting that as a party and political organisation Fianna Fáil bore some sort <Col N="780" /> of collective guilt for the misconduct of a former leader which was established in the report.  None of us in any of the parties in this House can take any joy from the findings in the report because it is clear that the report exposed a culture whereby, as the preceding speaker said, we have not regulated in a proper way the relationship between public representative and the receipt of payments for election expenses.  We had not tried to regulate that relationship in a proper way until we enacted the Ethics in Public Office Act and other electoral legislation which is now in operation.</P>
    <P>Rather than trespassing further on to the issues of fact in the report, I would like to deal with its recommendations.  This was one of the shorter parts of the report and I must confess to being somewhat disappointed by it.  I thought the findings of fact, analysis of evidence and judgments made about the facts found by the chairman of the tribunal were excellent.  However, in considering what recommendations should be made in relation to the state of affairs established by the report it was rather brief.  Action is required in four main areas.  The first relates to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not need to deal with this at length because the Minister for Finance made an announcement yesterday evening and I agree with what he has proposed.  A review must be carried out to ensure the Revenue Commissioners have adequate power to investigate those whose lifestyles raise questions and reverse the normal presumption of honesty that applies in their dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>The second matter relates to political funding and the nature of the funds available to politicians to carry out their public work and to conduct election campaigns.  During the discussion on the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995, Fianna Fáil made it clear it fully supported the requirement that any donation over £500 should be disclosed. However, we had doubts about the workability of some of the proposals on limitations on election expenses and on State funding of political parties.  I accept that we must address this issue regardless of the technical objections and constitutional and statutory problems which may arise.</P>
    <P>It is clear that any payment, however small, can be construed as imposing an obligation on the public representative.  We want to ensure the public does not see it in this light and that a system of funding is in place for political and electoral expenses which does not waste the public's money or put the public figure under any obligation. We may have to examine options such as limitations on posturing and on grants towards printing expenses and reducing expenses incurred at elections.  The State spends a lot of money at elections to ensure that free post items are delivered to every voter.  That money could be used more effectively by giving it in the form of grants to candidates to print literature.  The Minister for the Environment is considering that option.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> There is also the question of offshore bank accounts.  The tribunal in its recommendations makes the point that since these transactions were carried out, the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995, have come into operation.  However, the report concedes that the offshore banking device would have evaded these measures as well.  It is not clear that these measures are adequate to address the problem identified in the report.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's representation at the tribunal submitted that professional advisers should be obliged to disclose the movement of large sums of money to public figures.  However, the chairman of the tribunal took the view that such an obligation could only be imposed on advisers within the State and that such provisions could easily be avoided by politicians or public servants acting through advisers and banks outside the State.  The tribunal's findings demonstrate that if a public figure wishes to engage in this type of misconduct, the funds must have some connection with the jurisdiction &mdash; a footprint must be left within the State.  Professional persons, who knew about these footprints, should be obliged to disclose them.  I found the report's conclusion in that regard unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>While there is understandable public interest in the two public figures involved, Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry, this tribunal and the previous tribunal on the beef industry show there is an unacceptable attitude among some substantial Irish concerns and their professional advisers towards compliance with revenue law.  This attitude is not alone unacceptable but it has imposed a far greater loss on the Exchequer than any transactions involving politicians.  We must examine professional obligations to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue is the establishment of an ethics commission.  I do not agree with the conclusion in the tribunal's report that the Ombudsman should be invested with powers.  The Ombudsman performs a valuable statutory function by investigating citizens' complaints about the Administration.  If we want to restore and maintain confidence in ourselves as servants of the public, a distinctive institution should be established to do that.  The all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution in its first progress report recommended that the various institutions concerned with probity in public life should be brought together as one effective unit.</P>

      <P>This is undoubtedly one of the most important debates in this House because the issue of integrity is at the core of the political system. Two senior politicians have already been shown to lack any shred of integrity or credibility through their behaviour in recent years.  Both Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Lowry were shown to be kept men.  They displayed a total disregard for honesty and for our tax and other laws.  They have shattered all confidence in politics and demeaned each one of us in this House.  Most <Col N="782" /> importantly, they have disappointed and demoralised the public by fuelling the now widely held view that all politicians are on the make.  The full force of the law must be applied and be clearly seen to be applied to both these men.  The PAYE worker who has been ripped off by them over the years expects and deserves nothing less.</P>
      <P>Politicians regularly talk about the importance of encouraging young people to vote and to become involved in the political system. However, there is surely no greater disillusionment or turnoff for young people, not to mention the rest of us, than the spectacle of these two disgraced politicians.  What many people cannot understand is how Mr. Charles Haughey was allowed to get away with it for so long and why, in spite of much anecdotal evidence &mdash; the dogs on the street on the north side of Dublin knew the circumstances surrounding Mr. Haughey's financial situation &mdash; his party colleagues were unable or unwilling to put a stop to it.  The notion that the State is continuing to pay for his comforts is repugnant and it should cease without delay. Similarly, given all that we now know about Deputy Lowry, he should immediately resign his membership of this House.  If he fails to do so, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should remove from him as many of the privileges of membership of this House as possible.</P>
      <P>This debate has the potential to be a watershed in Irish politics, but only if we honestly approach the task in hand.  It is critical that we systematically work our way through all those skeletons in the cupboard, all of the issues which have been mentioned in the amendments proposed by my party &mdash; Carysfort, Glending Wood, the Johnston, Mooney and O'Brien site, the Esat licence, etc.  There can be no room for whitewash or curtailment of the scope of the inquiry simply because of the possibility of disturbing cosy arrangements or upsetting the club.</P>
      <P>The examination of the Ansbacher accounts must be thorough and not merely confined to politicians.  In that respect, I repeat what my party leader, Deputy Spring, said last night, that it is impossible to escape the conclusion that every single person who invested in the Ansbacher accounts was involved knowingly in a highly orchestrated and well designed tax scam.  There is no reason to exempt this from scrutiny and disclosure. If the notion of zero tolerance is to mean anything to the Government, surely it should be applied in this case.  Similarly, the role of professional advisers, compliance under existing laws and possible recommendations of any necessary reform of these laws must also be included for examination by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>On political donations, the importance of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 and the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995 is now very evident. It is time to make flagrant breaches of these Acts a criminal offence, as suggested in the McCracken report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="783" /> It is also worth reminding the public of the vehemence with which both of these Bills were opposed by many in this House.  It would be quite interesting to examine the record to see what various Members said about what was being proposed. I resent the attempts to rubbish my party colleague, former Minister Eithne Fitzgerald, in her valiant attempts to steer those Bills through this House.</P>
    <P>We know about Deputy Lowry, Mr. Haughey and Deputy Burke but what else is there about which we do not know?  It is worth pointing out that the disturbing revelations about these three men were pure flukes.  There were no checks and balances in the system up until very recently.  We should not attempt to clap ourselves on the back as these matters arose by chance and we are very lucky they did.</P>
    <P>The scale of expenditure on elections by many politicians has made the cost of contesting an election almost prohibitive for ordinary people. There were many examples of this in the recent general election, especially among Fianna Fáil candidates.  Certainly there was evidence in my constituency, and adjoining constituencies with which I was familiar, of vast amounts of money, £40,000 to £50,000, being spent on election campaigns. Big colour posters, colour leaflets and regular and large advertisements in newspapers do not come cheap.  I estimate that I witnessed at first hand election campaigns in the Dublin area, including my constituency, which would have cost in excess of £50,000.  We could do with a separate inquiry to find out from where these vast sums of money have come.  It would also be interesting to know how Fianna Fáil and, indeed, Fine Gael managed to clear their massive debts since 1992 during their periods in Government.  How many other lists are there similar to that list of Ben Dunne?</P>
    <P>Is it agreeable that I share my time with my colleague, Deputy McDowell?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having generously given way to Deputy Shortall, I am happy also to give way to Deputy McDowell provided the Deputies do not make unfounded statements about Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact that very large election debts were cleared in a short time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from it being wrong for a person in public life to accept large sums of money because of the obvious potential for abuse, the often quoted mantra that no political favours were sought or granted is simply not believable.  Most people accept that one rarely gets something for nothing and it follows that the bigger the donation, the bigger the expected favour.  Deputy Burke said yesterday that in hindsight it may not have been a good idea to accept what was in essence large <Col N="784" /> bundles of cash from a stranger.  What does this say about Deputy Burke's judgment?  There are huge questions remaining about that incident.</P>
    <P>I resent his statement that he was criticised for actions committed by him in 1989 by standards only put in place this year.  This is nonsense.  Many of us have spent our political careers trying to get action on these issues.  Our standards have not changed.  We still have those beliefs.  We had those beliefs in 1989 and articulated them clearly in recent years while the Labour Party was in Government.  Most ordinary people view this type of transaction as highly suspect and quite distasteful.</P>
    <P>I also resent attempts by Deputy Burke yesterday to spread the muck on this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I resent attempts here yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, to spread the muck on this issue.  We witnessed quite a performance.  Most of us and the general public made up our own minds on it, but I was outraged at the spectacle of Deputy Burke going out on to the plinth and declaring that this matter was now closed.  How dare he say that?  It is not up to him to pass judgment on his highly suspect behaviour over many years and I object in the strongest possible terms to his attempt to close the book on this issue.  The matter is not closed and it is critically important that it be examined. We were not given any explanations of the circumstances surrounding the payment of a huge sum of money to a senior politician, the reasons it was paid by a stranger and the possible strings which might have been attached so we propose that this matter be included in the terms of reference of the new tribunal with a view to establishing whether there are grounds to proceed to a further inquiry.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party also proposes, by way of amendment to an amendment already submitted, that the public proceedings of the tribunal should be televised.  The public deserves nothing less.  It is essential if we are to give any meaning to the term transparency that the proceedings of this new tribunal be televised so that the public can see at first hand the manner in which business and politics are conducted in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. McDowell Mr. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us in this House and, indeed, the public generally owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice McCracken and his team. They did their work expeditiously and in a fine way, and came up with conclusions and recommendations which are concise and to the point. It will have gone some distance to restoring the public's faith in tribunals of inquiry of this kind. Certainly, it has done something to restore my faith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I have a perspective on at least one of the aspects covered by this tribunal in that I represent the constituency which was represented for many years by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, the constituency now known as Dublin North-Central. Many thousands of people in my constituency supported Mr. Haughey and his family, loyally and conscientiously, over a number of decades.  It is particularly instructive to listen to and consider the reaction of many of those people to the events which unfolded during the summer.</P>
    <P>I should also state that many people in the constituency did not support Mr. Haughey.  Another former and renowned representative of the constituency, Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, obtained many votes largely on the basis that he doubted the probity of Mr. Haughey and said so publicly on many occasions.  There were many doubters who were not duped.  However, many people supported Mr. Haughey and continue to do so.  That is the point I wish to make because it is my strong belief that if Mr. Haughey were to seek election in my constituency in the near future the likelihood is that those who supported him in the past would do so again.</P>
    <P>I refer to this matter not in any sense to pass judgment on those who bear with Mr. Haughey. It is merely my intention to ask what this tells us about the political system, people's thoughts regarding that system and their expectations of politicians.  The bottom line is that the people who supported Mr. Haughey and who would continue to do so are satisfied that they received good service and, frankly, do not particularly care about the standards he employed in his private life and the way he maintained his lifestyle.  They do not care because they believe many of us are involved in politics for what we can get out of it. There is a deep public cynicism on that score.</P>
    <P>Charles J. Haughey did many good and laudable things in the public domain.  As already stated, I have more cause than most to be reminded about his achievements on a regular basis.  Sadly, however, those achievements are now hugely devalued by the facts revealed to the tribunal during the summer.  Facts about his personal life which have come to light have, in many ways, devalued the public work he carried out while serving as a Deputy for my constituency, as Taoiseach and as a Minister.  His refusal to cooperate with the tribunal must exacerbate our judgment.  The tribunal report sets out the matter in graphic and painful detail in chapter ten which is simply and starkly entitled, &ldquo;Offence by Mr. Charles Haughey&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The damage to the reputation of Charles Haughey may be irreparable but the damage to our political system, in the interests of everyone, must be repaired.  We can do this by ensuring that all available information is made public at the earliest opportunity.  This is a painful and unpleasant business but the bottom line is that we <Col N="786" /> are entitled to know what is or has been done in our name and with our money.</P>
    <P>There are few enough saints in this House and it is correct that this should be the case.  No one is suggesting that a perfect state of grace should be a prerequisite for membership of this House. It would be a much poorer place if that were the case.  Most of us accept, for example, that the private and family lives of Members are, in the majority of circumstances, not a matter of public interest.  That said, however, the public is entitled to basic standards of probity from Members of this House.  In particular, it is entitled to know whether the capacity of any Member &mdash; this obviously applies tenfold to Members who hold public office &mdash; to discharge his or her public duty is or could be compromised by a conflict of interest, however that might arise.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that members of local authorities have long been required to declare their property interests and withdraw from meetings where a conflict of interests could arise.  It was also for that reason that the Labour Party sought and obtained agreement from our then partners in Government to introduce the Ethics in Public Bill in 1995.  As Deputy Shortall stated, it is worth reflecting that the then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, was mocked and vilified by many Members on the other side of the House for her approach to that Bill.  She was accused of slaying dragons which did not exist and sullying the good name of politicians by suggesting that we should guard against abuse of the political system which was, as we are now aware, open to such abuse. I recall speaking to the then Minister of State at that time and she informed me that she would have liked to go further but she could not obtain agreement from her then partners in Government.</P>
    <P>It is strange to remark that some of those people are now saying, no doubt sincerely, that the Ethics in Public Office Act must be strengthened. I agree with that view.  I was a member of the all-party committee on the Constitution during the course of the last Dáil which recommended the permanent establishment of a body which would incorporate the constituency review committee and an investigative body to investigate allegations of the kind which came to light in recent months.  There cannot be a constant series of tribunals but there must be a body with statutory powers which can be used when serious abuses are alleged.</P>
    <P>It may be that the self-regulation which is at the basis of the Ethics in Public Office Act is sufficient to deal with most breaches or alleged breaches of that Act. However, there will be circumstances where something more formal and public is required.  I agree with Judge McCracken's recommendation that serious breaches of the Act should be a criminal offence.  If that were the case, it would be necessary in the interests of equity and natural justice that the individual concerned <Col N="787" /> should be answerable to the courts and not merely this House.</P>
    <P>Judge McCracken's report also provides much information about the banking system.  I must confess to a certain <i>naiveté</i> on this issue.  I had the notion that offshore accounts were, in some real sense, offshore.  I thought that in order to lodge money in a bank situated in the Cayman Islands one would be obliged to make contact with such a bank.  Clearly the truth is very different.  I recently read an amusing article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which a journalist mused that by simply walking off the street in St. Stephen's Green into a large bank one could close one's eyes and imagine the sounds of the Caribbean.  The truth is that any citizen in Dublin can walk into a bank and lodge money to or withdraw it from an account which is technically &ldquo;offshore&rdquo;.  There is a requirement that this must be declared to the Revenue Commissioners but we can be forgiven for treating that stipulation with a hefty pinch of salt.  The bottom line is simply that Irish citizens can evade tax by using and abusing the banking system and the global capital market.</P>
    <P>This is a subject about which the public wants and is entitled to know more.  How many people who are tax resident in Ireland hold overseas accounts?  What measure of money is concerned? Why and how do we facilitate banks based in tax haven countries in operating in Ireland.  It could be that these questions are in themselves naive. We are aware that banks in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland operate under rules which most of us would regard as distasteful.  Could it be, however, that I need look no further than the boundaries of my constituency to the IFSC to encounter activities and regulations which are less than exacting?</P>
    <P>I wish to remark upon the contribution of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to yesterday's debate which, I believe, hammers another nail into the coffin of public confidence in the political system. Before going further, it is important to be fair to the Minister in terms of his statement.  There is no evidence that he was guilty of any wrongdoing, other than the so far unsubstantiated remarks of one person.  It may be that such evidence exists but in the interim the Minister is fully entitled to the benefit of the doubt.  However, there certainly is doubt and the Minister acknowledged that he was guilty of an error of judgment in allowing circumstances to arise where such doubt could occur.  Setting aside the doubt and innuendo, let us consider the facts set out by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I listened with some astonishment to the comments of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Like most Members I would like to believe that I do a reasonable job.  However, I cannot imagine circumstances where someone I do not know might approach me and say, &ldquo;Listen Derek, I think you are doing a good job.  Here's a few bob for yourself <Col N="788" /> and the party&rdquo;.  If I opened the envelope afterward and discovered £30,000 in cash I would ask myself some serious questions.  The fact that the Minister does not appear to have done so is extraordinary.  The Minister said that we are applying the standards of 1997 to something which happened in 1989.  This argument is simply beyond me.  In the 1980s speculation abounded about possible corruption in some rezoning decisions taken then.  Allegations were made in particular about Dublin County Council of which Deputy Burke had been a member.  In those circumstances it was unwise in the extreme for a senior politician to accept an enormous unsolicited gift from an individual involved in the building industry.</P>
    <P>For the sake of public confidence, it is important to say that this is not how most politicians fund their election campaigns.  I have never received a contribution remotely similar to the sum mentioned by Deputy Burke and I suspect that is true of most colleagues but, having listened to him yesterday in many ways we operate in entirely different worlds.  I have never paid anybody to canvass for me or to put up a poster and I hope I never have to.  I speak for most Members and candidates in saying that but there are an increasing number of candidates who spend a great deal of money.  We need to think long and hard about just where this is leading us.</P>
    <P>The McCracken report identifies one payment of £20,000 to Mrs. Maureen Haughey as a contribution towards her husband's expenses in the 1989 general election.  I stood in that election in that constituency and I am reasonably certain that the total expenditure of all other candidates would scarcely have come to more than that amount.  Mr. Charles Haughey, as one of three Fianna Fáil candidates, received more in that donation than all the other parties spent during the course of the election campaign in that constituency. This is not simple begrudgery.  This has profound implications for our democracy and none of us are naive in this matter.</P>
    <P>Our capacity to get across our message depends to some degree on the resources which we can deploy.  It is probably pushing it too far to say votes can be bought but it is certainly true that one must package one's message well to get onto the pitch.  We need real debate and choices in a healthy democracy.  This simply cannot happen if one party or candidate is rich enough or has enough rich friends to swamp the electorate in a sea of glossy brochures and posters.  Other democracies have long accepted that election expenditure should be controlled and capped. The Electoral Bill passed a few months ago contains provisions to that effect and I hope and trust that the Government will make good its commitment to introduce those regulations without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> However, we need to go further and accept that private funding of political parties is a dangerous business.  It is not healthy that political parties should be almost entirely dependent on private donations.  Former Deputy Michael McDowell made a strident argument on Committee Stage of the Electoral Bill in regard to the right of individuals to spend their money as they liked.  He went further in that he asserted there was a constitutional right to contribute to political parties.  That may be so but if there is such a right then it can hardly extend to large donations such as that received by Minister Burke.  How can it possibly be in the public interest to allow one or more rich people to affect and distort election results by bankrolling individuals or parties?  How can it possibly be in the public interest if one side of an argument is not heard because the proponents of it simply do not have the money to enable it be heard?</P>
    <P>There is only one solution to this problem, State funding.  The McKenna judgment circumscribes our capacity to fund parties for election purposes and that is fair.  However, funding of political parties between elections is essential for democracy and it must be done with all the accountability and transparency that necessarily employs.  The Government is committed to abolishing those sections of the Electoral Act which provide for State funding.  I hope sincerely that it rethinks its attitude.  If it does not, we will be left with the intolerable position that political parties will depend on rich people or corporations who may expect something in return.</P>
    <P>Judge McCracken has revealed many unpleasantries but his report and the climate it creates can be used in order to ensure our political system is cleared up.  Our democracy will be the healthier for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which we perform our duties, discharge our responsibilities and meet our obligations is a legitimate topic for public scrutiny. Our conduct as Members of the House and in matters which relate to our membership must always be open to public scrutiny.  Of necessity, that means as public representatives our affairs must be open to a greater public interest than the affairs of other citizens.  Each candidate for public <Col N="790" /> office knowingly accepts this because public confidence in the workings of the House is the cornerstone of Irish democracy.</P>
    <P>The revelations late last year that persons in public life had received substantial payments and benefits from a wealthy businessman sent shock waves through the political system.  The scale of that shock reflected not alone the substance of the allegations but also their rarity.  Those disclosures were unprecedented in our political history and warranted swift and vigorous investigation and action.  The response of the House in establishing a tribunal of inquiry under Mr. Justice McCracken was a correct and measured one.  The terms of reference were sufficiently precise to permit a short and focused inquiry on the central issues.  Its result leaves no room for doubt or prevarication. The McCracken report tells the truth in plain English.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken concluded:</P>
    <P>It is quite unacceptable that a member of Dáil Éireann, and in particular a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He also concluded that:</P>
    <P>It is an appalling situation that a Government Minister and Chairman of a Parliamentary Party can be seen to be consistently benefiting from the black economy from shortly after the time he was first elected to Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those conclusions represent damning indictments of the conduct of the individuals involved.  If the tribunal achieved nothing else it pierced the dense and deliberately created smokescreens and exposed to public view matters which the participants had taken great trouble to conceal. However, the ramifications of the tribunal go far beyond the unacceptable facts revealed in those two conclusions.</P>
    <P>The revelations as to the unorthodox business practices of Mr. Ben Dunne during the period of his stewardship of the Dunnes Stores group leave the distinct impression that compliance with the provisions of tax legislation was viewed as an option rather than a necessity.  I trust this issue is being actively pursued by various State agencies and the disclosed wrongdoing is dealt with in accordance with laws enacted by the House.  If, however, it should transpire that existing mechanisms are inadequate to deal with the disclosed and unacceptable practices then I would have no hesitation in supporting the establishment of a further tribunal of inquiry into the activities of Mr. Dunne and his former company.  The law applies to big as well as little fellows.</P>
    <P>The report of the McCracken tribunal has raised for proper public debate the issues of the integrity of our democratic process and the public <Col N="791" /> perception of it.  If there is widespread public perception that Members of this House may be open to improper external influence then, collectively, we forfeit the respect of the people.  If we as the people's representatives forfeit their respect, then the integrity of the Oireachtas is damaged and the cornerstone of democracy is loosened.  Each of us has a duty to ensure that this does not occur.</P>
    <P>On 25 August the Taoiseach, in welcoming the publication of Mr. Justice McCracken's report, stated:</P>
    <P>The acceptance of large gifts or payments or personal benefits in a surreptitious manner or the large scale evasion of tax and exchange control regulations by even one or two senior serving politicians is deeply damaging to trust in politics.</P>
    <P>That statement expressly recognised not alone that the conduct involved was wrong but that it had consequences which went beyond the two individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>Our response to the wider issues raised by the McCracken report must be twofold.  First, we must take whatever action is necessary to pursue those questions which have been raised by this report but not answered because they fell outside its terms of reference.  Second, we must examine such safeguards as are in existence so as to ensure that conduct of this nature cannot be repeated.  I have noticed a disappointing tendency in Opposition contributions to this debate to seek to suggest that others are in some way implicated or involved in the conduct denounced in this report. To engage in debate of that nature is to shirk the fundamental responsibility of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Our primary duty is to the democratic institutions of this State and to ensure that they are protected and strengthened.  If and when questions arise which cast a shadow on the workings of this democracy, we have a duty to take every reasonable step to answer them and to lift the shadow.  The report of the McCracken tribunal has cast such a shadow.  Our duty is to move forward with concrete proposals rather than to use the report as a vehicle for unjustifiable political point scoring and character assassination.  It is for us to pursue the questions which, of necessity, the tribunal left unanswered.</P>
    <P>In considering the tribunal report and our response, it is important to see the issues which it has raised in their correct context.  The issues raised by this report are not in any way unique to Ireland.  In the past both Britain and the United States have had to deal with the same issues.  In May 1995 Lord Nolan presented to the British Parliament his first report on standards in public life.  He and his committee stated in their report:</P>
    <P>We cannot say conclusively that standards of behaviour in public life have declined.  We can <Col N="792" /> say that conduct in public life is more rigorously scrutinised than it was in the past, that the standard which the public demands remain high, and that the great majority of people in public life meet those high standards.</P>
    <P>Those conclusions apply equally to elected representatives here.  I believe the same principles of conduct which underpin public life in Britain apply here.  These seven principles stated by Lord Nolan are selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.</P>
    <P>The report of the McCracken tribunal indicates clearly that in the case of certain individuals there has been a departure from some of those principles. It was not within the terms of reference of the McCracken tribunal to deal with the full extent of that departure.  Much of what is now a legitimate cause for public concern only came to light in the course of the tribunal's proceedings. It is, however, now a legitimate matter for public inquiry and it is our duty to set about that inquiry in as efficient and economical a manner as is possible.</P>
    <P>Our response must be measured and calculated. The McCracken report has received universal acclaim.  It cut through issues which were complicated and complex to reveal with blinding clarity the truth which lay behind the smokescreen. Much of the credit for this must go to Mr. Justice McCracken and his legal team who appear to have combined a ruthless determination with courteous efficiency.  They did their work well and deserve our thanks.</P>
    <P>When considering the success of the tribunal we must also look to its terms of reference.  The practical lesson of the McCracken tribunal and the Finlay tribunal is that well focused terms of reference can result in a clear and precise report. Ill-focused terms of reference, such as occurred with the beef tribunal, result in protracted proceedings where the cost arguably outweighs such public good as may result.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish a tribunal of inquiry is one which cannot be undertaken lightly.  It is a decision which ought not to be undertaken by this House without just cause.  We, no less than any other institution in this State, owe a duty of fairness to all the citizens of this country.  A tribunal of inquiry is of necessity intrusive and onerous on those whose conduct it seeks to scrutinise.  A decision to subject any citizen to such an inquiry ought not to be taken on a whim, it ought not be used as a crude political weapon to torment opponents and it ought not be established without good reason and just cause.</P>
    <P>This House has a duty to act fairly and that duty is all the more onerous because it is unclear as to whether a decision of this House to establish a tribunal of inquiry on specific terms can be reviewed elsewhere.  The doctrine of separation of powers serves to separate the Legislature from the courts.  Laws which we pass may be reviewed <Col N="793" /> and struck down by the courts if they fail to comply with the Constitution.  Whether resolutions of this House may be similarly reviewed remains unclear.  The sovereign voice of the people, spoken through their parliament, ought not be lightly set aside nor should the right of all our citizens to expect fair treatment be discarded.  The primary responsibility for striking the correct balance rests with us.</P>
    <P>A further tribunal is necessary.  The proposed terms of reference are fair and justified.  The report of the McCracken tribunal provides what American jurists would call &ldquo;probable cause&rdquo; and what we would term &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; for establishing a further tribunal to inquire into the matters specified in the proposed terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a new tribunal of inquiry represents a proper response to the McCracken report.  It is not, however, a complete response. We need to examine the legislation which governs the conduct of Members with a view to seeing if it can be improved or strengthened.  Mr. Justice McCracken noted that the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and the Electoral Act, 1997, amounted to commendable efforts to ensure that the unacceptable financial transactions which he found would not be repeated.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has suggested in its submission to the tribunal that an independent third party be appointed to monitor and investigate possible breaches of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  The tribunal recommended that consideration be given to extending the remit of the Ombudsman so as to include those functions.  The tribunal also recommended that candidates for election to either House of the Oireachtas should have to produce a tax clearance certificate.  These matters must be addressed as a matter of priority and, if considered necessary, enacted into law.  The statement yesterday by the Taoiseach shows a clear determination on the part of the Government to act on foot of those recommendations.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish the McCracken tribunal and the decision which we will take today are clear signals to the public and to those in public life that the standards expected of public representatives, both by their fellow public representatives and by the public, go substantially beyond mere compliance with the criminal and civil laws. There is an implied trust placed on persons in public life by those who put them there.  The exact extent of that trust can be difficult to define with mathematical precision but it can be summarised in the word &ldquo;honourable&rdquo;.  Those who send us here expect us to act in an honourable manner.  The Taoiseach spoke for the entire Fianna Fáil organisation when, on 19 April last, he said:</P>
    <P>Participation in the democratic life of this country is about public service not self-service or the sustaining of a certain lifestyle.  It is the <Col N="794" /> Oireachtas and ultimately the people who decide what our political leaders and representatives are paid and who provide them with the appropriate facilities.  Even if in the particular case there were no favours sought or given we could not condone the practice of senior politicians seeking or receiving from a single donor large sums of money or services in kind..</P>
    <P>I sought election to this House as a member of Fianna Fáil.  It is a party of which I have been an active member for in excess of two decades.  It comprises tens of thousands of people who seek to participate in the civic life of their country through political activity.  Their political involvement is an honourable involvement.  Their efforts are decent and democratic.  I resent the continuing efforts which are made to suggest that Fianna Fáil is in some unspecified way inferior to other parties, that our standards are, in some unspecified way, less than those of other parties, that we are, in some way which nobody cares or dares to specify, not to be trusted.</P>
    <P>It is deeply ironic that those who queued with palms outstretched to receive the bizarre munificence of Mr. Ben Dunne come to this House and seek to cloak themselves in spurious superiority. In the course of this debate I have listened to threadbare efforts to link decent, honourable members of Fianna Fáil with the activities of one of the individuals denounced in this report.  I find it sad that parliamentary colleagues who in private will openly acknowledge each other's honesty consider it necessary to cast unwarranted aspersions in the course of public debate.  It is as if by denigrating others their own stature is in some way enhanced.  All they achieve is the debasement of the profession of politics.  It is a goal which is neither noble nor constructive.</P>
    <P>The new tribunal will explore matters of great public interest.  It must be allowed to do so in a completely unfettered manner.  As to the consequences, <i>fiat justitia ruat caelum</i>&mdash; let justice be done though the heavens fall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I compliment Mr. Justice Brian McCracken and his tribunal team on producing such a clear, concise and succinct report.  For a non-legal person it is, unlike many such reports, eminently readable. For that alone we must be thankful.  The conclusions drawn and the recommendations made will help to lay a new foundation for standards in public life for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By comparison with many of our European partners, we are a relatively young democracy.  In a sense we are still on a learning curve in the development of standards of best practice to allow that democracy to flourish in the real sense. We were extraordinarily lucky in our emerging years as a new State to have so many visionary statesmen and women who had a very clear idea of how they saw democracy flourishing through a vigorous parliamentary system.  Most were idealists. <Col N="795" /> Many were pragmatists as well.  By and large, they were all inspired and driven by a sense of public duty and by the value of the process of politics and of unselfish public service.  It strikes me that many of these founding members of our State had an independence of means which gave them a freedom of thought and action which perhaps those of us who may now be termed professional politicians may not have to the same extent.  To the extent that they did not always have to look over their shoulders to examine the implications of decisions in electoral terms, they had room for more courageous decision-making.</P>
    <P>In the course of the recent recess I read again the biography of the former Tory MP, Julian Critchley, entitled <i>A Bag of Boiled Sweets.</i>  It struck me that there are lessons to be learned from the contribution of what might be termed the members from the shires to the evolution of parliamentary democracy there.  We have good examples in the early years of this State of Members from all parties and from none, from the professions and from the trade unions, who made a considerable contribution to this State, and they did not look to the safety net of a Dáil seat when they were making their decisions.  It may also have meant that their <i>modus operandi</i>was, to a great extent, divorced from the lives of the people they represented.  I heard a number of speakers refer to &ldquo;people out there&rdquo; and to &ldquo;ordinary people&rdquo;.  If anything needs to be adjusted in our mindset as parliamentarians, it is that we must be ordinary people, always listening and interacting with the people out there.  The day we think that as soon as we step inside the Kildare Street gate and on to the plinth we have undergone a mysterious metamorphosis is the day we lose touch with reality.  Far be it from me to preach or to lecture Deputies who have devoted years of honest and dedicated service to the public, but it seems that the ability to listen to the views of the most truculent member of the public is an essential requirement for the tool bag of a TD.</P>
    <P>For the past 30 years I have worked as a teacher.  Apart from the task of imparting knowledge, the greatest influence any teacher has on young people is in being able to inculcate values in them which make them good citizens. However, trust, integrity, courage, good judgment and openness are but some of the qualities we would expect to see in any well-rounded personality. It always disappointed me greatly if these qualities were deficient in the students I turned out.  These are traits and qualities which the public expect in their public representatives.  It is not, however, good enough to possess them.  It is expected that we display them in the way we frame policies and make our decisions, even in the way we live our lives.  That does not mean that we should set ourselves up as plaster saints. It does mean that we must expect that our public behaviour is constantly under the microscope and open to scrutiny.  It is for this reason that I particularly <Col N="796" /> welcome the proposal to develop a public ethics commission.</P>
    <P>It may be a cliché, but we are at a defining moment in the life of our democracy.  Mould-breaking discussions are about to get under way as part of the peace process.  Courageous leaders of all strands of political opinion in Northern Ireland are about to sit down with the two Governments opposite each other or even in adjacent rooms to explore how the very fragile democratic process can be nurtured and enabled to flourish so that future generations on this island can contribute to positive democratic debate.  It is important therefore that we put discredited ways of doing things behind us.  All our dealings must not only be open but be seen to be open.</P>
    <P>The US democratic system is probably the most open and most transparent in the world. The mechanism of public hearings into the suitability of nominated office holders is an excellent example of this transparency.  While these hearings have sometimes descended into what might appear to be circuses or show trials set up to satisfy public curiosity, on balance they serve the public interest extremely well.  We would do well to move in their direction.  The proposed public ethics commission is desirable and I commend the Taoiseach and the Government for their initiative. Public life will be served well by it and it will do much to restore public confidence and trust in the operation of Government.</P>
    <P>I am one of the recently elected Deputies who has served a 12 year apprenticeship in a local authority.  I was elected to the Dáil on my third attempt, so it is fair to say that I wanted to become a full-time politician.  It is a humbling experience not only to come into this House as one of the representatives of Dublin North-West to join colleagues whose honesty and integrity I admire and whose work rate I hope to match.  It is an even more daunting experience to come into this Chamber and to attempt, however inadequately, to lay out my stall and indicate what my expectations of my role are.  I want to pick the best of what I see around me and learn from the experiences and contributions of Members of the current Dáil and of those no longer here.  The contributions of some of the founding members of the State have inspired me.  I am in awe of much of the work they have done.  I am dismayed and greatly disappointed at the earlier attitude of a small number of people who, though totally devoted to public life abused their very special position and dragged the whole profession of politics into disrepute.  If we expect the consent of the governed to be forthcoming then the people who govern must be the essence of probity and integrity.  I therefore welcome the establishment of a new tribunal as proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>I came into this House to help frame legislation which will ensure the continued development of a healthy democracy.  I do not want to spend the next few years poring over the entrails of times <Col N="797" /> past.  The past must be rigorously investigated and the faulty punished.  The lessons learned from these investigations must be incorporated into legislation.  We must search elsewhere for models of best practice into the operation of the parliamentary process and procedure and into monitoring standards in public life.  Much of our current practices need little adjustment, but where improvements can be made they should be implemented without prevarication.</P>
    <P>In recent years, we have seen the fragile flower of democracy emerge in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.  We saw the spectacle of the first time voters in South Africa travel for days over deserts to exercise their hard won right to vote.  Today the people of Scotland vote in a referendum to decide whether they can have their own parliament. This is not simply a public relations exercise. It is the culmination of the fight by the people of Scotland to have a real say in running their affairs.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we have become too complacent and take too much for granted.  Complacency is a malaise which we must avoid at all costs.  It breeds cynicism and cynicism breeds alienation.  Once people are alienated and to all intents and purposes outside the loop, it is difficult to give them a sense of ownership of what is happening. Unfortunately, we have plenty of evidence of alienation in our society and it is not all to do with the unequal distribution of the benefits of the Celtic Tiger economic boom.  For whatever reason, a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; society has emerged in recent years in parallel with the perceived irrelevance of the parliamentary process to the lives of the people who ought to be beneficiaries of the significant advance in social and economic progress. There is something wrong when children as young as nine or ten years decide that school is irrelevant.  There is something wrong when parents seem hell bent on defending offending children when checking or simple chastisement is called for.  There is also something inherently unhealthy about referring to our young people as problems rather than assets.  There is something strange in a society which opposes care for the helpless and the marginalised in their communities. There is also something strange about a society which has so many people registered as unemployed but notices in many restaurant windows stating &ldquo;Staff Wanted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those examples of exclusion from mainstream society are disturbing.  Their causes must be addressed and corrected.  Resources must be committed to closing that yawning gap between those who see themselves as stakeholders in our society and those who feel no sense of ownership.  In correcting these inadequacies and imbalances, the attitudes and actions of those in this House and in public life will be watched closely by people who have lost confidence in us.  We need only listen to any vox pop to hear painful reminders of how irrelevant and out of touch we are.  Every one of us is seen to be on the make.  I am afraid a great cleansing is called for if we are to win <Col N="798" /> back the confidence we have lost and gain the respect we all crave.</P>
    <P>I therefore applaud the actions of the Taoiseach and the Government in setting the mechanism necessary for that vital restoration of confidence in public life.  I urge all Members to support this approach.  It is the only approach that will bear fruit and ultimately restore confidence in the democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a past critic of the administration of the courts in particular and the legal profession and my criticisms were levelled with sincerity.  It was something that needed to be said and I hope those involved in the administration of the courts take on board those criticisms. However, the work done by Mr. Justice Finlay and in this case by Mr. Justice McCracken has gone a long way towards restoring my confidence in the ability of the Judiciary to make itself relevant and to deal with important issues.  Mr. Justice McCracken has done a great job.  I hope other members of the legal profession, judges and those involved in the administration of the courts will follow his example and use their skills in an innovative way to restore the confidence in that wing of Government which we in another way must restore in this wing of Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell and others said the standards people see is what they expect from politicians. The majority of people knew that Charles Haughey was not funding himself from his salary from this House and, to a large extent, the public shares in that dishonesty.  It is time we as representatives of the public were able to speak openly and honestly.  I apologise if what I have to say causes embarrassment, but it is likely the majority of farmers who receive cash payments would do the same as Mr. Haughey or Deputy Lowry.  The majority of grocers and, dare I say barristers, when they received cash payments before making returns for VAT, would also do likewise.  What does that say about those barristers who later became judges?  Let us stop the hypocrisy.  Those people did not expect any more from politicians because that is how they lived their lives.  We should admit that the majority of the Members of the House and of the public were well aware that Charles Haughey was not funding himself from his political income.  The country is partly to blame for this scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hanafin made an eloquent speech. Fianna Fáil has a particular problem which I will try to address as impartially as an Opposition Deputy prosecuting the Government can, in the hope that we can restore some of Fianna Fáil's greatness not merely for its sake but for the sake of the Opposition because we pace ourselves off each other.  Fianna Fáil must face up to its problem. It is pointless saying we are all the same.  A particular problem has been identified and it must be exorcised and dealt with by Members on all sides of the House.  Many Members on this side of the House as well as members of the public are sneaking regarders of Charles Haughey. <Col N="799" /> We must admit our capacity for dishonesty.  There is a range of issues with which we are not willing to deal.  We dare not discuss NATO or hold a rational debate on abortion.  We dishonestly shove such matters to one side.  While the majority of people knew Charles Haughey was doing this, very few questions were asked when he was returned as Taoiseach on three occasions. Consequently the public shares part of the responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is a general perception that politicians today should not be trusted.  We should read what Shakespeare, Swift and other noted people said about politicians down through the years.  In recent times our former party leader, Dr. FitzGerald has been writing about what happened at the time of the foundation of the State and how things have moved on since then.  How did the de Valera family become owners of the <i>Irish Press</i> and a particular Fine Gael family become owners of the Irish Sweepstake?  Let us not think these are new issues, there have always been scandals in politics.  If we are putting everything on the table let us speak honestly and openly.  What happens in this House is that we reflect, in many ways, the standards people expect, because those are the standards they expect of themselves.</P>
    <P>We should consider what Deputy Ardagh said about dishonesty.  Recently, for the first time in over a decade, I took up a business interest outside this House, which I will declare in the normal course of events.  I did it for a number of reasons, not only for the money but because I need to do something outside politics.  I hope I can bring what I have experienced in politics to business and what I learn in business back to politics. However, I find that in business as in the public service relatively junior people are paid vastly more than Members of this House who are in insecure employment.  In any other profession or walk of life people in insecure employment are paid more because they have short-term contracts or an uncertain future.  We have allowed ourselves to be painted as doing something out of the ordinary if we even apply what an independent commission has decided should be our rate of pay.</P>
    <P>I share a constituency with Deputy Briscoe, who has been over 30 years in the House.  I have been here for 17 years.  Deputy Briscoe has never been a Minister, he is a hard-working Deputy and I find him a good colleague with whom to work. Should he not receive service pay for all the years' work he has given to this House?  We should stop denigrating ourselves.  We should stand up for ourselves, remunerate ourselves properly in a reasoned and fair way and stop apologising for that, because as long as we do, we will have to rely on outside people to fund our campaigns.  Does anyone think I could fund my electoral campaign from what I am paid for serving in this House?  Six people, my wife, my four children and myself, all live off my Dáil salary.  I do not say it is the worst salary available but what <Col N="800" /> is left after paying PAYE is not enough to fund a campaign.  All of this must be regulated and due consideration must be given to this in the way we do our business.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, said:</P>
    <P>Recent reports are full of examples of a structure of decision making here that has deliberately allowed decisions to be taken by Ministers or officials on the basis of executive discretion rather than on the basis of unambiguous laws that are available to all and applied openly by the courts..  Once the laws allow discretionary decisions to be taken without clear rules, we create an environment for corruption..  Serious questions were treated with derision.  Mr. Haughey always seemed to have a willing band around him ready to crease their faces with derisory laughter when he treated with contempt serious questions on this matter from the press.  Some of those faces are still visible on the Front Bench opposite.  Do some of those in Fianna Fáil feel even mildly embarrassed that they were among those who laughed or gave moral support to their leader when these questions about his wealth were imperiously dismissed at press conferences and on public platforms?  While the issue was of public importance, it was, or should have been, a matter of serious concern to Fianna Fáil during those years, but the party was blind.</P>
    <P>One matter in particular is of serious concern and I will place it on the record because I want to draw it to the attention of the House and the tribunal. Deputy Bruton also said yesterday:</P>
    <P>The sale of Carysfort College to UCD must now be re-examined in far greater detail and with far greater rigour..  Exactly the same pattern of collective Government decision making is to be found in the Carysfort case as was disclosed in the beef tribunal.  Ministers worked alone, without civil servants to ensure accountability. The absence of civil servants from eight meetings with UCD, some of them involving Mr. Haughey, the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and others between 11 September 1990 and 12 December 1990 does not, to quote the Committee of Public Accounts, &ldquo;suggest the degree of transparency which one would expect to be evident in all financial transactions of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I was Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts at the time and I received the cooperation of the vast majority of Fianna Fáil Members of the committee, as well as of the other parties present, in bringing forward the report of the committee on the sale of Carysfort.  The Comptroller and Auditor General reported to the committee on this matter in his report on the accounts of 1990.  We also made a special interim report to the Dáil, signed by me as Chairman on 6 February 1992.  Before issuing that report we brought before the committee not only the Accounting Officer of the Department of Education <Col N="801" /> but the Accounting Officers of the Department of Finance and the Valuation Office, the President of UCD and others.  The Committee of Public Accounts did a good job on that occasion. As I am familiar with the Carysfort case, I will discuss this example to explain what happened and why it is relevant that it should be investigated as part of the tribunal's considerations.</P>
    <P>In the period leading up to September 1990, the Department of Education made no offer for Carysfort; for instance, it made no offer in October 1989, when a reasonable offer was invited nor in February 1990 when it was clear that the then owners wished to dispose of the property.  This is mentioned in the committee's report.  The Valuation Office valued the site at approximately £3.8 million in August 1989.  In November 1990, a little over a year later, UCD acquired it for £8 million, without being told during the negotiations of the Valuation Office assessment.  This is also mentioned in the report. There is no doubt that UCD acquired an excellent property but at a cost of £9.7 million to the State.  The college originally intended to locate its graduate business school in Roebuck Castle, which would have cost the college £5 million, albeit for a smaller facility, with no cost to the State.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority, which has authority under sections 3 and 8 of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971, was not consulted, it was bypassed as was the Department of Education.  Both expressed their disquiet about this.  The Department of Finance opposed this purchase for traditional budgetary reasons. However, because of the Cabinet procedures used it was unable to give its view before the decision was made.  I refer here to pages 96 and 98 of the report of the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet procedures allow a Minister, with the prior agreement of the Taoiseach, to raise a matter at Government without circulating a memorandum. That is what happened on 4 December 1990, according to the evidence given to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I refer here to pages 6 and 98 of the Public Accounts Committee report.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for this.  The Engineering School in Merrion Street was dealt with in the same way.  However, a supplementary Estimate was introduced in this House and the Higher Education Authority got the necessary moneys to transfer to UCD on 21 December 1990.  The matter was brought to Cabinet without papers on 4 December.  An Estimate was rushed through this House.  The Higher Education Authority was given the money on 21 December which it had to immediately transfer to UCD.  That was done on Christmas Eve 1990.  I refer here to pages 52 and 53 of the Public Accounts Committee report.</P>
    <P>Dr. Patrick Masterson, who was then president of UCD, told the Committee of Public Accounts in evidence that an invitation came from the then Minister for Education to UCD to discuss Carysfort's availability.  He did not know it was available <Col N="802" /> to him at that stage.  He told the committee on page 58 of the report that the Department made it clear Carysfort was the only option for which UCD would receive State funding.  In pages 55 and 59 of the report he makes it clear that the Minister contacted UCD.  Incidentally, she told the Dáil that the proposal was from UCD, which I think is referred to on page 148 of the Public Accounts Committee report.  Technically, she was right in that the proposal came from UCD, but it came from UCD at her instigation.  Therefore, factually and in every other way she was wrong. It may have to be explained in time why it was suggested the proposal came from UCD.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts did not accept that Carysfort represented optimum value for money, especially as the property was sold some months earlier for a significantly lower amount than UCD ultimately paid for it.  In pages 9 and 10 of the report the committee strongly criticised the Department of Education because there was a limited market for that property.  The report states on page 5 that Carysfort &ldquo;was sold to a private developer in June 1990 for a sum reputedly in the range of £6.25 million to £6.5 million&rdquo;.  However, six months later UCD used State funds to buy it for £8 million plus £1.7 million other costs.</P>
    <P>Page 62 of the Public Accounts Committee report indicated that Dr. Masterson, the president of UCD, expected business people to fund Roebuck in its entirety.  However, he was told to forget about the £5 million he was going to raise to fund Roebuck because the State would give him £9.7 million &mdash; but only if he purchased the Carysfort site.  He was told he would not be given funding for any other option.  This Carysfort site &mdash; which was valued at £3.8 million in August 1989; for which the Department made no attempt to bid prior to September 1990, such as in October 1989 or February 1990; and which was purchased for £6.25 million or £6.5 million by a private individual &mdash; was suddenly foisted on UCD.  The cheque was written before Christmas by the State through Cabinet procedures which did not meet the normal transparent financial requirements of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General or this House, or which would not be accepted as fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>Page 4 of the report states the Department of Education building unit set out to justify this purchase as a value for money exercise.  It emphasised that it cost £8 million.  In fact, the cost to the State was £9.7 million.  It is pointed out in the report, following evidence given by the chief evaluation officer, that St. Helen's, a nearby educational facility with 70 acres, was sold for £7 million in May 1989.  Carysfort was valued by the Valuation Office at about £190,000 an acre as against £100,000 per acre for St. Helen's. Although the Valuation Office valued the acreage of Carysfort at almost twice that of St. Helen's, it still said it was only worth £3.8 million.</P>
    <P>This is very relevant because pages 25, 63, 64, <Col N="803" /> 66 and 71 of the report make it clear that civil servants were excluded from all five meetings between UCD and the then Minister for Education and all three meetings between UCD and the then Taoiseach.  Not only were Cabinet procedures bypassed, the normal procedure whereby at least a proper record of meetings is kept to ensure transparency, was also bypassed at all those meetings.  As Deputy Bruton said yesterday, the Committee of Public Accounts stated that did not suggest the degree of transparency which the committee would expect.  That was not said by me but by the Committee of Public Accounts, supported in a professional way by the vast majority of Fianna Fáil members of that committee.</P>
    <P>The Accounting Officer of the Department of Education asserted that the property was never on offer to his Department for less than £8 million. However, the Public Accounts Committee found it hard to reconcile that statement with the fact that the property was sold to a private developer in June 1990 for a sum reputedly in the range of £6.25 million to £6.5 million.  Although the Department of Finance, which was opposed to the purchase on traditional budgetary grounds, was not consulted in advance on whether the purchase represented value for money or on the need for such facilities at the level envisaged, the State was still committed to this expenditure.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Cabinet on 4 December 1990 it approved the purchase of Carysfort by UCD without having a formal memorandum presented to it.  In the course of hearing evidence, the committee was informed that under Cabinet procedures that could only happen if a Minister raised the matter orally, provided that the Minister had the prior agreement of the Taoiseach. The committee said this procedure was followed in regard to Carysfort.</P>
    <P>On 21 December 1990, the Accounting Officer for the Department of Education told the Higher Education Authority that approval of the Minister for Finance was required for any recurring costs.  However, the President of University College Dublin told the committee in evidence that on the same date the Taoiseach gave him an assurance that &ldquo;incremental running costs would be an appropriate charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>UCD was force fed £9.7 million of taxpayers' funds to buy a facility which the Valuation Office said was worth only £3.8 million.  UCD was contacted by the Minister, told this was available and told to negotiate.  However, it was never told that the Valuation Office said it was worth only £3.8 million.  Subsequently, in rushed circumstances and without proper Cabinet and financial control procedures being followed, £9.7 million was used to secure it.  Higher Education Authority, Department of Finance and Cabinet procedures were bypassed.  It was the subject of criticism by the one person who could not be bypassed, the Comptroller and Auditor General.  He examined the file and brought it to the attention of the <Col N="804" /> Committee of Public Accounts, which strongly criticised it.</P>
    <P>I have laboured this point because Deputy Hanafin is an honourable, well intentioned and first-class Member of the House.  However, she asked what was so different about Fianna Fáil. The answer is that Ministers addressed the Taoiseach as &ldquo;Boss&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes Boss, no Boss, three bags full Boss&rdquo;.  These Ministers did so to ensure their survival, to clock up their salaries and pensions and because they were afraid.  They allowed that culture to prevail.  As Deputy Bruton said yesterday, they bear part of the responsibility. Mr. Haughey and the Ministers who facilitated the procedure will be indicted if it transpires that the person, or any person or company associated with him, who purchased that property and sold it to the State in such a short time for a large profit gave funds to Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>Until the Fianna Fáil Party makes it part of its philosophy that it will not accept such standards in high places, which the late Mr. George Colley criticised, it will stand aside from every other group as the party with the most to answer for. None of us is a saint but it has the most to answer for, not just for having that culture but for introducing it and allowing it to prosper.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the approach of addressing Mr. Haughey as &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; and encouraging his mannerisms and use of the facilities of the State as if they were personally available to him was an abdication of constitutional collective Cabinet responsibility.  All sides should learn that Ministers share collective responsibility in Cabinet. The Taoiseach is <i>primus inter pares</i> but he is not a dictator.  Those who facilitated the procedures which allowed the Carysfort incident to occur share responsibility for it.  I draw the attention of the House and the tribunal to this matter.  I hope it will be of interest to the tribunal and that it will bear it in mind in conducting its inquiries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this matter. I hope the tribunal will in private or in public, or both, inquire from the people who were associated with the Carysfort and other similar deals if they made direct or indirect contributions to Mr. Haughey.  This aspect is relevant to the investigative approach of the tribunal.</P>

He was always voluble and ready to provide a quote.  I am glad he is maintaining that tradition.  He made a fine contribution but no party or individual in the House enjoys a monopoly on moral probity. This is an important aspect to remember in addressing the serious issues raised by the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to President Robinson whose term of office is almost complete.  She is a shining example of public service.  As a journalist I had the privilege of accompanying her on a <Col N="805" /> State visit to Poland.  She visited Auschwitz and spoke for everybody with her dignified reaction on what was an unforgettable occasion and experience.  It is a pity that the high public esteem in which President Robinson is held is not also extended to Members of the House.  However, I am honoured to contribute to the debate.</P>
    <P>This is my first speech and it is a particular honour for me because my father and grandfather both served in this Chamber.  It is sad that I have this opportunity at a time when the notion of public service has become a tarnished ideal.  In my upbringing I was taught that political involvement was not so much a matter of duty as a noble calling which people should feel honoured to answer.  Unfortunately, the events which led to this tribunal and other investigations in the last ten years have brought much of the political system and those involved in politics into the mire. This places a huge responsibility on the House to correct and improve matters.  My point relates less to the McCracken tribunal and more to the fundamental issue of democratic political reform of the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell took an interest in this area in the past and his party leader, Deputy Bruton, took a leading role in Dáil reform in the mid-1980s by providing a proper committee system. Perhaps the party leaders, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, will take up this challenge again in the 1990s and try to provide an efficient House which works for the public good.</P>
    <P>The calling of public service is not an easy task. In contrast to the times in which my father and grandfather served in the House, it is much more difficult to be involved in politics now.  It is no accident that during my lifetime in education, the workforce as a journalist and private industry I never met anybody of my age group who would have considered becoming a Member of the House.  It is a tragedy that an entire generation of people are disinterested in the political system and have no ambition or hope of becoming a Deputy.  The House must consider this matter. There is a huge responsibility on Members to make a difference and to ensure that politics appears relevant again.  Members must infuse politics with the spirit of public service that was in the House in the past and which I am sure will be here again.  Why are many able and ambitious young people no longer drawn to politics?  This issue goes beyond the McCracken tribunal, although that tribunal and the events it has inquired into are relevant to it.  It is important that the House take up the challenge to make politics and public service a noble pursuit.</P>
    <P>Today's debate is not simply about Mr. Haughey, Deputy Lowry or Deputy Ray Burke. It is about the relevance of our political system as we move to the end of the 20th century.  There are much wider issues here that cut to the very heart of our democracy and civic life.  What kind of standards do we wish to apply to ourselves as elected representatives?  What sacrifices are we prepared to make to ensure that people have full <Col N="806" /> confidence in their political representatives?  As a new Member, I have nothing to fear and believe all Members of this House have nothing to fear from full disclosure of financial interests.  I am not afraid of that and no party or individual is afraid of it.  We should pursue this very vigorously, and not stall.  It should be done quickly to restore public confidence.</P>
    <P>We must also ask what kind of State we wish to live in as we face the end of the 20th century. The current cynicism about politics can be traced to the serious neglect of political reform by the political establishment over many years.  It is now time this Parliament inaugurated a wide-ranging discussion about how politics and the political system can be improved.  The House should consider initiating a process of public consultation centred on the theme of reform of our political institutions, of our Constitution and of the conduct of our public life.</P>
    <P>This process of public consultation should begin soon and involve the maximum number of citizens.  There is a role here for a forum on civic life that would sit for a defined period and seek submissions from all interested parties &mdash; public bodies and private citizens alike &mdash; on the reforms needed to make our system of Government relevant again.  I use the word &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; repeatedly because our political life and system is not relevant to the generation coming forward. That is why a great number of people are not getting involved in political parties and are not interested in entering this House.  That must change.  It should be a cherished ideal for any young person to become a Member of this House. I feel particularly privileged, given my background in political involvement, to be a Member, but in the country I have in mind, my involvement would not be necessary because the competition would be too hot for people from a &ldquo;dynastic&rdquo; background like me to reach this House. I look forward to that day, as must every other Member.</P>
    <P>When speaking of this forum, I am reminded of the forum which was initiated by the Opsahl Commission in Northern Ireland.  That commission sat for nine months and began an unprecedented process of public consultation on one of the most relevant issues facing this island: how to resolve the conflict in the North.  It is noteworthy that this groundbreaking public inquiry involved thousands of ordinary people and, significantly, it preceded the Hume-Adams agreement.  It was one of the most important inquiries ever conducted and 35,000 people were spoken to individually and in various groups.  This kind of citizens' inquiry should be considered here and should be tightly focused by this House rather than by a judge or tribunal of inquiry.  There should be a formal citizens' inquiry into how people believe we should run the country.  It is not fair to put those issues before people in an election because people often concentrate on economic issues in an election.  The period between elections is an ideal time for this kind of consultation.  It is badly <Col N="807" /> needed if politics is to become relevant again to younger people and to get the allegiance of citizens. If begun, this consultation might restore public confidence in the political system, but that alone would not be enough.  There are bigger institutional relationships which the House must look into.</P>
    <P>There is concern outside the House about the relevance of the Seanad, local government, the Constitution and the role of political parties within the system.  These are big issues which have been left lying for many years, with local government being probably the most spectacular example.  I have not been known to speak well of the Progressive Democrats very often but their suggestion that the Seanad be abolished sparked a debate on that institution at least.  The issue of the Seanad should be twinned with that of local government reform.  Why can we not have a gubernatorial system whereby the elected chair-persons of the local authorities sit, <i>ipso facto</i> or as of right, in the Seanad?  That would guarantee local representation at a national level and would allow chairpersons of local authorities to play a valuable role at that level.  It would also allow Ministers to concentrate on national legislation while answering questions on local issues in the Seanad.  If Deputies need reassurance on this matter, membership of both institutions would not be allowed.  Membership of local authorities and this House should be mutually exclusive.  It is not in the interest of our civic life that people who are members of local authorities also be Members of the House.</P>
    <P>After the last war, Germany had to look anew at its constitutional and political institutions.  The checks and balances put in place then in Germany have served that country well.  Perhaps, given the level of public cynicism about politics here, the same approach should now be taken here.  My preference is for root and branch reform of the electoral system, which contributes greatly to public cynicism about politics.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell raised the issue of pay.  I heard this mentioned this morning also and it is a relevant issue, but the public will not give us the mandate to pay ourselves more if we do not reform the way we work.  It is dishonest of politicians to demand greater efficiency in the wider public service when they do not apply the same exacting standards to themselves.  Politicians will get the due recognition and monetary reward if they reform the way they work.</P>
    <P>If a new electoral system is put in place, it should reconcile the role played by democratic political parties and the public desire for direct or proportional representation.  The German electoral system is a mixture of the list system and direct representation which allows political parties to retain talented individuals who contribute at a national level.  It is ironic and somewhat tragic that Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien, one of Mr. Haughey's longest serving opponents, is not a Member today.  It is a pity that Dr. Cruise <Col N="808" /> O'Brien has had to oppose Mr. Haughey in the pages of the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  If the House was properly organised, individuals such as Dr. Cruise O'Brien would be able to oppose Mr. Haughey from within the Chamber.  There are many talented individuals in various parties in the House and the political system should value those with intellect and ability.  Those people should be retained by the system so that they can serve at a high level, be it as Minister or President.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the McCracken and beef tribunals that if there were proper procedures and standards in the House, these expensive tribunals would be unnecessary.  Speaking as a former journalist, there should be measured but considerable reform of the laws of libel as they apply to those in the public eye.  I emphasise the term &ldquo;the public eye&rdquo; as those who are not in the public eye should enjoy the protection of enhanced privacy laws.</P>
    <P>It is important the media be given the recognition they deserve and it is no accident the media, not this House or a Member, have led many of the revelations which have occurred in the scandals we are discussing.</P>
    <P>The role of the media and political parties in our national affairs should be given explicit recognition in our Constitution or in any new Constitution which this House will shape with cross-party support.  These reforms are desirable in themselves but there are other more compelling reasons that a process of deep-seated reform should take place.  If the peace process is brought to a successful conclusion, by definition there will be a need for a new constitutional dispensation that accommodates the diverse traditions on this island.  Furthermore, the momentous challenge of economic and monetary union within the European Union also demands a fresh approach to our political institutions and constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>In essence, nothing in the constitutional sense and life of this country has changed since the enactment of the 1937 Constitution.  That document has served the nation well but it is now time for it to be overhauled or even replaced.  In an earlier era Seán Lemass defined his task and that of an earlier generation of political leaders as one of securing the economic foundations for independence. It is to his credit that this mission set out in the late 1950s has now largely been achieved.</P>
    <P>The historic task of this generation of political leaders is to secure the social foundations for independence.  We have a proper, if somewhat flawed, political system and a successful economy, sometimes described as the Celtic tiger, but we do not have a society with the social cohesion one would expect of a country which claims to be a republic and democratic in its treatment of its citizens.  The task for this House is to secure the social foundations for independence and to justify our high idealism as a nation in going it alone away from the British Empire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> In an odd way the events and issue probed in the McCracken tribunal demonstrate the enormous economic success this country has achieved and the enormous temptations politicians are faced with in the modern age.  The real issue now for our political system is how to harness economic success so that the maximum number of our citizens can participate in the workforce with dignity and the opportunity to move ahead.  The task of eliminating social exclusion cannot be taken on by a political system which is uncompetitive, inefficient and unreformed.</P>
    <P>The enormous task of political reform should proceed quickly and in the lifetime of this Dáil. Public inquiries, such as the McCracken tribunal and the beef tribunal, are not enough.  The public will expect and, indeed, deserve much better than they are getting now.  We have a terrible habit of poring over the past &mdash; perhaps it is time this Parliament looked to the present and let the future look after itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I congratulate Mr. Justice McCracken and all those involved in the tribunal of inquiry on their diligent and efficient work in the production of this report.  The events and revelations over the past 12 months have damaged the perception of politics and added to increasing public cynicism about public life.  It is a source of profound distress and disappointment to members of Fianna Fáil that a person who led the party for many years, in many respects with great distinction, has been found by a judicial tribunal to have engaged in unacceptable conduct in the receipt of substantial sums of money.</P>
      <P>The matter of payment to politicians does not end with this report.  Questions remain to be answered and issues remain unresolved.  There is clearly need for a second tribunal and it is this tribunal the Government now seeks to establish. Our priority must be to move forward in an effort to restore public confidence in the political system by examining the current mechanisms for regulation and enforcement, addressing deficiencies and establishing new rules and means of enforcement where necessary.</P>
      <P>The McCracken report has been discussed in detail in the media and during the course of this debate and I do not intend to engage in repetition. During the debate some Members have sought to paint a picture of wholesale political corruption and tried to cast doubt on the integrity of as many Deputies and Ministers as possible. Such suggestions and innuendo have no basis in the conclusions of Mr. Justice McCracken's report which, while extremely distressing, found &ldquo;no political impropriety&rdquo; to have occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members should resist the temptation to throw mud by innuendo and instead focus on the substantive issues raised in the McCracken report. The Taoiseach has ensured the terms of reference of the new tribunal are broad enough to encompass the further issues about which concern <Col N="810" /> has been expressed.  In this way any allegations can be fully investigated in a forthright, fair and objective manner.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of Mr. Justice McCracken's report as to the unacceptable nature of the financial arrangements and activities of Deputy Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey have received universal public acceptance.  There are a number of dimensions to the unacceptable nature of such activity, including the potential compromise or conflict of interest involved, the difficulty of enforcing laws which are seen to be flouted by people in senior positions and the damage to the public perception of politics and its participants.</P>
    <P>I have been a public representative for 20 years and served in Cabinets under four Fianna Fáil Taoisigh, starting with Jack Lynch in 1979.  Politics is the ultimate in public service, and I have served the public service in other respects.  I am proud of the work I do as a politician in serving both my community and country.  I say without hesitation that public representatives generally are hardworking, dedicated people, many of whom have made personal sacrifices to serve in public life.  Even the most cursory perusal of the register of Members' interests will show that most Oireachtas Members have little to declare outside their Dáil or Seanad salaries.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to the public and ourselves to rebut any suggestion that politics is about personal gain or financial enrichment.  That is not to say those who take up public office must forego any possibility of success or profit in their private lives, although this is often the case.  Nonetheless, it is of paramount importance that all dealings in public life are above reproach.</P>
    <P>Our fate is in our own hands.  The manner in which we conduct ourselves, our response to this report and any consequent actions are important elements in dispelling public cynicism and addressing any lack of public trust in politicians. People have a right to expect high standards from those who represent them.  We have a duty to enforce those standards and work to relieve any doubts which have been generated by recent events.  It is now necessary for all parties and politicians to work together to renew public confidence in the democratic process.  We owe it to those we represent and to the many politicians who have served this country and its people with distinction at local and national levels over the years.</P>
    <P>The challenge of ensuring ethical conduct and financial probity among public office holders has been faced by many other democracies over the last 30 years.  Most countries now regulate those who serve in public office with varying degrees of stringency and methods of enforcement.</P>
    <P>The regime operated by the United States to regulate the financial interests and conduct of public office holders is probably the most restrictive worldwide.  Members of Congress are expressly barred from accepting gifts which aggregate to more than $250 in one calendar year. They are also prohibited from the private practice <Col N="811" /> of any profession which involves a fiduciary relationship or from using the influence of their official position to benefit their own financial interests.  Members there are also subject to a rigorous system of public disclosure of assets, income, property and debt.</P>
    <P>In the UK there are no direct prohibitions on outside earnings.  However, a system of registering and declaring outside interests ensures transparency and highlights possible conflicts of interest which may arise in the course of a member's activity.</P>
    <P>A report on legislative ethics prepared for the US Congress by the Congressional Research Service in 1994 observed that &ldquo;ethical restrictions on a legislators' conduct and outside activities with respect to private financial interests are a product of numerous political, cultural and economic factors, including the democratic maturity of the electorate as well as the public respect and perception of the status of its representatives&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We live in an age of increasing access to information. An educated and well &mdash; informed public brings with it a demand for accountability and transparency.  Our objective must be to meet these expectations and address public concern.  It is important that mechanisms which seek to enforce standards and ensure probity in all political activity are effective and are seen to be so.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken welcomed recent legislation enacted by this House and in particular considered that the current system of disclosure and regulation should be &ldquo;highly effective in monitoring ordinary political donations&rdquo;. However, the judge also recognised its limitations and suggested extending the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and giving the Office of the Ombudsman powers to conduct investigations.  It may be more effective to vest such powers, combined with those of the public offices commission, in an independent ethics commission.  A stand-alone, independent office would have the time and resources to dedicate itself to this single, important area and would signal to the public for once and for all that we are serious about addressing their concerns. The independence of such a body, and its perception as independent, would be an important element in the restoration of public confidence.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised both in the media and by the Opposition about the need for such an independent ethics commission.  Critics of the proposal have argued that the existing legislative provisions are adequate.  A more detailed analysis will show that the combined processes under the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Electoral Act may be seen as operating from a narrow basis. Only complaints about office holders are dealt with by the Public Offices Commission while complaints about ordinary Members are dealt with by a select committee.  At this stage, self-regulation by a select committee of Dáil Éireann may not be sufficiently objective to ensure public confidence in the political system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> It is interesting to note, as already mentioned by one of my colleagues, that the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution in its first report recommended such an approach which would guarantee the independence and impartiality of the commission, generate greater confidence in public life, create greater transparency in public institutions, create consistency and continuity in developing procedures for dealing with related functions and provide an independent source of advice and information in the areas of ethics in public life and electoral law reform.</P>
    <P>This model recommended by the committee is consistent with the models currently operating in other countries.  In the United States, for example, the State Ethics Commission serves not just as a repository for statements of disclosure and as a source of advice, but is also authorised to undertake civil enforcement action on its own motion or in response to a sworn complaint.  The commission is empowered to hold hearings, issue subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses and the production of documents and impose civil penalties and refer matters for criminal prosecution. A final decision of the commission may be appealed to the courts for a trial <i>de novo.</i> Examination of such a model may be worthwhile and could avoid any future need for the establishment of tribunals of inquiry except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is a feature of our democracy that political donations from private sources are part of the political framework, something accepted by Mr. Justice McCracken.  The McCracken report detailed the various payments made to members of the Fine Gael Party and to the Labour Party as well as to Fianna Fáil in respect of the presidential election campaign.  The amounts ranged from £1,000 to £15,000 to individuals and £180,000 to the Fine Gael Party.  The judge concluded that it would not be practicable to prohibit all political contributions.  Such contributions are an important element in ensuring political parties can function effectively and that they have adequate back-up support and research staff.</P>
    <P>The Government is giving the new tribunal extended powers by virtue of its terms of reference. It is important that we support this measure as a further step in our endeavour to lift the cloud over Irish politics.  This House must embrace the changes which are necessary to renew public confidence in the political system and ensure that future generations will be proud to participate in political life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Dunnes Payments Tribunal is a watershed.  Its language is clear, unambiguous and understandable.  It has proved beyond doubt that tribunals of inquiry with the right terms of reference and the proper presiding personnel can work.  It has delivered a withering denunciation of the <i>modus operandi</i> of a former Taoiseach and a former Government Minister in the conduct of their financial affairs.  It has <Col N="813" /> rendered considerable service by setting down recommendations which it sees as crucial to the performance of those holding public office, recommendations which must be adopted.</P>
      <P>The blunt message of paragraphs 34 and 35 of chapter 11 of the report is largely the basis on which recommendations for future conduct emanate. It is also an explicit indication of the standards and codes of conduct which should always have applied to those holding elected office.  The report states:</P>
      <P>.it is unacceptable that a Member of Dáil Éireann, and particularly a Cabinet Minister and Taoiseach, should be supported in his personal lifestyle by gifts made to him personally. It is particularly unacceptable that such gifts should emanate from prominent business people within the State.</P>
      <P>Judge McCracken goes on to talk about the dangers of bribery, corruption and political favours.</P>
      <P>The tribunal was set up to examine the finances of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  In the case of Deputy Lowry the sin uncovered was the serious one of tax evasion.  In the case of Mr. Haughey, not alone was the huge subsidisation of his lavish lifestyle by Dunnes uncovered, but there was a blatant attempt to frustrate the tribunal through stonewalling, a tissue of lies and evasions and a climb-down when corned and faced with the incontrovertible.</P>
      <P>Members of the Government have a tendency to become extremely annoyed when either the media or the Opposition dare resurrect and pose questions as to their version of, or involvement in, certain big money transactions while in office. They invariably resort to some statement of defence or explanation offered at the time.  I do not wish to necessarily imply guilt by association, but several members of the present Government, including the Taoiseach and Ministers Woods, Burke, O'Rourke and Ahern, sat side by side in Government with Mr. Haughey when he was Taoiseach.  They actively defended Mr. Haughey time and time again while publicly and enthusiastically pledging fealty to him.  Yet Mr. Haughey lied both in his personal written statements and his oral evidence to the McCracken Tribunal.  Are we not justified, therefore, in seeking answers to some of the unexplained and unanswered aspects of the past financial dealings in relation to projects in which present members of the Government, some of whom were Mr. Haughey's most trusted lieutenants, were directly involved?</P>
      <P>The investment for naturalisation scheme has the potential for good if properly administered. Yet the shoddiness or shadiness of the scheme as operated under Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice from 1987, some of whom are still in Government, has to be the subject of further detailed examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few case histories are illustrative. <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of 4 September 1992 lists 11 Saudi Arabian and Pakistani nationals who were granted certify Cates of naturalisation dated 8 December 1990. <Col N="814" /> All gave Glenmore House, Clonee, County Meath, as their Irish address.  Local people in Clonee confirmed in 1994 that nobody had lived in the house since 1990.  The awarding of a passport is supposed to be directly linked in the case of investment to a specific job creating scheme. The supposed project in the case of these 11 passports was, according to the IDA, linked to investment in the equestrian industry.  What the IDA was doing meddling in the horse business is a mystery to me.  Yet, four years later, Meath County Council was in a position to confirm that no application had been made to it for such a development.</P>
    <P>Each application must be accompanied by character references from three Irish citizens.  The Department of Justice, when asked to provide the names of those who proposed the 11 individuals or the group in question for naturalisation either collectively or individually, refused to supply the information.  The Department was also asked how much investment was made and where and when it was made.  It again refused to supply the information. The Minister for Justice in 1990 was none other than Deputy Raphael P. Burke.  When asked about the scheme he declined to give any details other than to say that &ldquo;there was a Government scheme in place at the time&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Two of the 11 people to whom Irish citizenship was granted were involved in the biggest banking scandal in history.  Sultan Khalid S Bin Mahfooz and Haroon Rashid Kahlon, together with the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, were sued by liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in relation to the BCCI collapse.  In July 1992 both men faced charges in the United States that they conspired to steal more than $300 million from BCCI depositors.  These charges were dropped in late 1993 following a plea bargaining settlement of $225 million.  Haroon Khalon pleaded guilty to the charge that he failed to register as a broker for which it was agreed by the US authorities that he would not be jailed.</P>
    <P>Here we have the biggest banking scam and scandal in history involving two principals who were accorded Irish citizenship on foot of references from three Irish citizens who presumably testified to the effect that they had an &ldquo;intimate acquaintance with the applicant&rdquo; and could vouch for their good character but the Department of Justice still refuses to divulge the &ldquo;who, when or where&rdquo; surrounding these applications.</P>
    <P>The applicant is required to provide on the application form particulars of any proceedings, civil or criminal, taken against him or her in courts of law in this State or elsewhere.  Was this information supplied and, if so, was it supplied accurately?  The normal procedure for the issue of certificates of naturalisation is that they are signed by an Assistant Secretary in the Department of Justice, yet in the case of Messrs Mahfooz and Kahlon, the certificates were signed personally by the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Raphael P. Burke.  I would like to know whether <Col N="815" /> the rumour is correct that either Deputy Burke or Mr. Haughey personally delivered the passports and/or the certificates of naturalisation to the gentlemen in question at the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin.</P>
    <P>All of this begs a number of questions to which answers must be supplied.  Why did Deputy Burke take such an extra special interest in the passport applications of these two wealthy, but suspect, gentlemen?  Did he personally oversee the details and the arrangements leading up to the granting of the passports?  Who were the three people who provided the character references in the case of each of the 11 applicants?  In view of the manifest wealth of the individuals in question and of Deputy Burke's handson involvement in the issue of the passports, what level of investment were the individuals to make in return for the passports and certificates of naturalisation and what was the nature of that investment?  Was the investment to be a global figure for all 11 applicants or was there to be an individual investment by each?  Was there ultimately any figure invested in a project here?  If so, what was that figure and what was the project concerned?  Did the individuals whose names were listed in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as having the passports ever visit this country or live here and, if they did, what was the duration of their stay? Who approached Deputy Burke initially to encourage him to personally steer the passport applications through his Department?</P>
    <P>These are legitimate questions which must be answered.  The refusal to answer them not only shows a brazen defiance but a contempt for the legitimate right to know if proper procedures were in place.  It also leads to a quite justifiable suspicion that something serious was amiss.  The questions simply will not go away.  At what stage did responsibility for the issue of passports transfer to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey's, Department?  Who was the official within that Department with particular responsibility for this issue?</P>
    <P>Had factual answers to legitimate Dáil questions been forthcoming on export credit insurance the beef tribunal would not, in all probability, have been necessary.  Central to this debate is the motion to establish a new tribunal of inquiry to delve further into the affairs of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  Deputy Lowry no longer holds ministerial office.  Mr. Haughey is no longer a Member of the Dáil nor is he a holder of public office.  Deputy Burke is both a Member of the Dáil and a holder of one of the most senior and sensitive positions in Government.  He, therefore, has a clear public and political duty to explain, in detail, his administration of a scheme in which huge sums of money were involved, where rules were so lax both in their formation and application that they could well be open to abuse and, to borrow from Mr. Justice McCracken when he referred to political gifts in the tribunal report, <Col N="816" /> could &ldquo;inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the most scathing criticism of Fianna Fáil's handling of the passports for sale affair came from the Progressive Democrats.  Does the scripture and writ of the Progressive Democrats as enunciated so eloquently by Michael McDowell in August, September, October and November of 1994 still run in its veins?  Is the Tánaiste still prepared to stand full square behind this issue as she has done in regard to the £30,000 political contribution?  Has she become so affected by the political blindness which holding office seems to have caused the Progressive Democrats that she does not see there are major questions attendant to this saga which have not been answered?</P>
    <P>To apply for a medical card one must provide one's full postal address.  Failure to do so will certainly involve a call from the community welfare officer from the health board in order to check out the bona fides of one's place of residence. Yet, the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Pádraig Flynn handed out two passports to Najwa Sabib Taher Masri and Khaled Sabih Masri on 15 December 1992.  According to the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, the Irish residence of Mrs. Masri and her son was simply located at Haddington Road, Dublin 4. Even in Mr. Flynn's home town of Castlebar, where everybody knows everybody else, it would be difficult to locate Mrs. Masri and her son on its main street without a house number.  One can only pity the poor postman, ten days before Christmas on 15 December 1992, pacing up and down Haddington Road with a bag full of Christmas cards in the midst of which was a brown envelope stamped &ldquo;Dlíagus Cirt&rdquo;, inquiring anxiously if Mrs. Masri or her son lived there; or was this Christmas gift also hand delivered?</P>
    <P>Mrs. Masri and her son were granted citizenship by Mr. Flynn for a consideration of a soft loan of £1.1 million to the pet food company of his friend and fellow Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  The recommendation of Mrs. Masri's suitability for citizenship came from Deputy Reynolds' and Mr. Flynn's political friend, then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I can be helpful to the Member.  Every Member of the House, including the Deputy, is entitled to intervene in the debate on each group of amendments between 3 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.  The Deputy will be entitled to speak on each group for three minutes if he so wishes.  The debate is not being guillotined.  We are merely grouping the amendments for the purposes of debate, which was the unanimous request of the other main party Whips.  We are merely grouping the amendments so that we can discuss each item.  If we do not do that, a Member might use up the time debating one issue and we would not reach the other issues to be discussed. The Deputy may intervene on five occasions if he so wishes between 3 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.</P>

I intended taking a broader approach in my contribution rather than dealing with the specifics of the individual amendments and hoped I would have been accommodated in that regard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I thank the Tánaiste for allowing me conclude.  It is extraordinary that Deputy Smith, who had the pleasure of endorsing the suitability of the Masris from his intimate <Col N="819" /> acquaintance with them, is still shy in telling us when and how he first met them and his knowledge of their personal and commercial background, those types of mundane administrative details as distinct from his more personal intimacy with the family.  It is not too late to tax Deputy Smith's powers of memory recall to answer that set of basic questions.  The Department over which Deputy Smith presided is very assiduous in relation to one square foot of a new house grant.</P>
      <P>The Reynolds family would not be selling pet food today had it not been for the soft loan given to them in exchange for two passports.  I am happy that the company survived.  I pass the premises three or four times each week and externally it is as fine an industrial premises as one could get.  However, Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach stated on 30 May 1994 that he &ldquo;had not been involved in any way in the running of the company for up to 14 years&rdquo;.  In June 1994 Deputy Reynolds delivered a speech in Portlaoise in which he explained that he had &ldquo;as required an arm's length relationship with that company [C&amp;D] since I took ministerial office so I cannot be accountable for and have no knowledge of its day to day business&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Industry and Commerce and I have a letter from him dated 28 June 1992, written on notepaper headed with his home address of Mount Carmel House, Dublin Road, Longford, to a Mr. Norman Spence, Pembrokeshire, Wales in which he informs Mr. Spence that he can no longer be kept on the C&amp;D pet food team.  How is that for detachment?  It is quite clear that Deputy Reynolds was not only involved in the business while Minister for Industry and Commerce, but sentences and messages were delivered in the name of the company not in terms of &ldquo;we&rdquo; or &ldquo;the company&rdquo; but in terms of &ldquo;I regret&rdquo;, &ldquo;as I have said before&rdquo;, &ldquo;I must point out&rdquo; and &ldquo;I trust&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds was very involved in the most minute details of his family business.  That would have been commendable had he not been Minister and the major shareholder in the company, had he not been the beneficiary of a softer than soft loan and had he not denied his retention of his involvement with the company.</P>
      <P>These questions are not vexatious and they are certainly not trivial.  They are not asked out of simple curiosity.  They should be asked and, despite being asked in the past, they have not been answered.  There is too much involved here to allow them to go unanswered any longer. There is too much doubt, ambiguity, evasiveness and contraction.</P>

      <P>On 10 December last, the Progressive Democrats moved a motion in this House to establish a tribunal to inquire into payments to politicians by <Col N="820" /> Dunnes Stores.  Introducing that motion, Deputy Bobby Molloy spoke of the public's right to know and of the need to uphold the integrity of our democratic system.  He stated correctly that a tribunal of inquiry was essential if we were to get to the truth.  That motion was voted down by the three parties then in Government.  The attitude of the rainbow coalition was summed up well by the Leader of Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa, in his contribution.  He stated:</P>
      <P>A tribunal of inquiry along the lines proposed by the Progressive Democrats would be a potential disaster.  It is a recipe for prolonged hearings, with huge legal bills, and the real prospect of journalists ending up in jail, with no guarantee of satisfactory or complete answers at the end of the process.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that Deputy De Rossa was wrong.  Judge McCracken did an excellent job and every voter and taxpayer owes him a great debt of gratitude.  We owe a debt of gratitude also to the press, without whose efforts this whole scandal might never have been exposed.  Judge McCracken gave us satisfactory answers.  The tribunal was not a disaster.  We did not have prolonged hearings.  Journalists did not go to jail.</P>
      <P>Judge McCracken gave us satisfactory answers but he was not always able to give us complete answers.  That is the reason we need another tribunal and why the Government parties agreed so readily to the establishment of another tribunal. We were anxious also to reach the maximum amount of agreement with the Opposition parties. Nobody has any morally superior authority in relation to these issues.  Later, when we deal with the individual amendments, the Government will be in a position to accept a number of them.</P>
      <P>The new tribunal will have to investigate fully the relationship between Dunnes Stores and Deputy Michael Lowry &mdash; a relationship described by Judge McCracken as extraordinary, unorthodox and unhealthy.  The new tribunal will have to investigate the financial mystery whereby Mr. Charles Haughey apparently managed to sustain a lavish lifestyle, a lifestyle enjoyed only by a landed aristocrat, on the relatively modest salary of an elected politician.  We now know that Ben Dunne's largesse paid the bills for three years or so, but who has kept the Kinsealy show on the road for the past 30 years?  The new tribunal will also have to investigate decisions made by both of these individuals while they were in Government to ascertain whether or not public favours were sold for private cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribunals of inquiry got a bad name after the hugely expensive and largely inconclusive beef tribunal.  Hopefully, things have now changed. Mr. Justice Finlay showed in the hepatitis C inquiry how a tribunal could work efficiently and effectively to get at the truth with a minimum amount of cost and delay.  Mr. Justice McCracken has shown that a tribunal of inquiry can function with equal efficiency and effectiveness in dealing with the complex financial interactions, many of <Col N="821" /> which were specifically structured in such a way as to avoid detection and investigation.  Both of these men have restored my faith in tribunals.  I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Justice McCracken and his team for the excellent work they did and for the thoroughness and tenacity with which they approached their task.  They have done us all in public service a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal would have been able to complete its work much more speedily, and at a greatly reduced cost, had Mr. Charles Haughey co-operated with the inquiry instead of engaging in deception and prevarication.  I am confident the forthcoming tribunal will follow the lead set by Finlay and McCracken.  The taint of sleaze or scandal must be removed once and for all from public life and that can only happen if we bring the highest ethical standards to public office.  We must now banish forever the squalid stench of political payola.</P>
    <P>We must rescue political life from the ravages of understandable cynicism.  We must be able to demonstrate that those who serve in public life are honourable.  The people of this Republic deserve no less and they must get it.  Confidence in public life demands that elected politicians and public servants be above reproach in the decisions they make.  These decisions &mdash; which often confer very large benefits and can have the most far-reaching effects &mdash; must be made without fear or favour.</P>
    <P>For far too long our system of government and public administration was bedevilled by a climate of secrecy.  This veil of secrecy has in the past fuelled a culture of nods and winks; government by fiat or fear; government tainted by the corrosiveness of mistrust and misdeed.  In other words, bad government, unacceptable government.  The era of sneaking regard or resigned acceptance of nods and winks, the fixer and the occupant of the inside track is over.  The public has the right to expect integrity from its politicians.  Constitutional democracy is based upon the political responsibility of the citizen.  In electing Members to Dáil Éireann the citizen effectively delegates part of that responsibility.  Those who are so entrusted by the electorate have a clear duty to be worthy of that trust.  This is particularly the case in relation to those who hold ministerial office.  When this trust is breached it rightly engenders mistrust, cynicism and scandal.</P>
    <P>The shroud of mystery, the era of the antihero, involved Charles Haughey, a former distinguished Member of this House, a former Minister and former Taoiseach.  By virtue of the office he held he is a member of the Council of State, is in receipt of a State pension and has the benefit of Garda security and a State car.  It gives me no great pleasure to rake over the past deeds of Mr. Haughey, particularly as he is not present in the House to respond.  However, I must do so as to do otherwise would be a disservice to the public, a travesty of justice and ultimately an abdication of the trust the people have placed in me.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey masqueraded for almost a generation <Col N="822" /> as the spirit of the nation.  It is more fitting to say that he is the spectre of the nation.  The report of Judge McCracken unambiguously put flesh on the ghost and the forthcoming tribunal must lay the ghost to rest.  The wrongdoings of Mr. Haughey uncovered by the McCracken tribunal are of a most serious order.  They are reprehensible and cannot be condoned.</P>
    <P>The politics Mr. Haughey practised were a million miles away from the school of transparency and accountability.  His were the politics of intimidation and threats.  Opposition to his style of leadership was not so much discouraged as ruthlessly snuffed out.  Those who dared question his leadership credentials were treated as political pariahs.  I remember many days during the early 1980s seeing grown men cry.  I also remember seeing a Deputy collapse and being taken to hospital because of the pressure he was under from Mr. Haughey and his friends.  I will not forget those days easily.  I remember too being summoned to Mr. Haughey's office to be told that if I behaved myself and supported him, if I was a good girl, then I would see preferment at some future date.</P>
    <P>During the late 1970s and early 1980s many of us wondered at how he had managed to amass sufficient wealth to pay for a Dublin mansion, a County Kerry island, a yacht and a lifestyle which was lavish in the extreme.  We may have had our suspicions but they were only that.  The persistent rumours and innuendo about him remained just that until the McCracken tribunal finally shone a light on the awful truth.  Charles Haughey was a kept man.  We now know that one leading businessman was a generous donor.</P>
    <P>It is clear that our knowledge of the financial gifts proffered by Ben Dunne merely scratches the surface of a lifestyle usually the preserve of multimillionaires.  At page 73 of his report Judge McCracken put it succinctly when he said:</P>
    <P>The possibility that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought, is very high, and if such gifts are permissible, they would inevitably lead in some cases to bribery and corruption.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Ben Dunne could have used the threat of disclosure at any stage to secure favours from Mr. Haughey.  That no evidence has emerged of any such favours being sought or given does not take away from the fact that Mr. Haughey left himself wide open to possible blackmail or bribery.  He compromised himself to such an extent that if pressure had been applied he would have found himself cast in the role of a political puppet.  In other words, the holder of the highest Government office, the leader of the Government, was a mere political pawn.  His ability to perform his duties was seriously impaired by his acceptance of these gifts.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal has raised as many questions as it has answered.  There is every reason to believe Mr. Dunne was just one of a number of financial sponsors of Mr. Haughey.  It <Col N="823" /> has been estimated the payments uncovered by the tribunal could have sustained Mr. Haughey in his lifestyle for no more that two or three years. This begs the question as to who else made financial contributions to him and for what motives.  It is reasonable to assume that other contributions may not have been so apparently benign as those of Mr. Dunne.</P>
    <P>Chapter 9 of the report delivers the most damning verdict on Mr. Haughey's treatment of the tribunal.  It cites 11 separate instances where he told untruths to the tribunal.  The former Taoiseach tried to lead the tribunal team a merry dance.  On the eve of the tribunal appearance by Mr. Haughey there was an expectation that he would confirm much of the information that had been uncovered by then.  However, those who expected a contrite or expansive Charles Haughey were to be disappointed.  Page 58 of the report reveals a most remarkable lapse of memory. While accepting Mr. Ben Dunne's evidence that he was handed three cheques each amounting to £70,000 sterling in November 1991, Mr. Haughey told the tribunal he had no recollection of the meeting and had made no further inquiries. This begs the question, were contributions of more than £200,000 so normal that they could so easily be forgotten?  He was given at least 11 separate opportunities to set the record straight but did not avail of any of them.  The consequences of this are now a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>There are also alarming issues raised in respect of Mr. Haughey's liability to pay tax.  It is inconceivable that he would now escape censure or sanction by the State.  If he pays no penalty for his wrongdoing it will send an alarming signal to those who, for much less, have had to face the full rigours of the law.</P>
    <P>I will refer to Deputy Lowry who does not seem to understand the concept of compliant taxpaying. If his only income was that received as a Member of this House he would know all about compliance.  He would just be another PAYE taxpayer with no room for manoeuvre when it came to evading tax liability.  There were no such constraints in his business dealings with Dunnes Stores.  Page 32 of the McCracken tribunal report provides us with as much as we need to know about the implications of such tax-dodging for his capacity to carry out his duties as a holder of public office.  Judge McCracken found his relationship with Dunnes Stores extremely disturbing.  At page 70 of the report he states:</P>
    <P>It would be very damaging if there was a public perception that a person in the position of Government Minister and member of Cabinet was able to ignore with impunity, and indeed cynically evade, both taxation and exchange control laws of the State.  It is an appalling situation that a Government Minister and Chairman of a Parliamentary Party can be seen to be consistently benefiting from the <Col N="824" /> black economy from shortly after the time he was first elected to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state, rightly, that:</P>
    <P>If such a person can behave in this way without serious sanctions being imposed, it becomes very difficult to condemn others who similarly flout the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lowry has done us all a huge disservice, especially in his attempts to explain away his conduct in his personal statement to the Dáil last December.  He deliberately sought to mislead us, perhaps thinking that would be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey is especially cynical and brings enormous discredit on both of them.  No political impropriety has been uncovered but it would be naive in the extreme to think their receipt of such donations and payments did not colour their decision-making capacity.</P>
    <P>One of the other serious matters raised by the McCracken report is the number of apparent breaches of the company law code.  A dynamic enterprise policy and dynamic economy demand that we have a comprehensive and effective company law code.  Business people who pay their taxes are entitled to expect that the system of corporate law under which they operate is vigorously enforced.  Foreign companies choose to locate in Ireland because of the stable business environment offered and our strong regulatory regime. The new tribunal is mandated to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary for the reform of company law.  We must ensure the law in this area is modern and effective so that corporate fraudsters can be stopped.  The apparent breaches of company law brought to light by the McCracken tribunal have to be investigated.  It is my responsibility to ensure they are and I am determined to do so.</P>
    <P>I wish to inform the House that under section 19 of the Companies Act, 1990, I have appointed two authorised officers from my Department to examine the books of two of the companies mentioned in the tribunal report.  Last Tuesday I appointed Mr. Peter Fisher to examine the books of Garuda Limited, trading as Streamline Enterprises, in Thurles, County Tipperary, and I appointed Mr. Gerard Ryan to examine the books of Celtic Helicopters Limited.  The brief of both officers is to establish what evidence is available to show that either the companies, their directors or their auditors breached particular provisions of the Companies Acts.  I do not intend to speculate on what specific action might be appropriate on foot of their reports.  It would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on these matters until I have received and considered these reports in full.</P>
    <P>The tribunal report is also revealing in respect of the dealings between Dunnes Stores, Deputy Lowry and Streamline Enterprises.  Mr. Justice McCracken goes so far as to describe these as &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo;, &ldquo;unorthodox&rdquo; and &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo;. <Col N="825" /> For my part, I find these dealings deeply disturbing. They require further scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The McCracken tribunal has demonstrated that there may very well have been breaches of company law by Dunnes Stores or its subsidiaries.  I can assure the House that I am actively pursuing this matter with Dunnes Stores at present.  There are a number of different approaches open to me and I expect to be in a position to make a full announcement within a matter of days in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>It is clear Mr. Haughey enjoyed a remarkably lavish lifestyle for a period in excess of 20 years. Ben Dunne's largesse accounts for some of it, but it would seem there were other benefactors and the public is entitled to know who they are.  We cannot turn a blind eye as to the possible motives of such donors.  We must examine the integrity of certain decisions made during Mr. Haughey's tenure as Taoiseach.  We must also establish if the extraordinary <i>modus operandi</i> of Deputy Lowry in relation to his business dealings influenced or had the potential to influence any decisions he made during his term in public office.  We must see if any other holders of public office received unusual payments in the relevant periods and if any benefit accrued to any such donors.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference drawn up for the new tribunal strike the right balance.  On the one hand, we cannot have an inquiry which is openended. We cannot engage in a broadly based fishing expedition, hoping that we will find Pandora's box.  On the other hand a tribunal which has a narrow focus on a few specific areas runs the risk of requiring us to come back in a few months' time to establish a third inquiry.</P>
    <P>It makes eminent sense that the first task to be undertaken by the tribunal should be the identification of donors.  Once we follow the trail of donors we can quickly establish whether that trail leads to policy decisions made in the 18 year period covered by the terms of reference.  There is no point in examining every controversial or debatable Government decision over a period of years.  Many of them may have been based on bad judgment or have come about as a result of incompetence, but they cannot all be viewed as somehow criminal or improper in character. However, decisions that may have been made under the influence of huge, secret, personal contributions fall into a different category completely, an attempt to subvert the democratic system of Government.  Elaborate concealment through offshore accounts and other such devices is a recognition both by the donors and the recipients of the impropriety of what they are doing. Those complex financial webs were obviously woven in order to evade tax.</P>
    <P>The task for the new tribunal is to establish if the intention was to hide from view the fact that benefactors of powerful politicians became beneficiaries of Government decisions.  The terms of reference proposed for the new tribunal are as comprehensive and well-drafted as they can be. They represent the clear determination of the <Col N="826" /> Government that any wrongdoing will be brought to light in all its detail regardless of who or what is involved.  No legislative or Government support required by the new tribunal will be lacking.  I hope that the result of these painful, complex and expensive inquiries into the affairs of Mr. Haughey, Deputy Lowry and anyone else involved will be far-reaching in terms of Irish political culture.</P>
    <P>This debate is about fundamental values that are the bedrock of democratic politics.  It is about integrity, responsibility, obligation and accountability. The subject matter, and the background to it, is scandalous, unpleasant and painful. Elected politicians have been diminished in the eyes of the public by the action of their peers. The people have had their investment in the political process devalued by a very small minority.</P>
    <P>If this second tribunal does its work with the efficiency and clarity of McCracken, the body politic and the people that it serves will be rendered a great service.  The political pointscoring is irrelevant; any moral superiority, inappropriate. A genuine wish to serve the country and the public good was the motivating force that inspired earlier generations of politicians.  It is no different today and must not be any different in the future.  The pursuit of power for its own sake has no place in our political system.  Self-enrichment has no place in our political culture.  We do not need people in politics whose only interest is self-interest.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government I thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  This has been a good debate and there has been an enormous degree of unanimity across the floor of the House.  In the session to follow the Government will be accepting some of the amendments from the Opposition.  In so far as we can accept amendments, we are prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>We made it clear from the outset that we will fully implement the recommendations contained in Mr. Justice McCracken's report.  I have some personal reservations about the amendment that proposes a new defined role for the Ombudsman because I believe the Ombudsman's remit is to look after the small man against the State, but the new proposed role is slightly different.  The Ombudsman is now being asked to be the policeman of politicians whereas until now the Ombudsman reported to the House.  I have reservations about that specific recommendation, but the Government will examine it.</P>
    <P>In respect of the other recommendations and breaches or possible breaches of company law identified in the McCracken report, I have acted. The Government will act in so far as it can to make sure that the strong conclusions and unambiguous report of Mr. Justice McCracken and his team, for which we all owe him a great deal of gratitude, are fully respected and implemented. He has done a great service to Irish public life.</P>
    <P>In the manner in which we have sought to establish the next tribunal, I hope we can continue to serve the public which is our duty.  We <Col N="827" /> want once and for all to end the taint of scandal that has surrounded some political decision-making and some politicians in the recent past.  We can all be proud of those who serve in public office, whether in our system of public administration or as Members or Ministers of this House.  The activities of a tiny minority of our peers have brought us all into disrepute.  We do not deserve that and it is our duty to make sure that we no longer continue to accept it.  In so far as the new tribunal will be able to reveal some further matters, I hope it will bring to an end the era of scandal and sleaze and that we will see heavy sanctions taken against Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  That is what the public expect and they expect in so far as we can in our decision-making that we should honour in full the spirit and letter of the law.  That is what the Government intends to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance will deal with the various amendments.  I hope that for the next hour and a half before we vote at 4.30 p.m., if there is a vote, the debate will be conducted in the spirit in which it has been conducted since it began yesterday.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind serious public concern arising from the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Dunnes Payments) published on 25 August, 1997, which established that irregular payments were made to and benefits conferred on certain persons who were members of the Houses of the Oireachtas between 1 January, 1986, and 31 December, 1996,</P>
      <P>And noting that the said Tribunal established that money was held on deposit in certain Irish banks by offshore banks in memorandum accounts the Ansbacher accounts for the benefit of Irish residents including Mr Charles Haughey, (the history of which deposits is set out in Chapter 6 of the Report of the said Tribunal),</P>
      <P>And noting further that the Dunnes Payments Tribunal was unable by reason of its terms of reference to investigate the source of the Ansbacher accounts, other than in respect of sums paid by certain persons referred to in the said terms of reference.</P>
      <P>Resolves that it is expedient that a Tribunal be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, as adapted by or under subsequent enactments and the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979, to inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> (a) Whether any substantial payments were made, directly or indirectly, to Mr Charles Haughey (whether or not used to discharge monies or debts due by Mr Charles Haughey or due by any company with which he was associated or due by any connected person to Mr Charles Haughey within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 or discharged at his direction) during any period when he held public office commencing on 1st January, 1979, in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making the payment was connected with any public office held by him or had the potential to influence the discharge of such office.</P>
    <P>(b) The source of any money held in the Ansbacher accounts for the benefit or in the name of Mr Charles Haughey or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office, or in any other bank accounts discovered by the Tribunal to be for the benefit or in the name of Mr Haughey or for the benefit or in the name of a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, or for the benefit or in the name of any company owned or controlled by Mr Haughey.</P>
    <P>(c) Whether any payment was made from money held in any of the accounts referred to at (b) to any person who holds or has held public office during the period of his/her tenure.</P>
    <P>(d) Whether Mr Charles Haughey did any act or made any decision in the course of his Ministerial offices, to confer any benefit on any person making a payment referred to in paragraph (a) or any person who was the source of money referred to in paragraph (b), or any other person in return for such payments being made or procured or directed any other person to do such an act or make such a decision.</P>
    <P>(e) Whether any substantial payments were made directly or indirectly to Mr Michael Lowry (whether or not used to discharge monies or debts due by Mr Michael Lowry or due by any company with which he was associated or due by any connected person to Mr Michael Lowry within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 or discharged at his direction), during any period when he held public office in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making the payment was connected with any public office held by him or had the potential to influence the discharge of such office.</P>
    <P>(f) The source of any money held in the Bank of Ireland, Thurles branch, Thurles, Co. Tipperary, the Allied Irish Bank in the Channel Islands, the Allied Irish Banks, Dame Street, Dublin, the Bank of Ireland <Col N="829" /> (I.O.M.) Limited in the Isle of Man, the Irish Permanent Building Society, Patrick Street branch, Cork or Rea Brothers (Isle of Man) Limited, in accounts for the benefit or in the name of Mr Lowry or any other person who holds or has held Ministerial office or in any other bank accounts discovered by the Tribunal to be for the benefit or in the name of Mr Lowry or for the benefit or in the name of a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, or for the benefit or in the name of any company owned or controlled by Mr Lowry.</P>
    <P>(g) Whether Mr Lowry did any act or made any decision in the course of any Ministerial office held by him to confer any benefit on any person making a payment referred to in paragraph (e) or any person who was the source of any money referred to in paragraph (f) or on any other person in return for such payments being made or procured or directed any other person to do such act or make such decision.</P>
    <P>(h) Whether any payment was made from money held in any of the bank accounts referred to in (f) to any person who holds or has held public office during the period of his/her tenure.</P>
    <P>(i) Whether any holder of public office for whose benefit money was held in any of the accounts referred to at (b) or (f) did any act, in the course of his or her public office, to confer any benefit on any person who was the source of that money, or directed any person to do such an act.</P>
    <P>(j) Whether the Revenue Commissioners availed fully, properly and in a timely manner in exercising the powers available to them in collecting or seeking to collect the taxation due by Mr Michael Lowry and Mr Charles Haughey of the funds paid to Michael Lowry and/or Garuda Limited trading as Streamline Enterprises identified in Chapter 5 of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal Report and any other relevant payments or gifts identified at paragraph (e) above and the gifts received by Mr Charles Haughey identified in Chapter 7 of the Dunnes Payments Tribunal Report and any other relevant payments or gifts identified at paragraph (a) above.</P>
    <P>And further in particular:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(k) To make whatever recommendations it considers necessary to ensure that the relationship of politics to private contributions and influence is always seen to be entirely above board, and that the standards by which public policy is conducted are held in the highest esteem, and</P>
    <P>(l) In the light of its findings and conclusions, to make whatever broad recommendations <Col N="830" /> it considers necessary, for the reform of company law.</P>
    <P>'Payment' includes money and any benefit in kind and the payment to any person includes a payment to a connected person within the meaning of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>'Person' includes any natural or legal person or any body of persons whether incorporated or not.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be requested to conduct its enquiries in the following manner, to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979.</P>
    <P>(i) To carry out such investigations in private as it thinks fit using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts, in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to such matters,</P>
    <P>(ii) To enquire fully into all matters referred to above in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist, and to report to the Clerk of the Dáil thereupon, (iii) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal thinks appropriate, on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed,</P>
    <P>(iv) To report on an interim basis, not later than three months from the date of establishment of the Tribunal or the tenth day of any oral hearing, whichever shall first occur, to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:</P>
    <P>the numbers of parties then represented before the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the progress which has been made in the hearing and the work of the Tribunal;</P>
    <P>the likely duration (so far as that may be capable of being estimated at that time) of the Tribunal proceedings;</P>
    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>And that the person or persons selected to conduct the Inquiry should be informed that it is the desire of the House that the Inquiry be completed in as economical a manner as possible, and at the earliest date consistent with a fair examination of the matters to it;</P>

      <P>We thought long and hard about the approach we wanted to be taken by the next tribunal.  There was a large measure of agreement that we would use the methodology of following the so-called money trail.</P>
      <P>By and large that is the most efficient and productive method of operation for the new tribunal. Notwithstanding that, there is a strong public view that we should signal clearly as part of the remit of any new tribunal the issues that have caused public controversy and disquiet and which have undermined public confidence in the operation and impartiality of politics.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Spring is not meant to be an exhaustive list of the issues.  However, it is extremely important that we put explicitly in the terms of reference the type of issues that are important.  These include Carysfort and the Glending Woods issues which have generated much passionate feeling.  If there are any wrongdoings in any of these matters it is appropriate that they should be investigated properly. The preamble is carefully worded and sets the tone for the new tribunal.  I hope the Government will be able to accept it.</P>
      <P>Some of the other amendments were quite specific on issues like Glending, and I strongly agree that these issues need to be investigated. We did not spell out in detail all the issues because we felt that by doing so we might exclude something that would be appropriate for investigation. We should, however, refer to them to give heart and support to members of the general public who have been disquieted by these issues for some considerable period.</P>
      <P>If they are not able to include the detailed specifics of amendments in other Deputies' names, I hope the Government and the Minister for Finance will accept the spirit of the amendment in Deputy Spring's name, which simply sets the tone and specifically mentions issues which are a cause for disquiet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best approach in dealing with the issues which remain after the McCracken report is to follow the money trail.  If that trail leads back to one of those specific decisions which were the cause of so much concern in this <Col N="832" /> House in the 1980s and early 1990s &mdash; and, indeed, the cause of such public concern &mdash; then so be it.  That should also be investigated.</P>
      <P>We cannot investigate everything.  We should only investigate situations where there is a least <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing.  If <i>prima facie</i> evidence of wrongdoing arises in following the money trail, any of these matters are legitimate whether it is export credit insurance, passports for sale, the IDA package for the beef industry or the issue Deputy Howlin referred to in Wicklow.  However, we do not want to specifically list controversies, some of which have been examined before by judicial tribunals or otherwise, and others which have not been examined. In the light of McCracken's findings they seem more sinister now, yet no new evidence has arisen.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Spring is a good one because it gets over the problem of going on a trawl through one's favourite controversies and obliging the tribunal to examine them seriatim.  At the same time the amendment lists the public's concerns and catalogues all these decisions in the preamble or recital to the terms of reference.  Deputy Spring's amendment does not alter the task being given to the tribunal if we include it in the recital but it meets the public concern about these issues.</P>
      <P>We do not want to leave ourselves open to the charge that we are running away from any of these issues.  The amendment keeps the focus on the terms of reference and includes the matters of concern in the recital.  Fine Gael will support it when it is pressed to a vote afterwards, if it is not accepted by the Government.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Amendment No. 14 calls for the terms of reference to include a look at the tax amnesties of 1987 and 1993, and if this huge concession to a very wealthy section was influenced by payments to political parties.  We have heard much talk of money trails relating particularly to Ansbacher, but there were a number of very significant money trails in Irish politics and business over the past ten years, probably none bigger than the scandal of allowing super wealthy individuals and powerful companies to escape with perhaps up to £1 billion of taxation. That should be included because there is still enormous anger among ordinary PAYE tax-payers, the majority of our people, about that.  I hope the Government parties will see that their terms of reference will not get over the cynicism among the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 16 relates to the scandal of Glending Wood and I hope the Government will <Col N="833" /> concede this should be included.  I have heard Government Deputies express disquiet about the sale, privately and without public tender, of 147 acres of State land for £1.25 million to one of Roadstone's companies for quarrying.  Incredibly, the deposits of sand and gravel were valued in that sale at £439,000.  On a conservative estimate 24 million tonnes, valued at £3 per tonne thus giving a figure of £72 million, could be taken from that.  If we allow an extraction cost of £1 per tonne it leaves a potential profit of £48 million, yet it was sold for £439,000 or 1p or 2p per tonne. This is a scandal and to make it possible an archaeological site was delisted and has since been reinstated.  Everything about it has the fingerprints of some of the main personalities that featured in the McCracken tribunal's report.  It is critical that this should be examined.</P>
    <P>As regards amendment No. 17, leading members of the conservative parties are at pains to put a huge chasm between payments to individual politicians and major payments to political parties.  The difference is only one of degree, however.  No ordinary people believe that massive amounts of money are given to major political parties for nothing.  There should be a full investigation of all substantial donations to the major parties who have participated in Government since 1987, and an examination to see if Government policy was in any way influenced by those. These concerns of ordinary people should be taken on board and included.</P>

      <P>We know Mr. Haughey had one benefactor for a period of about two and a half years.  We believe that, having regard to all the circumstances adduced in the debate, he must have had a number of other benefactors.  Whereas establishing the identities of those is a matter of some interest, what is of more interest is whether these other benefactors benefited from the relationship with Mr. Haughey.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to flag some pretty controversial transactions about which the public mind harbours discontent and concern.  It does not say these matters shall be inquired into by the tribunal.  To use Deputy Noonan's Euroword, it is merely framed in the form of a recital that acknowledges public concern about a number of controversial transactions and that this House is reflecting that.  Following the preliminary stage when, I hope, additional benefactors will be flushed out, it may no longer be necessary to inquire into some of these matters.  It is important to signal the concern that exists.  For that reason, I am pleased to support amendment No. 1.</P>

      <P>This amendment is interesting because it begins with the words &ldquo;Bearing also in mind&rdquo;.  When I asked the Whips if I could speak today, I was told my request would be borne in mind.  However, I was not allowed to do so.  It is possible to bear things in mind but that does not mean scandals will be uncovered.  I refer particularly to Glending Woods.  I understand a Labour <Col N="834" /> Party councillor, Mr. Cullen, who is directly involved in this matter has asked his party to support the Green Party amendment, which I hope it will.  This is a scandal which must be fully investigated by the tribunal.</P>
      <P>We want to know why sand and gravel deposits, which we estimate were worth a minimum of £48 million, were sold for £1.25 million. We want to know why a 3,000 year old bronze age site was delisted by the Government under the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht said it was not delisted but I have evidence to show it was.  If a tribunal were established, those involved could show what happened.  We want to know why Wicklow county manager continued negotiations with Cement Roadstone Holdings at a time when Wicklow County Council's planners were pursuing it in the High Court for unauthorised quarrying in Glending Woods.  We also want to know if there is any connection between the sale of lands at Glending Woods to Cement Roadstone Holdings at a time when Mr. Des Traynor, who was Mr. Haughey's financial adviser, was its chairman and was involved in the negotiations and the fact that Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>We know Cement Roadstone Holdings has given money to political parties because my Green Party colleague, Mr. David Healy, asked this question at its annual general meeting after buying two shares and becoming a shareholder. We must find out the connection between donations to political parties and actions of political parties.  We can talk about individuals but we must examine the way political parties act in these matters.</P>
      <P>I ask the Labour Party to support our amendment.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Sinn Féin, I welcome the work of the tribunal, its comprehensive report and recommendations.  It is an indictment not only of the individual politicians named in the report but of their parties.  It says something of the extent of justified public cynicism about politics and politicians that it is to such tribunals that the people now look more and more for the investigation of issues and the resolution of problems, a role they have long ceased to expect from so many of their elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The McCracken report has shone a light on the dealings not just of two wealthy former members of Government and their even wealthier business friend, Mr. Ben Dunne, but of a political class that has created a culture of privilege, a golden circle.  They have treated the State more like a <Col N="835" /> potato republic than a real democracy.  Claims that big business donations do not give the donors privileged access to the corridors of power have no credibility.  Does anyone seriously believe that the bankrolling of the two main political parties and of senior figures within them by one of the biggest companies in the State has had no bearing on policy either directly or indirectly?  The Government should now take speedy action on the recommendations of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The report notes that as many of the payments to Deputy Michael Lowry and Mr. Charles Haughey were made offshore and in a manner veiled in secrecy in an attempt to ensure they would remain undiscovered, it may be that the measures in the recent legislation do not go far enough in ensuring that unacceptable financial transactions will not be repeated.  Stronger legislation is needed not only for such dealings by those in public office but also for the export of private and corporate wealth generated in this State.  There needs to be a much deeper probing into the Ansbacher accounts, for example, in the investigation of which the McCracken tribunal was hampered.  The new tribunal should be empowered to inquire into this matter.  I support amendment No. 17 in that regard.</P>
    <P>The tribunal does not consider it practical to prohibit all political contributions and rely solely on public funding of political parties.  There is much public unease about the provisions of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995, for the public funding of parties.  This is understandable as people clearly see that the bigger parties will continue to benefit from the support of wealthy benefactors while obtaining the biggest proportion of the funds set aside for the parties. However, this is also a democratic issue.  One of the democratic demands raised during the struggle for universal suffrage and democratic equality throughout the 19th century was the payment of Members of Parliament.  Non-payment meant that only the wealthy could afford to run for public office or to hold that office if they were elected.  A way must be found to eliminate the continuing electoral advantage bestowed by wealth and privilege.  The best way to do this is to limit spending by parties and candidates even further than is set down in the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>For too long the close relationship between the wealthiest in our society and the most powerful politicians has bought first class citizenship for a privileged few.  It has reduced the rest of us to lesser citizenship and today it still excludes tens of thousands of people from the benefits of the much vaunted Celtic tiger economy.  The people are demanding an end to this inequality and it is the business of legislators to do so.</P>

      <P>I am taking this debate on behalf of the Taoiseach. These amendments would not improve the tribunal's terms of reference.  As Deputy Noonan <Col N="836" /> said, there were considerable negotiations on how to proceed following the McCracken tribunal. The purpose of the negotiations between the parties and the Government Chief Whip and the Taoiseach was to draw up the terms of reference for the new tribunal as speedily as possible so that all matters requiring public attention could be examined.  Following these negotiations, it was decided to follow the money trail and if that led to unusual decisions, the tribunal would then be in a position to inquire into them.  All the Opposition parties wanted to follow the money trail first.  The terms of reference for this tribunal were framed with that in mind.</P>
      <P>If we accept amendment No. 1, we are saying to the tribunal it can follow the money trail but it must also follow its decisions.  I heard many Members of this House on radio and television saying it would be better to move in the other direction.  This amendment would not add to the tribunal's terms of reference.  I thought everyone agreed that was not the way to proceed.  The Government Chief Whip and the Taoiseach proceeded with the Opposition on that basis.  We now want to include more items, but this amendment would not add to the terms of reference which are specifically designed that the money trail is to be followed.  The tribunal will have adequate powers to investigate any of those decisions and anything arising there from.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 14.  Deputy Joe Higgins specifically wants to get behind the terms of the 1993 tax amnesty.  The terms of the tax amnesty were set forth in such a way that acceptance of amendments Nos. 14 and 15 would mean the undoing of the requirements of that amnesty Act and it is not possible to so do.</P>
      <P>If the money trail and the approach which the tribunal will be adopting leads to some further investigations relating to the decision on Glending Wood which is covered by Deputy Joe Higgins's amendment No. 16, then the tribunal has adequate powers within its terms of reference to follow that and related decisions.  That has been the <i>modus operandi</i> in setting down these terms of reference and that is the way the tribunal will proceed.</P>

The tribunal may inquire into the following: if Mr. Haughey was the beneficiary of any other moneys in any of the other Ansbacher accounts; if he was the beneficiary, who donated the money; if any other office holder or former office holder was a beneficiary; or if there was a channel through a Haughey-controlled account which benefited office holders or previous office holders. That is the public's primary concern.  They want a clean political system.  They want to ensure that there is no corruption in politics and they want a further and wider scrutiny of the Ansbacher accounts to see whether there were corrupt practices involving Mr. Haughey, other officer holders or former office holders.  In so far as it goes, that is fine with us.  It focuses on the issue of primary public concern.</P>
      <P>However, there is an issue of public concern which is almost as strongly felt.  If these accounts had nothing to do with politicians, if these Ansbacher accounts were merely there for the purposes of tax evasion or exchange control evasion to benefit private citizens in this country, the public feel they should be inquired into also. There is no link with political corruption and no <i>prima facie</i> case of anything connected with politics in this secondary concern, but the public will not forgive us if we allow these terms of reference to be agreed without facing the tax evasion issue head on.</P>
      <P>I know there are legal difficulties in drawing up terms of reference to examine bank accounts held in the names of private citizens.  If one says that we are to examine private citizens' Ansbacher and Guinness Mahon accounts, the law of equity in my view would extend as far as to make it necessary to examine every bank account held by Irish citizens in any kind of offshore arrangement. That might have unforeseen effects on the economy. We must achieve terms of reference which target and focus on the public concern without having some kind of prurient trawl through the private affairs of decent citizens who are doing nothing wrong.</P>
      <P>I believe the way I have cast this amendment is the way to do it.  I am asking that the procedures used would be examined to see whether tax evasion occured or whether there were attempts to avoid exchange control regulations.  If it so transpires in the preliminary stages, then the tribunal would make recommendations not only on how these practices should be avoided in the future in respect of Ansbacher but in respect of accounts held throughout the banking system.  I strongly recommend that approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly in agreement with the argument and the clear case put forward by <Col N="838" /> Deputy Noonan.  The inadequacy of the focus on the Ansbacher accounts drew the most criticism in public debate.  While the focus has been on ethics and standards in politics, it is a matter of concern for every citizen, and particularly every tax-payer, that if wrongdoing is discovered by somebody who happens not to have been a former Minister or Mr. Haughey, then that is not within the scope or ambit of exposure by this tribunal, and that is wrong.  It is often suggested that politicians have certain privileges but this is a peculiar privilege, the privilege to be uniquely investigated. If others are found to be involved in tax evasion, they are not under the scope of this tribunal. If such wrongdoing is discovered, it should be followed through at least to the extent of being notified to the Revenue to ensure that the same tax regime that applies to the compliant citizens of this State applies to all and nobody is above the law in this regard.  It is extremely important in the context of instilling public confidence in the political system and the workings of this new tribunal.</P>
      <P>I listened with care to the words of the Tánaiste in bringing the previous debate to a conclusion on behalf of the Government.  She spoke passionately in terms of this second tribunal being a final opportunity to restore public confidence in the operations of the political system and all its subsidiaries, the system of governance of this country. I strongly urge the Minister for Finance to look at one of the series of amendments.  Each of the parties and the Independents in Opposition sought to formula a wording which would be appropriate to allow the type of exposure about which Deputy Noonan and I have spoken.  If the words of the Tánaiste are to be believed &mdash; and I, for one, believe them &mdash; surely there is a form of words among those amendments which the Government will accept.  If the Government has an amendment or if it wishes to add, subtract or amplify any of the amendments in the names of Opposition Deputies, I am sure there will be no difficulty in facilitating that approach on this side of the House.  It is extremely important that this issue is not fudged.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>Mr. Justice McCracken's relevant comment is as follows:</P>
      <P>It is not the function of this Tribunal to examine these deposits in any detail, and it may well be that a number of the Irish depositors may have been people engaged in international business which was greatly facilitated by having a sterling account abroad which did not require exchange control permission to operate.</P>
      <P>He concludes:</P>
      <P>No doubt there were others who deposited the monies in this way from other motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can deduce that there is legitimate money for international business in some of those memorandum accounts but we can similarly infer from what Mr. Justice McCracken has said &mdash; he would <Col N="839" /> be unlikely to make the latter remark if the accounts did not contain money which was deposited for other motives &mdash; that the motive was tax evasion.  Deputy Spring's amendment refers to the source of any money held.  My party's amendment, amendment No. 6, refers not only to the source but to the beneficial ownership of any moneys.  The essence of what we are providing in the motion is that if people in public life have been availing of this kind of tax evasion mechanism it is wrong, but if private wealthy citizens want to go about evading their taxes, we ought not to inquire into it.</P>
    <P>I understand amendment No. 6 has struck terror into the heart of the system and it is believed interest rates, etc., will rise in the morning.  Perhaps that is correct.  However, the argument as the man in the street will see it, is that we will not investigate this matter because further tax cheats might be discovered.  There might be more than one accountant in this city working for a small bank who has assembled a portfolio of £38 million and salted it away in off-shore accounts for the purposes of evading tax.  There may be other accountants who have used instruments available in this jurisdiction to evade tax.  It is hard to justify this to ordinary people.</P>
    <P>If the Fine Gael amendment is a reasonable <i>via media</i>, I will support it.  However, I find it difficult to understand how we can state that it is acceptable for wealthy personages resident in this jurisdiction to evade their taxes.  I understand that accounts of this kind were perfectly legal until 1978 when Ireland left the sterling area.  Sterling was not a foreign currency at that time and it is only since then that the exchange controls applied until about 1991.</P>

      <P>Deputies Howlin and Noonan made very cogent arguments in favour of pursuing these accounts.  I was particularly struck by Deputy Howlin's point that there should not be special standards which suggest that politicians are the only people who may be inspected.  We should also investigate instances where there is any reason to fear that institutions, banks or professionals have been involved in wrongdoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the earlier group of amendments, it strikes me there are other ways to pursue some of the issues raised, particularly that of Glending Wood. I have already decided to request that the Committee of Public Accounts should undertake a full examination of the situation surrounding Glending Wood.  Some of the details connected with this matter may be forgotten if the relevant amendments are defeated and I suggest the investigations should not be put to one side as a result. I hope Members will use the other available institutional <Col N="840" /> arrangements, particularly the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and specifically the Committee of Public Accounts, to examine other scandals.  Glending Wood is one of the scandals I am anxious to see properly investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Party also believes that the matter of the Ansbacher accounts does not only require the investigation of the affairs of politicians.  Those accounts were not set up simply for the benefit of politicians.  As other Members indicated, there are other accounts which require investigation.  Some of these are quite legitimate and the people in whose names they are held have nothing to fear.  However, if the Dáil is a true representative body it should concern itself with matters about which PAYE workers, the unemployed and unpaid volunteers are concerned. Overseas accounts of this type raise questions in the minds of ordinary people.  There may be reasons relating to business matters which necessitate the establishment of such accounts but for the majority of people this investigation involves politics.  However, this is not solely a political investigation and the amendment stresses that point.</P>
      <P>The question arises from this group of amendments as to why would people want to evade the censure of the Revenue Commissioners by establishing certain off-shore accounts.  The amendments also give rise to questions regarding whether the Revenue Commissioners have sufficient powers or the will to pursue some of the more suspicious accounts which could be unveiled with a proper investigation of the Ansbacher accounts.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that there is a see no evil hear no evil school of thought and that once one makes a tax return regardless of the fact that it could be completely inconsistent with the wealth displayed by one, the Revenue Commissioners have done their job.  People must be reassured that this is not simply a case of making a tax return; everything must be declared.  This is included in one of the amendments tabled by the Opposition, including the Green Party, and worries can be dealt with in due course.  The concerns behind the amendments are not being addressed by the tribunal and if we are to ensure politics will be restored to a position of respect, this or a similar amendment will need to be taken on board as part of the investigation by the new tribunal.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I am sorry Deputy Roche had to withdraw so quickly.  With regard to Glending Wood, he knows well that the Committee of Public Accounts does not have the powers of a tribunal to compel people to appear before it and reveal bank accounts, etc.  That is a feeble way of opposing the amendment.  Paragraph (c) of the proposed terms of reference seeks to examine&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> Whether any payment was made from money held in any of the accounts referred to at (b) to any person who holds or has held public office during the period of his/her tenure.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Finance explain this?  Why should an investigation into such a person be confined to the period when he or she held office? Substantial payments could have been made before or after that time which would be relevant. I am sure that at least this seemingly minor but important point will be accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>The majority of decent people looked askance when it was revealed that Irish residents had £38 million in the offshore Ansbacher accounts.  The impact of this was that a veil was lifted on the dealings of some elements of business and finance. We saw the devious methods of some captains of industry and finance &mdash; the ugly face of Irish capitalism &mdash; which justified the cynicism of decent PAYE taxpayers who are crucified and forced to pay every penny.  The Government does not want to investigate the matter and Deputy Rabbitte referred to this earlier.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken poses a question that must be answered:</P>
    <P>No doubt there were others who deposited monies in this way from other motives.</P>
    <P>What were these motives?  It is clear what he is getting at.  Every week in Dublin decent PAYE taxpayers are dragged into court by local authorities for arrears amounting to £255 for the hated water tax, now abolished.  They are asked what their income is, etc. because they correctly objected to an unjust tax via a simple disobedience. Some £38 million is held in the offshore accounts which are undoubtedly for tax evasion purposes.  However, the Government does not propose to examine them despite having this ideal opportunity.</P>
    <P>Was the tax amnesty availed of to bring laundered funds back into the economy?  If these questions are not answered, it makes a mockery of a new investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to exchange control matters, on the day the tribunal report was <Col N="842" /> received my Department requested the Central Bank, to which organisation the operation of exchange control arrangements was given in 1965, to investigate the issues raised by McCracken in so far as exchange control regulations had been breached.  Members will recall that in the case of Deputy Lowry it appeared to Mr. Justice McCracken that exchange control regulations had been breached.  I have been informed by the Central Bank that this involves going through many transactions but it hopes to be in a position before the end of the month to send me a report on same.  On receipt of those findings I will then be in a position, if it warrants it, to send those files and papers to the Director of Public Prosecutions who will take it from there.</P>
      <P>The other point concerns the audit procedures undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.  I believe the former wording relating to the Ansbacher accounts in these terms of reference and the words relating to the investigations by the Revenue Commissioners will give the commissioners ample powers to pursue tax evasion if, as a result of this tribunal, further tax evasion queries come to light.</P>
      <P>The focus of this new tribunal is on politicians or on former politicians.  The original purpose of this tribunal, arising from the McCracken tribunal, was to focus on the activities of politicians and favours thereto.  It was not intended at the outset that other matters be investigated.</P>
      <P>I have looked at the amendments tabled by Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Sean Barrett. We would like to accommodate amendment No. 21.  We have not been able to come up with a more suitable amendment at this stage but if I have a suitable form of wording before the close of the debate at 4.30 p.m.  I will put it to the House.  As Deputy Noonan has said, other considerations must be taken into account in the whole area of the Ansbacher deposits.  I am not trying to lessen the anxiety on the part of the ordinary compliant taxpayer when he sees enormous sums of money such as this.  In defence of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I have said this before becoming Minister for Finance &mdash; the change in its whole operation in the past ten to 15 years is one of the significant factors in the Exchequer returns in recent years.  Anybody who has been involved and has looked at the changes will be aware this is happening.  I might be in a position to accept a modified form of amendment No. 21 but apart from amendment No. 7 I cannot accept the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2, 8, 9 and 10 are in the names of myself and Deputy Barrett. The term of reference, as drafted, would cut off <Col N="843" /> the investigation into Mr. Haughey as soon as he ceased to be a Member of this House.  If we look at the Dunnes tribunal and match the dates of the payments from Dunnes to Mr. Haughey, at least one was after that time.</P>
      <P>If we are investigating political corruption the word &ldquo;kickback&rdquo; would be in everybody's mind in terms of political corruption in other jurisdictions. It is not necessarily at the time the favour is done that the money is paid.  Unless it is extended up to 31 December 1996 this term of reference confines the scrutiny of Mr. Haughey from 1 January 1979 up to the day he ceased to be a Member.  It should be extended.  It is an omission which I do not think was intended but it should be corrected.</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 8 which is similar, paragraph (d) refers again to Mr. Haughey's ministerial offices.  The Attorney General may give us assurances that the ministerial offices include the office of the Taoiseach but I would be much happier if the words &ldquo;or during periods when he was Taoiseach&rdquo; were included.  There is not much point in investigating Mr. Haughey when he was a Minister if he is not investigated when he was Taoiseach.  In any event, he was not a Minister between the effective dates; he was Taoiseach all the time.  We need either an assurance that the legal advice is that the phrase &ldquo;ministerial office&rdquo; includes the office of Taoiseach or, alternatively, the acceptance of my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 refers to Deputy Michael Lowry and seeks to substitute &ldquo;ministerial office&rdquo; for &ldquo;any public office&rdquo;.  There has been a very fair attempt to ensure that the terms of reference in respect of Deputy Lowry mirror those relating to Mr. Haughey.  I do not think the House intends that Deputy Lowry should be investigated in his capacity as a member of the Mid-Western Health Board or as a member of Tipperary County Council.  Ministerial office is the issue there.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 10 speaks for itself.  There has been conversation, if not <i>prima facie</i> evidence, over the years to the effect that the manner in which the leader's allowance is paid to leaders of the Opposition leaves a lot to be desired.  It is paid by personal cheque by the Department of Finance in the name of the leader.  Public servants at senior level and people in the main Government parties have been fairly free over the years to describe Mr. Haughey's lack of discrimination between a political expense and a personal expense, and in regard to entertainment which benefited the Fianna Fáil Party, even though there was a social element attached to it.  No fine distinctions were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The totality of the leader's allowances in the 1980s amounted to in excess of £1 million.  If we are following the money trail, that money trail should be examined as well.  The Taoiseach's <Col N="844" /> assurances that everything was in order were less than all-embracing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 in the name of Deputy Spring mirrors the sentiments and concerns of amendment No. 10 just addressed by Deputy Noonan.  Again it relates to the leader's allowance, how the very substantial sum of money, in excess of £1 million, paid out of State coffers to Mr. Haughey as Leader of Fianna Fáil specifically for parliamentary support was used and disbursed by him when he was party leader in the years 1983 to 1992.  There is a great deal of disquiet on both sides of the House, including among Fianna Fáil members, about how that money was disbursed, how it was handled and spent.  It was not intended to meet the personal expenses of an individual.  It was intended to be a parliamentary allowance for the proper support of parliamentary expenses of a political party.  It is an issue that should be encompassed in the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I also support the amendments tabled by Fine Gael which tidy up the terms of reference in relation to, for example, a period to be covered to ensure that there is a comprehensive overview and that the tribunal will not find itself hamstrung on a technicality whereby, because of a certain timeframe in the terms of reference, some untoward act would not be investigated fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Minister to focus, for a moment, on amendment No. 13 which relates to paragraph (j) and the Revenue Commissioners, in other words, the power that is being conferred on the tribunal to establish whether the Revenue Commissioners availed in full and in a timely way of their powers to investigate Mr. Haughey and Deputy Lowry.  Can the Minister say to the House that the tribunal may get the file on Mr. Haughey's tax affairs other than as relates to the Dunnes Stores payments? The whole exercise will be largely futile, since we already know the answer on the Dunnes Stores payments, if we do not get the tax file for the years when this conspicuous consumption was paraded under the noses of the Revenue Commissioners. That is the question the man in the street and the small business person want answered. In amendment No. 13 I propose to include paragraphs (a) and (b).  The motion includes only paragraph (a).  Paragraph (b) refers to other bank accounts discovered by the tribunal.  This matter must be investigated, not merely in the context of the Dunnes Stores payments but in terms of other payments and bank accounts that might be discovered by the tribunal, and the Revenue Commissioners must furnish the necessary documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be a perfectly plausible explanation for this.  Mr. Haughey may be a blood stock producer, a famous explanation I got from the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners regarding <Col N="845" /> another matter.  For all I know, he may be breeding prize ponies and selling them to Mr. Goodman. They may have developed a fetlock problem which could be claimed against insurance.</P>

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I am appalled the Government is not accepting the substantive amendments.  It is obvious the terms of reference and the Government's proposals are a cynical manoeuvre to use Messrs.  Haughey and Lowry as lightning conductors to divert the anger of the ordinary people, the attention of the media and turn the spotlight on to those individuals.  It is an attempt to make them perform the same function as the old goat in the supposedly less enlightened days of yore when the populace placed all their sins on the unfortunate animal's head and dispatched it into the wilderness.  It is obvious that is the Government's intention rather than holding an inquiry to get at the truth of standards at the interface of business and politics in the past ten years.  That is the conclusion people in general will draw from the Government's action.  It obviously does not want to delve deeper than the narrow terms of reference which relate to mainly two individuals.  Why is that the case?  Is it afraid other embarrassments might come to light or that other individuals found hiding behind &ldquo;S&rdquo; codes in Ansbacher accounts might be big beneficiaries of Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats or even Fine Gael which also receives substantial contributions from big businesses?</P>
      <P>I take it the Minister for Finance will adopt a similar attitude to amendment No. 11 since its proposal is similar to that contained in amendment No. 7.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference before us are about putting politics before people, damage limitation, self-preservation and big business as usual.  They will ensure the symbiotic relationship between business and politics continues to erode the fabric of democracy and public confidence in it.  The tactics are clear.  The terms of reference are a decoy to concentrate on Haughey and Lowry as they are yesterday's men.  Fianna Fáil can afford to put a stake through Mr. Haughey's heart, he is dispensable.  However, while Haughey might be gone the Haugheyites live on.  They are alive and well and enjoying the privileges of Government.  Our current Taoiseach is foremost among the Haugheyites; he is Mr. Haughey's chosen successor, &ldquo;the most cunning and devious of them all&rdquo;, according to the former Taoiseach. What was intended as a compliment now takes <Col N="846" /> on a chilling resonance in light of the McCracken report.</P>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach use that cunning and deviousness when appointing another Haugheyite, Deputy Burke, as Minister for Foreign Affairs? This was an extraordinary decision, given what we know about the Minister.  There is a thick file on him in Garda Headquarters in the Phoenix Park.  He has been investigated 20 times by the fraud squad, he received £30,000 from a developer but the Government would have us believe all this is normal, acceptable, above reproach, and should be rewarded with a ministerial position.  If this is so, political standards are relative and the Taoiseach inhabits a different universe to the rest of us.  To most people, receiving a payment of £30,000 in cash is quite extraordinary.  My party is clear and unequivocal in its response &mdash; the terms of reference must be broadened to include an investigation into these important matters.  I will speak again when my amendment relating to Deputy Burke comes up for discussion and I will deal directly with that subject.</P>

    <P>The leader's allowance has been paid to party leaders since 1938 to meet the expenses of maintaining party operations.  It was always paid to a <Col N="847" /> leader or a bank account nominated by the leader &mdash; that applied to all parties &mdash; until the passing last December of the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.  Members will remember the furore surrounding that Act and the stirring speech made from these benches by my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, concerning the media's attitudes to politicians.  Prior to that Act the payment was always made to the leader, with no provision as to the purposes of the payment.  The 1996 Act provides that the money must go towards parliamentary activities, including research.  The amount paid to political parties has always been known and it would have been the job of the Members of those parties to decide or ascertain how it would be spent.  Since this was raised some months ago, the Taoiseach has investigated the matter and consulted the party administrator during Mr. Haughey's reign as Fianna Fáil leader.  I use the word &ldquo;reign&rdquo; advisedly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I particularly wish to draw the attention of the Minister to amendment No. 27. The purpose of this amendment is to have included the matters which were the subject of the personal statement made to the House yesterday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs after subparagraph (i) &mdash; in other words, at the preliminary stage of the tribunal when the sifting process is carried out &mdash; to establish whether there is evidence which would warrant these matters being referred to the tribunal proper.</P>
      <P>I submit it is very difficult to understand any argument the Minister can advance which resists that process which, under subparagraph (i), will be carried out in private.  My party has tabled an amendment to excise the words &ldquo;in private&rdquo; because that is an undesirable situation.  There was no such stricture on McCracken, yet he exercised his discretion and everybody says he did a very good job.  Why can we not leave it to the discretion of the tribunal on this occasion?</P>
      <P>If the Government is not minded to do that, then I merely ask that at the preliminary stage, during the sifting process which is conducted in private, the matters which were the subject of the personal statement by the Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, should be included.  As somebody remarked on radio today, if this matter had come into the public arena during the Lowry/Haughey affair it would have indisputably been referred to the McCracken tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To quote Deputy Gormley who talked about yesterday's men, how can this House justify to the public that we are prepared to investigate the misdemeanours of yesterday's men, but a serving Minister, who may have done nothing wrong &mdash; this is entirely non judgmental &mdash; but who received an inordinately large personal donation from a stranger can give us no information on the motivation behind that?  The amendment is non-judgmental and I do not seek its inclusion in the tribunal's terms of reference.  The tribunal should deal with the matter in so far as it relates to the preliminary stage.  It could proceed if evidence is <Col N="849" /> established but if it is not, that would be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government appears to have drawn a line in the sand.  The Minister's triumphant remarks after yesterday's debate, when he misunderstood the civility demonstrated towards him because of the manifest stress he was under in the House, were not in his interest.  Accepting the amendment is the least the House should do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendment No. 27.  Of all the issues debated this week, there has been a strong public focus on the need to ensure that the House does not deal just with wrongs in the past and that confidence is restored now in everybody who holds public office.  In common with other contributors, I make no allegations against the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  A <i>prima facie</i> case has not been established but all Members are amazed that somebody who was barely known to the Minister arrived with two envelopes stuffed to the gills with £30,000 in cash.  This needs further investigation at least in the preliminary stage.</P>
      <P>There are two ways to deal with this matter, both of which are covered in the amendments. The House could include them in the terms of reference of the new tribunal or alternatively we could take the path outlined by Deputy Rabbitte which is encompassed in amendment No. 27.  This would ensure at least a proper sifting of the issue. If matters need to be investigated, they should be investigated.  If no such matters arise, the issue will rest there.  It is essential for all Members that the amendment is accepted by the House and incorporated in the terms of reference.  I understand the parties in Government share the strong view on this side that this should happen.  There should be no question marks left over this crucial issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party's position is similar and we will support this good amendment. Following yesterday's debate which involved a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, and questions, Fine Gael's view is that while nothing further emerged to damage the Minister's reputation, it did not clear up the event.  There is not a <i>prima facie</i> case for making the Minister's payment an issue within the terms of the tribunal for a full blown inquiry because it has not reached that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party wondered whether it could be included if other facts emerged in the interim report from the tribunal to the House which will also cover the adequacy of the terms of reference.  My party considered whether that would be the appropriate time.  It also considered if a committee of the House should look at this matter further.  However, Deputy Rabbitte and his Democratic Left colleagues have come up with the solution.  It should be included in the preliminary sifting in which the tribunal will engage in private.  If nothing emerges, there will be no damage to the Minister's reputation because everything will be conducted in private.  However, <Col N="850" /> if new facts emerge which call for further inquiry, it will proceed to the body of the tribunal in the same way as other issues will proceed.  The Opposition owes a debt of gratitude to Deputy Rabbitte and his colleagues because we all wondered how to deal with this issue which needs to be addressed.  The amendment is the best solution I have seen so far and my party supports it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGormley" hpid="Mr. Gormley Mr. Gormley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gormley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed at yesterday's events.  It appeared the Minister, Deputy Burke, did much filibustering and that his answers were inadequate.  When I asked him why payment was made in cash, he replied that I would have to ask the developers that question.  If we had a tribunal that question could be asked and the developers could be made to open their books.  Maybe that is why there is a reluctance among certain Opposition parties to Deputy Burke being investigated by a new tribunal.  If the books were opened, they might reveal that others were in receipt of payments. That is what Deputy Burke implied yesterday and why he feels so aggrieved.  He believes he is being singled out and implied that everyone is at it.  We are not.  The Taoiseach said yesterday that no party is blameless.  The Green Party has never accepted a donation from a developer.  I call for unity among the Opposition parties today in supporting our amendment.</P>
      <P>People are missing the point.  We are talking about <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  The McCracken tribunal was the best ever yet it did not discover political impropriety.  Once it started to dig, it found a lot more.  We know that large tracts of land were rezoned against the wishes of professional planners.  We know that huge sums of money were made by developers because of these rezonings.  We know that these developers have given money to political parties.  We know that the explanation given by Deputy Burke is not satisfactory.  We also know that public confidence in the planning process is at an all-time low.  If this Government is serious about restoring public confidence in politics and the planning process, it must investigate these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Government does not want to include these matters in the terms of reference because it would open the biggest can of worms ever seen in this State.  The &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario would become a thing of the past.  If the tribunal extends to Deputy Burke, the outlook for him is very bleak.  He would go down, and the question would be: who would go down with him?  Deputy Burke has the unequivocal support of the Progressive Democrats which must be a great comfort to him.  It is the same reassurance that a Premier League football manager feels when the board of directors give him a vote of confidence although his team is playing badly. The Progressive Democrat support for Deputy Burke is the first chapter in their political obituary. A once proud party is now a sad, pathetic rump.  They are an insipid and uninspiring bunch of has-beens.  Faced with the challenge of being radical or redundant, the Tánaiste took the <Col N="851" /> redundancy package and fled.  The policy-driven party have become the Mercedes-driven party. The pursuit of perks, power and privilege has replaced the politic of principle.</P>
    <P>I ask support for our amendment from all Opposition parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments relate to Deputy Ray Burke.  Let us be honest about this. I hear Deputies I like making remarks in private about Deputy Burke to the effect that of course he may have done nothing wrong and they are not making any allegations, yet they want to keep this game going forever.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke did what no other Deputy has done in my time in this House.  He came into the House, made a personal statement, subjected himself to cross-examination and gave a fair outline of his personal affairs, which I would not like to have done.  That set a precedent with which all Members will have to live.  Some people outside the House will only be satisfied when Deputy Burke resigns.</P>
      <P>I am not the guardian of Deputy Burke's conscience. In my 20 years in the Dáil we have been mostly on opposite sides in political debate, but I defend the right of everybody to be treated fairly. Deputy Burke has stated quite clearly that he received this money and has stated the circumstances in which he received it.  People are saying that there is no <i>prima facie</i> case or allegations of wrongdoing but they still want to keep this matter going.  It is the greatest amount of bloody hypocrisy that we have had in the House for a long time.  Journalists and the media have spent much time researching the activities of Deputy Burke and it is time they either put up or shut up as no further evidence has been adduced in this matter.</P>
      <P>The question was raised by Deputy Gormley and Deputy Joe Higgins who seem to be the new conscience of the House while the rest of us are lesser beings.  They are trying to grab the high moral ground.  From previous experience of people and parties who grab the high moral ground, I warn them to be careful.  Deputy Burke admitted he got £30,000 in cash but Deputy Gormley and others said it was incredible.</P>

      <P>Many incredible things have happened in the past, one of which occurred quite recently.  If you had met a person on the street before the McCracken tribunal and told them that somebody walked into a public house where there was a function taking place upstairs and met a person he had not met before who gave him £15,000 to keep him going, they would not have believed you and would have said it was incredible and that nobody would do that in Ireland.  As a result of the tribunal and our greater knowledge of the person concerned and those who know him, who would not have been surprised by this, it no longer seems incredible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> We are supposed to be incredulous about Deputy Burke and the £30,000 but not about these other activities.  I do not know why those concerned presented the money in cash, nor does he.  He said he accepted £30,000 and he has outlined the circumstances in a way in which no other Member of this House has done.  In the interest of fair play &mdash; I would say this in relation to any Member, and did so not too long ago for a Member who is not a member of my party &mdash; it is time to give Deputy Burke an even chance and that applies both inside and outside the House. There is a marked type of hypocrisy.  There is no one on those benches who does not believe him, except perhaps five Members but the remainder are going along with this morning's media hype and feel they must be on the side of the angels. That nauseates me.  Until further evidence is adduced, Deputy Burke stands cleared of all charges.  I reject all the amendments.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 28, in the names of Deputy Barrett and myself, are tidying up amendments.  Amendment No. 24 states:</P>
      <P>After the definition of &ldquo;Person&rdquo;, to insert the following new definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;Public Office&rsquo; means for the purpose of this Inquiry a member of either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the terms of reference to include Members of the Oireachtas serving at present or having previously served, and not other persons who hold public office.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 28 relates to misdrafting by the draftsperson.  Clearly, when a tribunal reports and does not establish matters of substance, it should at least be required to describe the steps taken to determine what evidence, if any, existed. We do not have to direct a tribunal to do so because we can take it as read but a tribunal should be required to ensure that the steps taken to determine what evidence, if any, existed can be identified.  We want the interim or the final report if the money trail leads nowhere.  The tribunal should have to place a report before the House which will not simply say it did this or that. It must be demonstrable that it did everything within its power to follow the trail and, if it fails, it must be clear that it tried and that the steps it took are clearly identified in the House.  The drafting of this part is incorrect and is off the point.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 22, 25 and 29, which relate to the conduct of the tribunal, have been tabled in the name of Deputy Spring. Amendment No. 22 expands the type of recommendations available to the tribunal.  Without <Col N="853" /> going into detail, it is clear what we want.  Issues raised regarding the conduct of professionals and of the Revenue Commissioners should be open to scrutiny and to specific recommendation by the new tribunal.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 seeks to give discretion to the tribunal to decide whether the preliminary investigation should be conducted in private or in public.  This is a matter which should be at the discretion of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Part B of amendment No. 29 concerns the cost of the tribunal.  While the terms of reference allude to ensuring the costs of the tribunal are kept under control, an issue which will gladden the hearts of the Minister for Finance and his officials, part B of the amendment seeks that &ldquo;all costs incurred by reason of the failure of individuals to co-operate fully and expeditiously with the Inquiry should, so far as is consistent with the interests of justice, be borne by those individuals&rdquo;. It would be improper if the taxpayer was at a loss in funding obstruction of the will of the Oireachtas by any individual or group of individuals.</P>

It would be regrettable if that occurred again.  A number of people have contacted me today to remind me that the second strike by workers at Dunnes Stores took place over a retrospective payment of £1 million due to employees, yet the former principal director of the company was in a position to hand out donations of £1 million on the basis that he wished to buy the friendship of a prominent politician.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>This collection of amendments, though disparate, covers a number of concerns which the public still have about the terms of reference. The focus of the new tribunal is on political careers that are over.  Will the public be reassured that the current political process which must also serve the future is free of the cynicism which currently attaches to it?  Unless the Green Party amendment which would allow for the investigation of other politicians currently serving and who hope to serve in the future is accepted, we will be left with a fossil type investigation which may amount to flogging a dead horse.  Can the Government not find sufficient common sense to extend the terms of reference of the tribunal to allow it cover activities and misdemeanours which may involve current Members of the Oireachtas or those involved in public life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the added aspect of the Revenue Commissioners, who as individuals are doubtless doing the best job they can under the circumstances but who are in the eye of a storm when it comes to answering questions.  Enormous wealth seems to be obvious to everyone apart from those <Col N="854" /> to whom it ought to be obvious.  Why do the Revenue Commissioners find themselves having to be facilitated with a tax amnesty from time to time or why must they be dragged kicking and screaming to answer questions in relation, for example, to Mr. Haughey's wealth?  Why is it that we cannot, through this tribunal, clearly give them the necessary legislation, powers and motivation to do their job?  Why can we not include a revised set of standards in order that the Revenue Commissioners will have no need to be facilitated by tax amnesties?  Such amnesties serve the rich elite and do nothing for the vast majority of people other than to alienate them from the democratic process which is supposed to serve them.</P>

This amendment lengthens the number of recommendations we are asking the tribunal to make but I am willing to accept parts (k) to (o) of the amendment.  With regard to amendment No. 22 (m) I suggest that &ldquo;securing the formal independence&rdquo; be changed to &ldquo;maintaining independence&rdquo;. I am sure Deputy Howlin will agree to that.</P>
      <P>I will also accept amendments Nos. 25 and 29 in Deputy Spring's name.  Amendment No. 25 refers to the privacy of the format of the proceedings. Amendment No. 29 in regard to the cost of the inquiry was referred to by both Deputies Howlin and Rabbitte.  I do not feel that the amendment is necessary.  I am sure Deputies Howlin and Rabbitte probably have good cause to remember&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;chapter 2 of the beef tribunal report which provides an excellent judicial interpretation of the Tribunals of Inquiries Act and refers to decisions made in the United Kingdom and matters relating thereto.  If a person were not to co-operate fully with an inquiry costs would be borne by them in that regard.  However, it is probably worth including the amendment in order to emphasise that we do not want to read, in years to come, of millions of pounds having been spent on an inquiry.  As long as the work is carried out expeditiously and fairly there should be no need for such an amendment.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no need for amendment No. 24 tabled by Deputy Noonan regarding the definition of holder of public office as meaning, &ldquo;for the purpose of this Inquiry a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 tabled by Deputy Noonan refers to the Ansbacher accounts.  I am of the view that in order to encompass the meaning of the amendment it could be incorporated into the recommendations which the tribunal will bring forward as a result of its deliberations.  In the light of accepting amendment No. 22 in the name of <Col N="855" /> Deputy Spring, which includes paragraphs (k) to (o), instead of amendment No. 21, will Deputies Noonan and Barrett accept a further amendment which would include paragraph (p) stating, &ldquo;for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of offshore accounts and to recommend whether any changes in the tax law should be made to achieve this end&rdquo;.  The spirit of amendment No. 21 regarding Ansbacher would be better encompassed in what we are asking the tribunal to do. Having accepted additional recommendations put forward by the Labour Party, instead of amendment No. 21, I ask Deputies Noonan and Barrett to accept the additional recommendation to which I referred.  Perhaps that would satisfy the Deputies' concerns.</P>

The resumè of the McCracken report was that Irish residents put money, which probably should have been taxed, into offshore accounts and brought it back into the country through Ansbacher deposits in Guinness and Mahon.  In investigating that matter, the tribunal will investigate the entire position of Ansbacher deposits and offshore accounts.
