      <P>The position has not changed since I replied to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 1 and 2 on 15 May 1996.  The Deputy will recall that I replied in detail to him by way of letter on 23 October 1996 to a suggestion made in a supplementary question about the acquisition of Daniel O'Connell's birthplace outside Caherciveen, County Kerry.</P>

      <P>My party's Daniel O'Connell is not present today and I am speaking on his behalf.  The Government has shown a lack of imagination in regard to this issue.  Is it proposed to hold special commemorative events or to issue commemorative stamps to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the death of Daniel O'Connell?</P>

      <P>As I indicated to Deputy O'Donoghue on the previous occasions he raised this issue, the Government proposes to issue a stamp to mark the 150th anniversary of the death of Daniel O'Connell.  I understand the Office of Public Works is currently having discussions with a descendant, Professor Maurice O'Connell, on the possibility of holding a ceremony in Derrynane House on the occasion of the anniversary. Two possibilities are an open air mass and a special open day.  Other possibilities, for example, a celebration in Dublin, are also under consideration.</P>

      <P>The interim report of the Devolution Commission was published in August 1996.  That report and the Government statement in response to it were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I understand the commission is finalising a second report.  I do not wish to pre-empt the commission's work by commenting further at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Taoiseach expect the final report to be available?  Does the Government have an action plan to respond to the report and to put into effect any proposals it chooses to make?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate what the Government proposes to do about a report it has not yet received.  In regard to the first report, the Government acted on that in the White Paper on local government produced by the Minister for the Environment.  A substantial number of the recommendations of the interim report were incorporated in the White Paper and will be carried forward into legislation which will be introduced shortly by the Minister for the Environment.  As to the first part of the Deputy's question, I expect the second report to be received quite quickly.  I understand the commission is meeting today and may finalise the report at today's meeting or, if not, at a subsequent meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, surely the question of local government finance is directly related to the question of local government reform.  They are inextricably linked.  I would like an answer to my question.  When does the Taoiseach expect proposals to come forward to end the discrimination created by the Government against members of rural group water schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach might like to respond to the question of the devolution of powers in relation to group water schemes.  He referred to a second report on the devolution of functions and powers to local authorities.  Is that the report the Government requested the commission to produce before the end of last year? Will the Taoiseach enlighten the Whips as to the reason the interim report was referred to them for their consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the report has been referred to the Whips.  The first report, which considered the relationship between local partnership companies, other local development organisations and statutory elected local authorities and which made a number of recommendations on that matter, has been acted upon in the White Paper of the Minister for the Environment, which was approved by Government and will be incorporated in legislation.  The report now in preparation is at an advanced stage and I expect we will see it quite soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Whips are as bemused as the Taoiseach as to the reason it was referred to us.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will ascertain the reason for that before the next Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Without making any judgment on the contents of the report, is it the Taoiseach's view that, in a country with a population of 3.6 million, there are too many layers of bureaucracy at local and national level?  The various partnership bodies and other agencies are all involved in administration.  Where will it end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has a point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not be too surprised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never underestimate Deputy Burke in any matter.  The Deputy has a point.  The various bodies were established for historically varying reasons.  Viewed from today's standpoint, it is difficult to justify their number and the inter-relationship between them.  Viewed from the standpoint of the time of their creation, however, each of them was justified.  The Minister for the Environment's proposals will simplify the <Col N="176" /> matter somewhat by ensuring the various bodies are more integrated.  It is also fair to say, in contra-point to what Deputy Burke has said, that there were complaints in the past that the State was unduly centralised, in other words, there was too much power in the centre and insufficient power devolved to individual bodies and functions at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the regional education boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is now being remedied to some degree, but if the intention is to devolve functions being carried out by one body at national level to perhaps 26 bodies at local level, it is inevitable there will be more bodies doing the same functions than there were previously. The price of decentralisation of power is some administrative complexity.  The task of Government is to find the right balance between decentralisation and undue complexity.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I had separate meetings with the President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, Commissioner Fischler and Commissioner Bonino in Brussels on 4 March.  The meetings were extremely useful in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference and in developing a common understanding of the measures needed to tackle the BSE crisis.  They were also very useful in making the first contacts in relation to the financial perspectives for the European Union post-1999.</P>
      <P>In my meeting with President Santer I reviewed developments at EU level, with particular reference to the Intergovernmental Conference. In this context I stressed that Ireland will strongly oppose proposals which suggest that small member states should forgo their Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My meeting with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies consisted of an early exchange of views on possible developments in relation to the financial perspectives and Structural Funds after 1999.  We did <Col N="177" /> not have a detailed discussion on the amount or nature of Ireland's Structural Funding post-1999.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and I also discussed the need to ensure continued funding for the EU peace and reconciliation fund.  I pointed out in this context that it was essential that the concept of additionality of EU funding be maintained in relation to the Northern Ireland peace process.</P>
    <P>In my meetings with Commissioners Bonino and Fischler, I discussed the latest state of play in the fight against BSE and I offered full support in putting in place the new food safety arrangements at EU level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred in his reply to the right of small countries to have their own Commissioner.  In any of his meetings, did the Taoiseach put forward his own idea of a federal Europe, referred to by him in the Dáil on 28 January and earlier in his New Year statement, which, in effect, would diminish the powers of small countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My position on this matter is well known, as are my convictions.  There was no need for me to repeat them on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Taoiseach's convictions shared by all the members of his Government, particularly his view on a federal Europe with a common defence policy which he wants to make his principal goal for this year?  If it is shared by the other members, why was it not referred to in the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the ever closer union of the peoples of Europe which was agreed to at Maastricht and endorsed by the Irish people.  I believe in that vision as agreed at Maastricht.  It is important, in the interests of a country like Ireland, that we have a closer European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We know the Taoiseach's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties Ireland has faced historically has been that it was overshadowed by a large neighbour.  Our closer accession to Europe and an ever closer union in Europe gives Ireland a capacity to play on a much larger stage and not be overshadowed, as we were in the past, by our nearer neighbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in a closer Union based on a federation of the peoples of Europe because that is the best way forward for this country.  It will enable Ireland to take its place more fully among the nations of the earth than it can do in any other model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept it is now unlikely that Ireland will qualify for Objective 1 status?  That being the case, does the Taoiseach believe it would be better to pursue a <Col N="178" /> regional approach if we are to continue to get EU funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not concede that point, nor should we concede that point.  We are not in the same position in relation to GNP as we are in relation to GDP.  GDP is a particularly inaccurate measure of Irish relative wealth because it includes profits which are repatriated and do not remain here.  Also, it is important to emphasise that Ireland's increase in income is very recent and there is no accumulated wealth here which can be drawn down for capital projects or for unforeseen eventualities, whereas other countries have that facility of accumulated wealth.  Therefore, simple measurements of income on an annual basis do not state the true relative position of Ireland <i>vis-à-vis</i> other countries.  Furthermore, Ireland is a peripheral nation of the European Union.  We are the westernmost part of the Union, and we are an island.  Those are factors that also tend to justify special consideration for this country.  The Deputy can be assured I will use all the resources of this Government, and all the resources that we have evolved and developed during our Presidency, to ensure that we retain Objective 1 status in the negotiations post-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Taoiseach is unlikely to be there to negotiate, I will not worry too much about his analysis.  From what the Taoiseach said, our growth rate is clearly exaggerating the performance of the economy.</P>
      <P>Was economic and monetary union discussed with the Commission, and has the Taoiseach any plans to have fuller consultation with the private sector before we make any further decisions on a single currency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not make inaccurate political predictions at Question Time. There may well be a certain element of whistling past the graveyard on the Deputy's part, but I will not be drawn into a discussion on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is zero tolerance for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The secret of this Government is that it is tolerant of all, including the Opposition. That is one of the reasons it is a success. Zero tolerance was tried by the Deputy's party between 1989 and 1991 and it was not successful. It possibly contributed to the downfall of the Government in which it was participating, so zero tolerance in Government is not a particularly good principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of economic and monetary union is one upon which Ireland has taken a position.  We did not look for opt-outs at Maastricht.  We took the view that if we qualified we would go in, and go in we will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach said this was a preliminary meeting at which he was laying out his stall, so to speak.  What agenda is there for further meetings to press home the case of Ireland to continue to be regarded as an Objective 1 region?  Is there a timetable, an agreed agenda, whereby that case can be pushed? What arguments are being used to rebut the proposition that if we are fit to enter economic and monetary union we are fit to be cut loose from Objective 1 status?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for participation in economic and monetary union under the Maastricht Treaty and the criteria for Objective 1 status are completely different.  The criteria for economic and monetary union relate to levels of borrowing and convergence in regard to interest rates and exchange rates.  The criteria for Objective 1 status relate to income.  It is quite consistent for a country to qualify under the criteria for economic and monetary union and still retain Objective 1 status.  No responsible politician in this House should concede that point.  There is no inter-relationship between the two sets of criteria. As to the action we propose to take to deal with the matter, the Government, following my meeting, is working on a programme of action to deal with this matter to protect the good investment the European Union is making in this country, which gives the best return to Europe on investment by the European Union anywhere within the Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is speaking to the converted on our need to maintain Objective 1 status.  Are we to take it the Government has no fallback position in the event of us not achieving Objective 1 status?  Deputy Harney referred to regionalisation.  Is it not the case that in the event of us not achieving full status, the Government should have a view on looking after disadvantaged areas around the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take up the Deputy's invitation to state a fallback position because I am looking for the retention of our existing position. I acknowledge that it will be a difficult negotiation, but we will be well prepared for it.  As to the reasons for the stance we are taking in regard to Objective 1 status, I have set those out in some detail in response to a question from Deputy Harney.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I addressed the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body at Dublin Castle on Monday, 3 March. The main topics that I covered were Northern Ireland, issues within the broad British-Irish relationship such as Sellafield, and EU-related matters like economic and monetary union. Rather than summarising all the points I made in what was a broad-ranging address, I have instead had copies placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>I dealt in my address with the multi-party talks in Belfast.  As anticipated, the talks have since been adjourned until 3 June, pending the forthcoming local and general elections in Northern Ireland.  This was a sensible decision.  We have been trying to make progress in the negotiations over a number of months and it has been obvious that the imminence of the elections has made it increasingly difficult to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my address to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, I believe that when the talks resume, it will be important that significant progress be made within a finite period, to steer negotiations through to progress as speedily as possible.  We will be pursuing the question of an agreed timeframe and calendar for the negotiations with this aim in mind.</P>
      <P>As I also indicated in my address, it is the Government's hope that the participants generally, with electoral concerns behind them, will be able to agree on a basis for overcoming the current impasse on the issue of decommissioning soon after the resumption of the talks.  The two Governments, working together, must jointly, in all circumstances, continue to offer the leadership that is needed to overcome obstacles and to reach the comprehensive accommodation, founded on consent, which I am convinced is sought by the great majorities on both islands.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultation on the North report, the period for which we believe is too long, is proceeding.  I made it clear at the time that I felt eight weeks was too long and the British Government should come to decisions on this matter earlier.  That has not happened.  However, I am pressing and will continue to press in every way I can for early action on the North report. Local agreement is preferable to outside intervention, including intervention through the very carefully crafted agency of the North report recommendations.  I urge all participants in parades and all persons who are likely to be adversely affected by parades to seek to reach local agreement and to seek to reconcile their views on these matters.  There is a genuine conflict of rights and a conflict of views, and such conflict can only be resolved either by one side giving in entirely or by compromise.  In general compromise is preferable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not think it was a good idea that the multi-party talks were abandoned for the lead-in to and the duration of the general election campaign in the UK and in the North. How does the Taoiseach equate the existence of that vacuum with his statement that it is important that substantial progress be seen to have been made when the talks resume?  It is difficult to see how there can be progress in a lacuna such as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties in Northern Ireland which are participating in the talks have an eye on the upcoming British general election and are unwilling to make compromises with one another lest those compromises be misconstrued or misrepresented by some of their rivals within their own community. That causes difficulty which any politician can fully understand in the run-up to an election in Northern Ireland.  It was a prudent decision to have a break in the talks rather than a period where the talks would be used for electioneering instead of negotiating purposes.  I do not think prolongation of the talks through the active election period would have been constructive; it might have led to a degree of megaphone diplomacy in what is designed to be a confidential negotiation.  The decision taken was a prudent one on the part of the Governments and the participants. Once the election is over in Northern Ireland the position will be different.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the talks have been going on for some time, will the Taoiseach say what progress has taken place?  We read in recent times speculation about changes in Department of Foreign Affairs personnel in this area.  What is happening in that regard?  The Taoiseach said he <Col N="182" /> does not rule out an initiative from the Government. I suggest that the uneasiness in terms of who is moving from where should be sorted out very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Department of Foreign Affairs officials who work for the Government through the Tánaiste do so in accordance with Government policy, in a very dedicated way and with a very high degree of integrity.  Officials, particularly in the Anglo-Irish section, and various ambassadors and staff who have been dealing with Anglo-Irish relationships have done so with an exemplary degree of skill in recent years.  I and the Government have been very well served by those officers.</P>
      <P>On the first part of the question, the best course for me to adopt is to draw the Deputy's attention to the words of the independent chairman, Senator George Mitchell, who specifically said that he was pleased with progress in the talks in regard to a number of matters, including agreement of detailed rules and procedures, agreement to the chairmanship and agreement to the agenda for the plenary session.  Serious efforts were made by most participants to overcome the very difficult issue of decommissioning.  Nobody should pretend this is a simple issue, in view of the radically different perspectives of the different sides on this question.  Although an agreement was not reached, serious efforts were made by most participants at various times to overcome that difficulty. I hope, once the election in Northern Ireland is over and the participants are freed from the constraint which that anticipated event imposes upon them, it will be possible for them to reach an agreement on the issue so that we can proceed to substantive negotiations in the three strands.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his presence at the recent British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting.  The issue of this year's parades took up much time at the meeting, but on the other issue raised, the Bloody Sunday investigation, will the Taoiseach inform the House on the progress the Government has made in its investigation of new evidence in that regard?</P>

      <P>On the multi-party talks, which are postponed until after the elections, all parties agree that until there is a declaration of a ceasefire it would not be proper for Sinn Féin to enter the talks.

      <P>Are there plans for a summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister in advance of the British general election?  Given that a bipartisan approach is adopted to Northern Ireland by this House and the House of Commons, will the Taoiseach agree that should be maintained during election campaigns in both jurisdictions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Contacts with the British Prime Minister are ongoing and if a meeting is judged to be useful between us it will take place.  We will meet soon in a European context.  The Deputy's remarks about the maintenance of bipartisanship in regard to this matter are well made and I will do all I can to ensure that is the case in both jurisdictions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach expect progress will be made this side of a general election? I appreciate the Taoiseach may be in contact with the British Prime Minister, but nothing seems to be happening on either side of the Irish Sea.  With the talks at a standstill, it appears that no progress will take place and we will be at a dead end until after the British general election and possibly after the election here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the republican movement called a ceasefire it would certainly create positive conditions for progress by removing the physical threat which has hung over participants in the talks since 10 June.  Negotiation under threat from outside is obviously more difficult than negotiation where all participants have for-sworn the use of violence and there is no threat of violence from any of the participants in the talks or potentially in the talks.  Clearly the republican movement has a responsibility to make that decision itself.  It can see that its 25 year campaign of violence achieved absolutely nothing.  It reached its original ceasefire on the basis of political analysis which pointed to political participation without the use of violence or the threat of violence as the best way of advancing its objectives. Nothing has changed to alter that analysis. If it was right in August 1994 when there were no talks on offer it is even more right today when talks exist which that movement could enter on the basis of ground rules that are explicit and clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I speak for the vast majority of my colleagues on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body who have been of the view over the years that when there is a vacuum the men of violence take advantage of that lack of political movement.  There is no better time than now to heed that maxim.  What is required is that the two Governments take an initiative <Col N="184" /> rather than de-escalate initiatives, however flawed they may be.  The Taoiseach is holding out no hope of either Government doing anything to ensure the men of violence stay out.  That is wrong.  It is up to the two Governments to leave aside electoral considerations and continue to push their political agenda.  They are, in effect, currently giving in to the men of violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken.  The peace process is based on inclusive negotiations, not on imposed solutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is based on negotiations between the Governments and the parties in Northern Ireland designed to reach an agreement between all parties that will ultimately give us a settlement.  It is not something imposed by the Governments.  I do not believe it is possible in a democracy for two Governments to impose a solution in the way the Deputy, perhaps inadvertently, infers.  The Governments must create an opportunity and an impetus and give leadership to the parties in the talks process so that an agreement can be reached.  We have done that by creating a talks process which is open to all who forswear violence.  This is the first time a talks process as comprehensive as that commenced on 10 June has been available in the history of the Irish problem.  These talks represent an historic opportunity for all concerned to move forward. The Deputy should not, inadvertently or otherwise, undermine the existing talks process by suggesting that unilateral or bilateral action by the Governments could supersede the comprehensive inclusive talks process involving all the democratically elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland as the best way forward.</P>

Anybody with political sense knows that in the run-up to an election parties tend to take maximalist rather than compromised positions with opponents.  The Governments have <Col N="185" /> taken a practical approach to this matter.  The participants have agreed the talks should be suspended until June so that the electoral process in Northern Ireland can run its course and the parties can come back to the talks equipped with a renewed electoral mandate to deal with the issues in a less charged atmosphere.  Meanwhile, the Governments will continue to work on the matter. I maintain close and ongoing contact with the British Prime Minister &mdash; the Tánaiste is doing likewise with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland &mdash; to pursue all possible initiatives to build confidence in the process and to create the best possible conditions for forward movement when the talks resume.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with the Deputy.  It is important that participants take their responsibilities seriously.  There is a tendency, perhaps because of the number of participants in the talks and because the Governments are also involved, for participants to delegate responsibility for contributing towards a compromise to the Governments or someone else.  I agree with the implication in the Deputy's question. I hope, however, the atmosphere after the British general election will be different and that people with a longer electoral timeframe will be more willing to compromise with one another.  It is important that people realise the price of failure to compromise in these talks may be high for everybody.  It may not be possible to pass it off to others, as is currently happening in regard to responsibility.  I thank the Deputy for asking that question.</P>

In regard to a renewed electoral mandate for all the political parties, including Sinn Féin, will the position post the election be the same for a party in Sinn Féin's position which might renew its electoral mandate before the people but would not be subsequently allowed to participate in the renewed talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is laid down in the ground rules for the talks and there has been no change in those rules.  They are founded in legislation. The electoral mandate for the purpose of the talks is the one given prior to the opening of the talks on 10 June.  That is not altered by any other election that may occur.  The conditions of last May's electoral mandate are not being altered in so far as the talks are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Occupiers' Liability Act to which the Deputy refers came into operation on 17 July 1995.  It contained specific provisions which were intended to facilitate the use of land for recreational activities.  It was also designed to simplify and clarify the law on occupiers' liability by putting it on a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The legislation in question was preceded by a Law Reform Commission consultation paper, published in 1993, and by a final report, published in 1994.  Because the introduction of the Occupiers' Liability Bill was so proximate to these reports, it inevitably took on board all the recent developments in this area of the law.  In addition, in drawing up the Bill, I engaged in a very wide consultative process.  Members of the farming community had a particular input in its provisions and I am glad I was able to accommodate many of their concerns.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to review the operation of the Act at this stage.  Since the Act was passed, I have had very little correspondence on this issue which, to my mind at least, suggests that its key provisions are generally regarded as satisfactory. Furthermore, legislation of this kind can be assessed properly only when it has been tested within the context of court litigation.  Such litigation would, as a matter of course, be monitored by my Department.  However, I am confident the principles which the Act contains will safeguard occupiers against unmeritorious claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with what is happening in Ireland today.  Does the Minister agree that one of our greatest assets is our openness to tourists?  Why is the second largest farming organisation erecting luminous signs quoting part of the Act and stating that &ldquo;unauthorised persons will be prosecuted&rdquo;?  That is, in effect, telling tourists to keep out.  Is the Minister aware that people in certain areas are charging tourists to cross their lands to climb mountains and so on? If section 5-(2) of the Occupiers' Liability Act is working so well, why does the ICMSA feel it necessary to erect such posters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Tourism is an important industry and everything possible should be done to facilitate it.  I am not aware and cannot accept that the operation of the Occupiers' Liability Act causes any problem in that regard; the contrary is the case.  I and my Department had extensive consultations with the IFA and the ICMSA and many of the clauses and subsections in the Act result from representations made to me.  I am prepared <Col N="187" /> to keep the operation of the Act under review but there is nothing in it which should cause any undue problems for farm owners or members of the IFA or ICMSA.  Since the Act was passed, I have received no representations from the ICMSA or anyone else indicating a problem or difficulty with it.  If such representations are made to me, I will examine them carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is unaware that the ICMSA has put up signs.  I was informed today that a sign has been placed on Bray Head, which is a public right of way.  Perhaps the Minister could ask the ICMSA why it is afraid of the Occupiers' Liability Act and why it is putting up these signs on public property.  Does such action not ruin our tourism industry and our image as &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the property referred to by the Deputy is public property to which the public has right of access, then no person has any right to block it off.  As far as private property is concerned, if there is no right of way over it, a land-owner has a right, guaranteed under the Constitution, to prohibit access to it by any member of the public.  During consultations on the Occupiers' Liability Act it was made clear to me that farmers had no wish to do that and were prepared to welcome recreational use of their land provided certain provisions were included in legislation to protect them from unmeritorious complaints and claims.  Those suggestions were taken on board and both farming organisations expressed their reasonable satisfaction with the terms of the Act which changed the previous common law position that had led to problems for their members.  They felt that unmeritorious claims were being sustained by the courts against them.  However, the Act has dealt with that, so there is no reasonable basis for members of either organisation to feel their position is being interfered with unduly.  If they feel that a particular case has given rise to problems, I will be happy to look at it.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, few, if any, cases have reached the courts under this legislation.  There is no reason farmers should fear they are leaving themselves open to compensation claims in unreasonable circumstances.  We must monitor this situation but we must also give the Act time to operate.  We must wait to see what type of decisions the courts will make pursuant to this Act and then review the matter if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that such action is intimidatory to recreational users and tourists.  Is the Minister suggesting that a court case should be taken to test the Occupiers' Liability Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to suggest that anybody should bring a test case.  The type of cases which could arise under the terms of this <Col N="188" /> Act could be wide and varied.  The primary thrust of this legislation is to deal with recreational users or trespassers.  The extent of a land-owner's liability to recreational users or trespassers was covered in section 4.  It is a limited liability which provides for liability in only two cases.  One is if the land-owner injured the recreational user or the trespasser intentionally or acted with reckless disregard for such a person.  That is a restricted form of liability.  There can be borderline cases in any situation that arises and I have no doubt the courts will form their own interpretations.  It may be a long time yet before cases reach the courts.</P>
      <P>The fact I have had no letters of complaint or adverse comment about the Act suggests it is working reasonably well.  I urge farmers and landowners to give recreational users and tourists the maximum possible access to their lands because it is an important factor in the tourism industry, which led to this Act in the first place.  I agree with Deputy McDaid that everything possible should be done to encourage them to do so.</P>

      <P>It is for each of the bodies, both public and private sector, referred to in recommendation CR.10.1 to take the recommendation on board in its area of activity.  The Equal Status Bill, 1997, will, when enacted, provide a legislative underpinning to ensure that organisations do not discriminate unfairly in relation to the supply of goods and services.  I also draw the Deputy's attention to the proposal in the Equal Status Bill, 1997, for an equality authority which will have the general function of working towards the elimination of discrimination and promoting equality of opportunity.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, also contains powers relating to the elimination of discrimination and promotion of equal opportunities for travellers in employment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is he concerned that the recommendations of the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community, which was published in July 1995, have not been implemented?  My question relates to equal status policy.  Does the Minister agree that it would be appropriate for his Department to implement not just the recommendation referred <Col N="189" /> to in the question, but also the other recommendations in the report?  Does he also agree that the Government is making little effort to implement these recommendations on a co-ordinated basis? The Minister's reply with regard to recommendation CR.10.1 would seem to confirm this fact when he is unable to outline today the progress which has been made by Departments other than that made by his Department with regard to this most important issue for the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a most important issue but surely Deputy Flood must agree it would not be possible for the entire responsibility to rest with the Department of Equality and Law Reform when one takes into account that there are many Departments and agencies involved. However, there is the interdepartmental group working on the report of the task force.  It meets from time to time and examines the recommendations and the question of implementation among the Departments and agencies coming under the responsibility of individual Ministers and Departments.</P>
      <P>It is open to Deputy Flood or, indeed, any Deputy to raise questions with any Minister with regard to his or her Department or, where that Minister has responsibility for agencies working under the Department's ambit, to examine the operation of equal status in the agency for which he or she has responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, and the Equal Status Bill, 1997, which are proceeding through the Houses of the Oireachtas, will have a major general input into the provision of equal status.  The Equal Status Bill, 1997, will have general application.  The Employment Equality Bill, 1996, has provision for equality reviews and action plans and gives powers to the new Equality Authority, which is to be set up under the provisions of the Equal Status Bill, 1997.  That authority will play a major monitoring role and major powers will be devolved to it under these two Bills.</P>
      <P>There is also provision for codes of practice on these issues and the legislation providing that will be particularly helpful.  It may well be that codes of practice will be prepared which will provide rules for the application of equal status provisions to Departments and their agencies.  All these things taken together are a positive sign and the two equality Bills, when enacted, will be a major source of progress in that regard.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the position of the Law Reform Commission that the rules in relation to the reporting of family law cases are too stringent; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6846/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The law on reporting of family law cases is contained in various family law statues, including those dealing with divorce, separation, maintenance and domestic violence, which, in general, provide that such proceedings shall be heard otherwise than in public.</P>
      <P>In its 1996 report on family courts, the Law Reform Commission affirmed the importance of the right to privacy in family law cases on the basis that they frequently involve detailed discussion of personal relationships.  However, the commission recommends that access by a bona fide researcher to such proceedings should be allowed by a judge subject to refusal only on the basis of compelling and stated reasons and that the attendance of students of family law should be allowed at the discretion of the judge.  The commission's report was preceded by a consultation paper in 1994.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations fall far short of any major relaxation of the <i>in camera</i> rule for family law proceedings.  Legislation would be required to implement the commission's recommendations and when other legislative priorities are disposed of my Department intends to give consideration to the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law proceedings, taking into account the commission's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. Notwithstanding that we do not want to infringe on the privacy of the people involved in family law cases, it is important to have some methodology by which we can keep legislation under review because there are few written judgments and transcripts cannot be examined in the vast majority of family law cases at present.  Does the Minister agree the development of the law and public debate is inhibited by the fact that this information is not available?  Does he see the provision of a mechanism in the short term which will encourage debate on this important social issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I agree that, if all other things were equal, it would be desirable that the family law courts, like all other courts, would be open and the cases reported.  Without question it would <Col N="191" /> be helpful to practitioners.  However, all other things are not equal in family law cases.  There is a serious difficulty having regard to the nature of the material which is adduced before the courts in family law cases which gave rise to the present restriction in virtually all family law cases.  Admittedly, the Law Reform Commission suggested some reform but Deputies will see that even what it proposes is rather limited as it recommends providing access to bona fide researchers on the one hand and students of family law on the other.</P>
      <P>I am broadly sympathetic to considering some relaxation of the present rule provided schemes can be devised to protect the identity of the people whose cases are involved.  It is really a problem which would give rise to difficulty in more rural areas outside the large urban centres. It would not be such a problem in the large concentrated urban areas where anonymity, from description of a case, would not be so readily destroyed.  In rural areas people would readily be identified from the description of events and I would not wish that to happen.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my initial reply, when the Department has disposed of its other legislative priorities we will look carefully at the <i>in camera</i> rule to see what variation can be made.  When we do that we will take into account the comments of the Law Reform Commission and, indeed, other comments made by Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We must protect the identity of people involved in such cases and that must be paramount but I would sound a note of caution on this matter.  Will the Minister agree that one of the difficulties we encountered in the run up to the divorce referendum related to the acceptance of the extent of marriage breakdown and the trauma involved?  We must have an accurate picture of what is going on in society to be able to frame laws.  It is for that reason that a degree of information, irrespective of how it is collated, is essential.  I am glad to hear the Minister will examine the matter.  How imminent is such an examination?  Does the Minister see this happening in the short term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh enunciated the reasons it is desirable that there should be some relaxation of the <i>in camera</i> rule.  Those were the arguments in favour of it.  They are valid and I agree with them.  However, there are also arguments to the contrary which must be taken into consideration.  It is a difficult area as there are arguments for and against the issue.  We must find some basis for some relaxation of the <i>in camera</i> rule and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, though vague in some respects, may form a suitable base.  It is something I will have to consider in the fullness of time, but <Col N="192" /> I cannot give a commitment that it will be done in the short term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be in a position to inform the House that completion of the final phase of the development plan for the Legal Aid Board, the opening of the law centres in Tullamore and Newbridge, has recently occurred.  I am sure those centres will make a significant contribution to the work carried out by the board.</P>
      <P>The opening of the law centre in Tullamore on 27 January 1997 had an immediate impact on the waiting list in the law centre in Portlaoise.  When the centre opened 62 persons were transferred from Portlaoise law centre to the Tullamore law centre.  Also, it is expected that the new centre will reduce the numbers of persons who would otherwise be seeking legal services at the Portlaoise centre.  In addition, since the centre opened some 18 persons have applied to the Tullamore centre from areas traditionally catered for from the Athlone law centre.  This trend is expected to continue.  It is also expected that persons who previously would have sought legal services from Nenagh law centre will now apply in Tullamore for the provision of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a pre-existent waiting list at the Newbridge law centre which was previously operated on a part-time basis from Finglas law centre. This list was taken over by the Newbridge law centre when it opened.  The opening of the Newbridge centre should, accordingly, enhance both the service generally and reduce the pressure on Finglas law centre.  In addition a number of existing clients transferred from Portlaoise to New- <Col N="193" /> bridge when it opened and it is expected that persons who previously would have sought legal services from Navan law centre and some of the Dublin law centres will now apply instead to the Newbridge law centre.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce will affect the numbers seeking appointments with Legal Aid Board solicitors.  As of 26 February 1997 1,062 persons had registered with the Legal Aid Board seeking appointments with solicitors of the board on the coming into force of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 on 27 February 1997.  The figure of 1,062 represents slightly less than 41 per cent of applicants for legal aid at the end of February.</P>
    <P>There is a charge for the services of the Legal Aid Board.  At present, the minimum charge amounts to £23 for this service.  However, the board may, where the maximum income contribution is assessed at £23, either waive the contribution or accept a lower contribution if it considers that it would cause that person severe hardship to pay the maximum contribution.  This provision also applies where the applicant is required to pay both an income and capital contribution. Therefore, applicants for legal aid are required to pay at least a minimum contribution which may be waived or reduced, should the board consider it necessary.</P>
    <P>On the question of extending the Civil Legal Aid Act to people taking legal action on the grounds of discrimination in both the employment and non-employment areas, including travellers, the position is that legal advice is available to an applicant seeking the assistance of the board in respect of an alleged case of discrimination in either the employment or the non-employment areas, where the applicant meets the criteria for the grant of legal service as set out in the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 and in the regulations made under that Act.  Legal aid is available in similar circumstances where the proceedings in question are to be conducted in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court.  Also, the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995 contains a provision in section 27-(2) that enables me, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make an order to extend legal aid to tribunal hearings.  It would be my intention to consider the question of the operation of that provision in due course taking into account progress, workload, the situation of the Legal Aid Board and the demands the introduction of divorce will make on that service and the Exchequer position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>What effect will the 1,062 cases have on the waiting list?  How soon will those cases be processed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The addition of 1,062 cases will involve a substantial increase in the workload of the law centres, depending on where they are.  I cannot give any prognostication as to how that will work out over time.  The law centres are reasonably equipped to cater with the additional <Col N="194" /> workload.  The funding provided for them was substantially increased and the number of solicitors working in them has more than doubled.  As time passes, and the procedures proceed and the divorce jurisdiction develops, this matter will have to be kept under ongoing review.  We will have to monitor how it works out.  It probably will impact more heavily in some areas than others.  It may be necessary to move staff from one centre to another, if there is a lightness of pressure in one area and a weight of pressure in another.  The Legal Aid Board does that as it becomes necessary. The divorce procedure is in place but it is only beginning to get under way.  We, as well as the Legal Aid Board, will monitor the matter closely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to the Legal Aid Board to appoint counsel to represent its clients.  Is representation given by a senior counsel or a junior counsel or is that at the discretion of the Legal Aid Board?  Is a system of appeal open to the appellant if he or she is not satisfied with the way a case has been dealt with by counsel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that in a moment.  If a person applies for legal aid and his or her initial application is turned down or granted on circumstances which are unacceptable to the applicant, he or she can avail of an appeals procedure.  The level of representation they receive depends on what is involved in a particular case.  For example, if a matter could be dealt with by the District Court it would be handled by one of the highly skilled and professional solicitors employed by the Legal Aid Board or, in the small number of cases where the relevant scheme applies, a private practitioner.  On the other hand, counsel would be employed if a case involved Circuit or High <Col N="195" /> Court proceedings or an appeal to the Supreme Court.  Depending on the complexity involved and whether a case was heard by the Circuit, High or Supreme Court, a junior counsel or possibly a senior counsel would be briefed if the situation so warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>It often happens that the female party involved in a case may not have access to adequate finances.  Is consideration taken of the fact that one party can be represented by senior counsel while the Legal Aid Board may only be able to afford to employ a junior counsel or solicitor to represent the other party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Legal Aid Board will provide whatever level of representation it considers appropriate and necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include employing senior counsel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily follow that senior counsel has any particular magic in these situations.  The level of representation that is appropriate and necessary is provided.  Whether or not a person receives legal aid, representation in the District Court is generally carried out at solicitor level.  It is true that junior counsel occasionally appear there but, by and large, solicitors are the advocates in that court.  In the Circuit Court, the usual form of representation involves junior counsel but many solicitors appear without counsel.  Occasionally a senior counsel might appear in the Circuit Court but this is by no means usual.  In the High Court, representation is carried out mostly by junior counsel but the extent of the presence of senior counsel is greater there.  In the Supreme Court, representation is usually, though not necessarily, at senior counsel level.</P>
      <P>Solicitors have a right of audience in all courts of the land, from the District Court up to and including the Supreme Court.  However, this right is not exercised in the higher courts to a major extent.  I believe this to be regrettable but it is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the staff of the courts are adequately trained to deal with the new cases?  Is he confident that the initial difficulties have been overcome or will there continue to be difficulties in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any responsibility for the staff of the courts.  That matter falls within the ambit of the Minister for Justice and the Deputy should consider tabling a question to her Department in that connection.  However, I do not believe there should be any particular difficulty. While not identical, the procedures have much in common with those involving judicial separation. The latest information available to me is that, as far as the Department of Justice is concerned, there is no dispute involved.  However, that is <Col N="196" /> more appropriately a matter for the relevant Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 19 and 26 together.  In the past I indicated that the law of defamation raises complex legal and constitutional issues.  It is beyond question that there are competing rights in this area &mdash; to a good name, to privacy and to freedom of expression.  A good defamation law requires the careful reconciliation of these rights.  I also refer to the fact that the influences which bear upon the law of defamation derive from a multiplicity of sources which include the common law, statute, international law and the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission report on the civil law of defamation is a comprehensive document which deals with this topic in a clear and lucid way.  Many of the recommendations are difficult to quarrel with, for example, the proposal to abolish the outmoded distinction between libel and slander and the emphasis the commission places on the desirability of developing timely and effective remedies which will provide an alternative to damages for those who are anxious to vindicate their good name.  The proposals in the latter area are of particular importance because there is a perception that our current law is too centred on the award of damages and that damages may not necessarily be the appropriate remedy in all cases.  The commission also has interesting proposals aimed at rationalising the range of defences which would be available in a defamation action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other proposals are more controversial.  At present, a plaintiff must show that a statement complained of is defamatory.  However, he or she is not obliged to prove that such a statement is false since the law presumes the falsity of defamatory statements.  In consequence, it is for the defendant to establish the truth of the statement if the defence of justification is raised.  A majority of the commission recommended that this presumption of falsity should be abolished.  This would be a radical change in our existing law.  The <Col N="197" /> Law Reform Commission proposals for a new cause of action with regard to defamation of the dead are also somewhat contentious.  One of Deputy Byrne's questions deals exclusively with this matter and, in that context, I refer him to the reply I gave to a similar question in this House on 19 February last.</P>
    <P>On taking up office as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, I took a conscious decision to concentrate my legislative effort on those areas of the law which had hitherto been somewhat neglected, namely, those relating to the family and to inequality within our society.  It is a regrettable fact of life that the need to prioritise means that some issues will, of necessity, be dealt with less expeditiously than others.  Reform of defamation law has been one such issue but the matter is under continuing review taking into account the need to dispose of current legislative priorities which are in hand in my Department.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the current laws limit the freedom of the press.  They provide that a person may not be defamed and is entitled to a good name. Those laws evolved over a lengthy period and result from an amalgam of common, statutory, constitutional and international law.  Of course, there have to be and there are restraints, otherwise a person's good name could be damaged for which there would be no remedy.  What those constraints ought to be is a matter for consideration, requiring careful, detailed study as very serious issues are involved.  As any Member of the House will know, the protection of the good name of the individual is a very important matter and must be protected within reasonable constraints, striking a balance, on the one hand, between the rights of newspapers and other media to report and, on the other, the rights of the individual.</P>

      <P>Has the Law Reform Commission taken into account the recent advent of defamation on the Internet?  What is the position in regard to this?  No doubt the Minister is aware that in Northern Ireland a case arose recently of a person allegedly accused of being a child sex abuser and through the Internet it was possible to ascertain his identity, where he lived and so on.  How do our laws on defamation cater for such circumstances?  For example, can such a defamed person lodge a claim in the country of its origin against the countries in which the totality of information on the Internet is available or against the various other sources now opened up through the Internet?  The Internet would appear to introduce a whole new set of potential defamation circumstances into our defamation laws.  Has this aspect been considered recently?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware whether the report of the Law Reform Commission referred specifically to defamation through the medium of the Internet; it probably did not but I cannot be certain of that.  The general principles applicable to defamation on the Internet would be the same as those applicable to defamation disseminated in any other way.</P>
      <P>The issue raised by Deputy McDaid is an interesting one and highlights the point I made earlier that this subject has connotations in international law as well as many others.  The question of cross-boundary defamation is not confined to the Internet.  For example, there are newspapers that may contain a defamatory article on a person which are circulated in more than one country &mdash; perhaps an Irish paper being circulated in the United Kingdom or a United Kingdom newspaper being circulated here or radio or television broadcasts that could be defamatory and be picked up in another country.  Therefore, there is an international dimension to determining the appropriate venue at which an action for damages could arise in a cross-boundary case.</P>
      <P>However, this is not the time or place to engage in a detailed analysis of the private, international problems that arise.  The law is there to deal with them.</P>
      <P>The question arises for my Department as to what review may be necessary of the legal position obtaining.  When continuous legislative matters in hand in my Department &mdash; both before this House and in course of preparation &mdash; have progressed sufficiently we will undertake a more in-depth examination of the defamation question to ascertain what further amendment, if any, of the law may be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has agreed that his Department will be examining defamation laws in regard to the Internet, does he agree that a number of questions should be raised and placed on record with regard to the venue at which a defamed person can sue?  For example, is that location where the information is read, where it has been loaded or in any country through which it is channelled?  Does he agree that a whole new spectrum of defamation is about to be opened up through the Internet?  Does he also agree that this overall question is worthy of examination since I can foresee such cases arising in the not too distant future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Internet may represent a new form of dissemination of potentially defamatory matter, I would envisage that the broad legal principles applicable would be no different from those applicable to dissemination of defamation in any other cross-border manner. Of course, the question arises of the source from which the particular defamation on the Internet emanated which could well present problems for any person defamed in that manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Following my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I instituted a scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services. Grants were first paid under this scheme in 1994 when £750,000 was expended.  A similar amount was expended in 1995.  However, in 1996 the scheme was extended to include the provision of assistance to organisations providing counselling to children whose parents have separated.  Nine hundred thousand pounds was made available in 1996 for distribution under the revised scheme, when 75 organisations were grant-aided, of which 29 provided both marriage and child counselling services, two such organisations providing child counselling services only.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the level of commitment and generosity shown continually by the voluntary sector in coming to the assistance of those in need I consider that the financial assistance offered by my Department will act as an encouragement to that sector to provide the facilities for counselling children whose parents have separated.  I believe they have the expertise necessary to provide this type of service and I assure them of my continuing support in their endeavours.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to be in a position to inform the Deputy that my Department is currently assessing applications for grants for the current year, payment of the first instalments to be made within the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister foresee a means by which he can encourage services focused specifically on child counselling, bearing in mind that the introduction of divorce has made people generally more aware of the necessity for such services, not only for those who are divorcing but for others experiencing difficulties in their marriages? Does he envisage any way in which this allocation could be increased or is he satisfied that the amount already allocated will meet the potential demand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>While fully supporting Deputy Keogh's intent I should point out that we have been doing so.  Whenever I have had meetings with representatives of counselling organisations I have raised with them the provision of child counselling, which I regard as extremely important, in respect of which we have had some success, 29 organisations now providing specific child counselling.  There are approximately 12 to 15 such organisations in Dublin.  Deputy McDaid will be interested to learn there are two in County Donegal, one in his home town, providing specific child counselling.  However, I agree it is a service that will have to be extended.  I and my Department <Col N="200" /> will continue to suggest to such voluntary organisations that they endeavour to expand the child counselling aspect of their activities.  Our suggestions in that regard generally fall on receptive ears.  Many have availed of the increased funding provided on an ongoing basis to enable them provide the necessary specialised training for counsellors.  We will continue to encourage them to extend that aspect of their services further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it appropriate that we should rely on voluntary organisations to provide such services? In relation to the funding of the voluntary agencies which are doing an excellent job, is it sufficient that they can budget only on a year to year basis?  Surely the allocation of resources should be over a longer timescale in order that they may better plan their services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Budgeting is done on a year on year basis and has to be done in that way.  If I had any means at my disposal to guarantee even the current level, not to mention the increased levels of funding, to the counselling organisations I would be happy to do that.  However, I am afraid that some future Government, of which Deputy Keogh's party may be a part, may curtail expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for such social activities as counselling and mediation in general to enable cutbacks to be made in the social area.  I would be happy to do that but unfortunately budgeting is done on a year on basis.  As long as I have been Minister and in the term of office of this Government, the money available for counselling has either been maintained or increased.  A sum of £900,000 is available this year for the service countrywide.  It is a substantial sum and good use is made of it.  We maintain contact with them on an ongoing basis.  The question of whether it is appropriate that the service should be provided in this way is interesting, coming from Deputy Keogh.  I thought her party was not in favour of nationalisation of any kind of service.  I am not sure whether she is suggesting that this service should be nationalised.  So far as counselling is concerned, the voluntary organisations are doing a good job.  I am grateful to them as we all should be for the contribution they make.  Counsellors and administrators give of their time and expertise on a voluntary basis.  It is remarkable there are so many people here who are prepared to do that.  We would be in a bad way without them. They deserve every encouragement and monetary help which I and the Government are happy to provide for them.</P>

Small amounts of the £25 million, or perhaps £50 million which is to be spent on regional education boards, would be much better spent on services such as this.  If the Minister is looking for sources of funding I have the answer for him because his colleagues in Government do not.</P>

The Taoiseach has often said that the cornerstone of democracy is decent education. Two important Bills are before the House this week, the Universities Bill and the Education Bill, and the Minister asserts that these will effect the most sweeping changes ever made to the education system.  We are dissatisfied that debate on these Bills is to be strangled and cut short when many people wish to contribute.  Many amendments from Committee Stage of the Universities Bill will be recommitted on Report Stage and the Education Bill will, if implemented, have far-reaching importance.

I will make inquiries for the Deputy as to when exactly it will be taken, but the Deputy's party must understand that it is not possible to take the Second Stage of three or four different Bills on the same day at the same time.

It is necessary to seek the cooperation of Deputies opposite to allow the Second Stages of various Bills to be passed so that we can get them into committee.

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minister for Justice I was acutely aware of the need for reform of our courts system.  A full reappraisal of where the courts stood and where the system was going had been <Col N="219" /> long overdue.  A fresh approach was badly needed.  A vastly increased volume of civil actions, family law business and criminal cases over a number of years had meant that the entire courts system was under considerable strain.  The most serious and immediate problem was, of course, the delays in the hearing of actions and appeals at all levels of the courts system.  This adversely affected litigants, victims of crime, the business sector and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The first major step I took to turn around this unsatisfactory state of affairs was to introduce and secure the enactment of the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995.  That Act provided for a total increase of 18 in the statutory maximum limit of judges &mdash; three in the Supreme Court, three in the High Court, seven in the Circuit Court and five in the District Court.  All but three of those extra judges have been appointed.  The 1995 Act contained other innovative reforms that improved the position considerably, for example, by enabling the Supreme Court to sit in two divisions which could hear appeals simultaneously and by giving the Master of the High Court and county registrars the power to deal with business that previously only judges could handle.</P>
    <P>Last summer I brought forward the Courts Bill, 1996, to increase the maximum statutory limit on the number of judges of the Circuit Court by a further three to 28 judges, including the President of the Circuit Court.  The Courts Act, 1996, and the 1995 Act, provided for an additional ten Circuit Court judges, that is, an increase of more than 50 per cent in the number of judges of that court.  Developments in the family law area and changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts in 1991 had a major impact on the volume and complexity of business coming before the courts system as a whole, but this affected the Circuit Court in particular.</P>
    <P>The implementation of divorce legislation is likely to impact further on the volume of business, particularly in the Circuit Court.  It is not yet possible to assess its long-term requirements for judicial and staffing resources but in the shortterm it is expected there will be a considerable number of applications to the courts.  My Department is currently in touch with the Department of Finance regarding the provision of additional staff in this regard.  If a continuing upward trend becomes apparent I assure the House the Government will look at the need for additional judges and staff in that specific context.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional judges has enabled the President of the High Court to arrange additional sittings of the Central Criminal Court and the President of the Circuit Court to arrange additional sittings of the Circuit Courts, in particular in areas where delays were acute.  Alongside my legislative programme, this development has had a significant effect on the backlog of cases before those courts.  My strategy has been to combine the allocation of additional judicial resources with practical legislative and <Col N="220" /> administrative reforms to quickly equip the courts system with the means to make inroads on delays in hearing cases and appeals.</P>
    <P>This strategy has produced excellent results. The existing backlogs in the courts are well on the way to being cleared.  For example, in the Dublin Circuit Court I understand new litigants in civil cases can now obtain a court date within six weeks of the lodgement of their cases.  This compares with a delay of two years last July.  In family law cases in the Dublin Circuit Court the delay has been reduced from 16 months to four months and now there are no delays in the hearing of criminal cases in the Dublin Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of personal injury actions in the High Court have been reduced from 35 months to 20 months and delays in the hearing of cases in the Central Criminal Court have been reduced to as low as six months in some cases. There is still room for improvement, particularly in personal injuries actions, but the reduction in delays from 35 months to 20 months in a very short space of time is welcome.  There have been similar substantial reductions in delays in the hearing of cases in the provincial Circuit Court. To give just one example, delays in the hearing of civil cases in Galway have been reduced from two years to as low as three months and delays in the hearing of family law cases which had been up to six months have been eliminated.  The vast majority of provincial Circuit Court venues have experienced this pattern of reductions in the level of delays in hearing cases.</P>
    <P>A major step has been taken to reform the courts system with the establishment of the working group on a courts commission which I set up at the end of 1995, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, to review the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  I also asked the group to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with the commitment to that effect in the programme A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>Last November the Government approved the recommendation in the working group's third report, Towards the Courts Service, to the effect that steps be taken as a matter of urgency to legislate for a courts service as an independent and permanent body and accorded priority to the drafting of this Bill.  The legislation required to enable the new courts service to be established is being dealt with as a priority within my Department and this measure will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The working group is continuing its work on the review of the day to day operation of the courts system and it will submit further reports to me as appropriate.  This is valuable work and I take this opportunity to again thank Mrs. Justice Denham and the other members of the working group for the very important work they have undertaken in this area.  This strategy for the <Col N="221" /> longer term development of the courts system is crucial.  As I said in other venues, too many sticking plasters have been put on the courts system over the years.  The Government is now taking a fresh and long-term look at the courts and, with the help of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, we will have a more effective courts system when the new courts structure is set up.</P>
    <P>Another major area of concern with regard to the courts, which I am actively addressing, is the standard of court accommodation.  A major courts building programme has been drawn up and a number of works are under way throughout the country.  I am aware that, despite the work done in recent years, the standard of much of the court accommodation around the country is seriously inadequate and fails to provide the facilities necessary for persons using the courts.  I have obtained nearly £7 million from the Government this year to carry out capital projects and a further £1.6 million for maintenance projects, totalling about £8.5 million.  This is the largest amount to be allocated in one year since financial responsibility for courthouses was transferred to the Exchequer in March 1990 and is an indication of the Government's commitment to provide modern court accommodation which is necessary for the effective discharge of court business.</P>
    <P>Up to 1990 responsibility to keep court premises in good condition rested with local authorities, which for various reasons neglected their duty in that regard perhaps because of lack of finance or pressure for spending on other purposes. There is now a programme in place and this year I received the largest amount of money ever to progress that programme of renovation and rebuilding.  Over the next month or so new courthouses will be provided at the former Riverbank Theatre and the former Richmond Hospital, at Carrick-on-Shannon and Naas.  Work on the building of a new courthouse in Tallaght has just commenced and major projects in Ennis, Listowel, Longford, Trim and Cork city will also get under way this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the recent Government decisions to appoint two judges of the High Court, Ms Justice Mella Carroll to the Nursing Commission and Mr. Justice Brian McCracken to the Dunnes Stores Tribunal.  These developments will, naturally, have implications for the existing judicial resources in the High Court, and that is the background to this Bill.  I would be most concerned if the progress already made in reducing delays in hearing criminal and civil cases before the High Court were adversely affected by the appointment, albeit temporary, to other duties of the two judges I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase the statutory limit on the number of judges of the High Court, not including the President of the High Court, from 19, as set by the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, to 22.  This will be raised to 23 where one of the judges of the High Court is appointed to the position of commissioner in the Law Reform Commission, which is a standard <Col N="222" /> provision.  It is my intention that one new judge should be appointed to the High Court as soon as the Bill has been enacted.  The Bill takes account, therefore, of the need for possible future increases that may be required in the number of High Court judges.  That approach makes much better sense than legislating to increase the complement of judges on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis on each occasion that an additional judge might be required.  Urgent circumstances could arise in the future which would require the appointment of an additional High Court judge.  This Bill means that it will be possible to respond to such a need without having to bring forward another Courts Bill.</P>
    <P>Tackling immediate problems and implementing a longer term development strategy for the courts are key priorities for me as Minister for Justice.  The reforms I have already put in place and ongoing reforms will ensure that the courts will have the capacity in future to respond effectively to the demands placed on them.  This commitment of resources and longer term planning is vital for the operation of an efficient system of justice and that is a standard the public is entitled to expect and which I am confident my reforms will deliver.  The Bill which is being debated here today is a significant measure that will enable the great progress that has been achieved in the operation of our courts system to be maintained and developed further.  I commend it to the House.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the legislation in the Seanad I was heartened that two lawyers from the Opposition had the good grace to agree the position in the courts has improved greatly in recent times.  They commended the speed with which court cases are currently being heard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the Bill.  However, while additional judges have been appointed, the backlog in the courts has not decreased.  The Government has done nothing to decrease it.  On 1 October 1995, before the new judges were appointed, there were 51 cases involving rape, murder and aggravated sexual assault before the Central Criminal Court.  On 1 October 1996, after the new judges had been appointed, there were 65 cases awaiting hearing in the Central Criminal Court.  While we welcome the new appointments, the Minister must examine the organisation of the Judiciary.  When new judges are appointed one expects the backlog to diminish rather than increase by 14 cases.  The judges who have been appointed deal with civil rather than criminal cases.  Given the current crime statistics, that is not what they should be required to do.  Perhaps the Minister would examine those statistics before replying to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a lay person I often wonder why the Judiciary, like most other professions, does not hold an annual or biannual congress to deal with difficulties that arise in the courts system.  The Garda, nurses, farmers, teachers and bishops meet on an annual or biannual basis in the <Col N="223" /> interest of their professions and to ensure consistency in the matters with which they deal.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes the organisation, administration and financing of the courts must be reappraised. We will implement the report of the Courts Commission with particular reference to the establishment of an independent courts service. We also believe current court procedures are cumbersome and slow.  There is an unacceptable delay in processing cases, some of which can take up to 18 months.  Such delays serve the interests of neither the defence nor the prosecution.  We need a fast-track prosecution system.  The number of court appearances must be reduced to permit trials to take place within three rather than 18 months.</P>
    <P>To achieve this, Fianna Fáil proposes that the system of preliminary examination should be abolished and instead, at the first appearance, an inquiry should take place into whether the matter should be dealt with on indictment.  If it is dealt with on indictment it should be referred directly to the court of trial and the trial should proceed within 90 days of arrest.  This would involve reform of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967. Cases involving certain serious crimes should be heard within 90 days.</P>
    <P>When in Government Fianna Fáil will establish special family courts to deal with family law cases and commence a programmed national courts refurbishment scheme.  It will also recognise that court delays often derive from the way in which the court calendar is organised.  That should be reorganised for more efficient dispatch of business.</P>
    <P>Increased staff must be provided to service these additional sittings and, in particular, the number of registrars must be increased.  Fianna Fáil believes there is scope for modifying the approach to the giving of evidence.  We will remove the necessity for oral evidence to be given by purely formal witnesses.  We propose to establish a witness protection programme similar to that operated by EUROPOL.  In conjunction with this, we will provide a statutory basis for plea bargaining and establish a specialist section in the Department of Justice with a brief to provide an ongoing statistical backup for the courts.</P>
    <P>The role of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is merely advisory.  Its purpose is defined in the Courts and Courts Officers Act as identifying persons and informing the Government of their suitability for appointment to judicial office.  In November 1995 Deputy O'Donoghue said the Minister for Justice had radically altered the composition of that board.  It was no longer deemed appropriate for the chairman of the Law Reform Commission to serve as a member. Instead, the Minister proposed the appointment of the Attorney General &mdash; the general law officer of the Government &mdash; to the board.  If he were not appointed to the board, the holder of that office could provide a more independent role in assisting with such appointments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> Fianna Fáil has a proven track record of having staffed the Bench with numerous lawyers with affiliations to other political parties.  That was the case for all the courts.  Unfortunately, that commendable attitude has not applied to the Minister's party while in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in the same way that the Progressive Democrats have welcomed other legislation to reform the courts.  The courts service is the Cinderella of the justice system, not only in terms of the allocation of resources but also the time and attention given to it by legislators.  As the Minister said, the cumulative effect of more judges means that serious <Col N="225" /> inroads have been made into the backlog, particularly in relation to the processing of civil litigation. Delays which had been legion and, in many cases, defied belief have been reduced, particularly in the civil lists.</P>
      <P>As regards criminal trials, any improvement in the backlog of cases is a double-edged sword because of the lack of prison spaces.  If we start to free up the wheels of the criminal justice system, more people will be committed to Mountjoy. However, because of a shortage of space, other convicted offenders will be released to make room for them.</P>
      <P>There are three legs in the criminal justice system. The first is the enforcement of the law &mdash; there was much debate recently about zero tolerance &mdash; the second is an efficient courts service to process criminal trials and the third is an efficiently run prison service.  I know the Minister has made every effort, with the limited resources available to her, to provide 120 or 130 more prison places over the past year, but there is still a chronic shortage of space in our prison service for convicted persons.  The courts are sentencing people who are serving a short time in jail or no time at all, as happened recently when a person was sentenced to a year in prison and was allowed out after one day.  Such action sets at naught all the efforts to improve the criminal justice system. This cannot be allowed to continue.  We often hear about people who have been sentenced to Mountjoy but who are allowed out after one or two days because of a lack of space.  However, we should not be tempted to accept that in our criminal justice system because it is a scandal.</P>
      <P>Some improvement has been made in the civil lists which will be welcomed by individual litigants, the legal profession, the business community and insurance companies.  Delays added to the cost of civil litigation and, in many cases, caused unnecessary trauma for individual litigants and witnesses who were called back to court time after time because cases were adjourned.  I congratulate the Minister on her success in this regard, although I am still concerned about the operation of the criminal justice system because of the shortage of prison spaces.</P>
      <P>As regards family courts, it is appropriate for the Minister to increase the maximum statutory limit for High Court judges.  One High Court judge has been appointed to the Dunnes tribunal and another, Ms Justice Mella Carroll, to the Nursing Commission.  It is appropriate to legislate for the appointment of further High Court judges.  There will be a demand for more judges now that the divorce legislation has been enacted.</P>
      <P>In a recent report on the family law courts, the Law Reform Commission referred to what is described as &ldquo;the negative ethos of the court system as it currently operates in the area of family law&rdquo;.  It continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of concentrating on the empowerment of individuals to resolve their own family disputes by encouraging negotiation and agreement, the emphasis of our system, <Col N="226" /> with its concentration on adjudication, is on solutions which take control away from the participants.  A humane system of family law is one which encourages the responsible resolution and management of disputes wherever possible by members of the family themselves.  Judicial intervention is, of course, necessary to prevent exploitation or abuse between family members. The ideal of empowerment should not blind us to the problems of inequality which may arise in a system of private ordering.  This apart, it is perhaps time to consider how reforms in our legal process may help in the process of family empowerment.</P>
    <P>One of the key recommendations of the commission is the establishment of a system of regional family courts based in 15 centres around the country, operating as a separate division of the Circuit Court and presided over by judges nominated to serve for a period of at least one year who are assigned on the basis of their suitability to deal with family law matters.  This is important in terms of the Minister's ongoing efforts to improve the judicial system as it applies to the courts.  Much has been and will be achieved if the recommendations of the Courts Commission are put in place.  The report of the courts commission was before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security recently and, rather than delay matters by debating it at length, we decided to note the report and send it back to the Minister so there would be no delay in getting on with the business of establishing the independent courts service which will mark a huge change in the administration of the courts.</P>
    <P>One further aspect which I want to raise with the Minister relates to the proposal by the Director of Public Prosecutions for a unified prosecution service.  Many pre-trial delays in the criminal prosecution service relate to what he called duplications and delays which arise as a result of splitting the responsibility for the decision making aspect of running cases.  The DPP deals with decision making and instructs the Chief State Solicitor to run cases but inevitably delays occur because of the separation of the two functions.  There has been a proposal for a unified prosecution service and perhaps the Minister will indicate if that proposal is being considered.</P>
    <P>Recently a confidential report, which was leaked and subsequently published, revealed great inadequacies in the administration of the Chief State Solicitor's Office and I am glad to note that additional attention has been given to the obvious need for a change in the management structure of that office to guard against a panorama of doom outlined in the consultants' report. They pointed to great dangers facing the State because the Chief State Solicitor's Office was determined not to be fit for its purpose as it was inadequately resourced and had poor management structures in place over a long period.</P>
    <P>All of these matters are very important.  It is important to rectify administrative and structural defects in the criminal justice system and procedural <Col N="227" /> delays which are not beyond resolution. Reform of some of these important aspects does not require legislation.  I am glad that the Strategic Management Initiative encompasses all institutions and public offices, including the Chief State Solicitor's Office, the DPP's Office and the Department of Justice because in the past many of these things were hidden from view.  There is an accountability deficit as far as such matters are concerned.  I am not happy about that but at least there has been some review of the operations of those offices and that can only be for the betterment of the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>I support this Bill which allows the ceiling to be raised and the appointment of three more High Court judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes this short measure which enables the Government to advise the President to appoint three additional High Court judges, raising the statutory number, as the Minister said, to 22 or 23 in the event that a judge of the High Court occupies the position of President of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>The reason given by the Minister for the immediate appointment of a judge is a good one &mdash; two judges are deployed on work in connection with the resolution of the nursing dispute and the tribunal of inquiry into the payments by Dunnes Stores to which the Price Waterhouse report refers.  However, in justifying an increase of three appointments, the Minister said that urgent circumstances could arise in the future which would require the appointment of an additional High Court judge.  As a matter of abstract principle, I would have been interested in the Minister expanding on that somewhat.  I ask her to give the House an undertaking that those urgent circumstances will not arise on the departure of the present Administration in a few weeks time and that the period following the dissolution of this House, the consequent general election and the time which elapses under our constitutional arrangements between polling day and the formation of a new Government, which as we all know from recent years can be quite lengthy, will not be one in which urgent circumstances arise.  There is a suspicion abroad that this measure is an attempt to provide for making appointments in the event of the departure of the present Administration.  The Minister is in a position to assure the House that is not the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested by the intervention of the Minister earlier in the debate on the question of the judicial appointments commission.  I was not a Member of the House at the time but I should declare my interest as a member of the Bar.  I was interested in the measure because I saw a fundamental constitutional undesirability in the establishment of that commission and the Minister's intervention highlighted it.  I do not mean to criticise the Minister personally but judges are now being brought into the process of the appointment of other judges.  That is a very <Col N="228" /> undesirable development because judges are there to administer justice and not to partake in Executive decisions relating to the appointment of judges.</P>
    <P>We all know that the circumstances which led to the departure of the last Government surrounded the appointment of a judge and the Minister, representing the collective emanation of the Government, is responsible to this House in connection with any matter regarding the appointment of a judge.  It seems undesirable if the Opposition seeks to criticise some issue relating to the appointment of judges, as Deputy McDaid did, that the Minister says that is a slight on the Judiciary.  Of course, that cannot be the case.  Under the Constitution, as the Minister will be well aware, the appointment of judges is a matter reserved to the Government and the Government is responsible to this House for these appointments.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the commission has been established simply to filter lists which the Minister then presents to the Government so, in effect, the procedure is that the Government makes the selection.  It might have been much more desirable to make it clear in the original legislation that this was really only a certification procedure where one needed a clean bill of health from this committee before one could be considered for appointment as a judge by the Government.  That, as I understand it, is the substance of the new procedure.  I welcome the fact that advertisements are placed in the public press or <i>The Legal Diary</i> inviting applicants to apply for these appointments so that at least they can have their suitability assessed by this committee prior to a Government decision, but the actual decision on an appointment remains a political one vested in the Government.</P>
    <P>I made the point about the undesirability of judges being involved in the procedure.  I realise this was something which the Tánaiste negotiated with the former Taoiseach at a military aerodrome but the fact remains that advocates should be independent in the performance of their functions before the courts and it is not desirable that they can be inhibited or that a judge decides on the suitability of particular advocates for appointment. That is my view.  I know it was not advanced vigorously by my party at the time but I am glad of the opportunity to record that view now as I thought it was an undesirable development for the legal profession.  Judges have important work to do in adjudicating cases, not in connection with the selection of people who should take their place or sit beside them on the bench.</P>
    <P>With regard to the procedure itself, the general view of the profession is that the Act has not changed the fundamental principles on which appointments have always been made and the general practices of Governments in that regard have not changed.</P>
    <P>There is merit in the idea that appointees should have some political experience.  My <Col N="229" /> experience as an advocate has been that, by and large, judges who have had political experience have been very humane and talented and have had a good insight into the human condition.  We should not be hard on ourselves.  We should accept that persons of political experience should not be disqualified or debarred by virtue of that from judicial appointment.  Deputy McDaid's point related to how the Government had exercised its functions under the Constitution and that matter can be raised in the House.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to concede there has been considerable improvement in the various court lists.  I have been impressed by the improvements in the operation of the Supreme Court where there were great delays.  The splitting of the Supreme Court into two divisions has been successful and is a permanent improvement in the system of justice in the State.  The assimilation of the Court of Criminal Appeal into the Supreme Court has rationalised and greatly improved the system of appeals from the High Court and the Circuit Criminal Court and I welcome that improvement.  The Supreme Court is substantially up to date and that is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>On the criminal side, Deputy McDaid highlighted a problem that seems to persist in the Central Criminal Court and I would be obliged if the Minister would investigate it.  There is a problem of delays in that court's business.  The most serious offences proceed on indictment to the Central Criminal Court.  As the Minister indicated, there has been considerable improvement in the Circuit Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on a the matter I raised before, that of district courthouse provision in the greater Dublin area.  The old practice of ensuring a district courthouse was located near a local police station was desirable.  A vast amount of Garda time in Dublin is wasted commuting from suburban areas to city centre district courthouses. While a great number of district courthouses were constructed in the centre city area adjacent to the principal court buildings, there is a strong case for the provision of district courthouses throughout the suburbs for the disposal of criminal business.  The Minister mentioned the development of a courthouse at Tallaght.  Tallaght appears to be a pioneer case for new developments of this kind in the suburbs.  The infrastructure in other suburban districts requires that improvement.  The three suburban county areas of Dublin now have a greater population than the county borough area, yet the number of district courthouses in those areas is very small compared to the number of district courthouses in the city centre.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the point that with the introduction of divorce legislation there will be a considerable increase in the volume of business transacted on the matrimonial side.  The Law Reform Commission put forward proposals that would require considerable time and attention of the House to implement.  There are a number of <Col N="230" /> hardship cases we discussed during the referendum debate.  They need an expeditious remedy, but that is not available because of the delay.  Is there a fast-track procedure that could be provided under the court rules or legislation to give certain cases priority where an individual requires an urgent remedy?  There has been a great improvement in the Circuit Court in Dublin and the civil list has been expedited substantially.</P>
    <P>On the circuit side, I wish to raise a matter that is the subject of reports but that does not strictly relate to the Bill &mdash; that of an increase in the jurisdiction of the court.  It has been suggested that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court will be increased further.  The successive increases in the jurisdiction in recent years have exceeded general inflationary pressures.  There may be a case for another increase.  Has the Minister any proposals in that regard?</P>
    <P>I wish to raise another matter relating to the Circuit Court that is unsatisfactory and requires examination &mdash; the appeal from the Circuit Court to the High Court on the civil side.  On the criminal side, a transcript is produced and an appeal is made to the Supreme Court, but on the civil side when a Circuit Court judge hears a case the appeal is by way of a full rehearing before a High Court judge.  There was a long debate about that in the Free State in the 1920s.  At one stage there was a different arrangement when there was a written record and appeal by way of a written note but that was found to be unsatisfactory and the rule that applied to the county court in British times was restored to provide for an appeal by way of complete rehearing.  There is a view among witnesses and lawyers that witnesses like to have two bites of the cherry; they like to have their case heard twice.  I have always thought it an unsatisfactory arrangement on appeal to have a complete rehearing of a case a second time. When one judge is dealing with a case and it is appealed to another judge, there is not a predictable outcome and that is an unsatisfactory aspect of Circuit Court procedure.  I do not know if the Minister has considered that matter.  Perhaps she could refer it to Mrs. Justice Denham.  With modern recording devices, it may be possible in a few years' time to generate cheaply a record of Circuit Court civil proceedings which could be reviewed on appeal as a transcript rather than have an appeal by way of a complete rehearing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell mentioned the unified prosecution service.  Far be it for me to introduce a rift between our two parties, but one should be careful of building too large an empire in any quarter of the legal establishment.  The experience in England has been of a substantial increase in costs caused by the development of a unified prosecution service there and it is a matter that is under review.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on the improvements that have taken place in regard to the court lists and I urge her to take action where further action is required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their support for this Bill and their comments about the improvements in the courts.  Deputy McDaid raised the issue of the Central Criminal Court and I said the delays were reduced to six months.  I did not say there were none.  There are still delays.  Deputy McDaid claimed there were 51 cases on 1 October 1995 and 65 cases on the list on 1 October 1996.  Because of the mechanism of advertising for applications and their consideration, etc., the appointment of the additional High Court judges was not made until mid-1996 or thereabouts and the effect of their appointment did not have any impact by 1 October, the start of the court term.  I am not surprised the number of cases on the list was of that order.  Our aim is to reduce the waiting time for cases to be heard in that court and to ensure a backlog of cases does not build up in that court again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan made the point that the Bill allows for the appointment of three High Court judges and I said we would appoint one when the Bill is passed.  However, the Deputy need not fear, I have nothing in mind in regard to urgent business.  In 1995 when I increased the number of High Court judges by three that was considered a worthy increase, but because of the backlog of cases the Government decided to make those appointments immediately to deal with the backlog. I had thought that in 1995 we might have been able to keep one of those appointments in reserve for a time we might need to make one, but we needed to make the three appointments then.  Ms Justice Mella Carroll is doing a job that will take a year to complete and it is difficult to say how long Mr. Justice Brian McCracken will be away from court, but he should not be away for anywhere near a year.  That is why I asked the Government to approve the appointment of one judge to fill the temporary vacancy left by Ms Justice Mella Carroll.  The Government will monitor the position as to the availability of Mr. Justice Brian McCracken.</P>
      <P>It is possible a High Court judge could be involved in an accident but would not have to give up his or her job.  However, that person may be unavailable for a year if severely paralysed, for example, and need time to recuperate.  The President of the High Court may decide it is necessary to appoint another judge.  Deputy Lenihan will know that some time ago the Government decided not to continue the practice of temporary appointments to the courts because it was found unsatisfactory. If a judge is unavailable for a year, it would be appropriate for a Government to appoint another judge and in doing so, may decide not to fill the next vacancy if it believes the court is large enough.  I have nothing more sinister in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of the family law courts.  Mrs. Justice Susan Denham is examining the Law Reform Commission's report on family law in the course of her work with the Courts Commission.  A major courts refurbishment programme is under way.  This programme <Col N="232" /> includes the provision of family law court facilities.  Shortly, we will have a network of major court development.  An integral part of that development will be a completely self-contained family law suite where family law cases may be heard.  Separate family law facilities are available in Athlone, Arklow, Bray, Cork District Court complex, Donegal, Dungarvan, Enniscorthy, Galway, Kilkenny, Loughrea, Waterford, Ballina, Ballinasloe, Clonmel and the District, Circuit and High Courts in Dublin.  These facilities will be provided in Naas and Carrick-on-Shannon shortly.  We have begun to make great improvements. I visited a number of these suites where there are separate rooms for the two sides in a family case and facilities for looking after babies and making coffee.  These facilities are needed in traumatic family law cases, are progressing well and will make a difference to our courts system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to improving facilities in the courts and ensuring cases are heard more quickly and said this would mean more people being sentenced by the courts.  I did not deny this would not be a problem when the building of new prison spaces was taking place.  The only alternative was to maintain the slow pace in the courts which would ensure people going through the courts did not require prison places. A considerable number of people are going through our courts.  By the end of the year, a substantial number of prison places will be available. Next year a 400 place remand prison will be available which will free up places in prisons.</P>
    <P>On family law, the concept of nominating judges is practised in the Dublin area where Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness was appointed to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>I have no proposals to extend the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Given its present jurisdiction, and the additional family law work expected, I would like to defer any consideration of extending its jurisdiction.  On gardaí commuting to the city centre for District Court cases, there are District Courts around Dublin and two in my constituency, in Balbriggan and Swords. We recently turned the sod for a District Court in Tallaght.  The issue of gardaí having to be in court is being dealt with under the criminal justice Bill.  Under that Bill gardaí will be able to give evidence through certificate and prisoners may be brought to the District Court nearest to them for remand hearings thus reducing the need to send gardaí long distances.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Advisory Appointments Board was included in a Fianna Fáil-Labour Bill published around the time the last Government broke up in late 1994.  It was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice.  The Constitution requires the Government to make recommendations for appointments to the courts to the President. People will know from talk in the Law Library that there were many applications for District Court and Circuit Court appointments. The board is able to consider the qualifications of applicants, the expertise required and make <Col N="233" /> recommendations to the Government.  It is then a matter for the Government to decide.</P>
    <P>I would not like to mix it with Deputy McDaid about the political affiliations of any appointments over the years.  However, he should look at some recent appointments.  He may assess their politics but, perhaps, they were apolitical. Appointments this and previous Governments made have stood the test of time by the quality of judges.  It would be wrong for us to get into a slagging match about who belonged to what party because we could match it with Fianna Fáil which has boasted about being in Government for 50 of the 70 years the State has been in existence.  The Deputy will find more judges were appointed under the stewardship of his party.  The qualifications of those who have applied to the Judicial Advisory Appointments Board can be checked.</P>
    <P>I am happy this legislation is going through the House today.  As a famous French scientist said, you never get credit or notice for what you have done, only notice for what you have not done. There will always be something to be done in the justice system.  That is part and parcel of the job. I am glad we are taking this action today before any delays build up because of the temporary transfer of two judges from the High Court.  I thank Members for their contributions.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in speaking to the Government's Freedom of Information Bill.  It arrives in this House following a most constructive debate in the Seanad where the Bill received the support of all sides.  I was happy to accept positive suggestions from all sides to strengthen the Bill's commitment to openness.  We all want to adopt the most effective mechanisms for ensuring the culture and practice of secrecy in public bodies are set aside for good.  Information is power and access to information is fundamental to the reform of our democratic institutions to create genuine openness and to empower the ordinary citizen.</P>
      <P>The Bill has drawn on best practice abroad and, in coming late in the day to this legislation, we have been able to draw on a wealth of legislative models and practical experience in other countries.  I welcome the work of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in enhancing openness and, in particular, their recent report on the review of the Official Secrets Act.  I will return to this issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> What is freedom of information?  Freedom of information is a legal right for every person to ask for and get access to records held by public bodies.  It creates a new legal right for citizens to see public files.  It recognises in law that public bodies should be directly accountable to the ordinary public they are there to serve.  Freedom of information overturns the presumption of official secrecy set out in the Official Secrets Act and replaces it with the legal presumption that the public has a right to know.</P>
    <P>The Bill carries a mandate to the public service to provide the public with access to information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.  That mandate is contained in the Long Title to the Bill. This Bill will mark a permanent change in the way public business is done.  Giving people a legal right to know what public bodies do and what information they hold is extremely important because public services touch every aspect of our lives &mdash; as parents, as patients, as residents, when we pay tax or draw a pension.</P>
    <P>The public bodies to be covered under the Bill include central Government Departments and their subsidiary agencies, including the Blood Transfusion Service Board, county councils and health boards, other public boards and semi-State organisations and organisations which are substantially publicly funded, such as secondary schools, voluntary hospitals or organisations contracted to provide services for people with disabilities. In case there is any confusion, the list in the First Schedule to the Bill is of bodies to be included, not those to be excluded.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is in force, every person will have a legal right to see what is on his or her files held by public bodies and to correct that information if it is wrong.  The Bill carefully protects personal privacy and personal information will not be available in the normal course to third parties. Community groups will be able to look at policies and plans which affect their community. This will include information on road repairs, waste disposal and recycling and information on issues which are important for the quality of daily life.  People will be able to look at their tax and pension files.  They will be able to see what happened to their application for a grant or how their dealings with any public body are being handled. People will be able to see how public bodies spend their money, how priorities are set and reasons for delays.  Freedom of information will give the public the right to know how and why decisions are taken.  Public bodies will be legally obliged to give answers to the public they serve.</P>
    <P>Governments and Government bodies will become more accountable when information is out in the open.  Freedom of information, everywhere it has been introduced, has brought about more open government and better administration of public services.  Doing business in the open is the best guarantee of efficiency.</P>
    <P>What is in the Freedom of Information Bill? At the very heart of freedom of information is <Col N="235" /> the creation of a new legal right for every person to access any information held by a public body. This right will place an obligation on public bodies to provide the public with information when they look for it.  Complementing this, a powerful mandate for openness and access to official information is set out in the Long Title.  This establishes that the purpose of the Bill is &ldquo;to enable members of the public to obtain access to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, public bodies have worked in a culture where secrecy was the norm.  Overturning the practice and philosophy of three quarters of a century involves a radical change.  For this reason, the Bill sets out a range of key measures to enable, support and enforce this fundamental change.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the public need information to get information, the Bill requires that each public body must publish information on its structures, functions and the categories of information it holds.  This is so that members of the public can find out which public body has the information they are looking for and can learn what kinds of information are available.</P>
    <P>The Bill places a legal duty on public bodies to help members of the public in making requests, so the public can pinpoint the information they want to see.  It also requires that the public be encouraged to make requests for information under the Bill where they would otherwise not be able to access the information they seek.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is in force, every person will have a legal right to correct any personal information on them on public files where it is incorrect, incomplete or misleading.  In addition the Bill provides that each public body publish its internal rules and guidelines which it uses in decision making.  In this way the public can be informed in advance as to the ground rules and basis on which their application for any grant or benefit will be judged.  The Bill provides that, where a public body fails to publish such guidelines in full, nobody can be placed at a disadvantage where they might have been able to qualify for something if they had known the full rules.</P>
    <P>The Bill requires public bodies to give reasons for the decisions they make to the individuals concerned.  So, for example, when a public body turns down a grant those affected will have a legal right to the reason for that decision.  The Bill also requires that people are told what the appeals mechanism is for challenging any such decision.</P>
    <P>Taken together, these changes confer important and powerful new rights on individuals in their day to day dealings with public bodies. These provisions of the Bill set out important guarantees that public bodies are fair and seen to be fair in their dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>The public's right to know will be backed up by a powerful and independent appeals system which is the cornerstone of the Bill.  Experience abroad has shown that an effective appeals system <Col N="236" /> is the best guarantee that the public actually get the information they look for and that public officials carry out to the full their legal duty to provide information.</P>
    <P>The Bill establishes the Office of Information Commissioner which will act as an independent watchdog to ensure the public's right to know is upheld and not blocked.  The commissioner will have power to issue binding rulings and to overturn decisions to withhold information.  He or she will have power to examine all the documents in any case and to send for and examine witnesses.  In the normal course, an unfavourable decision on a request for information will be reviewed, in the first instance, by a higher official in that organisation.  If the decision is still not satisfactory, there is a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner.  The onus of proof is on the public body to show why the information should not be released.  As a result of the fine track record he and his office have as the people's champion, the Government have asked the Ombudsman, Kevin Murphy, to be the first Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will develop, protect and enforce the legal right of the public to get information. He will enforce the legal duty of public bodies to supply information.  The Office of Information Commissioner will be a separate and independent office with its own staff.</P>
    <P>The commissioner will have power to report to the Oireachtas on how the legislation is working and its operation in any case to which he wants to draw attention.  He will have a role in promoting a more open attitude to release of information generally by public bodies, whether or not it has been requested.  He will be able to investigate how any individual public body is meeting its legal obligation to provide information to the public.</P>
    <P>Like freedom of information the world over, there are certain exceptions to the automatic right to see information.  These exceptions are similar to those in comparable legislation elsewhere &mdash; Sweden, the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and consist of those areas which commonsense requires should remain as confidential &mdash; information which could jeopardise security or law enforcement, breach legitimate personal privacy of individuals, or where, for operational reasons, release of the information at a particular time would be premature.  These exemptions are sensible and balanced.  The Bill will not be a charter for crime bosses or drug barons and will protect the criminal investigation process.  Companies doing business with Government bodies can be assured that commercially sensitive information they provide will be protected.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the exemptions are discretionary, not mandatory.  They are &ldquo;Yield&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; signs.  They permit information to be withheld, but do not oblige or require it to be withheld.  They are subject to two vital tests whose purpose is to ensure that exemptions are not abused.  First, release of the material <Col N="237" /> must be assessed as harmful to the interest concerned. In other words, it is not something about security but something which would damage security.  Second, most exemptions can be set aside where the balance of the public interest favours disclosure.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the exemptions is not to inhibit disclosure but to protect information in circumstances where its disclosure could be contrary to the public interest.  Subject to that public interest concern, any discretions under the Bill are intended to be used to the greatest extent possible to provide access to information in line with the mandate given in the Long Title.  The provisions in relation to exempt information are set out in detail.  The practical experience of freedom of information elsewhere suggests that openness is better served where exemptions are clear and specific.</P>
    <P>A broad brush exemption allows more information to remain hidden rather than something which would harm law enforcement or security. Tightly drawn exemptions ensure the release of information is at a maximum.  In the event of a public body using an exemption to refuse to grant access to a record, the matter does not end there. It will ultimately be for the Information Commissioner to decide on appeal whether access should be granted.</P>
    <P>In exceptional cases, where the release of information would prejudice law enforcement, defence, security, or international relations and the matter is sufficiently sensitive and serious to warrant it, a Minister may issue a certificate.  This effectively removes the avenue of appeal to the Information Commissioner.  Instead, a certificate will be reviewed by Cabinet colleagues and must be withdrawn where a review finds insufficient grounds for its use.  An appeal can also be made to the High Court.</P>
    <P>A number of requirements must be met before a certificate can be issued.  First, the matter must be likely to prejudice a key matter under either of the exemptions mentioned.  Second, the matter must be of sufficient seriousness or sensitivity to justify the issue of a certificate.  If not, the courts will so find.</P>
    <P>Experience in common law jurisdictions abroad has been that certificates have rarely been used and only in the early days of freedom of information. I emphasise that the intention of the Bill is that a certificate should be issued only on a most exceptional occasion where the nature of exempt information is such as to justify excluding the Information Commissioner from access to the records concerned.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively turns the Official Secrets Act on its head replacing the presumption under that Act that all information is secret unless expressly authorised for release with the presumption that all information can be made public unless its release would give rise to specific harm. The Bill amends the Official Secrets Act accordingly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> As I mentioned, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security has also recently issued a very good report on the Official Secrets Act.  A key recommendation of that report is the repeal of the Official Secrets Act and its replacement by criminal sanctions in relation to espionage and the unauthorised disclosure of specific categories of information and civil sanctions in relation to other breaches.  The committee's report suggests in paragraph 5.10 that this be done by either new legislation providing for such matters or as part of criminal justice legislation.  These recommendations anticipate and complement this Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record my strong support for the committee's report.  In line with the Government's commitments to act in this area, I look forward to early action on the matter by the Department of Justice in whose remit the Official Secrets Act lies.</P>
    <P>We are concerned to ensure that, when people look for information, it will be readily available, that teething troubles will not derail the principle and purpose of the legislation and that foreseeable steps are taken to have a user friendly system which works.  Within the public service, a special group is overseeing the practical steps Departments must take to make access to information a reality when the Bill is enacted.  These include reorganising the filing and file retrieval systems and the training of staff.  The Bill creates a statutory duty on the Department of Finance to ensure these practical steps are taken to make access to information work.  There will be a special unit in that Department to drive the working of the Bill when passed.</P>
    <P>There is a lead-in time of one year from the passing of the Bill to ensure everything is prepared and can run smoothly from day one. Because all internal rules and guidelines will be published from day one and will be equivalent to the force of law, Departments must ensure these are complied, scrutinised and rationalised in time for the Bill's starting date.  Other important public bodies are automatically included in this first phase &mdash; they are listed in the First Schedule &mdash; and county councils and health boards are automatically included six months later at the most.</P>
    <P>The Long Title sets out the purpose of the Bill as, among other things, enabling the public to obtain access to official information to the greatest extent possible consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy.  It is the purpose clause which guides interpretation of the discretions offered under the Bill for the release of information.  It is the mandate given to Government Departments, to the Information Commissioner and to the courts in deciding on queries under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard provisions on Short Title, commencement and interpretation of various terms used.  Part II is concerned with access to records and establishes a legal right for the public to access records held by public bodies.  It sets out arrangements for making requests and determines times within which public bodies must <Col N="239" /> respond and the ways in which access may be granted.  In general, people must be given the information as soon as possible and within 20 working days.  Public bodies must publish information about themselves, the information they hold and the internal rules and guidelines used in decision-making.  This Part also deals with deferral and refusal of access to records.  It sets out procedures for internal review, establishes rights for each member of the public to access reasons for decisions directly affecting them and to have personal information held by a public body amended where such information is incorrect, incomplete or misleading.</P>
    <P>Part III sets out a series of related measures to protect information relating to key areas of Government activity.  Information may be protected where its disclosure could damage the security or defence of the State, international relations or law enforcement.  Matters before Government or information likely to prejudice the operations of Government may also be protected for a period.  In addition, information relating to third parties may be protected where disclosure may constitute a breach of confidence, invasion of privacy or damage to commercial interests.  Many of the protections outlined can be set aside where the public interest would on balance be better served by the disclosure rather than the withholding of the records in question.</P>
    <P>Part IV establishes the Office of Information Commissioner and sets out the functions and powers of the Commissioner and the procedures for review of decisions under the Bill.  In addition, the Commissioner is required to keep the operation of the Bill under review and may carry out investigations into procedures adopted by public bodies for the purpose of compliance with its provisions.</P>
    <P>Part V presumes a decision to have been made in the event of failure by a public body to reply to a request.  This is to allow for immediate access to the appeal system.  It provides for appeals to the High Court, legal protections for the release of information under freedom of information, exclusions from the Bill, charges and the amendment of the Official Secrets Act.  It provides qualified privilege to authors of documents and those who release them under freedom of information.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information commands support across party lines.  This was most apparent in the recent debate on the Bill in the Seanad.  In this regard I acknowledge the contributions of Senators Roche, Lee and Dardis.  I also acknowledge the contributions of Senators Howard, Sherlock, and O'Sullivan.  Arising from that debate, the Bill has been amended to take account of these contributions.  I look forward to a similarly constructive and informed debate in this House.</P>
    <P>Every country which has introduced freedom of information has seen significant improvement in the quality of public administration and in the accountability of public services.  I have no doubt that this Bill will quietly enhance democracy by <Col N="240" /> making Government bodies more accountable to the public they serve.  It will create a new climate of openness.  Because information is power, it will transfer power to ordinary people from those behind closed doors.  Freedom of information will mark a profound and lasting change in the way public business is done.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but must say some critical things about it and hope they will not be taken personally by the Minister of State or by her colleagues in the Labour Party.  The Bill promises much but is in danger of delivering less than it promises.  It is confused.  Perhaps this is too little, too late from the Labour Party.  It is not the radical Bill which I expected and which had been promised in countless press briefings over recent years.  However, I commend the Minister of State for her personal pursuance of this matter, although I have some criticisms of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Many of the aspects of the Bill are conservative and constrained and it is confused in many areas. I hope I am not being too uncharitable and I will seek to defend the Bill as I make my points.  On a positive note, it gives us a good foundation to put much needed administrative reform on the Statute Book.  If the Minister of State is willing to listen to what is said in the House and accept the views of Members, we can together make real administrative reform which will benefit Irish people and politics.  It has been thoroughly discussed by my colleagues and other Members in the Seanad and much has been added to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to administrative reform.  In the 1994 negotiations between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil following the collapse of the last Government administrative reform was a major item on our agenda.  It is ironic that Fianna Fáil proposals that were agreed between the two parties form a substantial part of the current Government's programme.  I am not unhappy about that and celebrate it, for it appears that for once we got it right.</P>
      <P>In stark contrast to the Bill the Minister of State is introducing, Fianna Fáil's proposals were not encumbered by bureaucratic procedures but simply set out the rights citizens should have in public administration.  Those proposals broke new ground in that they sought to codify, in clear details, areas where the administrative system could withhold information.  The Fianna Fáil proposals can be seen as the precursors to legislation removing the now ridiculously outdated Official Secrets Act, 1963.  The Minister of State regards that Act as an anachronism which should be consigned to the shredder or the archive, with which I agree.  It is ludicrous legislation which was brought in on the assumption that everything was secret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On taking office, the Taoiseach said the Government would operate as behind a pane of glass.  That pane of glass, as produced today by the Minister of State, is not only very smoky but <Col N="241" /> probably bullet-proof also.  The goods delivered today fall far short of the description given in the bill of sale.  If politics were subject to the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Labour Party could be sued for false advertising.  The ink is hardly dry on the serial press releases from the office of the Minister of State promising a brave new era of openness, transparency and honesty. This Bill falls far short and is far too conservative, providing safe sanctuary for those Labour totems. This Bill is a minimalist and disappointing administrative fig leaf for real openness in Government. Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Bill.  We have no objection to the very modest improvements being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unsatisfactory from any objective viewpoint.  I will set out why and explain the Fianna Fáil position.  I also want to expose the failure of the Government in general, and the Labour Party in particular, to live up to its most important commitment.  The reason this Government was cobbled together in the first place was ostensibly to point the light into the furthest arcane regions of the public administration.  This Bill is proof positive of the failure by the Government to deliver not only on its most important promise but to justify its reason for coming into existence.</P>
    <P>This is the second Freedom of Information Bill to come before the Oireachtas in the life of this Government.  The first was introduced by Fianna Fáil in the Seanad.  That Bill, and a position paper published by my predecessor as Fianna Fáil spokesperson for equality, Deputy Woods, cogently set out the Fianna Fáil position.  What we proposed in the Fianna Fáil Bill goes far beyond what is provided for in this Bill.  The central premise of the Fianna Fáil position is that the Official Secrets Act, 1963, must be repealed. Until this is done there will be no legal basis for the Minister of State's claim that the presumption in relation to official information is for disclosure.</P>
    <P>The claim made for this Bill, that it will shift the presumption in relation to official information from secrecy to disclosure, is unfounded. First, there is the glaring failure to repeal the Official Secrets Act.  This is compounded by the invention of the Minister of State of a ministerial licensing system for withholding information. This system is itself totally flawed as it provides for the most awkward and inappropriate political intrusion conceivable.  Any such licence, however well justified, will be the subject of political contention. Furthermore, the system devised by the Minister of State for ministerial orders will remove this failure to disclose from the appeals mechanism, which is totally unacceptable.  The appeals mechanism is itself more an obstacle course rather than an access point to obtaining information.  It appears to be back to front, inside out and upside down.</P>
    <P>The appeals system in the Bill is based on appeals by the citizen against a failure to disclose, based on one of the innumerable exemptions the Minister of State has devised.  That flatly contradicts <Col N="242" /> the claims made for the Bill that it will shift the presumption away from secrecy towards disclosure. If the presumption was in favour of disclosure, then the appeal would have to be made by the public authority to the information commissioner. This is why it is upside down.  Why should the citizen have to make the appeal to the information commissioner?  Why does the authority or the Minister, before putting the stamp of secrecy on a matter, not have to go to the commissioner? It is ludicrous practically and perverse legally that the onus to appeal non-disclosure should be put on the citizen and not on the public authority.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes that the presumption should be in favour of disclosure.  In practical terms, this means that the appeals system envisaged in this Bill should be reversed.  If a public authority believes that it is entitled to an exemption, then the onus should be on that public authority to actively seek and justify the exemption to the Information Commission.  It is ironic that a Labour Minister who has preached endlessly on the need for access should put the considerable and complex practical difficulties of making an appeal onto the ordinary citizen.  Putting up a case for a successful appeal will, necessarily, be complex in many instances.  This appeals system puts an unnecessary and very onerous difficulty on the citizen seeking to obtain information.  Politically, it is clear that the Minister of State has been mugged by the mandarins.</P>
    <P>The appeals system should not only be reversed, but should be supplemented by a confidentiality list.  Under Fianna Fáil's Bill, rejected by the Government, any information that is exempted must be included in a confidentiality list.  When information is exempted from disclosure, a general description will be contained on a publicly available disclosure list.  The description should be sufficient to enable the public to challenge the inclusion of the information on the list. This is a much simpler method for allowing the public access to information which they deserve to have.  The Minister of State emphasised areas where information would be available to the general public.  However, they will have to go through a complex procedure to get that information and the Minister of State's work has been compromised by that.</P>
    <P>The faults in relation to the provision of general classes of information is even more glaring in regard to the provision of environmental information. Existing policy is driven by the EU directive on freedom of access to information on the environment.  The directive requires public authorities to make information relating to the environment available to citizens.  This directive was implemented in Irish law by Fianna Fáil while in Government in 1993 and was replaced in 1996, albeit with few changes.  In 1993, this was a considerable advance on the existing situation.  Apart from these directives, and some provisions in the planning Acts, Irish law contains no adequate provision for giving an individual the legal right <Col N="243" /> to information on the environment.  This Bill provides none either.</P>
    <P>There is a general recognition that the current position is inadequate.  The standards set out in the directive were envisaged as minimum.  The Irish regulations have hardly advanced from their original minimal provisions.  They still incorporate nearly every optional exemption contained in the directive.  Considerable confusion has arisen as to which public authorities are covered by the regulations.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us on this.  The one month time limit for responding to a request for information is too long and vague.  The response given often falls far short of the information sought.  Similarly, the discretionary grounds for refusing to give information when requested are too vague and facilitate evasion.  There are no provisions for copies of information to be made available.</P>
    <P>The 1995 review of the regulations carried out by the Department of the Environment highlighted many of the deficiencies I have outlined. Unfortunately, the regulations introduced in 1996 made only modest changes and do not resolve the serious difficulties now being experienced.  There was a definite expectation that the Government's long promised Freedom of Information Bill would address the issue.  It has not.  Perhaps the Minister will contact the Department of the Environment to investigate some of the deficiencies.</P>
    <P>The Bill fails to properly address the issue of access to information on the environment.  The Environmental Protection Agency and An Bord Pleanála are excluded from the list of agencies covered by the provisions of the Bill.  Fianna Fáil supports the EU position that environment information should be subject to a specific statutory right of access.  This Bill will not come into effect until one year after its passing into law.  In the case of local authorities this can be extended to three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Minister's pardon. The time limits for responding to requests for information proposed in this Bill are unacceptable from the point of view of environmental information.  In this Bill a 21 day time limit is envisaged.  Under the environment information directive, the time limit is one months.  This will lead to a situation where an individual citizen would have a statutory right of access to information under the Government's Bill within a shorter time limit than for environmental information under the 1996 directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill further provides for a wide range of exemptions that are unacceptable in the context of environmental information.  These include unreasonable disruption to the work of the public body involved.  It is against this background that Fianna Fáil recently published a party position paper on environmental information and a <Col N="244" /> Private Members' Bill which will remedy the situation. The Fianna Fáil Access to Environmental Information Bill, 1997, will provide a much more liberal measure of access within a much tighter timeframe.  The Bill will also provide a speedy and inexpensive appeals system.  Fianna Fáil is seeking the support of the Government for this Bill.  In any event my party is committed to implementing its provision on our return to Government.</P>
    <P>By having a statutory basis to the right to environmental information, it will be possible to provide regulations which can be widened further in the future as circumstances change and develop.  The appeals system provided for in the Fianna Fáil Bill will allow for a simple, inexpensive and binding process.  At present the only recourse in the event of information being refused is the Ombudsman, whose recommendations are non-binding or judicial review which is prohibitively expensive.  The appeals procedure we envisage will ensure that qualified personnel adjudicate on these issues.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's Bill will also provide for a schedule of charges to applicants.  This will ensure that the current position where applicants are effectively discouraged by outrageous charges for information that is often readily available cannot continue.  The time limit for provision of information will also be increased to 14 working days. The timely provision of the information being sought is vital to its effective use in many situations.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil policy initiative and accompanying legislative proposals on environmental information lay the foundations for allowing participation in an active and informed partnership for the formulation of environment policy.  Fianna Fáil has set out its detailed legislative proposals to secure real openness in Government. The Bill on freedom of information introduced by our spokesperson for the public service, Senator Roche, in the Seanad last year, together with the Bill introduced more recently by our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, form a comprehensive and cogent set of proposals.</P>
    <P>The Government defeated Senator Roche's Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we did not.  We accepted it in the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister of State promised something better but she has singularly failed to deliver on all that was good in the Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Bill on environmental information is a direct response to the failure of this Government Bill to address the issue of environmental information.  It is on the Order Paper.  If the Minister of State is serious about openness she should support it.</P>
      <P>On balance, along with many other agencies, we welcome this Bill.  The Minister is probably aware of two principal concerns about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> First, it does not contain any guarantee that its provisions will begin to affect the Garda Síochána by any given time.  This can be deferred indefinitely. Second, An Bord Pleanála is not mentioned in the list of bodies covered by the Bill.  These two matters are covered in section 1, subsections (2) and (3) and in paragraph 5 of the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>The gardaí will only come under the provisions of the Bill after the Government has promulgated regulations.  It is only right to recognise that the functions of policing and planning involve matters which must be kept secret.  Modern society demands that these functions are conducted in an accountable manner.  Leaving these two bodies outside the remit of the Bill facilitates mismanagement and corruption.  Perhaps the Minister of State will allude to these two areas when she replies.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Seanad which were accepted.  The Bill was discussed at length in the Seanad and, undoubtedly, it will receive further scrutiny on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security accepted the proposal of my colleague, Deputy Woods, that the Official Secrets Act should be re-examined. It is ridiculous legislation which deserves to be put through a shredder.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill.  Unfortunately, although it is a proposal of the Labour Party, it is conservative and confused.  It will be much discussed in the coming weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats welcome this Bill.  It has already been amended by the Seanad and is the better for those amendments.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said the Bill marks a permanent change in the way public business is carried out in Ireland.  I hope that will be the case. The proof will be seen in how the exemptions are determined and utilised by State authorities, public bodies and future Governments.  Traditionally, the concept of democracy in Ireland was associated simply with the right of the people to elect a Government.  Nowadays, there is a growing recognition that there is more to democracy than that simple test.  The concept of democracy now requires not just a Government elected in free elections but a Government that is open and accountable.  The job of the Opposition is to hold the Government of the day to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience in the four years since my election and in dealing with two Administrations is such that I approach this legislation not with cynicism but with genuine fear.  The heart of the Bill is in the right place and the Minister of State has dedicated a great deal of time, energy and personal commitment to it.  However, the ethos of the Bill sits uneasily with the record of this Administration for accountability by way of parliamentary questions.  My perception of the Bill is coloured by my lack of confidence that the ethos of the Bill will be translated into the workings of <Col N="246" /> this House.  The Dáil is the major tool of accountability and one cannot legislate to compensate for the manner in which Members of this House are routinely deprived of information to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Another element of democracy is that individuals ought not be treated as subservient to the Government of the day or to the democratic institutions of the State.  This Bill will be a considerable step towards achieving open Government. Ireland has lagged behind other democratic States in introducing measures to create open Government and institutions.  Each section of the Bill must be carefully scrutinised to see if its provisions truly enable the public to hold institutions and those who exercise public power to account. That power derives from the will of the people and the true test of the Bill will be whether people in power serve the needs of the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>The most important provision is section 6 (1) which creates the right of access to records. However, that right is subject to a wide range of exceptions.  The menu of exceptions must be carefully scrutinised and challenged to ascertain whether they are truly legitimate or simply provide a refuge for those who do not wish to co-operate with the ethos of the Bill.  The Bill was given a tortured passage through various Departments. Some Departments are less willing than others to adopt the ethos of open Government and some of them have prospered behind a culture of secrecy.  It is important to realise, therefore, that the Bill has been compromised by the deliberations and slow passage it received through some Departments.</P>
    <P>There is little point in legislating for the principle of openness and access to information if everything sensitive to the authorities is to be excluded by exemption.  The strength and radical nature of this legislation could be nullified by a too wide range of exemptions.  The Minister of State said the exemptions are discretionary, not mandatory.  They permit information to be withheld but they do not require it to be withheld. They are subject to two vital tests whose purpose is to ensure that exemptions are not abused.  That is an important consideration because people who wish to withhold information will hide behind exemptions.</P>
    <P>The first test is that the release of the material must be assessed as harmful to the interest concerned. The second test is that most exemptions can be set aside when the balance of the public interest favours disclosure.  How will we determine what is the public interest?  We can look at practical examples of how this and previous Administrations interpreted the public interest in a manner that might be suspect under the ethos of this Bill.  In the case of the beef tribunal, for example, the questions originally posed were about export credit insurance.  That information was sought through parliamentary questions and its release was cleverly avoided by crooked replies to those questions.  As a result there was <Col N="247" /> a tribunal of inquiry.  Had that information been subjected to the test of whether it was in the public interest that it be released, convincing and powerful arguments would have been put forward by people in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry against its release.  The public interest at that time would have been seen as protecting our greatest export and the integrity of our meat export trade.  Members will recall that Deputies who dared to ask questions about export credit insurance were accused of national sabotage.</P>
    <P>I can envisage the Government of the day or the public body which has possession of certain information being determined to plead the public interest in order to withhold that information.  That is the heart of the problem.  We are not talking about information that is not sensitive or unremarkable. We are discussing sensitive information which will cause embarrassment, bring down Governments and initiate calls for the resignations of the heads of public bodies.  No Administration will go to great lengths to hide information which is not of import.  That is the problem.  There would have been no need for a tribunal of inquiry into hepatitis C if the Department of Health, the BTSB and the then Minister for Health had provided more information.  That is the truth of the matter.  We are not concerned with routine information, we are discussing sensitive information which could cause the downfall of Governments.</P>

      <P>The Bill is &ldquo;an Act to provide for the regulation of private educational institutions and for the protection of students attending such institutions, for those purposes to enable the Minister for Education to issue licences to private educational institutions and to require them to enter into and maintain bonds, to provide for the establishment of a fund to be known as the private students' protection fund and for the payment of contributions by private educational institutions towards the resources for that fund and to provide for other matters connected with the foregoing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the introduction of this Bill by the Opposition is the recent collapse of the Advanced Technology College.  Over two years ago, in its programme &mdash; A Government of Renewal &mdash; the Government gave a commitment <Col N="248" /> to introduce legislation to regulate the private third level colleges sector, particularly in respect of the protection of the consumer rights of students.  In other words, it stated that it would introduce financial bonding which would, in essence, provide a guarantee to students attending private colleges that their courses would be completed in the event of a company going into liquidation or collapsing, as happened in the case of the Advanced Technology College.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the Advanced Technology College was a disaster waiting to happen.  The warning signs were apparent for some time because Newman College and ACT had previously collapsed in similar circumstances.  On both occasions, it was left to other private colleges in the Dublin area to come to the rescue of a number of students attending those colleges.  Some of the existing private colleges took on board a number of students from Newman College and ACT and facilitated them in completing their courses.</P>
    <P>To their credit, a group of private colleges have recognised the need for regulation.  I understand that their proposals have been with the Minister for some time and, like her promises to introduce legislation, they have not been acted upon.  Will she provide a clear indication why the Government has not introduced legislation to deal with the provision of financial bonding arrangements for private third level colleges?</P>
    <P>The basic facts of the latest instalment of mismanagement by the Minister of the private colleges sector are well known.  Students who, through their own hard work and that of their parents, paid thousands of pounds in fees arrived at their place of education one morning to discover it had collapsed overnight.  The first and most important point is to strongly condemn the scandalous and cavalier attitude of the owners. Clearly there had been a wilful and cynical deception of the staff and students.  In my opinion, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of reckless trading.  Will the Minister inform the House if an investigation is taking place under the Companies Act?  If not already involved, the Garda Síochána should be brought in to investigate this matter.</P>
    <P>The students were treated in an appalling manner by the owners of the college.  Its doors were shut and there was a complete absence of information regarding the students' futures, what had taken place and the reasons for the collapse.  This week, we witnessed the unhappy spectacle of students taking High Court proceedings to seek the appointment of an examiner.  It is a disgrace that the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, refused to meet the students.  Her refusal is indicative of her complete inaction with regard to private colleges in general.</P>
    <P>On the Order of Business last week, the Tánaiste was asked if the Minister would meet the students, their parents and the group trying to resolve this matter but to no avail.  Her failure to meet these people was a breach of faith.  The Tánaiste informed me that whatever could be done would be done.  However, his promise has <Col N="249" /> not been fulfilled and hundreds of students approaching the end of the academic year and important examinations have been left high and dry.  To date, the Minister for Education's response has been &ldquo;let them eat cake&rdquo;.  If the academic careers of these students are to be salvaged it is essential that an examinership be established.  The Minister has a duty to do what she can to ensure that such an examinership is viable.  She must overcome her ideological grudge against private colleges, recognise that they have evolved as a response to gaps in the State sector and take immediate and necessary action in respect of the Advanced Technology College.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an examinership is vital because there was a complex range of courses on offer at the Advanced Technology College and other colleges would not be in a position to readily assume responsibility for them.  Some of the computer science and business courses could be replicated in other colleges but that is not the best solution.  The existing staff at the Advanced Technology College are prepared to help the students complete their courses during the next three months.  Essentially, we are requesting that the Government provide a sum of money to the examiner to enable the college to remain in operation for three months.  This would allow the students to complete their courses with the help of the staff.  Many of the courses, such as cinematography, film, photography, etc., are of a specialist nature and involve the use of complex equipment.</P>
    <P>Members are aware of the reasons students attend places of education such as the Advanced Technology College.  They do so because sufficient places are not available in the State's third level colleges to cater for the increased demand in recent years.  That demand has occurred for demographic reasons and there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers attending second level education during the past five years.  It is envisaged that this increase will peak either this or next year.  As a result of the growing participation in education generally and the need to pursue further qualifications after post-primary level, those students who do not secure a place in the State's third level universities or regional technical colleges &mdash; plcs in some cases &mdash; have no alternative but to pursue their education in private sector third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party seems to be of the opinion that these students are the sons and daughters of well-heeled, upper middle class families who can afford private education and it is their tough luck if anything goes wrong.  To date, this has tended to be the view emanating from the Department of Education.  The initial response of the Minister's office to the parents that this matter was none of the Department's business and they should not have registered their children for the courses was disgraceful.  There was a complete lack of sympathy and compassion from the Department.  The Minister can nod and make any facial expression she wishes, but that does not hide the fact that <Col N="250" /> the initial response was disgraceful and quite unbecoming in respect of the plight of students who found themselves in great difficulty.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point about the insufficiency of college places.  Thousands of people applied to the Dún Laoighaire College of Art and Design for its cinematography and film courses but there were only a small number of places on offer and many applicants were disappointed. Therefore, people will seek to pursue courses in private colleges.  Many of our students have gone abroad.  The number in third level institutions in the United Kingdom has scored over the past five years, resulting in their being deemed eligible for the higher education grants scheme.  Why has all of this happened?  The answer is that we have had an insufficiency of places in our third level sector coupled with a huge demographic growth.  If we acknowledge all of that we must also accept that the private third level sector has a viable and important role to play.  We must acknowledge students' rights to attend private colleges and accept that they form part of the national effort to provide third level places and that they will continue to have a definite role to play until we have a sufficiency of places within the State sector.</P>
    <P>That fact has not been acknowledged by the Minister in her four years in office.  Generally her attitude to third level colleges appears to take the form of some ideological difficulties with their very existence and origins.  The immediate requirement in relation to the Advanced Technology College is the underwriting of an examinership, which is the cheapest, most expeditious way to solve this mess.  Before people start accusing me, Deputy Eoin Ryan or others of offering simplistic solutions or throwing money at the problem, I understand the amount required is estimated to be in the region of £150,000.  We should remember that the State has bailed out banks and large insurance companies for far greater amounts.  In this case we are talking about enabling 500 students to complete the final three months of their education, enabling them to complete their course and secure certification.  Without setting any precedent that would be a generous deed on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if accepted by the Minister, will create new circumstances with an obligation on third level colleges to have financial bonding. This is remarkably different from prevailing circumstances in which no such arrangements are in place.  While the Minister may worry about creating a precedent, if we pass this Bill and put in place the proper legislative framework governing financial bonding, we will not be creating any precedent in the event of her supporting an examinership in the case of the Advanced Technology College.  That is the Bill's <i>raison d'etre</i>&mdash; to support the students and their parents' campaign.  It has been introduced on the basis of its own <i>bona fide</i> merits, in line with the Government's commitment to introduce such legislative arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> On behalf of the students and staff involved I want the Minister to state where she stands in relation to an examinership for the Advanced Technology College.  Do the promises of the Tánaiste and Labour Party mean anything?  Does the Labour Party stand for anything any more in relation to the difficulties confronting these students?  Time is fast slipping away for any action in relation to this college.  There is a further hearing in the High Court on Thursday next with a full hearing later in the month.  With each successive week the position becomes ever bleaker for the students involved.  Fianna Fáil's objective is to ensure that whatever can be done is done.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the Advanced Technology College represents the latest instalment of a totally unsatisfactory saga.  The Minister's continued failure to make any response whatsoever to the needs and demands of the growing private colleges sector allowed circumstances to arise in which the Advanced Technology College collapsed. It is the aim of my party to ensure that will never recur.</P>
    <P>In order to secure the proper regulation of private colleges I prepared this Bill with my colleagues, Deputies Eoin Ryan and Woods, in response to the circumstances that have evolved. The private colleges sector is a vibrant, enterprising one catering for real needs in education. Many private colleges have been to the fore in seeking change and submitted detailed proposals to the Minister some time ago.  Unfortunately, for the students and staff of the Advanced Technology College those representations, as in the case of so many others, fell on deaf ears in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide for the regulation of private educational institutions, their students and staff.  It will require the Minister to license private colleges, requiring them to enter into a bound to guarantee against business failure.  I hope the Minister will at last acknowledge the need for this legislation and accept its underlying principle. I urge her to accept it on Second Reading and if amendments are necessary on Committee Stage, we will be open to their acceptance.  I do not think she can deny the principle behind the Bill, which is that private colleges should be regulated and statutorily obliged to have financial bonding.  Any reservation on detail or the thrust of any particular section can be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a licence will be a necessary condition to the operation of a private college. Any Minister will have to be satisfied as to the financial <i>bona fides</i> of a college before granting a licence and the business record of any operator will be taken into account.  The Minister can attach terms and conditions, as appropriate, to any such licence which can be used for registration and other purposes.  The withdrawal of any such licence would also be a matter for the Minister and any private college would have to continuously satisfy the appropriate conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="252" /> Furthermore, the Bill confers powers of inspection on the Minister which will ensure that he or she can effectively monitor the private colleges sector.  In addition, the refusal or revocation of a licence by a Minister would be subject to appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>A condition of obtaining a licence to operate a private college will be the entry into a financial bond, the purpose of which will be to ensure that, in the event of a private college being unable to discharge its responsibilities, moneys from the bond will be available to the Minister who, as trustee, will apply them to secure ongoing obligations. The uses to which the bond may be put by the Minister include helping students to continue their education, refunding as far possible moneys paid for services not rendered and defraying reasonable expenses incurred by him or her while acting as trustee in such circumstances. The Minister will also be responsible for accounting for the bond.</P>
    <P>In addition to the bond into which private colleges will have to enter as a matter of course, this Bill provides for the creation of a private students' protection fund, the purpose of which will be to assist students of bonded colleges, as necessary, over and above the resources of the bond.  Furthermore, the fund can be used if for any reason a delay is incurred in paying out under the bond.  However, the fund cannot be used to make payments for which the bond has already provided.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely and represents a vital response to the failure to date to regulate the private colleges sector.  Hundreds of students, their parents and teachers have been bitten financially by the lack of financial regulation.  Studies have been disrupted.  It is difficult enough to study for a difficult examination once but the pressure of having to do so again is appalling.  We are aware of many individual students having to work part-time, late at night, to fund the courses in which they participate at the Advanced Technology College.</P>
    <P>As I have already pointed out, these are not all children of rich parents merely enjoying the luxury of a private third level education.  These are students who have been forced to earn the money with which to pay for that education for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the lack of places in the State third level sector.  I have met these 500 students and their parents.</P>
    <P>I have already given two examples of difficulties that occurred in this sector over the past three years.  Some four or five years ago in Cork the College of Aeronautics collapsed, whose individual students, training to be pilots, had paid thousands of pounds.  This private college was opened with great fanfare, was assisted by the State, collapsed and went into liquidation.  I witnessed the trauma experienced by students while trying to help them secure places in other colleges.  Given the specialised nature of the training involved, many did not find alternative places.  Iona Training Centre provided some places.  I am aware of <Col N="253" /> the financial commitment of these young people who, in some instances, borrowed the money to pursue their courses.  When the courses collapsed they had no protection.</P>
    <P>One of the last articles by the late Christina Murphy, a great education journalist in <i>The Irish Times</i> last year, highlighted a case in Cork where a body established itself as a higher education institute almost overnight and began to advertise. It said it would provide degrees to enable people teach in Irish primary schools and the degrees would be vetted by a British university.  The article revealed the body in question did not have a franchise to offer that degree course.  Many parents of students had paid deposits of £100 which they subsequently recovered.  Where it not for that article many people would have been affected, perhaps not financially but certainly in the context of securing employment here on the basis of that degree because the State did not recognise the college in question.  In the past four or five years a number of examples of difficulties in certain colleges have highlighted the need for a proper legislative framework.  That is what we are attempting to do here.</P>
    <P>There are some excellent private colleges performing extremely well and it is unfortunate for them that the sector gets a bad name because of the sins of a few.  For example, Portobello College has its own bonding arrangement.  The principal there believes passionately there should be a bonding obligation for all private third level colleges. I have visited the owners of Griffith College, Dublin, who are doing excellent work as are LSB College Limited and Skerry's College, Cork. Over the years other colleges have provided high quality courses for many young people which have enabled them to go into the market place and secure jobs.</P>
    <P>We acknowledge those colleges are doing an excellent job in terms of the quality of the courses provided and the standards achieved.  Many have been acknowledged by the NCEA who have designated a number of the colleges for the provision of various courses.  Those I have mentioned are NCEA designated and some are on the CAO list and have an excellent track record.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about protecting them because until we have a proper legislative framework collapses such as this will continue to occur.  Without regulations and controls people can be ripped off and unfortunately the Minister did not regulate the colleges sector.  It is our duty to legislate to protect students, parents and staff.  Despite promises in the programme, A Government of Renewal, the State has failed to legislate.  There is a moral obligation on the Government to do something for the students of the Advanced Technology College.  We have allowed this system to continue unregulated and have not moved despite many warnings.  Given the Government's negligence in this area, it has an obligation to financially support the examinership and ensure the college is viable during a three months period in order that staff and students can complete their courses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Whatever is done for the students of the Advanced Technology College will be little but I hope it is not too late.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to see beyond party politics and support the Bill.  In the past five years there has been a change in the treatment of Private Members' Bills.  When in Government we accepted Deputy Shatters' Bills &mdash; Judicial Separation and Family Law Reforms Act, 1989, and the Adoption Act, 1991.  A number of private Members' Bills have been accepted by the Government and a number have been rejected. Fianna Fáil will not stand aside and leave the 500 students without anybody to speak for or help them.  We will do what is open to us as an Opposition party.  The ultimate is to put forward and seek Government approval of legislation.  We have raised the matter on the Order of Business, on the Adjournment and we now have a Private Members' Bill to progress the matter.  It is a pity it has taken so long and that we could not have had intervention at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect we would have to move a Private Members' Bill tonight.  The week before last I received a telephone call from some students at the Advanced Technology College, Merrion Square, who told me they had been studying at the college for the past two years. There were told some changes would be made in the college but before they knew what was happening they realised the college was being closed. Out of frustration and anger they occupied the building where they remained for a number of days.  Following a request I visited the college. Given that they had occupied the college for a number of nights, the conditions under which they were living were appalling.  The owner of the college had turned off the water and had refused to allow food to be taken in.  Nearing the end of their occupation they were getting food in by hauling bags up the front of the building.  While at the college that afternoon, a gentleman arrived from a water filtering company and removed the pump from the building so that no water could get to the students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of the students I tried to negotiate with the owner of the college.  I told him the way in which the students were being treated was outrageous, that it was not leading anywhere and if he wanted to resolve the matter he should sit down with the students and negotiate with them. Unfortunately he refused to do that and said he wanted the students to leave the college.  The students would not leave the college because they considered they would have no ground on which to bargain.  As it happened the students moved legally and were successful in court on Friday evening in a bid to save the college.  In the meantime they decided to try to meet as many people as possible with the view to setting up a structure that would save the college.  At this stage parents began to congregate at the college and asked me what they could do.  The issue had been raised in the House on the previous evening by Deputy <Col N="255" /> Keogh of the Progressive Democrats but unfortunately the Government's answer was negative. Both the parents and I were shocked by that answer.  They and I naively believed some avenue must be open through the Department of Education, the Minister's office or through another Department but no ideas were forthcoming.</P>
    <P>On Saturday afternoon in Jury's Hotel there was a meeting of students and parents.  Some parents of final year students had spent £6,000 on courses; their children would have qualified this summer but now their money was gone down the drain.  At the meeting a Government backbencher, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, said the students were being treated outrageously and the Minister and the Government should do something about it.  However, that, too, fell on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>This country's film industry has been well promoted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins.  It is a growth industry and has focussed a lot of attention on Ireland. We are rightly proud that many high-profile films have been made here.  Many students in this college hope to graduate and work in that industry. A few weeks ago, the Taoiseach said we had a shortage of multi-media graduates; students in this college are pursuing such courses.  There is a lack of qualified people for industry and that is a growing problem because we do not have graduates to fill the jobs becoming available.  Everyone, including the Government and various State bodies, recognises that.  In many ways it is a good complaint but we must be mindful to address it. If we have a shortage of graduates in these and other courses provided by this college, I cannot understand why the Government would not ensure these courses could be completed in the few months that are left.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no idea how angry people are, not because Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats are whipping them up but because they simply cannot believe she will not meet them.  If she even met them to say she could do nothing some of them would accept it but they cannot accept that she, as Minister for Education, will not meet them at all.  The parents cannot understand how she can watch 500 students go out on the street.  Many of them are in shock.</P>
    <P>This is not the first time this has happened; it occurred with Newman College and that is probably why the subject was mentioned in the Programme for Government.  There are many good private colleges, some of which were mentioned by my colleague Deputy Martin.  Portobello College, Griffith College, the LSB, etc.  They are running excellent courses and doing a good job.  Long may they continue to prosper.  This is a growth area because the State is not able to cover it. There is nothing wrong with the private education sector.  In some cases it sets a better standard than the State sector and it provides a variety of courses, so it is not to be discouraged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> Many people on the Labour Party front bench made their names through student politics.  They stood in buildings close to here and marched for great ideals and socialism.  However, when 500 students are thrown on the street, their Minister and party colleague will not meet them.  I am not asking her to sort the matter out, all she has to do is meet them because it is the least she could do.</P>
    <P>We have seen a huge growth in private colleges and many foreign students have come here.  It is not good that they should see a private college go bust while nothing happens.  The issue is being watched and discussed by students all over Dublin. As I said both when we were in Government and since, we should encourage and nurture the practice of attracting foreign students to third level education in Ireland.  It is the fourth biggest industry in England and many private colleges here say we have not pursued it as much as we could.  Ireland is an attractive country to which to send students to be educated.  It is stable and safe and, for many Middle Eastern countries, it is much more politically correct to send students here rather than to England.  It is a potential growth area which we have not tapped as much as we should.</P>
    <P>Last week the Tánaiste told Deputy Martin that everything which could be done would be, but that is not the case.  This side of the House has been accused of introducing Private Members' Bills for reasons of political expediency but we do not do so.  The Bills we introduced have acted as a catalyst for this Government to take action.  We introduced a Child Pornography Bill and straight away the Minister addressed the problem; we introduced a Bill on syringe attacks and the Minister has prepared legislation in response.  Our job as an Opposition is to raise issues of concern to the public and put the Government under pressure.  If introducing this Bill means the Government will take action on this issue, that will be a good night's work and we will be happy.  I hope the Minister has no ideological grudge against private colleges because it is important that they grow and prosper.  It is necessary to underwrite the examinership of this college immediately, as this is the cheapest and most expeditious way to sort out the mess.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, Deputy Martin and I, among others, have put a lot of work into this Bill.  The Government has failed to legislate although it promised to do so in the Programme for Government. Private colleges submitted detailed proposals to the Minister some time ago.  Unfortunately this Bill will be too late for the staff and students of the Advanced Technology College.  I was most impressed with the staff's commitment to continue the courses until the end of the year and prepare students for their final exams.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Martin, dealt with the details of the Bill.  It is not perfect but it is not meant to be because we are in Opposition. However, we hope the Minister accepts the principle of it.  If amendments are required, we will <Col N="257" /> support them if we agree with them.  Other Private Members' Bills have been passed and I ask the Minister to support this Bill.  I also ask her to meet the students of this college and their parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the students, and their parents, of the Advanced Technology College, which is in financial difficulties.  I am conscious of the commitment of students and parents to providing for students' education and of the financial and other sacrifices involved for them.  Developing a policy and regulatory framework in this area is complex. However, the Government is committed to developing an appropriate regulatory framework for private colleges.  Much work has been carried out in developing one but work remains and it will be done.</P>
      <P>This is not an area which lends itself to overly simplistic solutions, such as are seen in the proposed Bill before this House.  The rights of parents and students are involved.  The rights to conduct private business within the terms of the laws governing the operation of companies is relevant. The procedures for dealing with private companies which experience financial difficulties are relevant. There are consumer protection issues, which embrace the concerns of other Departments of State.  There is a range of issues related to the quality of education provided in such institutions.</P>
      <P>Finally, there is the complex issue of framing appropriate legislation taking account of the relevant constitutional provisions, the right to carry on business in a private commercial capacity, the rights of consumers to be protected and the rights of students to a quality education.  The deeply flawed Bill presented to us ignores many of these issues but the Government, through its programme for Government, and the commitment in the White Paper on Education is committed to moving forward on these fronts.</P>
      <P>I propose to set out what we have done and where we propose to go.  I will also set out why this Bill fails to adequately address the complexity of the issues involved.  The Bill being proposed by Fianna Fáil is a knee-jerk and oversimplistic reaction to the difficult situation faced by students of the Advanced Technology College, which ignores the remedies being pursued through the courts.  An application to have an Examiner appointed to the Advanced Technology College is currently before the courts.  The objective of the procedure for the appointment of an Examiner is to allow a company experiencing financial difficulties an opportunity to put together a rescue package which would in turn be adjudicated upon by its creditors, shareholders and the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides for the making of an interim report to the court on the future viability of the company within a timescale of 21 days, although the court has the power to grant an extension to this.  The Examiner is also required <Col N="258" /> to form a view as to the manner in which the company has conducted its affairs and in particular whether any question of negligent trading arises. Therefore, there is a statutory procedure for private commercial colleges which get into financial difficulties and it is being availed of by the students of the Advanced Technology College. As creditors of the company they will have the opportunity of stating their case to the Examiner and the court, as appropriate.</P>

      <P>There are statutory mechanisms for companies experiencing financial difficulties and these mechanisms are being availed of by the students in question.</P>
      <P>It is clearly important that every effort should be made to protect the financial investment of students and their parents.  The Government recognises the need for regulatory control of private education and, in this regard, the programme, A Government of Renewal, outlines its commitment to introduce legislation to regulate private education to ensure proper educational standards, consumer protection and employee rights.</P>
      <P>This Bill significantly fails to adequately address the questions associated with the regulation of private education.  Furthermore, the complexity of the issues and the risk of getting it wrong if we rush to legislate is borne out by the Bill in which there is serious confusion as to the intended target of its provisions.  The introduction of a regulatory framework which will stand the test of time and serve the consumers of educational services demands a considered approach involving dialogue with the relevant interests, a detailed assessment of the various options available and a clear understanding of the implications associated with each option.  A rushed approach based on a regulatory framework designed for a different set of consumers with different needs and concerns is clearly inadequate and oversimplistic.</P>

      <P>It is a pity to waste time. There have been advances in meeting the programme's commitment to regulate private colleges and I consider it is important to outline the initiatives I have taken in this regard.</P>
      <P>Before doing so, we need to look at the current arrangements.  Under section 20 of the National Council for Educational Awards Act, 1979, the Minister for Education may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, and after consultation with the NCEA, designate an educational institution other than a university as being an institution to which the NCEA Act applies.  Since its foundation in 1972 and its establishment on a statutory basis in 1979, the NCEA has pursued its mission of putting in place quality certification at third level in the extra university sector.</P>
      <P>A number of private commercial colleges have been designated under the NCEA Act, such as the Dublin Business School, formerly Accountancy and Business College; The American College, Dublin; Burren College of Art; Griffith College, Dublin; HSI College, Limerick; The Institute of Education, Business College; LSB College Ltd.; Mid West Business Institute, Limerick; Skerry's College, Cork and St. Nicholas Montessori College, Ireland.  The work of the NCEA is complemented by the National Council for Vocational Awards whose function is to develop a comprehensive national certification and assessment system for a wide range of vocational programmes, particularly those in the education sector, in consultation with the relevant interest group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of a national qualifications framework is being progressed by Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority, which has <Col N="260" /> a wide ranging remit, including the development, implementation, regulation and supervision of the certification of all non university third level programmes and all further and continuation education and training programmes; responsibility for the plans, programmes and budgets necessary for the achievement of these functions, including the plans, programmes and budgets of the NCEA and the NCVA; the establishment, direction, supervision and regulation of a national qualifications framework; and ensuring international recognition for all the qualifications under its remit.  Teastas is charged with welding the many existing certification systems into a coherent framework and in so doing establishing flexible routes by which students can gain access and progress to further qualifications.</P>
    <P>My approach to the question of regulating private colleges is clearly set out in the White Paper, Charting Our Education Future.  There has been significant growth in recent years in the number of private commercial colleges.  The White Paper outlines how new control procedures will be put in place in relation to private commercial colleges offering third level programmes which seek State certification.  It is important to regulate such colleges so as to guarantee the academic integrity and quality of the courses and qualifications on offer; to prescribe institutional norms in regard to, for example, staff qualifications, support services, teaching/research balance, entry standards and the balance of course provision; and to protect the financial investment of students and their parents.</P>
    <P>There is a dual focus in the area of policy, namely, to ensure the quality of provision in private colleges and to provide for adequate consumer protection.  The White Paper sets out the parameters of the control procedures which will, in addition to requirements to protect students' financial investment, involve rigorous evaluation of the quality of courses on offer; an evaluation of the physical and educational facilities, teaching staff and other support services available; a requirement that each institution receiving NCEA designation provide at least three courses of certificate or diploma standard; and the provision of relevant statistical information to my Department and the NCEA.  The evaluations will be carried out on an ongoing basis.  These new control procedures will be the responsibility of Teastas, the Irish National Certification Authority.</P>
    <P>The first report of Teastas, which was published in January 1997, is currently under detailed consideration.  This report presents the initial proposals and recommendations of the board on a national qualifications framework and the organisational structure for Teastas.  It also outlines the progress made during an extensive consultative process.  The key issues in relation to the development of a national qualifications framework are quality assurance, accreditation, access, progression <Col N="261" /> and mobility and international recognition. My Department has commenced discussions with Teastas on the system of approval for institutions seeking State certification.  These discussions will also encompass issues in relation to financial and academic bonding.</P>
    <P>In the interim considerable progress has been made in formulating educational standards. Private colleges now offer courses for which tax relief is available under the 1995 and 1996 Finance Acts.  This improvement has been introduced during my time in office.  In keeping with the commitment in the White Paper, I published a code of standards to which institutions must adhere in order to be eligible for tax relief.  That information can be made available to parents by the Department of Education.  These codes of standards were developed by the Working Group on Third Level Private Commercial Colleges which I established to advise me on the appropriate criteria for recognition of colleges and courses, including admission and quality standards.</P>
    <P>The working group was representative of Teastas, my Department, the NCEA and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  In response to media advertisements, it received a large number of submissions from interested parties and met with representatives of a number of the colleges involved.  The codes of standards require institutions to meet specified criteria in the following areas.  In the academic environment institutions are required to have an academic board and adequate internal processes for self-evaluation. In the physical environment institutions are required to have adequate accommodation, equipment and access to library and other learning facilities, including facilities for research and computer facilities.  They are also required to have adequate finance for student clubs and societies.  In the case of staffing and staff development, institutions are required to have sufficient professional, technical and other staff with appropriate qualifications in the areas of teaching, administrative and clerical support, technical support, library and information technology services and advisory, counselling and guidance services. The staff must undertake work that will keep them abreast of developments in their field of specialist knowledge and have access to appropriate training in pedagogical skills.</P>
    <P>The working group was also asked to consider the issues of academic and financial bonding and consumer protection.  Following careful evaluation of the advice available to it in relation to possible provisions for academic and financial bonding and consumer protection, the working group concluded that such provisions should not be included in the codes of standards.  It recommended that my Department should address these issues in association with Teastas and the NCEA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a quality mark associated with the Department of Education and I am responsible for ensuring it is upheld for students, their parents and colleges.  My Department <Col N="263" /> has commenced discussions with Teastas. The working group was impressed with the consideration being given to the questions of academic and financial bonding by the private colleges which are very concerned about what is happening.  For example, the Institute of Education Business College already has a bonding system in place.</P>
      <P>A number of NCEA designated private colleges represented by the Higher Education Colleges Association are further developing proposals for academic and financial bonding for consideration in the context of decisions on the future framework.  My Department has been actively involved in the development of a regulatory framework for third level private commercial colleges.  This work is, of its very nature, slow and incremental having regard to the complexity of the issues involved and the need to develop an effective and efficient framework.  This work is in complete contrast to the hastily framed Bill being proposed by Fianna Fáil.  This Bill fails miserably in its attempt to regulate private colleges.</P>

    <P>The Bill proposed by Fianna Fáil is almost a mirror image of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 which is designed to protect holidaymakers who travel abroad on chartered holidays for a fortnight once a year, if they are lucky.  The Bill as proposed represents an over simplistic approach by Fianna Fáil which is attempting to apply the statutory framework <Col N="264" /> introduced for travel agents and tour operators who regulate a large market that affects people for a fortnight each year at the most.  Nothing other than a superficial comparison can be drawn between the position of travel agents and tour operators and that of education providers.</P>

      <P>The issue facing a holidaymaker in the event of a travel agent or tour operator experiencing financial difficulties is the recovery of a deposit paid in the event that the person has not started their holiday, and how the holidaymaker will get home if he or she is abroad on holiday.  Of all the annual customers of a particular travel agent or tour operator, the proportion affected by any financial difficulties is limited to those already on holiday and those who, having paid their deposits, have yet to travel.</P>
      <P>The issues facing students in educational institutions who experience financial difficulties are far more complex.  Students may have invested a number of years or months in pursuit of the course, in addition to their financial investment. Students will want the opportunity to complete their courses and obtain the relevant qualifications. They are not asking me or the Deputies opposite to get their money back.

The Bill requires educational institutions to enter into and maintain bonds and establishes a protection fund to be financed by contributions from educational institutions.</P>

      <P>The Bill, as drafted, includes summer schools and hobby pursuits.  There must be a clear understanding of the scope of any regulatory framework.  There can be no ambiguity as to the type of institution to be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As proposed, the Bill could result in a situation whereby no educational institution could provide private education at post-primary level for more than ten students without a licence from the Minister for Education.  Are the proposers of the Bill serious?  The desirability of introducing a mandatory licensing system needs to be fully explored, having regard to the cost implications for consumers who will ultimately bear the cost of such licensing.</P>
      <P>A regulatory framework requires an efficient, effective administrative structure to ensure compliance with all statutory requirements.  Such a structure would have significant resource implications. A balance needs to be achieved between the costs of, and benefits to be derived from, a regulatory framework.  We are not talking about taking £5 from everybody passing through Dublin Airport.  Does the Opposition seriously intend to require a licence for each voluntary secondary school?</P>

      <P>The Deputy needs to go on a course for the hard of hearing.  Does the Opposition seriously intend to regulate each course regardless of its length or subject matter?</P>
      <P>The constitutional implications of any legislation of this nature require detailed consideration because Article 42.2 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Parents shall be free to provide this education in their homes or in private schools or in schools recognised or established by the State.&rdquo; An initial consideration of the Bill raises serious questions as to the constitutionality of introducing a mandatory licensing system for private educational institutions.  The constitutional guarantees for the owners of schools need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In preparing the Education Bill, 1997, I was conscious of the competing constitutional rights of the various institutions in education.  I had to seek a balance between the rights which could be objectively supported as being in the interests of the common good.  Without detailed legal advice I could not be satisfied that the approach adopted by the Bill is constitutionally sound or is the best approach in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The framework set out in the White Paper involves a dual approach involving academic and financial bonding.  It recognises the reality that students' investment is not just a financial one but one of time invested on route to a particular desired qualification.  The benefits of such an approach are recognised by a number of private colleges, represented by the Higher Education Colleges Association, which considers that proper academic bonding would reduce the cost of financial bonding.</P>
      <P>In relation to financial bonding, a number of options will have to be considered.  These bonding arrangements should be on an individual college basis or on a sectoral basis with a common fund.  The size of the private commercial colleges sector needs to be acknowledged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of academic bonding may include provision whereby students affected by the collapse of a college could transfer to another college to complete their courses.  For obvious reasons, what is envisaged could only operate in private colleges which are State certified.  I have <Col N="267" /> already referred briefly to the constitutional issues.  My proposals outlined in the White Paper are for a regulatory framework to be limited to private commercial colleges which seek State certification. This is the optimal approach because we can have at that stage a balance between the academic and the financial bonding.</P>
    <P>Legislation has to address the real world.  This legislation ignores the fact that the fundamental concern of students at the ATC and other students in private colleges is the continuation of their education.</P>

      <P>I would like clarification on the question of when the Minister met the students or parents of Advanced Technology College as it is unclear.  I do not wish to be accused of misleading the House but it has been suggested that the Minister met those who were designated to represent the students and parents caught up in this unfortunate matter.  Has the Minister met those who were designated by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that is on the record, because I do not want to be accused of misleading the House.  My information is that the Minister had not met a delegation constituted to represent the parents and students at this entity, and that is the position.  However, the central burden of the Minister's argument is that this Bill does nothing to help the students of the college.  It is my respectful submission to the Minister that it does and is part of a very well thought out strategy by our spokesperson to assist those who have been caught up in this dreadful affair.  No Government wishes to commit itself to assist a college of this type when it believes it might lead to an open-ended commitment for the Exchequer; but if a proper bonding system were put in place, it would be possible to deal with the problem of ATC on a one-off basis.  Surely an administration such as this, spending the amount of money it has been spending since budget day and facing into an imminent general election, could find a place in <Col N="268" /> its heart for this group who have been affected by the collapse of the college.</P>
      <P>It was disappointing to hear the Minister oozing sympathy for the students and parents of the Advanced Technology College, saying how conscious she was of the commitment of the students and parents and how aware she was of their financial and other sacrifices, and yet not prepared to meet the parents or those designated to represent the parents or students of this body.</P>
      <P>The rest of the Minister's contribution, was most disappointing because of what it told us about her thinking and the quality of official thinking in the Department.  So much of the speech consisted of nit-picking, taking fine points, looking at a Bill and finding that this or that subsection was defective in some minor respect.  I will return to that later because the Bill does not bring within its scope the voluntary secondary schools.  Much of the Minister's contribution was devoted to this kind of negative, carping criticism. Not once in her contribution did she outline a positive strategy for addressing the problem that has arisen in the college.  Our spokesperson, to his credit, put forward a positive strategy based first on creating financial confidence in the sector through a bonding system &mdash; that is essential because no Government wants to become involved in interfering in this private educational sector unless it can be sure that financial probity and confidence can be maintained in the system hereafter.  That is guaranteed in this Bill and opens the way for the Minister to take an initiative in regard to this specific institution.  The Minister, however, is not interested in clearing the way towards this end.  In the long list of beneficiaries we have seen queuing up before the forthcoming general election, this is one group that will not be allowed to join the queue.  That is the message from the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests that developing a policy and regulatory framework in this area is complex. It is far less complex than the regulatory and policy framework the Minister has been attempting for some time to devise for the primary, secondary and university sectors.  She accepts that the Government is committed to developing an appropriate regulatory framework, and much work has been done, but much remains to be done.  When I see the kind of work the Minister has done on the Universities Bill and the Education Bill, I am worried about what she might produce to deal with private educational institutions. If it is drafted on the analogy of her earlier legislative efforts, we will have a great deal more talking in this House, and the Constitution will certainly come into play at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point the Minister made is that the rights of parents and students are involved.  It is great to hear her say that but, again, one looks at her legislative efforts in the university, second level and first level sectors.  I make this point because my right as a Deputy to comment on these matters has been curtailed by the decision of this Government to close the debate on the <Col N="269" /> Education Bill, one of the most fundamental items of legislation ever introduced in this State. The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was in another jurisdiction for part of his working political life.  He knows how fundamental the 1944 Act was in the United Kingdom.  This is the equivalent legislation here and there is an attempt by the Labour Party to nationalise by stealth a huge swathe of the Irish educational sector in the last weeks of a Dáil, just before a dissolution.  It is a scandal and the upset and worry it is causing to people of the minority religious faiths throughout this State is enormous.  That is what the Minister should address.  She should also address the upset and worry of the parents of the students of this private college, instead of introducing theoretical socialistic solutions to our educational system which do not inspire public confidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the effrontery to suggest that the question of rights to conduct private business within the terms of the laws governing the operation of companies is relevant.  This Bill has nothing to do with rights to conduct private business within the terms of the laws governing the operation of companies which is a matter regulated by a companies code which the Oireachtas has amended many times and which provides for relationships within companies.  Nobody is questioning the right of a company to conduct a private business.  What we are putting forward is a practical thought out scheme to ensure the financial probity and well-being of companies which carry on this particular business, and no reasonable person could object to that or suggest it is not in the interests of the common good.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection legislation is in existence in this State and if the Minister wishes to extend the ambit of that protection to this sector, that course of action is open to her colleague, the Minister for Trade and Tourism, who carries the responsibility for that legislation.  It is not an issue that arises on our Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests starkly that there is a range of issues related to the quality of the education provision of such institutions.  Happily, to date, such institutions have been immune from ministerial inquiry in these matters.  The quality of our educational institutions down the years was built up by parents, the different Churches, teachers and by the Department in setting standards through the inspectorate.  It was a true partnership, not the kind of partnership the Minister is at present trying to construct in education, a sort of collectivist partnership where the State nationalises by stealth the entire primary, secondary and third level sector and attempts to inhibit creativity and initiative in these institutions.  Here the Minister is concerned with the quality of education provision in such institutions.  The persons who go to these entities make a decision about the quality of the educational provision in them, and people can be trusted to make these decisions themselves.  It may surprise a socialist Minister to hear it, but people are capable of making intelligent choices and do not need the Minister for <Col N="270" /> Education to tell them what a quality education is.</P>
    <P>Then there is the complex issue of framing appropriate legislation, taking account of the relevant constitutional provisions &mdash; the Constitution was finally introduced.  Again I suggest in relation to the education Bill that the Minister should have regard to the constitutional issues there if she is examining her constitutional obligations at present, because she has very serious constitutional obligations in relation to the provision of education.  One of them is that while the Minister is obliged to supplement private initiative in education, she is not allowed to supplant or nationalise private education.  That is something she has purported to do in the education Bill.  She now suggests that our Bill is in some way unconstitutional in devising a very minimal standard of financial protection for these private colleges.</P>
    <P>It is a very disappointing contribution from the Minister, most of all for the poverty of official thought in it and the lack of any thought out initiative to deal with the problem that has arisen in the Advanced Technology College.  One issue that very much concerned me when I heard what the Minister said was this question of the definition of an educational institution.  The Minister was concerned that the definition of a private educational institution in section 2 would extend to or include all voluntary secondary schools in the State, but it is clear that the definition of private educational institution in the Bill means an institution, company, partnership or association of persons whose business is the provision of private education at post-primary levels for more than ten students and is referred to in the Act as an educational institution.  A voluntary secondary school is not engaged in a business, which in law means an occupation or activity carried on with a view to a profit &mdash; as we know, the voluntary education sector has not been carried on with a view to a profit.  The voluntary school, therefore, does not fall within the statutory definition under this Bill and no question of bonding arises.  The Minister is in error in suggesting that.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to suggest that every summer school, every part-time course, the Oscar Wilde summer school and courses in yoga, reflexology and flower arranging fall within the scope of the Bill, but none of those courses is carried on with a view to a profit.  They are voluntary activities which citizens are free to undertake.  It is remarkable the Minister made such a suggestion. If the definition of private education institution is defective, it could be amended in Committee, thereby addressing the Minister's concern.</P>
    <P>The only other point of jurisprudence raised by the Minister related to the analogy between education providers and travel agents and tour operators. In the Labour Party thinking on education there is no analogy.  It has not got around yet to <Col N="271" /> telling tourists what the politically correct destinations are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as parents and students are concerned, there is an analogy.  Perhaps the Minister does not like an analogy to be drawn between the high world of education and what she saw, rather patronisingly, as the low world of the travel agent.  As far as the consumer is concerned, what is provided is a service for which they pay, and what we are endeavouring to provide in this Bill is a basic mechanism to ensure financial protection for those who engage in that service.  Far from being a disreputable form of jurisprudence or dishonourable to equate the provider of a private educational service with a travel agent, there is a well established precedent in the Acts of the Oireachtas for this approach.  I was surprised the Minister did not refer to auctioneers or solicitors because similar arrangements have been put in place by the Oireachtas to ensure these classes of persons do not take money entrusted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to refer to the Bar because it does not have to handle clients' money, that is left to solicitors.  The Bar simply sings for reward and, some say, is more than adequately compensated for doing so.  Since the Bar does not have to handle clients' money, it does not need to be bonded, although some would say it should be outlawed.</P>
      <P>It is superficial for the Minister to suggest that it is a cause of derision that the legislation is modelled on legislation relating to travel agents when similar legislation has been well established in terms of the bonding of a wide range of persons who are entrusted with other people's money. The key feature as far as the parent or student is concerned is the entrusting of money to a private institution.  What is required is a bonding arrangement to ensure there is no defalcation of money or withdrawal of promised service, or in the event that there is such withdrawal, there is guaranteed return of the money.  That is the core proposal in the Bill, but the Minister did not address that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that legislation dealing with travel agents and tour operators is an inadequate template for this kind of legislation, but I am at a loss to know what is an adequate template.  The issue facing the holiday maker or tour operator experiencing financial difficulties is the recovery of the deposit paid, and that is the precise difficulty faced by parents and students.  The position is much the same with entities which go into receivership or liquidation.  It is not correct for the Minister to say that the issues facing students are far more complex.  The issues facing these <Col N="272" /> students are very simple and the remedies required very urgent, but the Minister did not recognise the simplicity of the problem or the urgency of a solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that there would be constitutional implications involved and that we must be conscious of the competing constitutional rights of the various interests in education, but she should have thought out that matter more carefully when drawing up the Education Bill. This Bill, which is a minimalist measure constitutionally, would provide financial security for those who deal with private educational institutions. It is in the interests of the common good that such provision be made.  No Supreme Court would strike down legislation which provides, in the interests of the common good and of social justice, for the regulation of a private activity such as this.  That relates to Article 43 of the Constitution, which provides adequate constitutional protection for this type of legislation.  There is no question of anyone's rights in regard to education being interfered with, unless of course the Minister decides to go one step further, as she envisaged in her contribution, and prescribes the courses students should take, what they should be taught or the kinds of boards that should exist in colleges.</P>
    <P>Far from doing nothing to help ATC students, this Bill goes a long way towards helping them by providing for an adequate system of financial bonding for this sector.  In so doing it allows the Minister to find an amicable resolution of the problems faced by parents and students.  I was very disappointed by the response to this matter. This is an urgent problem which should be addressed.  It is not good enough for the Minister to talk about the Constitution, certification of courses and the complex issues involved.  It is disappointing the Minister has refused to meet those involved in this tragedy.</P>

    <Title>Freedom of Information Bill, 1996 [  Seanad ]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the ethos and spirit of this legislation.  The key to the legislation in terms of its effect in providing open government will be the manner in which the exemptions, which are plentiful, are interpreted by the appeals commissioner or the body that retains the information <Col N="273" /> sought.  I was drawing a comparison with earlier cases in which it was deemed to be in the public interest to retain information when it was sought in the House.  The beef tribunal would not have been necessary if legitimate parliamentary questions had been answered here.  If the authorities at the time had been challenged with the definition of the public interest, I am sure they would have made a cogent argument for retaining the information sought.  In their view it would not have been in the public interest to release the information because it would have exposed massive malpractice in the beef processing industry and have had implications for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>The instinct to self-preservation exists in all bodies, including the human.  It certainly exists in the body politic.  Governments tend to preserve their interests and have gone to enormous lengths to retain information, the release of which would have prejudiced their being in Government.  The collapse of a Government must be avoided at all costs and that applies to all Governments.  Therein lies the real difficulty with this legislation.</P>
      <P>A tribunal has reported on negligence in the BTSB which led to the infection of many people. From my first reading of the report it is clear the Department of Health, the BTSB and the individuals concerned were mindful of protecting their interests and withholding information that would have represented an appalling panorama of doom if released into the public domain.  There was an instinct to cover up and that had to be sustained over many years by retaining information and failing to give Ministers sufficient information before coming into the House to reply to parliamentary questions.  That was complemented by the instinct of Ministers to preserve themselves and their Governments from trouble.  The report states that &ldquo;there was a sort of vague irresponsible hope that the problem might go away&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the hepatitis C crisis the authorities' interest in self-preservation was far stronger than the public interest.  If they had been challenged by the exceptions in this Bill relating to the public interest, they would have argued it was in the public interest not to admit that the blood supply was contaminated.  They would have said it was in the public interest to protect the State from widespread claims of negligence by the persons so infected.  They would have argued to the commissioner or to their Cabinet colleagues that it was in the public interest that this information remained secret because public confidence in the blood supply was at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are examples of cases in which Ministers, a State body and individuals would have argued the public interest was best served by the retention of information.  Public bodies, authorities and Governments have no problem releasing information that is non-controversial.  This legislation will be tested only in cases involving damning information which could cause the collapse of a public body or involve a large suit against the State.  We must examine carefully the list of <Col N="274" /> exemptions and the procedures in place for their use.</P>
    <P>In the event of a public body using the exemption to refuse to grant access to information, there is provision for an appeal to the commissioner to decide whether its use of the exemption is proper.  The Minister stated that in exceptional cases &mdash; these are the cases that cause problems &mdash; a Minister may issue a certificate which will remove the right of referral on appeal to the commissioner.  When that right of appeal has been removed from the commissioner it will be reviewed by other members of the Cabinet. That is an interesting scenario because under the rule on Cabinet confidentiality one would never find out what happened in a particular case.  The Cabinet operates collectively and decisions on retaining or releasing information would not be made public.  The Bill provides for an appeal to the High Court, but major obstacles undermine its fundamental principle, the public's right to information.  From my experience as an Opposition spokesperson trying to extract sensitive information by way of parliamentary question, I am not confident that this or future Governments will be forthcoming with sensitive or explosive information when their skins are at stake.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that section 6 reverses the existing principle under the Official Secrets Act that everything is assumed to be confidential.  I will attend a briefing meeting with the officials on this matter because I am not sure that this is the case.  Section 4 of the Official Secrets Act effectively makes it a crime to communicate official information unless such communication is permitted. Section 6 of this Bill extends considerably the circumstances in which some communications are permitted.  In so far as it goes, that is a move in the right direction, but it does not abolish the mindset that treats official information as secret unless there is an exception.  To do that we would have to get rid of the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security recently published a detailed report on a review of the Official Secrets Act.  The extent of the committee's concerns are reflected in its recommendation that the Act should be repealed at the earliest possible date.  Time is of the essence if we are not to put this legislation on the Statute Book in a half-baked manner.  It is important that real work continues on the repeal of the Official Secrets Act.  The committee noted a number of flaws in that Act.  Under its provisions a document acquires confidential status simply by being stamped as such.  A document can acquire unchallengeable confidential status by being certified as such by a Minister and even the courts cannot challenge that certification. There are serious doubts about the constitutional validity of this.  The Act uses criminal sanctions where civil or disciplinary ones might be more appropriate and fails to distinguish between information the release of which would damage the national interest, and information which <Col N="275" /> would not.  It is not clear whether the Official Secrets Act allows a public interest defence.</P>
    <P>I accept that in enacting the Bill the Government did not hide behind the Officials Secrets Act.  Under section 32(1)(a) it is irrelevant whether a Minister has certified a document as secret if a person requests access to it.  It is time to repeal the Official Secrets Act which should be done by amending this legislation or by introducing another Bill.  This Bill is not due to come into force until a year after it is passed, so it should be possible to place a new Bill on the Statute Book by then to replace the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>I hope that access to records will not be treated in the same way as parliamentary questions to Ministers are dealt with in this House &mdash; in other words, by giving as little information as possible. It is important for this House to observe the right of access to information.  Under section 15(5), the Minister for Finance must ensure that appropriate measures are taken by public bodies to train staff and to put organisational arrangements in place to breathe life into the spirit of this Bill.  It is important that the House is kept informed of these developments.</P>
    <P>No section requires public bodies to preserve documents.  In the absence of such a provision, there could be a temptation to destroy records or documents which would be of interest to someone who subsequently requested access to them.</P>
    <P>Section 6(4), which defines the types of records to which the public may have access, threatens to destroy many of the good aspects of this Bill.  Subject to certain limited exceptions, people will not be entitled to access to records created before the commencement of the Act.  Amendments were made to this section during Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The Minister said it was the Government's intention to provide access to past records on a rolling basis &mdash; first, two years, then four years, six years, etc.  While the Minister was willing to respond to the concerns expressed in the Seanad, further consideration of this issue is required.</P>
    <P>It is important to instil public confidence in the new measures.  We are a few years behind other democracies in providing access to information. If the Bill is passed in its present form, almost every request for access to information will be turned down, not on the grounds that the information sought was prepared in confidence or that it is commercially sensitive &mdash; such exemptions are provided for elsewhere in the Bill &mdash; but because the Bill does not cover records created before the Bill came into force.  This could have a serious negative impact on public confidence in the new measures.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the reason for the blanket approach adopted in section 6(4).  The Minister's rolling back approach should start at the same time as the Bill comes into force &mdash; in other words, people should be allowed access to documents not less than two years old.  In the Seanad debate, the Minister said it was a question of putting <Col N="276" /> filing systems and access in order.  Given that Departments will have a year and local authorities 18 months from the passing of this Bill until it comes into force, not to mention all the time they had since this legislation was mooted, there is room for progress on the issue of the right of access to documents created before the commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the 18 month implementation period for local authorities.  The Bill, as originally drafted, allowed for three years but this was amended in the Seanad.  It is important that changes are made at local level to allow access to information.  Local authorities are run by county or city managers and his or her officials.  We had an extraordinary situation recently where a councillor had to sue a county manager to get access to records.  Many managers are willing to co-operate with elected representatives. Local authorities are playing an increasingly important role in the day to day lives of our citizens. There is no reason a culture of secrecy should prevail, so it is vital to replace it with openness.</P>
    <P>Many people would like to know the extent to which &ldquo;section fours&rdquo; are still being passed by local authorities.  Section fours cause political alarm bells in many local authorities because they override a planner's decision on a particular planning application.  I am concerned that some local authorities have an appetite for section four motions.  Many citizens look forward to the reform of local authorities, particularly in relation to the planning process.  There is widespread concern about undue influence being placed on elected representatives in relation to planning decisions.  It will be good for democracy if our citizens feel the planning process is divorced from political interference.</P>
    <P>Section 19 does not deal with the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  Subsection (2) states that access cannot be granted if the record relates to statements made at a meeting of the Government. I do not expect the Minister to mention the Supreme Court decision in the Attorney General <i>v.</i> Hamilton case.  Members of this Government and of the Minister of State's party were among the most vociferous critics of that decision and the most vigorous proponents for a referendum to change it.  It is ironic that this Bill proposes to further consolidate the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions.  Unless we deal with this issue and repeal the Official Secrets Act, we will have some way to go before we achieve open government to which this Bill aspires.</P>
    <P>If the spirit of this legislation was translated into the replies to parliamentary questions, we would have a reformed democracy.  The classic reply to parliamentary questions is that &ldquo;the information sought is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources&rdquo;.  Such a reply hides a multitude, is crooked in its intent and is used to mislead this House when Deputies legitimately seek information <Col N="277" /> on behalf of the people.  This Government has a long way to go to match its stated commitment to openness with the ethos of this Bill and parliamentary procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation and management of the public service is the biggest business in the State.  General Government expenditure in the 1997 budget is equivalent to about 38 per cent of gross national product.  There are approximately 219,000 public servants with a pay and pensions bill per annum of about £4.7 billion.  Given the scale of this business there are bound to be difficulties in managing it.  One of these is undoubtedly a problem of image.  The civil and public services have made a major contribution to the growth and development of the Irish economy and society over many years.  However, there may be an erroneous perception that the Civil Service is managed by faceless bureaucrats detached from the real world of commerce.  Changing this perception for the better means much more than a new image.  It is about creating more efficient and effective public services and delivering that message home to the general public.  The time for this change is now.</P>
      <P>There is a need to build on the foundation provided by the Constitution and existing law to strengthen the positive features of public administration and to create a basis in statute for addressing the practical difficulties facing public service management.   Grounding the Government's programme for change and development in the public service in a series of substantial pieces of legislation sends a very clear signal to civil servants, politicians, and, most importantly, the general public that public service reform is a reality which is happening under this Government.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme of legislation to reform, open up and streamline the day-to-day management of the public service is a key element of the strategic management initiative. While each individual piece of legislation is important in its own right, taken together the legislative programme forms a mosaic of reform and renewal.  The long-term objective of this legislative reform is to transform the administration of central Government and deliver better quality and more efficient and effective public services to the citizen.  Public service must be just that &mdash; a quality service to the customer, the public. In essence, the legislative programme of renewing the machinery of Government represents a new deal for citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The citizen's right to have access to information is fundamental to this process of administrative change and development.  The Freedom of Information Bill will empower individual citizens by giving them a legal entitlement to have access to official information kept on them by the State. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that members of the public may exercise this right to know to the greatest extent possible consistent <Col N="278" /> with the public interest and legitimate rights to privacy.  I will say more about the specifics of this in a moment.  The Freedom of Information Bill fits into a process of change and development which will involve the implementation of the most substantial programme of reforming legislation in a generation.</P>
    <P>A key element in this programme, the Public Service Management Bill, was published by the Government last Thursday, 6 March.  This major Bill will empower the Civil Service to take measures needed to transform fundamentally the administration of central Government.  Its fundamental objective is to provide a legal basis for the new management structure set out in Delivering Better Government.  This statutory foundation will allow for a new relationship between Ministers and the Civil Service and will make possible the modernisation of the machinery of Government.</P>
    <P>A further legislative initiative which dovetails with the Freedom of Information Bill is the legislation, which I have been directing through the Oireachtas, to empower committees of both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to compel witnesses to give evidence and to confer privilege when they do so.  The Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, will enhance the capacity of committees of the Oireachtas to act on behalf of the citizen in investigating matters of public concern.  The new law will give power to relevant committees to compel witnesses to give evidence or produce documents and to grant them privilege and immunity from legal action if they do so.  The Bill has passed through Committee Stage and Government amendments for Report Stage will be published soon.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill will increase the powers and extend the remit of the Ombudsman to cover a number of key areas. Essentially, administrative matters in non-commercial State-funded bodies, which receive 50 per cent or more of their funding from the Exchequer, including non-medical matters of voluntary hospitals, will be brought within his or her remit &mdash; there might be a female Ombudsman one day.  The Minister for Finance is currently finalising specific proposals to put to Government on these changes.  It is also envisaged that an administrative procedures Bill will further empower the general public by introducing a code of practice or quality service statement which will guarantee stated levels and quality of service when dealing with the State administration.</P>
    <P>Freedom of information is at the heart of the deepening of our democracy.  By providing the citizen with a statutory right of access to official information the law will fundamentally change the nature of the relationship between the citizen and the State.  It will alter the balance of power between institutions of the State and individuals to give greater advantage to the citizen.  A new <Col N="279" /> approach of openness and a culture of accessibility to official information will be generated. Information is power.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the institutions of the State maintained the principle of confidentiality in relation to the business of Government.  Indeed, until 1972, the State successfully maintained the position that Ministers could not be compelled by court order to produce official documents for inspection.  Even today, costly, formal and time-consuming legal processes are required to access some forms of official information.  This will change.</P>
    <P>Experience in other countries has demonstrated the power of freedom of information legislation to change these matters for the better. I believe that a careful reading of the Bill before this House will show the following key changes. There will now be a statutory right to official information based on a presumption of openness. Necessary exemptions will be subject to an overall public interest test.  A public register of information and guidelines to be used in decision making by Government bodies will come into play. There will be a legal obligation on officials to help citizens requesting information to identify and find what they need to know.  There will be an onus on those who hold information to justify any refusal to disclose such information.  There will be a powerful independent appeals system to resolve disputes between citizens and public bodies promptly and without undue expense.</P>
    <P>While the legal changes brought about by freedom of information legislation are important for us in this House to consider, it will be in more practical ways that the individual citizen will see the benefits of this Bill.  Greater transparency in policy making will generate more confidence in the system of governance as a whole.  Client relationships with Government bodies will improve as individuals gain the reassurance of having access to records &mdash; people will know that their cases are dealt with fairly and impartially. An administrative culture which promotes openness rather than unnecessary secrecy will develop across the public services.  Openness will itself encourage quality &mdash; our public services will become more efficient and effective.  Freedom of information legislation will ensure that the highest standards are maintained in Government agencies in relation to accuracy and objective record keeping.  The citizen will be made central to the democratic process because the citizen will, in effect, own the official information on his or her particular case which the public services possess.</P>
    <P>Secrecy and centralisation of information &mdash; and, therefore, of power &mdash; is a major issue which all mature democracies must address. Lack of information clearly places a barrier to the public seeking to understand and participate in the democratic process. The Freedom of Information Bill will change this profoundly.  Decision makers, both <Col N="280" /> Ministers and officials, will now have to demonstrate greater transparency in policy making and a more comprehensive process of debate and consultation. Freedom of information will open doors to the ordinary citizen leading to a deeper and richer democratic society.  When the Bill is passed there will be an intensive process of training in the public service to deal with the standards and quality of service required to provide the citizen with the guarantees set out in the Bill.  The public will be made aware of their rights and entitlements to information.</P>
    <P>When the Act comes into effect one year after its passing, the Minister for Finance will make regulations regarding its practical application.  He, in consultation with other Ministers, will decide when certain sections of it will come into force. He will also draw up and publish guidelines on access and compliance which public bodies will have to follow.  The process of adjusting to freedom of information will require a cultural change in the public services so that the citizen, the customer, is always right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle.  I listened carefully to what Deputy O'Donnell said and I agree with her.  There is no move on the question of Cabinet confidentiality, which was specifically promised in the programme, A Government of Renewal, and is enshrined in section 19 of this Bill.  Despite various Government promises, including one in the programme for Government to abolish the Officials Secrets Act, it remains firmly in place.  I say that despite a rather vacuous section 45 which, whatever it does &mdash; and that is a matter for debate &mdash; it does not go any distance towards replacing the Officials Secrets Act.</P>
      <P>The administration of this State has been infected by a culture of secrecy since the foundation of the State in 1922.  That should not greatly surprise anyone because the system we inherited was that operated by the Civil Service of the British Empire, which was known to be the most secretive system of administration in the civilised world.  That culture of secrecy infected and permeated our public administration virtually to date.  In 1993 the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government promised a fundamental assault on secrecy and wide-ranging legislation to eradicate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill in principle, and accept it is an immeasurable improvement on the heads of the Bill discussed almost two years ago by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and concede it was improved somewhat by the debate during its passage through the Seanad, as the culmination of four years of effort to put freedom of information legislation on the Statute Book, it is a grave disappointment.  It is a minimalist, carefully hedged in Bill which, if interpreted in a certain way will make very little practical difference to the administration of this country.  The long list of exemptions and cop-out clauses are so vague and imprecise that they can <Col N="281" /> be interpreted as the bureaucracy wishes.  This effort will hardly qualify the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, for a place of pride in the open Government hall of fame.</P>
    <P>Some parts of the Bill are defective in legal terms and I will deal with them at length on Committee Stage.  Some parts of it do not seem to have any legal meaning and a number of its provisions are arguably unconstitutional.  The main difficulty is that section 6, which allows citizens access to information in the possession of the bureaucracy, is so hedged in by vague and widely drawn restrictions that if interpreted in a certain way it would be rendered nugatory and ineffective.  There is nothing in our experience in dealing with the bureaucracy, for which I have every respect, which suggests there will be a sea change in attitude simply because this legislation has been put on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains a number of curious provisions. One of its subsections prohibits an individual who is a member of staff of a public body from gaining access to a personnel record that is more than three years old.  On the other hand it permits such access where information is being used in a manner or for a purpose which affects, or will or may adversely affect the interest of the person.  In the real world requests for such information will hardly ever originate from idle curiosity.  Almost invariably a request will be made because the person in question wants to check what may be on his or her file that may adversely affect his or her chances of promotion or whatever.  That provision is superfluous; it will give rise to needless legal difficulties and it should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 8(4) states that in deciding whether to grant or refuse a request the decision maker must not take into account &ldquo;any reason the requester gives for the request&rdquo;.  That seems to conflict directly with section 10(1)(e) which states that a head of a Department may refuse a request where in his opinion it is frivolous or vexatious. By definition section 10(1) (e) involves the evaluation of the quality of the reasons adduced by the applicant.  Section 8(4) conflicts with section 10(1)(e).  It will give hostages to fortunes, will give rise to needless legal difficulties and it should be deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 10(1)(c) is a curious provision in freedom of information legislation.  It means that administrative inconvenience will be a good reason for refusing to give the information requested.  If the head of the Department or a person to whom a request for information is addressed says no to it on the basis it would cause too much difficulty to provide it, he or she is legitimately entitled to refuse to grant it.  We realise there are certain cases where it might be extremely difficult because of cost and the time involved to procure information but as this exemption is drafted, it enables the head of a Department to say to the information commissioner when the matter is appealed that the reason he or she refused to grant the information <Col N="282" /> was because the staff were engaged in A, B or C and the request would have involved so many additional man hours and would have disrupted the programme of work.  While it may be necessary to insert a clause approximating to that to provide for cases where it is genuinely too difficult to procure the information, that should be more clearly specified than it is in section 10(1)(c), which allows the head of a Department to advance the spurious reason we hear day in day out in the Dáil for not granting information, that it will take too long to compile the requested figures and it is too difficult to procure the information.</P>
    <P>Part of section 18 is unconstitutional.  It allows two bodies, the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission to refuse to give reasons for their failure to appoint someone to a job.  Why are those two bodies singled out? Why are other public bodies not mentioned? Why is there that invidious and arbitrary discrimination between those two public bodies and every other public body?  In my experience, the bodies to whom such requests will be addressed are exempt.  It is arbitrary to have one rule for two bodies in the public sector and a different rule for all others as it could be challenged on constitutional grounds on the basis of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Section 19 enshrines and entrenches the principle of Cabinet confidentiality as enunciated in the Hamilton case.  Despite vociferous criticism by members of the Labour Party and repeated promises, one of which was stated in the programme for Government, to sweep away that doctrine or substantially water it down, it remains firmly in place.  I wish to put specific points regarding section 19 to the Minister of State, which I hope she will address.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, section 19 provides that matters before Government, for example, Government memoranda, <i>aide memoires</i>, written advice to Ministers, etc., will be released only when the decision to which they relate has been made public.  Alternatively, such documents will be released when more than five years have elapsed after the relevant Government decision was made.  There will not be too many requests for those documents.  However, in cases where requests are made public in the immediate aftermath of a new Government, such documents can be released only if they contain &ldquo;factual information&rdquo;. This is excessively restrictive.  Surely documents which contain analysis, interpretation or evaluation of purely factual material should also be accessible.  In addition, there is no valid reason that projections based on factual information should not be accessible.  The same applies to expert advice.  There is no valid reason that documents incorporating both types of material &mdash; purely factual material and information relating to its interpretation, evaluation, etc. &mdash; should not be released, at least in edited form.</P>
    <P>Under the heads of the Bill originally put forward by the Minister of State to the Select Committee <Col N="283" /> on Legislation and Security, there was what was known as the &ldquo;whistleblower's charter&rdquo;, which attempted to exempt public servants from legal liability for releasing information in certain types of cases.  This provision was hopelessly restrictive and has been wisely removed and replaced by section 45.  However, this is not the appropriate place to enter into detail on the exact provisions of that curious section.  Any attempt to provide a whistleblower's charter should be very clear and specific in its intent.  It should also communicate to public servants the circumstances in which they would be justified in releasing information. The opposite is the case in section 45 which is deliberately vague.  I believe the reasoning behind this is to allow the threat of prosecution to continue to hang like the sword of Damocles over the heads of unfortunate potential wrongdoers.  That section must be substantially amended, otherwise it is mere window dressing aimed at giving the illusion that a whistleblower's charter which will have some worth and effect in practice will be introduced.</P>
    <P>As already stated, section 25 will substantially diminish the value of this legislation.  In essence it provides that if a Minister issues a certificate to the effect that certain information is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, such information cannot be disclosed.  A certificate will remain in effect for two years after which the Minister has total discretion to renew it.  Apparently, the Minister is not obliged to account to anyone for the decision to either issue such a certificate or renew it.  He or she can merely do so, under the legislation as it now stands, on the prompting of the head of a Department.  A certificate can be issued in respect of all matters referred to in sections 23 and 24.</P>
    <P>No one could deny that sections 23 and 24 contain a wide range of potential candidates for certificates. For example, section 23 refers to anything which may prejudice or impair the prevention, detection or investigation of offences; the enforcement of, compliance with or administration of any law; lawful methods, systems, plans or procedures for ensuring the safety of the public; the fairness of criminal proceedings in a court; security of penal institutions, etc.  Under subsection (3) it is stated that subsection (1) does not apply to a record if it &ldquo;discloses that an investigation for the purpose of the enforcement of any law, or anything done in the course of such an investigation....is not authorised by law or contravenes any law&rdquo;.  Section 24 deals with matters relating to the security, defence and international relations of the State, matters relating to Northern Ireland information that passed through intelligence channels, communications between Ministers and diplomatic personages, etc.</P>
    <P>These matters are wide-ranging and broadly defined.  There is no provision to appeal a Minister's decision.  An aggrieved party can challenge the decision to issue a certificate in the High Court on a point of law but this is a very limited form of appeal.  The unfortunate applicant has <Col N="284" /> very little chance of success in making such an appeal.  The information Commissioner has no power to review a decision of a Minister to black out information by the issuing of a certificate. However, for the purposes of optics, a review procedure will be put in place whereby the Cabinet can review a Minister's decision to issue a certificate. It does not take much imagination to assess the likely effectiveness and success of such reviews.  It is not clear who will initiate a review, how it will be initiated, what procedures will be followed or whether written representations can be submitted.  The Bill merely makes provision for a review by a Minister's colleagues for his or her decision to black out certain information at the prompting of a head of a Department who is, presumably, responsible to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The general proposed appeals procedure in the legislation is fatally flawed.  In the first instance, an appeal must be made to the public body which originally refused the request for information.  If that body persists in its refusal, a citizen can appeal to the Information Commissioner.  I am not suggesting that the commissioner will not be independent in the exercise of his or her duties but the office will be filled by a civil servant appointed by the Government.  Apparently, the Information Commissioner has wide powers to hear appeals, summon witnesses, etc.  It is not clear whether he or she is obliged to state the reasons for his or her decision.  Will the Minister of State provide clarification on this matter?</P>
    <P>One would naturally expect that a citizen should have the right to appeal the decision of the Information Commissioner to the courts. Unfortunately that is not the case.  If the commissioner upholds the decision to refuse access to information, a citizen can only challenge that decision in the High Court on a point of law. Effectively, this means that, in 99 per cent of cases, the courts are precluded from overruling the decision to refuse information and may do so only in exceptional cases where the Information Commissioner has erred in law.  On the basis of the facts, a High Court judge may be of the opinion that the information requested should be released but that will not matter.  The applicant will be obliged to convince the court that the commissioner's decision was biased or totally contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The proposal to confine a citizen's right of appeal to the courts except on a point of law is an effective denial of access to the courts.  It is almost inconceivable that freedom of information legislation should specifically prevent the courts from considering a right to refuse information on its merits.</P>
    <P>There are various other provisions scattered throughout the Bill which allow the bureaucracy to limit and deny access to information.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these escape clauses before Committee Stage.  There are sufficient exemptions and escape clauses which are vague and imprecise enough to enable the legislation to be rendered ineffective.  A much more radical <Col N="285" /> approach is needed, otherwise there is a grave danger that, despite this minimalist attempt, secrecy and obfuscation will continue to flourish. Whose interests will be served by that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am glad this Bill has been improved somewhat in its progress through Committee Stage in the Seanad, its provisions remain deeply flawed and thoroughly inadequate.  On careful examination, which I strongly recommend to citizens and the media alike, it turns out to be little more than a window-dressing exercise in freedom of information.  Without doubt it is a cleverly, carefully drafted Bill creating the impression of greater freedom of information while advancing that cause in only the slightest degree.  It is a thin pretence at action designed to camouflage the Government's internal confusion and inability to agree on anything of substance or any resolute plan of action.  Its timing was no accident.  Along with its fiasco of proposed reform of the courts, on which the Government was obliged to do a U-turn within a matter of weeks, this Bill was rushed into the public arena in a desperate attempt to distract attention from the Lowry affair.  Despite all the bluster and hype which surrounded its introduction, it is little more than a damp squib, another fine example of the mountain being in labour and bringing forth a mouse.</P>
      <P>The combination of the many exceptions in this Bill, coupled with the fact that ministerial decisions or those taken by heads of public bodies under sections 8 and 10 cannot be overturned by the Information Commissioner, means the public will have access only to such information as those heads permit and no more.  In other words, the Minister will retain control over what information will be made available.</P>
      <P>On the coming into office of this Government the Taoiseach, in a grandiose gesture in this House, declared he would conduct Government business as though behind a pane of glass.  What an empty promise that was since no Government in my time has equalled the secretivenes of this one.  This Government appears to be obsessed with endeavouring to curtain over every aspect of its activities.  Far from providing openness in its activities, it has established a reputation for secrecy that owes more to the former political traditions of Eastern Europe than to modern Ireland.  Its current proposals are grossly inadequate and fail totally to deliver on its promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill's main failures fall under seven headings, the first being its failure to repeal the Official Secrets Act, 1963.  Yet the Taoiseach remains silent on that issue day after day.  It is obvious he wants to put its repeal in abeyance so that it cannot influence this Bill, yet its repeal is essential, since it constitutes the bulwark of the secrecy culture.  Without its abolition that culture will continue.  That Act must be signed by all civil servants, committing them to obeying its provisions to the letter at pain of criminal prosecution and dismissal.  It requires them to regard <Col N="286" /> everything as secret unless the Minister directs otherwise.  In practice, this places extraordinary power and control in the hands of the Secretary of the Department, leading to management through fear and the inhibition of progressive, pro-active staff.  The presumption that everything is required to be secret unless proved to the contrary is the single greatest obstacle to openness under this Government.</P>
    <P>We listened to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Avril Doyle, talk about management and development of the public service, pointing out that it is time for change in public administration, referring to a whole series of new public service management strategies to be announced in the Bill to be introduced shortly.  None of that can take place unless the Official Secrets Act, 1963, belonging to another age, is repealed.  Its provisions are totally inconsistent with the very concept of freedom of information.  The simultaneous maintenance of that Act and the introduction of a freedom of information culture is complete nonsense.  There is general agreement, in official reports, academic commentaries and in the report of the review of the Official Secrets Act, 1963, just published, that it has outlived its usefulness and is inconsistent with the right to freedom of expression enshrined in the Constitution and with the important principles of good Government, about which the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, spoke.  It is important that staff be given the opportunity to flourish and develop within the public service, which cannot happen as long as the Official Secrets Act remains on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>How many bodies does the Government need to persuade it that the Official Secrets Act, 1963 must be abolished?  Its clinging to that relic of the past reveals everything about this Government's real attitude to freedom of information.  If the Official Secrets Act, 1963 is not repealed civil servants will remain obliged, on pain of prosecution, to keep everything secret unless otherwise specifically directed.  How can anybody claim that the secrecy culture can be meaningfully reduced much less abolished while the provisions of the Official Secrets Act continue to cast the shadow of prosecution over every civil servant from the highest to the lowest?</P>
    <P>The Government must explain to Members of this House why it proposes to retain the Official Secrets Act, 1963 while continuing the charade of a Freedom of Information Bill, a question it has consistently refused to answer and ducked on every occasion since the publication of this Bill. This Bill preserves the culture of secrecy.  It does not reverse the presumption of secrecy, as it states and as its proposers claim, which is an attempt to mislead.  The Bill does not reverse that presumption of secrecy.  It can be taken to be reversed only when the onus of proof is placed on the official side to satisfy the Information Commissioner that it is in the national interest that the information in question should remain confidential, whereas this Bill provides that it will <Col N="287" /> be the citizen who will have to apply to the Information Commissioner.  This means that, whenever a citizen cannot apply or, for whatever reason, is afraid to apply, the information remains secret.  Therefore, the presumption of secrecy is not overturned.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that, whenever a person is refused information by a public body, he or she will have a right of appeal to the Information Commissioner.  That procedure is the wrong way round.  If the presumption of secrecy is to be removed, it is the official body, not the applicant, who should have to appeal to the Information Commissioner.</P>
    <P>This Bill carefully preserves the secrecy culture on which this Government thrives while trying to create the impression it is doing the opposite.  In practice, there will be no effective appeal since this Bill fails to provide any effective appeal to the information Commissioner on a decision taken personally by a head of a public body to refuse to disclose the information in question.</P>
    <P>Section 34, in which there is a glaring deficiency, sets out the jurisdiction of the information commissioner from which decisions under section 8 are omitted.  This extraordinary omission leaves immense power to refuse information in the hands of a public body.  It is inconsistent with any real freedom of information regime.  The information applies to information held by some 120 public bodies.  The exemptions are contained in sections 19 to 32 and range from law enforcement, public safety, security and defence to the extraordinarily wide exemptions provided for in sections 20 and 21 which apply to all the public bodies concerned.  These sections taken together enable the head of any one of the 120 public bodies to refuse to disclose any information where the record sought contains information relating to &ldquo;the deliberative processes&rdquo; or the functions of management &ldquo;of the public body concerned&rdquo; and where the head of that public body is of the opinion that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest.  Notwithstanding the exceptions to this general provision in section 20(2), these wide-ranging exemptions are designed to prevent the public from having access to the information which forms the real basis for decision-making in the public service and, as such, are to be condemned.</P>
    <P>What concerns me even more are the procedural deficiencies in enforcing the right to information which, when taken together, could result in the purpose of the Bill being frustrated by the head of any one of the 120 public bodies. This arises from the failure to provide an effective appeal to the information commissioner from a decision taken by a head of a public body under section 8.  The practical result of the omission in section 34 is that it is open to every head of the 120 bodies to select the information they wish to keep undisclosed and to reserve to themselves the decision on any request from the public for disclosure. The decision to refuse disclosure under <Col N="288" /> section 8 could not then be reviewed or overturned by the information commissioner.</P>
    <P>The extent of the powers of the information commissioner in relation to a decision taken by a head of a public body under section 8, is to direct under section 35 a full or better statement of the reasons for a refusal where he is of the opinion that the statement of reasons for refusal is inadequate or where the public interest has been relied on as a ground for refusal.  In the absence of a power to review or overturn the decision of the head of the public body concerned, the remedy of a better statement of the reasons for refusal is of little or no value and contributes nothing to openness.</P>
    <P>Whether the omission of these decisions from the review of the information commissioner is a genuine mistake or a calculated attempt to deceive the public about the true nature and extent of information provided by the Bill or an effort by the old order to preserve itself is a matter for speculation.  Since the publication of the Bill I have warned repeatedly about this anomaly. I have heard much bluster and waffle from Ministers and advisers but no satisfactory answer.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the suppression of information where the relevant Minister considers it is in the national interest.  However, the Bill does not define the national interest.  It is left to the relevant Minister to decide that.  The decision will not be reviewable by the information commissioner or by any other independent body.  The Bill, therefore, gives the green light to any Minister to suppress information because he or she claims it is in the national interest.  This provision in section 25 makes a nonsense of the entire concept of freedom of information.  It is freedom of information unless the Government thinks you should not know.  The failure to define the national interest calls into question the genuine commitment of the Government to freedom of information.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not attempt to define official information despite the claim that its purpose is to provide a right of access to official information. This omission is extraordinary and calls into question the Government's commitment to real freedom of information.</P>
    <P>Section 25 provides that the Minister may issue secrecy certificates preventing the release of information that he or she thinks should remain hidden.  The information commissioner will have no power to review this decision.  The only review that will take place will be by the Minister's colleagues. In the hands of a Government as obsessed with secrecy as this one, we could expect secrecy certificates to be issued like confetti were the Bill to become law.  It is clear the idea behind the Bill is to create the illusion of freedom of information while retaining the ability to hide anything it wishes.  Had this secretive Government the opportunity to work under its own proposed freedom of information regime it could be expected to maintain its iron curtain of secrecy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> Section 28 provides that the Minister may, by regulations, provide for the release of personal data.  This is not a satisfactory balance of individual rights and national interests.  The circumstances in which such personal data can be released should be set out to ensure personal confidentiality is protected.  It is extraordinary that the Bill, which is scrupulous about protecting the Minister's right to hide public information, is extremely careless about protecting the individual citizen and his or her right to the protection of personal data.  The Bill does not provide for a new era of openness.  The Government came to office promising a new era of openness, transparency and accountability.  It has established a reputation for being more secretive than any of its recent predecessors.  Its proposals, as it prepares to leave office, are grossly inadequate and fail to deliver on its promises.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the ministerial power to prevent the release of any information it wants kept secret without independent scrutiny.  Its proposal is inconsistent with the freedom of information regime.  In the hands of the Government, whose commitment to openness, transparency and accountability is utterly and clearly discredited, it is a charter for secrecy.  The combination of the many exceptions in the Bill, together with the fact that the decisions of a Minister or other head of a public body, under sections 8 and 10, cannot be overturned by the information commissioner, means that the public will only have access to such information as these heads permit and no more.  In other words the Minister will retain control over what information will be made available.</P>
    <P>When enacted, the Freedom of Information Bill will be the conclusion of many years campaigning for such a new regime and, if flawed, it will be a long time before the flaws are rectified. Therefore it demands the most careful and detailed scrutiny.  Its panic striken presentation as a diversionary tactic during the Lowry affair &mdash; I am sure the Minister is not happy with that event or the attempt to distract from the Bill &mdash; lost much of its publicity on that day.  It is a deplorable and cynical breach of faith for those who campaigned for the Bill for so long.  The many wild and groundless claims of Government spokespersons cannot be relied on.  All citizens and the media would be well advised to closely examine the Bill.</P>
    <P>The freedom of information structure which will hold sway for the foreseeable future lies before us in the Bill.  It does not meet with the clear political consensus in favour of freedom of information for all and it will be a great disappointment to many people that it fails to deliver on the promises of openness and transparency.  It is important legislation, especially when taken in conjunction with the developments towards a modern, outgoing, active public service which is not constrained by an all-embracing Official Secrets Act and clearly has the ability to serve this country in a much better and more open way, <Col N="290" /> without fear of its citizens' participation.  I ask the Minister to look carefully at the Bill on Committee Stage and to see whether it is possible to repeal the Official Secrets Act either in parallel or in conjunction with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As my colleagues Deputy Woods and Deputy McDaid said, there is a definite lack of openness, transparency and accountability in this Government.  They came into power with a great fanfare but, in this Bill as on so many other occasions, the pane of glass has been removed and openness has flown out the window. The presumptions in this Bill should be in favour of rather than against disclosure and the onus should be on public authorities to prove their case, rather than the other way around, as a citizen may not have the wherewithal to seek legal representation, etc. for an appeal.  That is another step away from openness.</P>
      <P>This Government has produced the Hogan, Coveney and Lowry affairs as well as other affairs outside this House which I will not mention.  The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, portrayed himself as Steve Silvermint, the cool clean hero.  None of us realised what a murky past he had until it emerged subsequently.  It was rich for someone like him to clean up people on this side of the House when he knew what he would have to face in the future.</P>
      <P>By their nature, civil servants are secretive people, local and public authorities are secretive bodies, and they want to retain as much of this secrecy as possible.  It has been a bugbear of mine that the executives of local authorities tend to keep as much information from the members as possible.  Whether one loves or loathes them, they represent and are accountable to the people but faceless civil servants, local authorities and health boards are not.  There must be more transparency in that area also.  Those bodies have restrained the Minister from going as far as she would have liked.  It is undoubtedly a watered-down version of what we expected and the veil of secrecy remains.  One should also note that we have some excellent civil servants and county managers but this is a culture shock for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Freedom of Information Bill has come through the process I have outlined but at the end of this process we do not necessarily see the passion which the Minister and her officials feel about this topic, we see a classic compromise.  I do not blame the Minister or her officials but there is a series of mandarins and officials who must be dealt with in this legislative process.  The Bill promises a great deal but it is in danger of delivering much less.  It is somewhat confused and may be too little, too late.  It is not the radical Bill which I expected and which had been promised in many press briefings over the last few years. Many aspects are conservative and constrained. However, every Bill has a positive side and it does give a good foundation to put much-needed administrative reform on the Statute Book.  If the <Col N="291" /> Minister is interested and willing to listen to what is said in this House, real administrative reform can be put in place, which will benefit Irish people and politics in the long run.</P>
    <P>As our spokesperson, Deputy McDaid, said the central premise of the Fianna Fáil position is the repeal of the Official Secrets Act because unless and until that is done there will be no legal basis for the Minister's claim that the presumption on official information is for disclosure.  The Minister probably agrees with me that this Act should be consigned to the shredder.  It is ludicrous legislation which presumes everything is secret.  It is unworkable because it is breached every day.  It is nonsense to keep it on the Statute Book.  I am pleased there is a commitment to its reform.  I am not sure it will be easy to write off but it must be examined in the future.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is committed to real openness in the administrative system.  We will assist the passage of the Bill and will seek its speedy enactment. Moreover, when it is enacted we will seek to ensure its provisions are brought into immediate effect in all areas of public administration. However, this party's co-operation in that regard will not be given freely.  We should show more courage than the Bill does in a number of areas, because we are not encumbered by the consideration which the Minister and her Department must bring to the legislative process.  We should recognise that only good can come from allowing the light of public scrutiny to fall on other areas of public administration.  It illuminates good practices and decision and people can be assured they receive the type of administration we all want and where bad administrative practices, poor decision making or individual injustice are illuminated, corrective measures can be taken.  In both cases people are the real beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>There must be a period of education to inform people that they can go into public service bodies to see that public life is not operated on the basis of nudges and winks, who you know rather than what you know, family connections, etc., but on the merits of a case.  I agree that those provisions are necessary but simplicity would be better than complexity, which leads to a loss of understanding. I fear the public will see these complexities as exclusive rather than inclusive.  The purpose of the Bill is to protect citizens' rights but its complexity could frustrate that aim.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said a purpose of the Bill was to make freedom of information a right.  If a citizen has a right, he or she should not have to cite the Act conferring it.  There should be an automatic assumption that when the Bill is enacted, the right to freedom of information applies to everybody and that every public servant will vindicate that right and will be apprised of his or her legal responsibilities.  Our administrative code does not impose legal responsibility on individual civil servants but we must educate public servants that as soon as a person asks a question he or she has a right to information <Col N="292" /> which should flow freely and without impediment.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we know something is wrong but we do not know what question to ask.  We have had examples of this in the House.  Anything that constrains the flow of information could frustrate the purpose of the legislation.</P>

      <P>Civil servants are often slow to impart knowledge.  Recently a constitute of mine went into the free legal aid office in Waterford to ask for assistance in relation to a criminal case. Such offices do not provide assistance in such a matter and he should have gone to the Circuit Court or District Court.  However, the staff in the office knew that but did not impart this information to him.  I subsequently put down a question on this issue to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and he replied that all staff in free legal aid offices have been told to provide whatever information is necessary in such instances. This man did not get the right information because he did not ask the right question.  I hope this problem will be tackled by the Government to ensure that civil servants will give out the information required regardless of whether the right question is asked, although this may be a culture shock for some people.</P>
      <P>There is a fear that the legislation will be so complex that there will be a 12 months' delay between the date it becomes law and the date it becomes operable.  I accept that in Departments and offices with major administrative decision making processes, such as the Departments of Social Welfare and Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Revenue Commissioners, time will be required to put the necessary systems in place. However, the public service has had two years to work on the concept of freedom of information and is aware of the commitment of the Government, its predecessor and the Houses of the Oireachtas on this issue.  Public administrators have had ample time to make preparations.</P>
      <P>The Bill will not be implemented immediately in respect of local authorities and health boards, which is a fundamental error.  I am reminded of an incident I read about in the newspaper recently where a county councillor in Wicklow took legal action against his county manager in the High Court to get information.  Such information should be available to county councillors and public representatives.  We are living in the dark ages with some of our current practices. County councillors and the general public have a right of access to information from local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no compelling argument for not applying the full rigour of this legislation to local authorities, <Col N="293" /> county councils, urban councils, corporations, town commissioners and vocational education committees at the outset.  In recent years there has been an unacceptable propensity within the managerial and executive ranks of councils to deny access of information to the public and councillors.  The latter cannot fulfil their democratic responsibilities if they do not have access to the information they require.  We must ensure access to information at least where public representatives are concerned.  We have allowed the openness of local government to be eroded. Members are continually kept in the dark when trying to get information from management.  The democratic process would benefit if the Minister of State included local authorities from day one.</P>
    <P>The full rigours of the law should also apply to health boards.  There is far too much secrecy about the way the health service is administered and irreparable damage has been done.  I am sure the Minister, like myself, receives many representations from people unhappy with the way they or a relative have been treated in the administration of the health system.  There is supposed to be a charter of patients' rights but this does not work because there is no culture of openness in health administration.  From the day people start attending medical college they seem to be imbued with a degree of arrogance.  There is no tradition of openness &mdash; with notable exceptions &mdash; in that profession or in the health service.</P>
    <P>When the Ombudsman legislation was introduced, the health authorities were excluded. When we finally included them in the Ombudsman's remit we excluded clinical judgment.  Some years ago a person who had been involved in a traffic accident was diagnosed by the staff in a hospital with which I am well acquainted as having a broken leg and put into traction for a certain period. However, it was only before he was discharged that they discovered his other leg was also broken.  I am not suggesting professionals in the medical field should be second-guessed but clinical judgment is frequently based on guess-work. The term &ldquo;clinical judgment&rdquo; is a fancy word for guess-work as in some cases medical professionals do not know what is wrong with a patient. While we must accept this, if we exclude all those in medical administration from the provisions of the Bill, the Ombudsman Act and other reforming legislation we will do people an injustice. I would like health boards to be included from day one and do not believe the sky will fall in if we include them.</P>
    <P>There is no reason State sponsored bodies should not also be included from day one as they, particularly non-commercial ones, are in a privileged position, are budget driven and, to a large extent, set their own targets.  They are not subject to scrutiny by the Minister, questioning by the Houses of the Oireachtas on daily executive activities or to Adjournment debates.  We have created a huge number of non-commercial State sponsored bodies because we want to exclude <Col N="294" /> areas of public administration from the constraints of ministerial responsibility.  I accept that, however, we have not put in place a system whereby the public can oversee the activities of these bodies.  For example, we excluded them from the overseeing activities of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies &mdash; this was a crazy decision by the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and from the operations of the Ombudsman.  We are effectively excluding them from the operation of this Bill for three years.  No one could argue in favour of this proposal.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate with interest, I wonder where the ethos of secrecy in the public service and many other bodies comes from.  Some people tend to blame the Official Secrets Act, 1963, but this may only have been adopted as a cover under which to operate.  I strongly suspect this ethos developed long before the enactment of this Act and may have been developed for good reasons in some instances.  However, we are not disposed in this debate to considering good reasons for the development of this practice in the public service and there is general agreement that it must be eliminated.</P>
      <P>The Official Secrets Act has come under sustained attack in recent years, with one Dáil committee strongly recommending its repeal.  I wonder if more progress could have been made in this area under the cover of this legislation.  It probably would have been very difficult to introduce a Bill which achieved the aims of this legislation and also repealed the Official Secrets Act. However, it would be a great pity if we were to conclude this is as far as the Oireachtas can go in terms of repealing that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The provisions governing the confidential status of documents in the 1963 Act were very broad.  I strongly suspect that these provisions were interpreted to the widest extent possible in many cases.  This is the background against which the Minister introduced this Bill.  I have some doubts about whether the Bill will achieve what it sets out to do but it is required in general terms and I support it.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's attempts to introduce innovative legislation.  For example, she attempted to ensure ethics in public office and openness and transparency in the workings of Government, etc.  She will probably say I am not being very objective but her attempts may not, of necessity, have been very successful.  While I support her campaign, I am worried it is going nowhere and troops are rallying in opposition to it.  I do not see any of them on the Government benches but some interests are opposed to the direction in which the Minister is heading.  There is a temptation to believe we are deluding the public and engaging in a PR exercise which is not likely to go anywhere.</P>
    <P>The way in which parliamentary questions are dealt with was referred to.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to a frequent reply she receives, that the information is not readily available and it would cost too much to procure it.  The information requested may be regarded by the Department as trivial but it is extremely important to Deputies in following up matters.  In some cases questions are ruled out of order because the Minister is not regarded as being responsible for the matters raised.  This almost always applies in the case of commercial semi-State bodies whose operations in many instances impinge much more deeply and fundamentally on the State and the lives of citizens than the actions of the Government.  It would be unfortunate if Ministers were seen to be hiding behind a semi-State body and effectively ducking an issue of great public importance and removing the right of the public to democracy in the operation of the State.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions last year I raised the way in which the Government contract is awarded for the air and sea rescue service based in Shannon.  At that time one company was in possession of the contract, a new company from the UK was bidding for it and a third company based in Shannon was interested in securing it. One of the requirements for awarding the contract is that the equipment would have to be in place by 28 February last.  The Shannon based company knew it could not meet this requirement. It also knew that because there was only one supplier of the equipment in the world market the only company which could meet this requirement was the one in possession of the contract.</P>
    <P>The British company undertook to provide the equipment, slightly underbid the other two companies and secured the contract.  However, the equipment was not in place by 28 February.  This <Col N="296" /> has clear implications for the quality of the service provided by the air and sea rescue service and the way in which Government contracts are awarded.  No one can say the Department was not aware of this difficulty as Deputies, including me, had referred to it in the House.  This is an example of the refusal to accept certain information and the stubborn continuation of the wrong course of action.  Something similar happened in relation to the contract for the additional Government jet for the European Presidency.  Some of the same companies were involved.  Coincidentally, the same company was successful despite the fact that it did not meet the requirements as specified in the contract documents.</P>
    <P>A consequence of such procedures in the public service is people reach the inevitable conclusion that what used to be referred to as a golden circle by those in Government when in Opposition is still in operation.  The Bill will have to address that.  It will also have to establish for the citizen who is an interested observer or participant in the particular process that his or her case is being treated fairly and that the Government, Departments, semi-State bodies and local authorities operate above board and are open to scrutiny.  That is an enormous task and it is even more difficult in the context of the traditions which have built up.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the way this legislation might parallel the Data Protection Act, 1988 and the work of the Data Protection Commissioner.  I would not have known that existed were I not in receipt of correspondence from the aforementioned person to the effect that if I did not pay £20 or £50 and complete a form I would be in trouble.  Having made some inquiries, I discovered that legislation, even though it refers to personal data, only applies to material held on computer, not to manual files.  That is strong legislation which is almost nine years old.  It appears the commissioner is vigorously pursuing this area with some success.  The type of complaints made to the commissioner under the Act are interesting.  Many of them were in relation to Departments, semi-State agencies, health boards and county councils.</P>
    <P>Some of the terms in the 1988 Act do not mean what we would normally assume them to mean in every day conversation.  &ldquo;Data&rdquo; does not include material on manual file but only that on computer. &ldquo;Personal information&rdquo; does not mean what we would normally assume it to mean, it is something quite specific.  I wonder if there are terms used in this Bill that are slightly or perhaps radically different from what we would assume them to be.  The Minister might address that when replying.  The 1988 Act establishes similar rights for the citizen including the right of access, correction, deletion and complaint.  Those principles appear to be contained in this legislation.  I hope that is the case, particularly in view of the role of the Data Protection Commissioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> Reference was made to section 6(4), which was changed radically from that in the Bill as initiated to what is under consideration tonight.  I have examined it closely &mdash; I do not know what took place in the Seanad &mdash; but I wonder if the change achieves much.  Does it make the Bill stronger? The Minister was obviously satisfied it did in view of the fact that she tabled some of the amendments or, alternatively, accepted amendments. The section appears to be inherently weak and a little imprecise.</P>
    <P>Section 10, which in some respects is an extraordinary one, provides for refusal to grant a request on administrative grounds.  A wide list of grounds is given and perhaps the Minister might refer to that when replying.  It appears that virtually any grounds can be used by a head to whom a request has been made.  If the record concerned does not exist, that obviously would be reasonable grounds for refusing to grant the request, but subparagraph (a) which states &ldquo;cannot be found after all reasonable steps to ascertain its whereabouts have been taken&rdquo; is very broad.  Subparagraph (e) states: if &ldquo;the request is, in the opinion of the head, frivolous or vexatious&rdquo;. I have no doubt such requests will be made, and such an exclusion may be necessary, but I am sure some heads would welcome the opportunity to use the provisions of subparagraph (e) as an escape, despite the fact that their foremost consideration might be slightly or substantially different.</P>
    <P>One of the objectives we hope to achieve is that, under the ethos of the State, information would be more readily available as is the case in the EU in Brussels.  Information is couched in such language that it is almost impossible to interpret. It is written in English but the jargon makes it almost impossible to understand.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the citizen's right to have confidential information protected is not adequately covered in the Bill.  It appears to be covered in section 28, but I would like to be convinced that section is adequate to deal with what is required.  An enormous amount of sensitive information about individuals is held by health boards in particular but also by county councils and Departments.  If a TD's computer records are sufficiently sensitive to warrant the letters which emanate from the Data Protection Commissioner, the information held by some public bodies should be protected so that it would not go into the public domain or fall into the hands of somebody who did not have a right to it.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the huge administrative burden on county councils with which they are barely coping.  Section 10 might come into play in this regard.  I refer in particular to the planning sections of a number of councils which, because of the amount of building work, etc. taking place, are already drastically over-extended. That is one of the areas in which many queries arise, where the &ldquo;who you know&rdquo; comes into play and where some openness is needed.  It is also an area where the nature of the planning file is so <Col N="298" /> complicated that it is difficult for the individual with a genuine interest in it to wade through and extrapolate the information of interest to them. There is also a risk from a local authority point of view because unless it has sufficient staff to oversee the examination of the file by the interested citizen, documents might disappear or be taken in error.  That security risk may imply the provision of a greater level of staff to deal with the public's right to information.  The right to information in this area is fundamentally important if this type of Bill is to work.</P>
    <P>We should face up to the fact that if the Bill does work, many people will be disappointed. They want to believe there is some magic inner circle in the political system where various clandestine operations take place.  They are encouraged in that belief by what passes for debate in this House and the exchanges between Government and Opposition Members, regardless of who might be in either position.  People believe that to such an extent it may not be possible to change their minds but, if it were possible, it would cause them great disappointment because they take pleasure in thinking such hookery and crookery goes on.  Only those of us working in the grey area of politics realise how boring it is and that there is little factual basis for what is said about that area.</P>
    <P>Against that background, it will take a long time for this legislation to work sufficiently well for people to believe it is working.  There will be people who genuinely want access to information who will doubt whether it is adequately provided for under this Act or any other Acts that refer to information in one way or another.  If it fails to gain public confidence, or if it is found to contain provisions that make it impossible to get information, it will be a failure by being seen not to work.</P>
    <P>In the context of tonight's debate, one has to wonder how much Government commitment there is to this Bill.  The major party in Government sent in one speaker and the smallest party sent in none.  The Bill seems to have been presented as a time filler rather than as serious legislation.  The Government parties have failed to grasp the opportunity to create and support a level of openness in the operation of the public service and in the running of the State which is urgently needed.  It is a great pity that that has not been adverted to by more people and that there is not more support for this Bill.  It is strange that most of the support for the Bill is coming from the Opposition benches and that Opposition Deputies have taken the trouble to go through it to find out what the issues are and to call on their experience of dealing with people who have problems in this area to suggest amendments for the next Stage and also suggest to the Minister that there are areas which need further examination.</P>
    <P>In the course of channel-hopping, I happened to come across the broadcast of the debate in the Seanad when an eloquent Senator from Wicklow, Senator Roche, was making his contribution.  He <Col N="299" /> referred to the Wicklow case, to which a number of other Deputies have referred tonight, where an elected member of Wicklow County Council was unable to get fundamental information and was forced to go to court to get it.  It is extraordinary that under any system of democracy a member could be pushed to that point.  One would have thought that common sense would have prevailed and that the county manager and other officials would have made the information available. It ought to be available and there ought to be no question about it.</P>
    <P>I recall a request for information being made when I was chairman of Clare County Council and the information being made available to me as chairman.  I sat at a table with all the documents in front of me and the interested councillor read what he wanted to read.  I remember thinking that it was the most ridiculous waste of my time and an extraordinary procedure for the council to have to undertake to make this information available to an elected member, who happened to be from my own electoral area and from a different party and who ought to have been entitled to the information as of right.  I had no interest whatever in the information in question which was not relevant to anything I had a particular interest in.  It seemed an extraordinary negation of democracy that that procedure should have been called into play.  If I, as chairman, had said I had no time or had not been bothered, the councillor would not have been able to get the information except through the means employed by the Wicklow county councillor. That implies an extraordinary weakness in the system of local government and in the position held by an elected councillor, paralleled by the situation here in relation to parliamentary questions when over the past ten years Ministers in several Governments have either not had information made available to them within their own Departments or have chosen to present to the House a sanitised version or a version economical with the truth, creating far greater difficulties than would have had to be faced had they allowed the unvarnished truth into the public domain.  In most cases this probably would have raised no hackles whatever and would have aroused virtually no interest.</P>
    <P>That is how we have proceeded, and that is why a Bill like this is necessary.  I suspect it is also the reason this Bill is convoluted, long-winded and, perhaps, less effective than it might be were it not coming from the tradition from which it comes.  I suspect that if the Minister of State and three or four Deputies had written the Bill, it would be a lot shorter, much more direct and would contain fewer exceptions, and that the exceptions that are included would be copperfastened to a greater degree than they are, particularly the kind of provision in section 28.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an information commissioner is central to the success of the Bill.  We will not know, until we see it in action, whether <Col N="300" /> it will work well.  If the exceptions are so strong that they undermine the role of the commissioner, the worthy attempt to bring in this legislation and make it effective will have failed, and that would be a great pity.  Certain records are exempted.  I am not sure, from reading the Bill, whether the commissioner will have any say in relation to the exempted records, particularly where a Minister or a Government decides that they are exempted records.  From my reading of the Bill I would have to conclude that the commissioner has no role in relation to those documents. On the basis of the history of the operation of the 1963 Act, it seems a pity that somebody in as independent a role as the commissioner would not have access to some form of adjudication in relation to the decision of a Minister or Government on exempted material, because such exemption is usually absolute.  If I am right, this is a very great weakness in the Bill and something which, more than anything else in the Bill, would undermine it.</P>
    <P>I take the opportunity to wish the Bill well, to hope it is successful and that a little more openness will prevail.</P>

      <P>In the case of any Bill, it is important that its provisions be adhered to and that there be no loopholes through which people can evade their responsibilities.  I fear greatly for the effectiveness of this Bill.  In the case of the contracts that RTÉ negotiated with the people who present their programmes, the efforts by a committee of this House to glean information about those contracts were unsuccessful.  Will that type of information be available to a committee of this House under this Bill?  That is questionable. In such circumstances can RTÉ continue to negotiate confidential contracts, or will the information be available to whoever is in authority?</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I would remind the Minister how often we come across difficult situations where confidential settlements have been made by Ministers. One remembers a settlement made with a journalist, but when the Committee of Public Accounts tried to establish the facts surrounding that settlement it was told that the Comptroller and Auditor General could have a look to ensure that there was proper accountability but that we had no right to names or to information about the confidential terms of the payment.  I would refer the Minister to the recent payments made to hepatitis C victims.  When I put down a question, at the request of the individual, to the Minister for Health asking how much was paid to the individual and tried to establish if legal fees were paid to the solicitors of that individual as a result of a settlement, I could not get that information on the basis that it was a confidential settlement. That man paid his own private legal fees to his solicitor, with the possibility that the solicitor had been paid by the State as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  There is not a parent, pupil or teacher who could not tell a tale of unmanageable children, of bullying or truancy.  It is estimated that as many as 27 per cent of all school-going children are affected by bullying, actively or passively.  Much work has already been done within schools to counter the problem, but much remains to be done.  All too often both the victims and perpetrators end up outside the school system, albeit for very different reasons.  The victim may simply absent him or herself, while the perpetrator may well end up being suspended or expelled.  Bullying is just one form of bad behaviour, albeit a common one. Many badly behaved children have no particular target, they are just generally disruptive and difficult to manage.</P>
      <P>Currently the only method of dealing with badly behaved children is to suspend or expel them, a method which serves neither the child, his or her family, or the wider community.  Many children, especially if they have behavioural problems, are unable to find alternative accommodation in other schools and receive little or no support or treatment for their problems.  I am especially concerned at the practice of so-called &ldquo;roll-over suspensions&rdquo;, where a child is given an infinite number of consecutive suspensions but not actually expelled.  This practice effectively precludes the parents from making alternative arrangements and leaves the child in an educational limbo.  Suspension and expulsion are not solutions, they simply remove the child from one environment, the school, and place him or her in another environment, all too often the streets.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable that society should off-load children with behavioural problems in this way. It is not only unacceptable, it is short-sighted.  All the available evidence, including the most recent NESF report on early school leavers, shows that people without qualifications are, in the best case scenario, likely to drift into long-term unemployment and, in the worst case scenario, into a life of petty criminality.  The NESF report provides a statistical basis for the link between educational disadvantage and other forms of social and economic disadvantage, a link which Democratic Left has highlighted for some time.  That disadvantage is as real for children actively excluded from the school system on foot of bad behaviour as for those who simply drop out.  Indeed, it can be argued that bad behaviour may be a result of disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 46 per cent of 15 to 24 year olds without qualifications are unemployed, and are likely to stay unemployed.  That statistic alone should convince us to do everything possible to keep children within the school system.  The problem of children who simply fade out of the educational <Col N="302" /> system needs to be addressed through measures such as the promised School Attendance Bill.  I hope the Department will lose no time in bringing forward this vital legislation and it will be supported by adequate resources and personnel.  I would also like to see a system whereby principals are obliged to report to the Department of Education or their local education board the absence of any pupil for more than ten consecutive school days, or more than 15 days in total, in any given school year.</P>
    <P>We also need to devise a system whereby the Department of Education is notified of all children who are expelled, suspended or otherwise excluded from school, to ensure they are targeted by other educational services such as Youthreach and, where possible, to ensure their reintegration into the school system.  The only way of reintegrating such children into the education system may be to establish what I would call schools of last resort, half way houses between conventional schools which are unable to control badly behaved children and detention schools which imply a criminal sanction.  This option should be examined together with the appointment of teacher-counsellors and trained youth workers in each education region to cater for severely disruptive pupils.</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly deal with early school leavers if we do not know where they are or how many are involved.  I call on the Minister to ensure the suspension or expulsion of children from the school system is immediately reported to the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the National Economic and Social Forum I played a large part in preparing the report on early school leavers, to which the Deputy referred.  Under the Rules for National Schools no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second level the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.  In 1990 and 1991, the Department of Education issued to all schools Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline together with A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline.  The guidelines do not include a system of reporting suspensions to the Department.  Within these guidelines, individual boards are given discretion to work out specific details of their policy on school discipline.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only after every effort at rehabilitation has failed and every other sanction has been exhausted.  Circumstances vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can <Col N="303" /> draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school.</P>
    <P>A review of the guidelines has commenced. The Minister has requested the partners in education to make submissions on the current guidelines. The review will be carried out in consultation with the partners in education and will be influenced by the conclusions of a research project currently being undertaken with support from the Department of Education.  In cases where parents feel aggrieved with a decision to expel a student, they may bring the matter to the attention of the Department which arranges for appropriate investigation.  The Department, through a process of consultation with the schools and through its inspectorate, endeavours to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school or, alternatively, placing him or her in another school.</P>
    <P>In more difficult cases the Department's psychological service is available to assess pupils to determine the nature and extent of any special needs with a view to having them addressed in the most appropriate manner.  Programmes such as Youth Encounter Projects and Youthreach are designed to cater for pupils whose needs can best be dealt with outside the mainstream school system. The School Attendance-Truancy Report, published in April 1994, addressed the question of suspensions and expulsions from schools.  Subsequent to the publication of this report, a task force was established within the Department to examine submissions on the report and to consider and make recommendations on future action required to address the problems of truancy at primary and second level, including recommendations for the amendment of the School Attendance Acts.  In the context of updating the school attendance legislation, the establishment of a system whereby the proposed education boards are notified of any pupil expelled from school is one of the issues currently being considered.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the recently published Education Bill includes a provision for the establishment of an appeals procedure which can be invoked by either the parents of students or the students themselves.  This provision enables the establishment, for the first time ever, of an appeals mechanism for parents and students on serious issues, including expulsion, which materially affect the education of a student.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Ceann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an cheist phráinneach seo a ardú anocht. Nuair a d'ardaigh mé an cheist seo cheana ar an athló Dé Máirt an 21 Samhain 1995 chuir mé in iúl don Aire agus don Dáil go raibh imní ar fhoireann na scoile, ar na daltaí agus ar na tuismitheoirí <Col N="304" /> maidir leis na háiseanna atá curtha ar fáil don scoil seo.  Ba ábhar iontais a laghad obair feabhsúcháin a rinneadh ar na háiseanna le níos mó ná fiche bliain anuas.</P>
      <P>Chuir mé in iúl an oíche sin nach raibh an spás nó an treallamh sa scoil sásúil chun freastal ar na scoláirí go háirithe ó tháinig méadú mór ar líon na scoláirí atá ag freastal ar an scoil.  Tá suas le 450 dalta ann anois.  Thug mé liosta fada de na rudaí a bhí in easnamh sa scoil agus ní dóigh liom gur gá é sin a dhéanamh arís anocht mar tá gach eolas i dtuarascáil na Dála ón oíche sin.  Shoiléirigh mé go raibh sé riachtanach ath-chóiriú práinneach a dhéanamh ar an Chlochar agus ar an sean-scoil agus go raibh gá le seomraí breise. D'iarr mé ar an Aire an oíche sin airgead speisialta a chur ar fáil i Meastacháin 1996 chun athchóiriú iomlán a dhéanamh.  Tá mé ag iarraidh a fháil amach ón Aire anocht cad a thárla ó shin mar níl aon mhór-oibreacha déanta sa scoil fós.</P>

D'admhaigh an tAire i 1995 go raibh dhá iarratas ón scoil chuimsitheach faoi bhráid na Roinne &mdash; ceann acu chun scoil a dhéanamh den Chlochar agus an ceann eile chun oibreacha deisiúcháin a dhéanamh ar an scoil féin.  Dúirt sí gur cheart don scoil a cuid riachtanas ó thaobh treallaimh nua a chur in iúl do rannóg troscán agus treallamh na Roinne agus go ndéanfaí an t-iarratas a mheas.</P>
      <P>Dúirt sí go raibh beirt oifigeach ón Roinn chun cuairt a thabhairt ar an scoil agus iarracht a dhéanamh teacht ar réiteach sásúil.  Dúirt sí go raibh tuarascáil chuimsitheach ailtireachta agus innealtóireachta maidir le gnéithe áirithe an Chlochair á cur le chéile agus go mbeadh an tuarascáil sin ar fáil i gceann cúpla seachtain ina dhiaidh sin.  Dúirt an tAire chomh maith gur mhaith léi a dheimhniú domsa go mbeadh ar chumas na Roinne moltaí a chur faoi bhráid Scoil Chuimsitheach An Cheathrú Rua chun na háiseanna a fheabhsú chomh luath is a bheadh an tuarascail ó na hailtirí agus na hinnealtóirí ar fáil. Beidh mé ag súil le freagra dearfach anocht faoin scoil seo i mo dháilcheantar.  Tá gach tuarascáil a bheadh ag teastáil curtha ar fáil don Roinn. Táimid ag fanacht anois ar dheimhniú an Aire go dtabharfar cead dul ár aghaidh leis an obair agus go bhfuil airgead curtha ar fáil aici i Meastacháin Airgeadais 1997 chun an obair a thosú.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the time to say a few words on a topic which is important to the farming community, 48 young agricultural science graduates and 12 young environmental science graduates.  Two weeks ago those 60 people took a planning course in Ennis under the aegis of the rural environmental protection scheme.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years the European Union, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and others have become very conscious of the environment.  As a result the REPS was introduced. Under that scheme farmers follow a plan for a five year period during which they clear up the lake shores and rivers on their lands, trim hedges and so on.  More importantly, they must provide accommodation for their stock as well as for fodder, effluent and slurry and there is a definite upper limit to the amount of fertiliser and lime that can be spread on their land.  Each year during the five year period the farmer receives a bonus for his work in this regard, but as the cost of providing the accommodation could be between £20,000 and £45,000, the bonus is well earned.  The down side of REPS is that a farmer may not carry more than one livestock unit per one and a quarter acres of land, thus reducing meat production.  While this may be acceptable to those in the well fed part of the world, those who are starving would not hold a similar view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the tasks of the people who draw up REPS plans.  Irrespective of how highly qualified a graduate is, I accept that he or she would require in-service training for two or three months to be able to carry out those tasks, but we are talking about highly intelligent agricultural and environmental scientists.  Until two years ago those who completed the course in Ennis were deemed planners under the REPS <Col N="306" /> and could open planning agencies.  However, those who have just completed the course were told they would have to spend a further two years doing in-service training.  A planner with his or her own agency would be eligible to give 20 hour courses to young farmers.  These courses are relatively lucrative and it is a shame that such highly qualified people are debarred from holding them.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a practical individual, so I appeal to him to review the terms under which these planners are granted full planning permission and the authority to open their own agencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Foxe raised this matter because it provides me with an opportunity to clarify a number of issues which have arisen in recent weeks. My Department approves planners and planning agencies whose function it is to draw up five year plans for farmers based on the Department's agri-environmental specifications and the scheme conditions. Planners have a pivotal role in setting out the practices to be followed by the farmer to ensure that the objectives of the scheme are achieved.</P>
      <P>I have for some time been concerned to upgrade the procedures relating to approved REPS planners in light of experience in the operation of REPS over the past two to three years. Existing approved planners are being subjected to increased scrutiny, while the experience of newly approved planners will be established over a period.  Following completion of a two year period of satisfactory REPS planning, or the submission to my Department of 50 satisfactory plans, newly approved planners will be registered as approved REPS planning agencies.  At that stage, as well as preparing REPS plans, they will be authorised to oversee their preparation by being permitted to operate as REPS planning agencies.</P>
      <P>I will outline the improved arrangements for new REPS planners, put in place in conjunction with a REPS appreciation course held in Ennis from 19 to 21 February.  Each individual will be listed as an approved planner after three plans have been completed to the satisfaction of the Department.  The three plans submitted by each will be individually checked and responded to by the Department.  Each of these three plans must be officially approved by the Department and following such approval, each planner will be included in the Department's list of approved planners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After two years of satisfactory planning a planner may be registered as an approved planning agency, following formal application to the Department.  Alternatively, such approval may be given if 50 plans have been submitted to the satisfaction of the Department.  Planners may advertise for business when they have been approved by the Department following the submission of a satisfactory third plan.  An approved planner may, <Col N="307" /> working with another approved planner, run a REPS 20 hour education course subject to the conditions laid down for running such courses. Planners are required to inform my Department without delay if they become unable to comply with their undertakings or fulfil all or any of the requirements listed for the purposes of REPS.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 60 new planners trained last month, we already have 246 private planning agencies, many of which employ several planners. Additionally, Teagasc employs 351 planners. There is, therefore, no scarcity of REPS planners. I am not aware of any farmers having difficulties in getting access to planners to enable them to participate in REPS.  Nonetheless, it is my Department's intention to have another REPS appreciation course before June of this year, after which we expect to add up to 50 more planners to our approved list of planners.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is clear that my Department's approach to the approval of new REPS planners is fair and equitable.  Equally importantly, it will ensure that farmers will have access to an increased pool of fully qualified planners who, after a reasonable period acting alone under the supervision of my Department, can be registered as a planning agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this important issue and I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The fishing industry in Howth in my constituency is a vital part of the local economy and the employment it generates is a significant part of the workforce, both directly through sea fishing and indirectly through fish sales, processing and ancillary services.  A number of fishing boats from Howth are exclusively engaged in whelk fishing at the Codling Bank in the Irish Sea.  The Codling Bank comprises 63 acres of seabed, which is a vital nursery for shellfish.  Whelk fishing at the Codling Bank had an estimated commercial value of £4 million in 1995, the last year for which figures are available from the Department of the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern and the concern of the fishing industry in my constituency has been raised by the application by Bray Urban District Council to the Minister for the Marine for a licence to extract 250,000 cubic metres of gravel from the shellfish nursery at the Codling Bank to replenish the beach at Bray.  One does not need to be a marine scientist to understand the serious adverse effect of extraction on marine life, shellfish and employment in the fishing community which depends on shellfish and whelk fishing, in particular. If whelk fishing is wiped out, the boats which fish for whelk would have to fish for cod and <Col N="308" /> mackerel and this would depress the overall catch for boats now fishing for cod and mackerel.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Codling Bank gravel extraction environmental impact statement which was prepared for Bray Urban District Council by Irish Hydrodata Limited and the Aquatic Services Unit in the Department of Zoology at University College, Cork.   The statement lists the various fishing interests which were approached for their views.  The omission of the Howth Fishermen's Association from this consultation process has caused outrage in Howth among fishermen who depend on whelk fishing for their livelihood. They feel it is unacceptable that the Codling Bank nursery for bottom dwelling fish and shellfish should be disturbed.</P>
    <P>There are other apparent defects in the environment impact statement.  It overlooks, for example, the existence of live coral in the area of the Codling Bank.  During the proposed excavation work, the dispersal of the plume would, in the opinion of the fishermen, travel a greater distance than stated in the environmental impact statement.  According to the fishermen, the suggestion to fish the area prior to dredging is also non-viable.</P>
    <P>There are many alternative sources of gravel on land in the Wicklow area which could be used to deal with coastal erosion rather than ruining the Codling Bank seabed.  I ask the Minister to take into account the concerns expressed when dealing with the licence, which should not be granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Planning has been under way for a number of years to tackle the severe erosion and overtopping problem at Bray promenade, County Wicklow.  The protection scheme designed for Bray involves the provision of a renourished beach and certain rock structures to aid the retention of the nourishment.  As part of the design process it was necessary to identify a suitable type of beach nourishment for the protection scheme and a suitable source for that nourishment.  The codling bank has been proposed.</P>
      <P>In order to extract such nourishment material, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate licences under the foreshore Acts.  Therefore, Bray Urban District Council has lodged an application with the Minister for the Marine for the extraction of up to 250,000 cubic metres of shingle from the codling bank.  As per section 13A of the Foreshore Act, 1993, and the Foreshore (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1990, an environmental impact statement has been prepared in respect of the proposed extraction.  In accordance with the regulations the environmental impact statement was advertised and made available to the public who were invited to make submissions to the Department of the Marine by 23 February 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objections to the granting of a licence were received from four bodies/individuals, including the Howth Fishermen's Association.  These objections <Col N="309" /> have been relayed to Bray Urban District Council for comment.  On receipt of these comments, the matter will be further considered by the appropriate experts within the Department of the Marine who will then convey their views to the Minister.  The Minister does not yet have a view on Bray Urban District Council's application for an extraction licence.  I can confirm that <Col N="310" /> the Minister will take account of all submissions made to him under the statutory consultation process relating to this application and the environmental impact statement in coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12 March 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The monitoring committee on the employment of people with disabilities, which operated on foot of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, carried out a survey to determine the position at end-December 1995 in relation to the employment of people with disabilities in the public service.  I understand that the survey determined that there were 2,654 people with disabilities employed in the public service at that time.  This represented 1.49 per cent of the total number employed.  Work remains to be done to achieve the 3 per cent quota already reached in the Civil Service.  My Department has engaged in consultations with the Departments of Finance, Health and Environment to ensure that human resource managers in bodies under their control are aware of the Government's commitment to reaching the 3 per cent quota and to ensure that every effort is made to reach it as soon as possible.  An officer of my Department also served on the monitoring committee.</P>
      <P>Partnership 2000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness provides that the 3 per cent quota will be met in the public service during the period of the partnership.  In this regard, the following measures will be undertaken: responsibility for meeting the target will be assigned to a senior executive in each health board, local authority, vocational education committee and State-sponsored body; a co-ordinated strategy will be put in place including, the preparation and active promotion of codes of practice on the employment of people with disabilities, similar to existing codes in the Civil Service and the ESB; the maintenance of proper records of employment of people with disabilities, subject to the requirement of confidentiality and privacy; and the identification of suitable employment opportunities, targets and specific timescales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in relation to work and training, including those relating to <Col N="312" /> employment in the public service, are being considered by the interdepartmental task force which I established to draw up a plan of action on the rights of people with disabilities.  The plan of action is due to be submitted to Government around mid-year.  I am providing £300,000 to fund the interim Council for the Status of People with Disabilities in 1997.</P>
    <P>I understand that the national board of the interim council has been elected and arrangements are being completed jointly by the <i>ad-hoc</i> establishment group and the national board for the handover of responsibility for the interim council to the national board.  It is intended that this work will be completed by the end of the month.  The question of staffing arrangements is a matter for the interim council.  I have no function in this regard.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to separation agreements that may be in question in the context of divorce proceedings instituted under the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that among the criteria laid down in Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution and approved by the people in the divorce referendum in November 1995 is the requirement that before a decree of divorce can be granted, a court must be satisfied that proper provision having regard to the circumstances exists or will be made for the spouses and any children of either or both of them.  Section 5 (1) (c) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996 gives legislative effect to this constitutional requirement.</P>
      <P>In granting a decree of divorce and in deciding whether or not to make an ancillary order in favour of a spouse or any dependent children, it is important that the power of the court to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of income and property in favour of the parties concerned, in line with the requirements of Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution, is not restricted by any deed of separation which may have been entered into between those parties before divorce proceedings are instituted.  It would, of course, be open to parties to such proceedings, where agreement exists between them, to seek to have the terms of any existing deed of separation reflected in any ancillary orders made by the court on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, when farming the Bill that led to the Act of 1996, I made provision in section 20 (3) that a court must, in deciding whether to make certain ancillary orders and in determining the provisions of such orders, have regard to the terms of any separation agreement which has <Col N="313" /> been entered into by the spouses and is still in force.  I do not accept, as the Deputy seems to infer, that there will be a necessity for the court to re-open separation agreements in all cases. Clearly, where the parties are in full agreement on the terms of their separation, the reasonable assumption must be that the court will have no difficulty in giving due recognition to the wishes of the parties concerned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the legislative priorities of my Department &mdash; the Employment Equality Bill, the Equal Status Bill, the Children Bill, and a Family Law Bill &mdash; are as announced by the Chief Whip in the Government's programme of legislation for the current session.  However, I can say that when current priorities are disposed of it would be my Department's intention, in line with its programme of work, to continue with its systematic review and reform of our laws in relation to property.</P>
      <P>In the course of various legislative measures I have taken the opportunity to introduce reform of our property laws.  In the Family Law Act, 1995, I initiated updating of the powers of the court to make property adjustment orders in support of parties to separation proceedings and I made provision for the court for the first time to make such orders in cases where the parties concerned have a foreign decree of divorce or separation that is entitled to recognition in the State. Property includes property, real and personal, and in the latter sense I should like to mention in particular the pension adjustment orders which I have provided for in the Act of 1995.  Property adjustment, including pension adjustment orders, are now also a feature of our divorce laws based on provisions which I initiated in the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>The wide-ranging Family Law Act, 1995 implemented a recommendation of the Law Reform Commission concerning a time limit after which conveyances could not be declared void under the Family Home Protection Act, 1976. The Act of 1995 also repealed and re-enacted with amendments provisions in the Married Women's Status Act, 1957 giving the courts power to determine disputes between spouses in relation to property and it clarified the law in relation to the property of engaged couples as provided for in legislation of 1981.  The Powers of Attorney Act, 1996 introduced reform of our property laws taking into account the report of the Law Reform Commission on enduring powers of attorney.  That report was one of a series on land law and conveyancing law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="314" /> Notwithstanding the demands of other areas of the law on staff in the Department, I am satisfied that considerable progress has already been made to date in my Department on reforming our property laws.  In future legislative proposals regarding property law, close consideration will be given to the other proposals in this area made by the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>Any father who is in dispute about custody or access to his child may apply to the court under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 for its direction on the matter.  The Act provides that in deciding such issues the court must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  That important criterion, which is common to many other jurisdictions, is a matter which falls to be dealt with by the court in the context of all of the circumstances of each case.  Such orders may be varied by the court if it is in the best interests of the child that a variation order be made.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the application of that law in particular cases.</P>
      <P>My understanding is that section 11 may be broad enough to allow the court to make access orders in favour of grandparents but that the power is not clearcut.  The position appears to be that any such orders must be sought on the basis of application being made by one of the parents. The section cannot be activated by anyone else. Any such orders must be made in the best interests of the child concerned.  While provision to allow grandparents to apply in their own right to the court for access to a child appears desirable, the constitutional rights of the parents may make for some difficulties in framing appropriate legislative provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various representations have been made to my Department concerning the position of separated parents and grandparents.  I undertook to give consideration to those representations in the context <Col N="315" /> of preparation of the Children Bill which is in the final stages of being drafted.  That Bill, among other matters, aims at updating certain aspects of the law on guardianship.</P>

    <P>(5)  Chief State Solicitor's Office &mdash; Feasibility Study by Brady, Stanley O'Connell Associates Architects.</P>
    <P>This architectural study was commissioned by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Chief State Solicitor.  It deals with the existing building and proposals for its refurbishment and extension. I see little merit in having it published, it would, in any event, be inappropriate, for reasons of security, to publish detailed plans of any State law office.</P>

      <P>Preparations for the follow-up conference to the Barcelona ministerial meeting which inaugurated the Euro-Mediterranean partnership are being conducted in accordance with the follow-up provisions of the Barcelona declaration, by the Euro-Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona process.  The committee meets at senior official level and comprises the European Union Troika, including, at present, a representative from Ireland, and one representative of each of the Union's 12 Mediterranean partners.  In the context of preparations for the Malta ministerial meeting, the committee takes stock of and evaluates the follow-up to the Barcelona process and all its components and updates the work programme agreed at Barcelona.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As foreseen in the Barcelona declaration, the Euro-Mediterranean committee for the Barcelona process has met regularly and preparations for the Malta ministerial meeting are now at an advanced stage.  At its most recent meeting on 24 and 25 February, the General Affairs Council of the European Union heard a report from the <Col N="327" /> Presidency and the European Commission on the preparations and organization of the Malta meeting. The GAC, also, reiterated the Union's commitment to the establishment of a network of bilateral association agreements with its Mediterranean partners.  In this connection the GAC welcomed the signature of the Interim Association Agreement with the PLO and underlined its determination to conclude the negotiations with Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>While the precise agenda for the meeting has yet to be set, the meeting at Malta will take stock of progress in Euro-Mediterranean partnership and will set priorities for the future.  It is anticipated that Ministers for Foreign Affairs will adopt conclusions which reflect their wish to see the balanced development of the partnership through the gradual implementation of all three chapters of the Barcelona declaration, i.e. the political and security partnership, the economic and financial partnership, and the partnership in social, cultural and human affairs.  The importance which the Council of Ministers attached to the Malta meeting in this context was underlined at the meeting of the General Affairs Council referred to.</P>

      <P>In June 1995 the EU Council of Ministers mandated the Commission to negotiate a long-term relationship with South Africa.  This relationship is to be built on two complementary elements: a Bilateral Trade and Cooperation Agreement with South Africa and a Protocol to provide for qualified accession by South Africa to the Lomé IV Convention.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Term Review of the Fourth Lomé Convention, signed in Mauritius in November 1995, introduced provisions to facilitate South Africa's accession to the Convention.  Under the revised Convention, South Africa can formally accede to the Convention, without further ratification by the states party to it, if the terms of accession are agreed prior to the entry into force of the agreement amending the Convention. Accession by South Africa requires the approval of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the accession of South Africa to the Lomé IV Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations between the European Commission and South Africa on the Protocol of accession recently concluded.  I am confident that every effort will be made to ensure that the Protocol can be presented for approval to the next meeting of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers in <Col N="328" /> Luxembourg in April, thus facilitating the early accession of South Africa to Lomé IV.</P>
    <P>The EU's negotiating mandate for a Trade and Cooperation Agreement was formally presented to the South African authorities on 29 March 1996.  A first meeting between the two sides took place in June 1996 and some progress was made on non-trade aspects such as economic and industrial co-operation, education, research, and technology. South Africa formally responded to the EU's negotiating mandate in January.  In February the two sides agreed a tentative timetable and agenda for the next phase of negotiations up to July which includes six negotiating sessions on the Bilateral Trade and Cooperation Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in my written reply to the Deputy's previous Question No. 82 of 25 February, the Government and our EU partners are gravely concerned about the spreading military conflict in Eastern Zaire, which is increasing political tensions and aggravating the acute humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that reply, I also gave a full statement of the five principles upon which the EU has based its call on all parties to seek a political solution to the problems of Eastern Zaire and the region. These principles are the basis of the EU's coordinated and highly focused policy in relation to the Great Lakes Region as agreed among partners and set out in the Declaration made by the Presidency on 17 February.  The concerns of the Union are also being made known directly to the relevant Governments of the Great Lakes Region by our designated Special Envoy, Mr. Aldo Ajello, who has been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts throughout the region.  In pursuing its concerns, the Union is working closely with the Joint United Nations and Organisation of African Unity Special Representative to the region, Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun, whose fivepoint peace plan has been adopted unaimously by <Col N="329" /> the UN Security Council in Resolution 1097 of 18 February.  The five elements of this plan are:</P>
    <P>&mdash; Immediate cessation of hostilities.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Withdrawal of all external forces/mercenaries.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Reaffirmation of respect for national sovereignty/integrity of Zaire and other States of the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Protection and security for all refugees and displaced persons and facilitation of access to humanitarian assistance.</P>
    <P>&mdash; Rapid peaceful settlement of crisis through dialogue, electoral process and convening of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    <P>In appointing Special Representative Sahnoun, UN Secretary-General Annan has requested him to use his good offices to promote peaceful settlements of the various conflicts in the region, with special reference initially to the situations in Eastern Zaire and Burundi; to prepare an international conference on peace, security and development in the region, as endorsed by the Security Council; to use his good offices to help preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Zaire and to help restore the country's national institutions, including through support for the electoral process.</P>
    <P>Special Representative Sahnoun is working closely with the Governments in the region and other parties.  He also has a co-ordinating role in relation to the UN's Humanitarian co-ordinators at both regional and national level.  As evident from my reply of 25 February, the principles which guide the current approach of the Government and our European partners complement and underpin Mr. Sahnoun's plan and mandate.</P>
    <P>The current efforts of the international community are aimed at the early acceptance and implementation of the Sahnoun peace plan beginning with an immediate cessation of hostilities. The Government of Zaire declared its acceptance of the plan on 5 March.  In its statement of Friday, 7 March the Security Council has called on the rebel side to do likewise with an immediate cessation of hostilities, as has the EU in its parallel Presidency Declaration of that date.  In addition the Council has expressed its concern about the effect which the continued fighting is having on the refugees and inhabitants of the region and has called on all parties to allow access by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and humanitarian agencies to guarantee the safety of refugees and displaced persons as well as UN and humanitarian aid workers.  The possibility of an international mechanism to monitor a ceasefire is under active consideration by the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the ongoing peace-making efforts of regional leaders and of President Mandela continue.  Along with our European partners, the Government welcomes the initiative of President Moi of Kenya to convene another <Col N="330" /> regional meeting in Nairobi on 19 March and the initiative of the Organisation of African Unity to organise a summit on the Great Lakes Region before the end of this month.  The Government will continue to make every appropriate effort in concert with our EU partners for the effective co-ordination and success of these initiatives.</P>

      <P>The 18th meeting of the EU-Cyprus Association Council was held in the margins of the General Affairs Council of 21 February 1997. The Council dealt with issues of economic co-operation relating to Cyprus's application for accession to the European Union.  The Association Council is held at regular intervals and forms part of the ongoing co-operation framework between the European Union and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It is customary on the occasion of such an Association Council for a structural political dialogue to take place on issues of common interest between the EU and Cyprus.  However, this did not prove possible on this occasion, as agreement was not reached by all EU member states on the political statement to be delivered within the framework of the structured dialogue on one of the agenda items, the political situation in Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The European Union believes that the prospect of accession by Cyprus to the Union provides both the opportunity and incentive for both communities on the island to enter into serious political negotiations and to achieve serious progress towards a comprehensive political settlement during 1997.  The objective, shared by all partners in the European Union, is to see an early resumption of direct talks between the leadership of both communities on the island, with the aim of reaching an overall political settlement of the Cyprus question.</P>
      <P>Ireland, and its partners in the European Union, together with the Commission, are making considerable efforts to convince both communities, and in particular the Turkish-Cypriot community that they have everything to gain and nothing to lose through the accession of a unified Cyprus to the European Union.  To this end, Commissioner Van den Broek, accompanied by Presidency officials, including the Special Representative of the Presidency-in-Office, Ambassador Heaslip, visited Cyprus earlier this month to hold talks with political leaders from both communities on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the efforts of the European Union, various interested parties have also taken initiatives to promote progress towards a settlement. <Col N="331" /> These initiatives are intended to be complementary to, and supportive of, the efforts of the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Professor Han Sung Joo, in acknowledgment of the leading role to be played by the United Nations in the process of achieving an overall solution.  It is further recognised that any eventual solution should fall within the parameters of existing UN resolutions and decisions on the Cyprus question.</P>
    <P>Whilst these efforts will continue and intensify in the months ahead, it must be recognised that they can only succeed if the leadership of both communities, who have a primary responsibility for securing a solution, make serious efforts to move at an early date to direct negotiations leading to a final and comprehensive settlement to this longstanding problem.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference which opened in March 1996 is considering possible amendments to the EU Treaties.  It is open to any member state to table proposals for treaty changes at the Intergovernmental Conference. However, any Treaty changes must be agreed unanimously.</P>
      <P>One member state has tabled a proposal designed to ensure that no member state shall agree to process an application for asylum or refugee status submitted by a national of another member state.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency's outline draft Treaty, which was accepted by the Dublin European Council in December as a good basis for the further work of the conference, does not contain a suggested draft Treaty amendment in this area. It does however recall the important proposal which had been tabled and which should be considered further by the conference.</P>
      <P>The Dublin European Council asked the Intergovernmental Conference &ldquo;to develop the important proposal to amend the Treaties to establish it as a clear principle that no citizen of a member state of the union may apply for asylum in another member state, taking into account international Treaties&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is now receiving detailed consideration at the conference.  Ireland's position is that we very much understand the concerns which led to the tabling of the proposal.  At the same <Col N="332" /> time, we consider, like other member states, that it gives rise to a number of complex legal and other questions such as those identified by the organisations referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>These questions, including the compatibility of the proposal with existing international obligations, will need to be fully examined before the proposal can be taken further.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference has not reached the stage of definitive agreement on the various issues which it is considering.  Negotiations are continuing under the Dutch Presidency and the conference remains set to conclude in Amsterdam in June.</P>

      <P>I attended the most recent meeting of the Co-operation Council between the EU and the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) in Doha on 17 February, which discussed a range of political and economic issues of common interest to both sides.  The European Union raised a number of human rights issues, and this is reflected in the joint communiqué which was issued following the meeting.</P>
      <P>In the joint communiqué, the Gulf Co-operation Council Ministers, while noting the diversity of systems of values, joined EU Ministers in reiterating their continuing commitment to the promotion of human rights and recalled the commitment of all states, expressed at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, to the principle that all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent.  There was a more extensive discussion of Human Rights than at previous meetings of the EU-Gulf Co-operation Council.</P>
      <P>As a matter of course, the European Union raises the issue of human rights in the Gulf in its speech to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly.  The Government fully supports the principle that human rights should be a central consideration in relations between the EU and Third Countries. The European Union will continue to raise the issue of human rights obligations in its political dialogue with Third Countries, including with the members of the Gulf Co-operation Council.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, the matter was discussed further at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 24 February.  The Council reaffirmed its willingness to pursue a dialogue with China on human rights, aimed at encouraging respect for international human rights norms.  The Council expressed the hope that there would be rapid progress in this regard, following several contacts which had taken place recently with the Chinese authorities, particularly on the part of the EU and the US.  The council also encouraged the Presidency to pursue and intensify, in close co-operation with other interested parties, consultations and preparatory work already under way towards the possible tabling of a draft resolution on China at the Commission on Human Rights.  A final decision in this regard will be taken in light of any further relevant developments.</P>
      <P>Discussions with the United States are an essential part of the consultation process signalled by the General Affairs Council at its meeting on 24 February.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to liaise closely with the US and other interested parties in arriving at a final decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>While I can confirm that a meeting took place between the EU Troika and the US on 21 February, the Deputy will be aware that it is not normal practice to report on the detail of such Troika consultations, which are conducted on a confidential basis.  From public statements made by representatives of the US Administration in recent weeks, it will be clear that the views of the US in regard to the possible tabling of a draft resolution at the Commission on Human Rights are broadly similar to those of the Union.</P>

      <P>As regards the outcome of the EUASEAN ministerial meeting held in Singapore on 13-14 February, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 80 of 25 February indicating that Ministers had a productive and wideranging exchange of views on a number of political, security, economic and other issues at the meeting.  The discussions took place in an atmosphere of mutual confidence and understanding in the spirit of the previous meeting in Karlsruhe on 22-23 September 1994; and Ministers reiterated that ASEAN remains a cornerstone of the EU's dialogue with the Asian region.  As the Deputy will be aware, a copy of the joint declaration adopted at the meeting has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>In relation to Burma, the Deputy will be aware from my reply to Question No. 48 of 19 February that I participated in a lengthy and frank discussion at lunch on the situation in Burma at the EU-ASEAN meeting.  This exchange of views is acknowledged in the joint declaration.  The concerns of European Ministers regarding the situation in Burma were conveyed to the ASEAN side in great detail.</P>
      <P>Prior to this discussion, which lasted for some two hours, the Presidency reiterated, in the formal EU statement, the concern of the European Union in relation to the continuing human rights violations in Burma.  The EU called upon the SLORC immediately and unconditionally to release all political prisoners and to embark upon a process of national reconciliation and democratic reform, respecting the aspirations of the Burmese people as expressed in the elections of May 1990.  To this end, the EU also called upon the SLORC to enter into a meaningful dialogue with pro-democracy groups in general and with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in particular as well as with representatives of various ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>In relation to the EU Troika meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, I can confirm that almost the entire meeting was given over to an exchange of views on human rights issues.  This allowed for a broad discussion on areas of immediate importance to the EU including the question of a resolution on China at the forthcoming session on the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.</P>
      <P>In addition, the EU side expressed its regret that China had not agreed to a new date for an EU-China meeting within the framework of the Human Rights dialogue initiated in 1995 and highlighted European interest in resuming such a dialogue.  The EU also repeated its call that China become party to the UN Covenant on civil and political rights as well as that on economic, social and cultural rights.</P>
      <P>We sought the release of political prisoners in need of medical treatment and the agreement of China to facilitate prison visits by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the meeting, there have been indications that the Chinese authorities are considering, in <Col N="335" /> particular, the issue of prison visits and the question of adherence to the two UN covenants which I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am aware that on 17 February, the chairman of the Northern Land Council, a statutory authority established in Australia's northern territory sent a human rights dossier to the representative of the European Commission in Canberra in the context of ongoing discussions concerning a proposed EC-Australia Framework Trade and Co-operation Agreement.</P>
      <P>Over recent years, the European Union has progressively expanded the scope of provisions relating to respect for human rights in agreements with third countries.  In May 1995 Council decided that all subsequent agreements of this nature should contain a suspension mechanism to be used in the event of non-observance of essential aspects of the agreements, particularly human rights.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports the negotiating directives for the EC-Australia Framework Trade and Co-operation Agreement approved by the General Affairs Council on 21 April 1996 which stipulate that common respect for democratic principles and basic human rights will constitute an essential element of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Discussions between the European Commission and the Australian authorities aimed at concluding an EC-Australia Framework Trade and Co-operation Agreement are ongoing.  The question of a human rights clause is among the issues being discussed.  Ireland hopes that these negotiations will produce an outcome which is satisfactory to both parties.</P>

      <P>The Government, along with its partners in the European Union, is gravely concerned at the situation in Albania.  The President of the Council of Ministers of the Union, Foreign Minister <Col N="336" /> Van Mierlo of the Netherlands, travelled to Albania on 8 March to convey directly the concerns of the European Union at recent developments. The European Union, whilst recognising the need for the restoration of law and order in Albania, considers it imperative that the state of emergency should be lifted as soon as possible.  Minister Van Mierlo emphasised that the implementation of the state of emergency should not affect the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms of expression and information.</P>
      <P>The EU has also urged all political forces in Albania to come together in a responsible manner to resolve the present crisis, and to establish a government that enjoys the broad-based support of the Albanian people.  The European Union believes that through a process of national reconciliation, a consensus-based government can reach agreement on measures that will lead to a political resolution of the current crisis.</P>
      <P>The European Union will continue to lend its support and encouragement for the establishment of full democracy in Albania.  In this regard, it fully supports the efforts of the OSCE, and its essential role in achieving a peaceful reconciliation in Albania.  The European Union has welcomed the mission of the personal representative to Albania of the OSCE Chairman in Office, former Chancellor Vranitsky of Austria.  Members of the EU Troika, including Ireland, formed part of the OSCE delegation which met with President Berisha on 9 March 1997, and urged him to take positive measures to involve all political forces in the search for a political solution.</P>
      <P>The European Union also welcomes the efforts of the Council of Europe to contribute to the strengthening of democracy in Albania.</P>
      <P>Following the visits of Foreign Minister Van Mierlo, and the OSCE delegation headed by Mr. Vranitsky, it is reported that President Berisha of Albania has reached agreement with the other political parties on a programme of measures which include the establishment of a government of national reconciliation and the holding of parliamentary elections by June.  The European Union will continue to encourage the full implementation of these positive steps towards overcoming this crisis.</P>
      <P>Ireland will continue to support actively the efforts of the Union to encourage early progress towards a political solution, as well as the provision of appropriate assistance measures to Albania, for example, through the Community PHARE programme.  We will also consider positively any proposals for the provision of necessary humanitarian aid, as well as further measures to help Albania &mdash; once the political and economic conditions are right.</P>

      <P>In the Dáil on 26 February, the Taoiseach expressed concern about the decision which was expected to be taken later that day by the Israeli cabinet to proceed with the construction of the new housing units at Jabal Abu Ghneim-Har Homa.  Following the announcement of the decision, the Tánaiste issued a statement which set out the Government's position on settlements in detail.  The statement reaffirmed that settlements in the occupied territories contravene international law and are a major obstacle to peace, and stressed that East Jerusalem is subject to the principles set out in UN Security Council Resolution 242, notably the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force.  The statement further noted that the EU does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem.  The Tánaiste called on Israel to reconsider its decision to proceed with the construction of these new housing units.</P>
      <P>Prior to the official announcement, the Troika of EU representatives in Tel Aviv met with a senior official of the Israeli Foreign Ministry on 24 February to express the deep concern of the European Union that an extension of settlements in the Jerusalem area would hamper the peace process.  The Troika underlined the Union's wish that the parties to the peace process should refrain from actions which would change the <i>status quo</i> on the ground and which prejudge the outcome of the permanent status negotiations, which are due to resume on 17 March.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement, the President of the Council of Ministers issued a statement on behalf of the European Union.  The statement deplored the decision of the Israeli Government to approve the construction plans, and called on Israel to refrain from measures that have an eroding effect on the confidence necessary for further implementation of the existing Israeli-Palestinian agreements.  The statement also reaffirmed the Union's view, as set out most recently in the declaration adopted by the European Council in Dublin in December, that settlements in the occupied territories contravene international law and are a major obstacle to peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 7 March, the four European Union partners which are members of the United Nations Security Council tabled a draft resolution, expressing deep concern at the construction of a settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim-Har Homa.  The draft resolution called on Israel to refrain from all actions which pre-empt the permanent status negotiations and &mdash; as the occupying power &mdash; to abide by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Geneva Convention of 1949 relative to the protection of civilians in time of war, which is applicable to all territories occupied by Israel <Col N="338" /> since 1967.  The draft resolution also called on all parties to continue their negotiations within the Middle East peace process on its agreed basis, and the timely implementation of the agreements reached.  The draft resolution, however, was vetoed by the United States.</P>
    <P>Ireland, along with its partners in the European Union will continue to encourage all parties to advance the Middle East peace process, and not to take any action which would prejudge the outcome of the permanent status negotiations, including the issue of the Status of Jerusalem.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government has approved a grant of £25,000 to provide emergency relief supplies to those most affected by this disaster.  The grant will be disbursed through the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which has an excellent track record of providing effective and much needed emergency relief in these type of crisis situations.</P>
      <P>I understand that the European Union, through the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) is considering the most appropriate response to the disaster and is likely to reach a decision on providing emergency relief funding within the next few days.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the article in issue 24 of Revenue's tax briefing to which the Deputy's query refers was issued in response to complaints from tax practitioners that, without clear guidelines from Revenue, they were unsure as to the correct income tax or corporation tax treatment applicable to finance leases.  Where incorrect tax treatment had been applied by practitioners and was uncovered in a Revenue audit, the necessary tax adjustments usually gave rise to an additional charge to tax. Such unforeseen liabilities could cause cashflow problems for traders.</P>
      <P>Recent issues of Revenue's tax briefing set out in detail the tax treatment applicable to finance leases of assets used for the purpose of a trade or profession.  The guidelines as stated in issue 24 of Revenue's tax briefing, dated December 1996, represent a clarification of the correct treatment and not a change.  These guidelines are based on long established principles of accounting and taxation.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the guidelines, it was represented to the Revenue Commissioners by interested persons, including the parties mentioned in the Deputy's question, that many traders entered into transactions on the understanding that a particular tax treatment would apply and that they were unaware that this treatment was incorrect.  The Revenue Commissioners have now accepted that a strict application of the correct treatment, as outlined in the article, to leasing transactions which took place prior to December 1996 could seriously affect a trader's cashflow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transitional measures aimed at avoiding hardship in these cases have accordingly been discussed with interested parties.  In general, these <Col N="341" /> transitional measures will allow traders to account for finance leases taken out on or before 31 December 1996 on a payment basis, i.e. the <i>status quo</i>, and they will also allow traders to spread the taxation of rental rebates over a number of years.  A summary information leaflet, which will contain details of these transitional measures, is being finalised in conjunction with interested parties and it will be issued by the Revenue Commissioners in the very near future.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, who administer the car scrappage scheme, that persons wishing to scrap motor vehicles under the scheme must be approved by them for that purpose.  At the commencement of the scheme, the commissioners invited applications in the national press for persons seeking approval.  Applications received were considered having regard to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the geographical location of the premises,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; whether the applicant was already involved in scrapping cars on a large scale and had fixed crushing equipment in place for that purpose.</P>
      <P>Six plants were approved originally on this basis. Subsequently, approval was granted to four additional plants to cater for the high demand for the service under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The ten approved plants are subject to control by the Revenue Commissioners, are visited on a regular basis and records, books and scrappage certificates are examined.  These certificates must be issued by approved persons in respect of each vehicle scrapped by them.  The essential requirement of the car scrappage scheme is that the engine and chassis of each vehicle must be destroyed beyond use, thus ensuring that the scrapped vehicle cannot be reconstituted and used again.  While the Revenue Commissioners have no function with regard to the ultimate destination of the scrapped material, I understand that it goes for recycling and that minor parts are sold to used car dismantlers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The current licence under which the An Post National Lottery Company operates the national lottery ends on 31 March 2000.  It came into effect on 1 January 1994 and replaced the earlier licence which was granted for a period of ten years from October 1986.</P>
      <P>As the player base for the national lottery continues to grow rapidly, the company concluded that substantial investment in upgraded technology was required to enhance game support services to players, <i>inter alia</i> by facilitating improved on-line access via terminals.  Accordingly, following a public competitive tendering process, the National Lottery Company requested ministerial approval for contractual arrangements which would deliver improved technology on the most competitive terms.  In order to maximise the gains under the terms negotiated, and in recognition of the need for continuity in responding to challenges in the market place arising, for example, from the introduction of the UK lottery, the Minister for Finance agreed, following consultation with the Attorney General, to issue the fresh licence referred to above.  The licence provides for maximum gains from the investment in new technology by the National Lottery Company and a better return to the National Lottery Beneficiary Fund.</P>
      <P>The grant of a licence to operate the national lottery is subject to the provisions set out in section 3 of the National Lottery Act, 1986.  The arrangements which will apply after 31 March 2000 will be decided closer to that date.  It has not been the practice to disclose commercially sensitive information such as the fee payable to An Post in respect of the national lottery.  It would be particularly inappropriate to do so at this stage lest it influence the conduct of parties who would have an interest in the position when the existing licence to operate the national lottery expires.</P>

      <Quest>the special measures, if any, his Department will introduce such as tax incentives for the provision of industrial buildings for renting to incoming industry in view of the fact that there are no uncommitted industrial buildings available to IDA Ireland or Forbairt in County Leitrim.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of measures in operation to promote the supply of industrial buildings in areas of particular need, including the discretionary provision by IDA Ireland of rent guarantees for up to two years and the inclusion of advanced factories under the business expansion scheme.  The introduction of additional tax incentives for the provision of industrial buildings, such as accelerated capital allowances or special rent allowances, would involve a reversal of or departure from business tax policy of recent years, the central focus of which has been to reduce the standard corporation tax rate and to facilitate this by providing a wide corporate tax base.  This policy has resulted in a progressive reduction in the standard rate from 50 per cent in 1988 to 36 per cent in this year's budget with a reduced rate of 28 per cent on the first £50,000 of annual profits.</P>
      <P>I am informed that there is no evidence to suggest there is an overall shortage of industrial premises in the country at present.  While from time to time the existing supply of advance factories in a particular area may be fully allocated, IDA Ireland is satisfied that neither foreign nor indigenous industrial investment is being hampered at present by problems regarding the provision of industrial buildings.  I understand that two recent job announcements in County Leitrim were facilitated by the provision of advance factories and that two further facilities in the county are as yet unoccupied.  However, if the Deputy has particular concerns about the availability of suitable premises in the county for potential new projects, I suggest that he raise the matter with the relevant industrial agency or the local authority.</P>

Where students are in publicly funded institutions, pursuing <Col N="348" /> full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration, they can, of course, avail of the free fees initiative introduced in the 1995 budget.  I would also point out that a family with an income of £30,000 will benefit significantly from the tax improvements I introduced in the budget.</P>

      <P>In January of this year I agreed the proposal for a new remuneration package for the sheriffs and this proposal was put to the sheriffs on 24 February 1997 by the Revenue Commissioners at my request.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the terms of the proposal have been agreed by all the sheriffs.  Details of the proposal will be announced as soon as the necessary sheriffs' fees order has been drawn up by the Department of Justice.  It is expected that this revised sheriffs' fees order will be in place within the next couple of months.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am pleased to say that the revised operational guidelines for the sheriffs' operation, in relation to revenue work, have also been agreed by the sheriffs to coincide with changes to their remuneration.  These include an arrangement whereby all interest earned on moneys held by the sheriffs on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners will accrue to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>Tax concessions are provided for certain disabled persons under the disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  The reliefs include: the repayment of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) on specially constructed or adapted vehicles; the repayment of VAT on these vehicles, including VAT on the cost of adaptation; the repayment of excise duty on fuel used in a qualifying vehicle on which VRT has been repaid; and the grant of exemption from road tax on a qualifying vehicle.</P>

      <P>The GTN on-line directory service, which was developed by the centre for management and organisation development (CMOD) of my Department, was introduced in late 1995.  It operates on the basis of participating Departments and offices being responsible for the currency of their entries. While this directory service is available as a Lotus Notes database to all Departments, at this stage, 15 Government Departments and offices and the President's establishment avail of it.  The on-line directory service also provides an efficient method of collecting material for the printed version of the GTN directory which is circulated to all Departments.</P>
      <P>Difficulties of a technical nature have arisen with four of the 15 Departments availing of the service which has affected the replication of their information to the central copy of the directory in CMOD.  These have been resolved in the case of two Departments, and new procedures are being implemented in the other two Departments to ensure a smooth transfer of information to CMOD.</P>
      <P>With regard to my own Department, the use of the Lotus Notes product is currently being extended which will make it possible from May 1997 to maintain the on-line GTN directory for the Department up to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that, in addition to existing EU legislation relating to the deliberate release &mdash; field trials &mdash; and placing on the market of genetically modified organisms &mdash; which, in Ireland, is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for the Environment &mdash; the European Parliament and Council recently adopted Regulation (EC) No. 258/97 on novel foods and novel food ingredients.  Genetically modified foods come within the scope of &ldquo;novel foods&rdquo;, as set out in Article 1.2 of that Regulation.</P>
      <P>The Novel Foods Regulation is due to come into effect in all member states in mid-May of this year.  My Department has assumed responsibility for its implementation in this country.</P>
      <P>The regulation provides that novel foods and novel food ingredients must undergo a safety assessment and be officially approved/authorised before being placed on the market.  Thus, the regulation, which is an internal market measure, ensures that common rules and procedures in relation to novel foods and ingredients will apply across all member states of the European Union. I believe the controls now available under the EU legislation will provide protection for both consumers and producers but I will be keeping the matter under continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to his specific points on the labelling of novel foods, I refer the Deputy to article 8 of the Regulation.  Essentially, there must be specific labelling to inform the consumer of any characteristic <Col N="351" /> or food property, e.g. composition, nutritional value, nutritional effects, intended use of the food, which renders a novel food or novel food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.  There must also be specific labelling to advise the consumer of the presence in the novel food or novel food ingredient of:</P>
    <P>&mdash;material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population;</P>
    <P>&mdash;material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff and which gives rise to ethical concerns; or</P>
    <P>&mdash;an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification.</P>
    <P>I wish to point out that the labelling requirements for novel foods as prescribed by the above mentioned EU regulation are additional to the general food labelling provisions which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>The new Novel Food Regulation will harmonise the rules which apply in the various member states in relation to the novel foods issue and my Department is participating in discussions at EU level concerning the practicalities of the implementation process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Department has recently received correspondence from the North-Western Health Board recommending that Crohns disease be included on the list of long-term illness conditions. The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in <Col N="352" /> respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.  The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>
      <P>My Department has replied to this effect to the North-Western Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume the Deputy is referring to the indicative drug target (IDT) scheme which was introduced for general practitioners in the general medical services (GMS) scheme on 1 January 1993, following the review of the scheme in 1992 by the Department, the health boards, the Irish Medical Organisation, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the review mentioned above, it was agreed by all sides that medicines were not always prescribed in the most effective manner and that there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the available resources in the development of general practice. Accordingly, each doctor was encouraged to examine his-her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of opportunities to make <Col N="353" /> prescribing more effective and less costly for all his-her patients.  To assist in this process, doctors were provided with indicative drug targets, for patients on their panels, which had been constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted by age and sex criteria.</P>
    <P>As an incentive to doctors, the IDT scheme provided that a portion of the savings effected would be made available to the individual doctor for practice development projects which received the prior approval of the relevant health board. The balance of the savings made is allocated to the relevant health board for investment in general practice projects within the board's area.</P>
    <P>At every stage during the process of reaching agreement on the IDT scheme and in the subsequent implementation of that agreement, all the parties to the review mentioned above clearly understood and accepted that it was the duty and obligation of doctors, individually and collectively, to provide the most appropriate management and to optimally utilise the available resources for patient care.  It was and is similarly understood and accepted that the right of the doctor to prescribe for the patient as he-she considers necessary, remains in place.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied therefore, that the IDT scheme places the utmost importance on patient care from the viewpoint of safe, rational and cost effective prescribing.  It is important to point out that the IDT scheme does not provide the general practitioner with a personal remunerative advantage, rather it provides a means for investment in his-her own practice in the first instance and for other practices in the health board's area.  Such investment is to the advantage of all patients of general practitioners.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Radiotherapy services are currently available in St. Luke' Hospital, Dublin and in Cork University Hospital.  Due to the nature and very high cost of radiotherapy it is necessary to confine the resources available for the service to a limited number of locations.</P>
      <P>When preparing the national cancer strategy, which I published in November, I carefully considered the question of locating a third radiotherapy centre in the western region.  The expert advice available to me was that there must be a sufficient volume of patients for the service to maintain the high level of medical and technical expertise needed for such a high-technology unit. Unfortunately, the provision of a radiotherapy service in the western region would not appear to be appropriate at the moment on demographic grounds, but there are, of course, other considerations which would have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>However, the national cancer strategy concludes that there may be scope for developing radiotherapy services in Galway at a future stage. It indicates that: &ldquo;The case for it will be kept under review in light of demographic trends, costs and expert advice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure that there are adequate provisions for radiotherapy centres so that they can meet the demand placed on them.  With this in mind I have made funding available for significant development projects in the two existing centres &mdash; St. Luke's Hospital and Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>I will keep the question of locating a radiotherapy service in the western region under review.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that it would not be feasible to contemplate commencing the service until the major capital project to upgrade certain aspects of the hospital has been completed.  The contract for this project is being signed later this week.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Following Government decisions of 20 February 1996 on measures to reduce the demand for drugs the North-Eastern Health Board published a detailed service plan in April 1996 aimed at combating the drug problem in the north eastern area.  Included in this plan was the proposal for the establishment of rapid response teams. Each team would include: a team leader with particular expertise in working with vulnerable children and adults; a youth leader with strong community links; a social worker dedicated to supporting families; a specialist teacher with a track record of involvement in this area; an input from the child and adolescent services and adult mental services and assessment and treatment counselling services.</P>
      <P>During 1996 my Department allocated £100,000 to the board to allow it commence with the implementation of its service plan to address drug misuse.  This sum allowed for the establishment of a rapid response team and for the recruitment of five additional staff.  This team works mainly in the Drogheda-south Meath area.  The staff have been deployed to these areas because a significant drug misuse problem had been identified there.  A further £60,000 has been allocated to the board in 1997 for continued expansion of its drugs services and discussions are currently taking place with my Department on further developments.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Lotus Notes Government Telecommunications Network telephone directory has been used within my Department since early 1996.  The database is also used by other Lotus <Col N="357" /> Notes applications within the Department.  At present only the records relevant to departmental staff are updated regularly for use within the Department.  My Department does not at present replicate this database with CMOD as errors occurred while copying the database last summer. These errors, if continued would have seriously compromised the integrity of other databases within the Department.  In order to surmount these difficulties it has been decided to separate out the Department of Health phone list and the CMOD composite list into two different databases. This work has begun in my Department and it is intended to resume replication when it is complete.</P>
      <P>The responsibility for updating and maintaining the database with regard to Department of Health records only rests with the Corporate Services Division of the Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Between 1993 and 1996, additional revenue funding totalling £6 million has been provided for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, including the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>The provision of aids and appliances in the Galway area is a matter for the Western Health Board.  In 1995 and 1996, the board allocated £133,000 towards the provision of aids and appliances and equipment for services for people with disabilities, including a tracking system to enable a more efficient and effective use of existing appliances.  One million pounds has been provided this year for the development of services for people with disabilities.  The Western Health Board will discuss with its co-ordinating committee on physical handicap services the priorities for the allocation of its share of this additional funding, including the provision of aids and appliances.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Mater Hospital has submitted an outline preliminary proposal for a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme.  The cost of the proposal from the Mater Hospital which would include additional cardiac surgery is: capital cost, £2.6 million; revenue cost, £2.4 million per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would involve the employment of an <Col N="360" /> additional 45 staff.  In addition, the Mater Hospital has informed my Department that it considers that it would be uneconomic to initiate a lung and heart-lung transplantation programme on its own without incorporating extra open heart surgery.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a successful transplant programme for any speciality is an extremely complex and difficult task.  It is essential to have appropriately trained staff, suitable infrastructure and a multi disciplinary approach to ensure successful outcomes.  The Department's recent experience with the successful liver transplant programme bears this out.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by patients requiring lung or heart-lung transplants. I am considering the issues involved with a view to alleviating the difficulties for these patients, both in the short and long-term.  In the light of the experience gained in establishing the liver transplant programme, it is likely that a phased approach will be adopted, recognising the need to build expertise and to create a programme that is viable in terms of the outcomes for patients.</P>

      <Quest>when funds will be provided by his Department for the restoration of the old courthouse, that is the former county council offices at Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim in view of the fact that his Department objected to the proposals for the site by Leitrim County Council.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In September 1994, in response to a newspaper report that Carrick-on-Shannon courthouse was in danger of destruction because of plans by Leitrim County Council to demolish it and build new civic offices on the site, I called on the county council to consult and take the advice of the then National Heritage Council before coming to any decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October 1994, the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, informed the county council that he would be reluctant to approve its proposals for the domolition of the building and the construction of new civic offices on the site in view of the building's significant architectural merit.  He indicated to the council that if it was not possible to provide modern office accommodation to meet the council's <Col N="364" /> requirements within the fabric of the courthouse building (if restored), he would favourably consider a proposal for a new building on a green field site elsewhere.  He asked the council to simultaneously explore options for alternative cultural-heritage or other uses for the courthouse.</P>
    <P>As I stated in my reply to Question No. 100 of 6 February 1996, the council informed me it had been advised that the former courthouse would not be suitable for restoration for use as civic offices but would be suitable for use as an interpretative centre-museum, and that it had, therefore, decided to proceed with the provision of new civic offices at another location.  It requested that consideration be given to the Office of Public Works taking over the courthouse for development as an interpretative centre, with particular reference to interpretation of the Shannon-Erne navigation.  In August 1995 I wrote to Leitrim County Council, informing it that the Heritage Service of my Department already owned waterfront property upstream and downstream of Carrick-on-Shannon bridge, as well as premises in Rooskey where there was ample space for development, and stating that the best option for the preservation of the building was to keep it in active use as a courthouse.  Subsequently, I was informed by the Minister for Justice that the cost of restoration of the building for continued use as a courthouse would substantially exceed the cost of constructing a new courthouse and was therefore not a viable option.  I understand that the county council is currently discussing with the Heritage Council the question of the future use of the building.</P>
    <P>An application has been received by my Department under phase II of the cultural development incentives scheme, (CDIS) 1994-99, for the development of the building as an integrated arts and culture centre.  I have taken decisions as to the allocation, in principle, of grant assistance in respect of a number of applications received under phase II off the CDIS.  The application in respect of the Carrick-on-Shannon arts and culture centre project has not been successful at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, in anticipation of the possibility that some of the applications which have received offers, in principle, of grant assistance under phases I and II of the CDIS will not go ahead within the timescale of the current round of Structural Funds, I am drawing up a stand-by list of projects which may be considered for assistance in due course in this eventuality.  I hope to be in a position to make my decision on the projects to be included in that list in the very near future.</P>

As I stated on that day, the UK Secretary of State for National Heritage has informed that, subject to the resolution of certain practical and financial issues, she is favourable to the proposed increase on a phased basis in the power northwards at the Clermont Carn transmitter site in County Louth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>In establishing Ireland's national parks, Irish Governments, on the advice of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), have adopted the criteria set down by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, (IUCN), the World Conservation Union for National Parks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national park is defined by the IUCN as a &ldquo;natural area of land and-or sea, designated to (a) protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for present and future generations, (b) to exclude exploitation or occupation inimical to the purposes of designation of the area and (c) provide a foundation for spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities, <Col N="366" /> all of which must be environmentally and culturally compatible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is my view &mdash; as it has been the view of successive Irish Governments &mdash; that hunting or sport shooting are incompatible with these three objectives.  Hunting or sport shooting are, therefore, not permitted in Irish national parks and I do not propose to alter this approach.  I am advised by the NPWS that most managers of IUCN category II protected areas &mdash; national parks &mdash; support this prohibition.</P>
    <P>In a recent letter to the NPWS the IUCN confirm that &ldquo;IUCN provides technical background and experience on protected areas and many other environmental issues, but it is up to each country to decide how to apply them.&rdquo;  The letter also goes on to state that &ldquo;if hunting is against some of the objectives of the national parks in Ireland, the provision of forbidding hunting is absolutely valid.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 132 together.</P>
      <P>Stage 1 of the Burren and north Clare water services plan, which includes a proposal for improved water and sewage treatment facilities for Lisdoonvarna, was submitted to the European Commission for Cohesion Fund assistance in November 1994.  My Department is in contact with the Commission on an ongoing basis in an effort to secure Cohesion Funding and has written to the Commission pointing out the importance of these high priority projects.</P>
      <P>A revised preliminary report for the Lisdoonvarna sewerage scheme, with revised contract documents for the Lisdoonvarna water supply scheme, are being examined in my Department with a view to an early decision on both.  The two schemes have been included in my Department's water and sewerage services work programme to be advanced through planning &mdash; design in 1997. However, pending a decision on Cohesion Funding, I cannot say when construction will commence.</P>

      <P>Part IV of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, provided for the designation by individual local authorities of special control areas, subject to confirmation by the Minister for the Environment.  However, the policy was adopted in 1990 of applying coal bans by means of a prohibition on the marketing, sale and distribution of coal within specified areas.  This approach is based on regulations under section 53 of the Air Pollution Act, 1987, made by the Minister for the Environment to whom local authorities are, of course, free to make representations, based on local environmental conditions.  These arrangements, in practice, supersede the designation of special control areas by local authorities under the 1987 Act.</P>

The provisions in the Bill will apply to travellers who are tenants of local authority housing, whether standard housing or group housing, in the same way as to any other tenant.</P>
      <P>I believe that the issue of applying, in the case of travellers halting sites, similar measures to those in the Housing Bill should be considered in the context of the legislation being prepared arising from the National Strategy on Traveller Accommodation.

      <Quest>the measures, if any, she intends to take to resolve the anomaly which exists whereby mature students applying for third level grants from their home address are classified as dependent and their parent's income is taken into account whereas if they apply independently from their college address it is probable they will be assessed for the adjacent rate of grant payment only.</Quest>

      <P>Under the 1996 higher education grant scheme, independent mature students are defined to be mature students who are not ordinarily resident at home with their parents.  Their entitlement to a grant is assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address.</P>
      <P>The address of independent mature students for the purpose of determining the rate of grant payable is their residence for the purpose of attending college.  If this address is within 15 miles of the college, the adjacent rate of grant is payable. If the address is more than 15 miles from the college, the non-adjacent rate of grant is payable.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 1995-96 academic year, the normal residence of independent mature students was their address in the previous October.  The non-adjacent rate of maintenance grant was payable where the students's normal residence was more than 15 miles from the college being attended.  There is however provision within the scheme for local authorities to review the rate of grant payable where there is a change in the student's normal residence.  This provision effectively allowed local authorities to award an adjacent rate of grant if the student's residence for the purpose of attending college was with in 15 miles of the college.</P>
      <P>The 1995 scheme standardised the approach to be adopted by local authorities.  Furthermore, where independent mature students can produce evidence that they are maintaining a residence other than their address while attending college and the non-college residence is more than 15 miles from the college, provision was made to allow local authorities to regard that address as the normal residence and to award a non-adjacent maintenance grant.</P>
      <P>To award the non-adjacent rate to independent mature students irrespective of their address would in effect involve creating a new category within the grant scheme.  This would in turn be likely to lead to demands that this category be applied to all students.  Such a course would involve additional expenditure of about £11 million per annum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 and 166 together.</P>
      <P>Remedial teacher posts are allocated to schools on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department following the collection and analysis of data from schools, by my Department's inspectorate.  The allocation of such posts is also subject to resource availability in any given year.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teachers to primary schools. Since my appointments as Minister for Education, I have allocated an additional 241 remedial teachers to the primary sector.  A total of 1,188 remedial teachers are now in place and the percentage of pupils who have access to a remedial service has increased from 77 per cent to 87 per cent.</P>
      <P>However, as Minister for Education, I have to consider how best to deploy available resources across a wide range of special needs.  I have to determine priorities and try to allocate resources to best effect.</P>
      <P>In the current year, I have adopted a particular focus on children who suffer from educational disadvantage and have sought to target resources into these area in an effort to break the cycle of disadvantage.  As part of this approach, I recently launched a major new initiative aimed at bringing special targeted assistance to children in selected urban and rural areas who suffer serious educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that since my appointment as Minister for Education I have achieved substantial advances across the entire spectrum of special needs, including the remedial area.  It is my intention to continue this process.</P>
      <P>When I am next in a position to extend the remediation service, the needs of the schools in question will receive every consideration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at present to allocate a resource teacher to the schools in question.  My capacity to allocate such posts in any given year is dependent on resource availability in that year. Ten resource teacher posts were recently allocated by my Department to schools in the primary sector.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data from primary schools by my Department's primary inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The special educational needs of pupils attending the schools mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any future allocation of resource teacher posts.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.</P>
      <P>Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged area scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The schools in question were selected by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
      <P>In the event of additional resources becoming available for special needs areas, the needs of the schools in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made in the 1997 Capital Programme for the construction of a physical education hall at St. Mac Dara's community college. The present position is that the architectural planning of the project is proceeding and the planning and building unit of my Department is examining the outline sketch scheme.  When the scheme has been found to be satisfactory, the project will proceed to the next stage of planning which is the developed sketch scheme.</P>
      <P>At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the planning will be completed or when construction will commence.  However the project will continue to be accorded a high priority in my Department and every effort will be made to ensure that the planning of the project is completed as quickly as possible with a view to inviting tenders immediately.</P>

      <P>Of the 36 psychologists employed by my Department at present, 18 work in schools in Dublin city and county.  Of these, eight are working in second-level schools, nine are in primary schools, and one psychologist works in both primary and post-primary <Col N="393" /> schools.  There are also two senior psychologists employed in a supervisory capacity who are based in Dublin.</P>
      <P>These psychologists are available, as resources allow, to assess pupils at both levels.  At second-level, all schools have a psychologist assigned to them.  At primary level, the Department of Education's service is only available to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  In addition, the pilot service established in 1990 in West Tallaght-Clondalkin has been continued as a permanent service.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Department of Education's service, the city of Dublin vocational education committee employs four psychologists, one of whom is at senior level, for schools within its scheme and County Dublin vocational committee employs two psychologists for a similar purpose. Psychological services are also provided by the health authorities.  For children in national schools, it is the responsibility of the appropriate regional health board director of community care to arrange for psychological intervention where such is deemed necessary.  These services are provided in clinical and other settings by the regional health boards.  They are also provided by voluntary bodies supported by the health authorities. Information on numbers of clinical psychologists who are working with school pupils would be a matter for the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>There is no separate secondary level special education section in my Department.</P>
      <P>Where special needs children are concerned, the nature and severity of the disability, rather than the chronological age of the child, is the key factor in determining the educational response.  In some cases, special needs children are capable of being accommodated in ordinary primary or second level schools, with the help if necessary of remedial teachers, resource teachers or visiting teachers.</P>
      <P>In cases involving more serious disabilities, placement in a special school or special class attached to an ordinary first or second level school, may be the most appropriate response. The special schools and special classes can cater for children from four to 18 years of age.</P>
      <P>My Department's special education section plays the pivotal role in the development and delivery of special education services.  Where appropriate, the special education section liaises with other sections in the Department at primary and post-primary level to ensure an effective and efficient delivery of special support services.</P>

      <P>Under the free fees initiative, the State meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending full-time undergraduate courses, which must generally be of at least two years duration, at approved colleges.  Over 28,000 students benefited under the initiative in 1995-96 at a cost to the Exchequer of £54.5 million in 1996.  The costs associated with the initiative have been offset by the savings from the abolition of regressive covenant tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no plans to extend the scope of the free fees initiative to include the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI).  Indeed, the RCSI has <Col N="396" /> written to my Department stating that while the college will be part of the CAO system of entry from the commencement of the 1997-98 academic year, it does not wish to be considered for inclusion in the free fees initiative at present.  Any extension of the free fees initiative would have to be considered in the light of overall resource constraints.  In this regard, I would point out that tax relief is available at the standard rate, on fees paid to the RCSI in accordance with the provisions contained in section 6 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day running costs of primary schools, including the costs of purchasing general equipment, are funded by means of the capitation grant scheme and the contribution from local sources.</P>
      <P>The level of capitation funding has increased significantly in recent years.  In 1992, the grant per pupil was £28.  For the current school year, the rate of grant is £45.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the increased level of capitation grant achieved in recent years provides practical confirmation of my commitment to the primary school sector.  It is my intention to continue to review needs in this area.</P>
      <P>Where more specialised equipment is required to meet the needs of children with disabilities, my Department can make special funding available. If any of the schools in question have such a need they should make application to the special education section of my Department.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that their position in relation to the provision of a Garda sub-station at Donabate-Portrane remains as stated in my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 188 of 6 February 1996 that, is, that the Garda authorities are not convinced that the opening of a new Garda station at Portrane-Donabate is justified given the fact that apart from the capital cost involved, it would absorb personnel which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties.</P>
      <P>They will, however, continue to keep the policing arrangements in Donabate-Portrane under continual review and adjustments will be made as necessary.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that this dealing refers to an application for First Registration which was lodged on 8 June 1993.  There are a number of difficult issues to be resolved in this application including the nature of the title involved and the interests of the State in the foreshore. It is not, therefore, possible to estimate a completion date at this stage.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there is approximately an 11 month delay in having judgement marked in the Circuit Court Office in Dublin; her views on whether the delay is totally unacceptable since in many cases the judgment details will be totally out of date; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed that there is currently a delay of between nine and 11 months in having judgments marked in the Dublin Circuit Court Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that there should be any delay in the processing of cases and I have arranged that the staff in the Dublin Circuit Court Office will be deployed on overtime and also during the upcoming court vacation period commencing on 21 March, to tackle the arrears of judgments to be marked.  I am informed that it is not true to say that due to delays, judgment details will be out of date.  This will not be the case so long as an <Col N="406" /> affidavit of debt has been lodged with the Circuit Court Office, and this is part of the normal process, within 14 days of the swearing thereof.</P>
    <P>I am also informed that if any litigant is experiencing exceptional difficulties due to a delay in having a judgment marked and his solicitor makes representations to the County Registrar, the County Registrar will endeavour to mark judgment in such a case.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the files of a person (details supplied) in County Meath who has disabilities and who has an income from his Department which over the past three years has been cut back due to insistence by the Department of Finance that these payments are now liable for tax in view of the fact that this pensioner has no other income.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of the maximum disablement pension of £88.20 per week for life in respect of an assessment of 100 per cent disablement.  In addition he receives an invalidity pension of £81.40 per week, i.e., £66.20 personal rate plus half rate child dependant increase of £15.20 in respect of his two children. His wife is in receipt of £80.70 carer's allowance in respect of him, i.e., £67.50 personal rate plus half rate child dependant increase of £13.20 for two children.</P>
      <P>The current household income from my Department less child benefit comes to £250.30 weekly.  This represents an increase of £22.05 over the past three years and the 1997 budget improvements adds a further £9 to this from June of this year.  In addition he has a free travel pass, electricity allowance and telephone rental allowance and his wife receives child benefit in respect of their two children.</P>

      <P>The number of persons on the live register in each county on 26 January 1996 and on 31 January 1997 is contained in Table 1.</P>
      <P>Two estimates of the labour force are compiled by the Central Statistics Office from responses given in the annual Labour Force Survey conducted in April/May each year.  As labour force data are not published by the Central Statistics Office on a county basis and because the Labour Force Survey does not relate to the dates specified by the Deputy, the live register data as a percentage of the workforce requested by the Deputy are not available.</P>
      <P>Labour force data are published in respect of the eight regional authorities.  Tables 2 and 3 show the two estimates of the workforce in each of these regions, including the number and percentage of those who were unemployed, as found in the April 1996 labour force survey.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>A necessary feature of the social welfare system is that it must be flexible enough to respond adequately to the differing needs of the various categories of social welfare recipients.  The different methods of assessing earnings as between the various payment schemes reflect specific policies being pursued by my Department, which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention, for example, family income supplement for people working who have dependent children, revised arrangements or unemployment assistance for <Col N="412" /> part-time workers, retention of adult dependant allowances for people whose spouse is working, in certain circumstances, retention of child dependant allowances for people who are working, in certain circumstances, and the back-towork allowance scheme for long-term unemployed people taking up work.</P>
      <P>In the case of the one-parent family payment (OFP) the unemployment assistance schemes are not directly comparable.  While title to unemployment assistance is based on the claimant being unemployed, OFP addresses the contingency of lone parenthood and title is not based on the employment status of the claimant.  Research has clearly shown that lone parent families are vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion, and the OFP is designed as an income support mechanism to take into account the special needs and requirements of persons parenting alone and maintaining a household.</P>
      <P>It is also aimed at facilitating lone parents to return to the workforce by providing positive support so that, over time, they can become less reliant on social welfare payments for their income needs.  This is the rationale behind disregarding a lone parent's earnings up to £6,000 a year for means purposes.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, earnings disregards applying to other social assistance schemes are designed to achieve different objectives.  The method of assessing earnings for unemployment assistance (UA) purposes is now simplified so that where a person works for up to three days a week, earnings are now assessed at 60 per cent. This is designed to improve the incentive for unemployed people to take up casual and parttime work opportunities.  A further improvement in relation to earnings disregards, which I am introducing in this year's Social Welfare Bill, is that where the spouse of an UA recipient is working and earning over £60 a week, an adult dependant allowance will continue to be paid on the UA claim, at a reducing rate, until the spouse's earnings exceed £90 a week.  At present, the adult dependant allowance is withdrawn once earnings exceed £60 a week.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that in the best interests of social welfare recipients generally the system needs to retain a degree of flexibility to respond effectively to the differing needs of those who depend on it, and that this is best achieved by specific policies geared towards tackling the particular needs of various groups of recipients.</P>

      <P>My Department has been advised by the Chief State Solicitor's office that the Taxing Master made his findings on the basis of two bills of costs, the first involving 2,907 plaintiffs in 15 proceedings and the second involving 696 plaintiffs in eight proceedings.</P>
      <P>The first bill of costs including Revenue Commissioners, stamp duty on the taxation was £2,435,431.21.  The Taxing Master reduced this claim by £989,083.13 leaving a balance of £1.446 million made up of £1.128 million professional fees and the balance of £.318 million to cover VAT, postage and incidental costs.</P>
      <P>The total amount claimed on the second bill of costs, including Revenue Commissioners stamp duty on the taxation was £666,716.65.  The Taxing Master reduced this by £.210 million leaving a balance £456,051.30, made up of professional fees £.353 million and the balance of £.102 million to cover VAT, postage and incidental costs.</P>
      <P>With the agreement of my Department and on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor's office are raising objections to the Taxing Master's findings in so far as they concern solicitor's and counsel's fees and the matter is currently under appeal to the Taxing Master.</P>

    <P>With a wide range of competitive air fares and improving surface access, short breaks are also popular, particularly out of peak season and this sector presents good opportunities for growth not only to Dublin but to other city destinations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, a comprehensive promotional campaign under the domestic tourism marketing initiative was launched in February 1997 to increase the frequency and incidence of holidays in the home market.  This campaign features, as part of its strategy, comprehensive advertising in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-9 includes a provision whereby assistance will be provided for the continued development of <i>inter alia,</i> walking holiday routes and the extension and upgrading of the existing range of such routes in association with Cospóir, the National Sports Council.</P>
      <P>On a limited basis, the programme also includes provision to assist investment in a small number of market segments where existing specialist accommodation quality is deficient, including, caravan and camping park facilities; upgrading and improving existing buildings for hostel or other specialist accommodation and associated facilities on branded walking routes; and provision of new and improved accommodation at approved outdoor pursuits centres in remote areas currently without appropriate accommodation.</P>
      <P>In general, in keeping with the overall strategy in the programme, support is aimed primarily at the enhancement of existing investment rather than supporting new development and all accommodation supported must be registered or approved, as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point, funds provided under the programme for tourism development projects are generally over-subscribed and, specifically, those available for specialist accommodation related developments are fully committed.  These and other aspects of the programme's operations are being considered fully in the context of the current <Col N="415" /> mid-term evaluation of the programme.  I am not in a position at this stage to anticipate the findings of this review.</P>
    <P>Other EU funded programmes such as the Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry and the Leader II Programme administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Local Urban and Rural Development Programme provide support for smaller tourism initiatives.  In the Border counties assistance may also be available under the IFI and INTERREG Programmes and the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, again on a limited basis.  This includes limited provision for accommodation projects, including, in some cases, guesthouses and bed and breakfast establishments, on a basis compatible with that in the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>

Provision for tourism projects is also made in a number of other Community initiatives such as the INTERREG II programmes, both Northern Ireland and Maritime, and the special programme for peace and reconciliation which are administered by the Department of Finance.

      <P>The pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995 and operates for a three year period from 1 July 1995.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in the areas designated.  The 15 areas designated, including Bundoran, County Donegal, were selected in order to give an even spread around the coast of designated resort areas.</P>
      <P>Reports received to date suggest that the scheme has been successful in attracting a significant level of investment.  However, preliminary findings also suggest some variance of the level of overall investment between the designated areas and in terms of the tourism project type supported.  Circumstances such as the long lead in time for capital projects, the planning process etc. inhabit the regional tourism authorities ability to establish an exact breakdown of investment at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, from time to time, I have consulted with the Minister for Finance, who has primary responsibility for the scheme, about the possibility of extending it but we have agreed not to make any changes to its scope or to designate any new areas until the present three year pilot period has elapsed and a full evaluation has been completed. At this point it is simply too early to say what the outcome of the evaluation could be.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a question on 26 November 1996, the Tourism Council considered the terms for a special seasonability programme for spring of this year.  The approach taken was that the events under the programme, which is essentially a pump priming exercise to test the off-season impact of such a festival, should take place in four cities initially, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> The reason for this was, as the Celtic Flame Festival is a new festival, designed to broaden the appeal of the country to visitors in the off-season leading up to St. Patrick's Day celebrations, the four locations selected were perceived by the Tourism Council to have the ability to best cope with tourists at that time of year and provide a good pilot basis for testing the concept.  In particular, the availability of accommodation, the general infrastructure required by visitors and the availability of suitable venues to accommodate the expected numbers to the concerts were major considerations.</P>
    <P>The results of this year's venture should help establish the viability of other venues participating in the festival, should it succeed in its aim of generating off-peak business, in future years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219, 220 and 224 together.</P>
      <P>Considerable efforts continue to be made by the agencies for which I have responsibility, both in generating the maximum level of new employment by encouraging both foreign and indigenous enterprise to set up in both counties and by other measures administered by FÁS, such as the community employment scheme, which directly address unemployment needs in the area.</P>
      <P>In 1996, over 441 persons in Sligo and 222 in Leitrim participated in FÁS-run training courses. In addition, in 1996 1,062 persons participated in FÁS schemes in Sligo, with 611 participating in Leitrim.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards in both counties are also actively involved in effectively complementing the work of the State agencies such as FÁS and Forbairt, by promoting the development of indigenous small and micro-enterprise potential and stimulating economic activity at local level.  In 1996, enterprises assisted by the two respective enterprise boards created 68 full-time and 45 part-time new jobs in Sligo; in Leitrim 55 such full-time jobs were created.</P>
      <P>The following tables show provisional numbers of new jobs, based on the Forfás Employment Survey, which were created in IDA and Forbairt assisted companies in Sligo and Leitrim from 1994 to 1996:</P>

    <P>Forbairt only assists those overseas industries in the food and natural resources sectors.  About 110 people are now employed in Forbairt client companies in these sectors in counties Sligo and Leitrim. Significant developments under way in the two counties include the construction of the Masonite plant in County Leitrim.  In June it is planned to start production of door skins on the first production line with the second production line due to be in production by early 1998.</P>
    <P>Over the past six months the company has recruited in excess of 100 employees who have undergone training in the US and in Ireland. Total employment now stands at 156 people and it is likely to rise to its target of 330 by early 1998.</P>
    <P>On 24 February, I announced that two new investments by overseas companies, with the support of IDA Ireland, will create 100 new jobs in County Leitrim.  Lilly Industries which will create 12 new jobs in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, is a major supplier of building products coatings to Masonite in the US.  Its County Leitrim plant is a direct response to a request from Masonite to establish an operation close to its new Irish facility for the supply of white paper and a clear coat product.  In addition, Westmark of Germany, a manufacturer of mechanical kitchen aids, will create 88 new jobs in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>Industrial land and buildings are also being developed at the Finiskilin estate in Sligo and this, together with other vacant building space in the county, will be aggressively promoted this year with the objective of attracting new investment.</P>
    <P>I have again recently reinforced and emphasised with the industrial development agencies Government policy on the regional distribution of employment opportunities.  There are, however, limitations to the extent to which that policy can be enforced nationally in relation to inward investment projects.  In the final analysis, individual foreign investors themselves decide on the particular locations which best suit their own range of requirements.  The strategy being undertaken by the industrial development agencies to ensure the best possible regional spread of new employment opportunities is fully informed by the need to anticipate and meet the requirements of potential investors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 222 and 223 together.</P>
      <P>Limited resources do not make it possible to provide Community Employment (CE) for all long-term unemployed people.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the programme at those most in need, such as persons in receipt of an unemployment compensation payment or persons in receipt of certain means tested social welfare payments. In line with this both men and women married or single who fulfil any of the following eligibility criteria can participate on CE:</P>
      <P>CE Part-Time Integration Option</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; 21 years or age or over and on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&nbsp; Special categories such as those referred by the NRB, or travellers on the live register, or on one-parent family payment for at least 12 months.</P>
      <P>CE Part-Time Job Option</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="421" />&mdash;&nbsp; 35 years of age or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or one-parent family payment for three years or longer.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; Special categories such as those referred by the NRB who are aged 35 or over, or travellers who are on the live register or on one-parent family payment for at least 12 months.</P>
    <P>In addition, persons with children who are in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or survivor's contributory pension can apply to transfer to one-parent family payment in order to become eligible to participate in CE.  Also married unemployed people can swop their social welfare entitlement in order to qualify for participation on the programme.  In this way, a married person who meets the eligibility criteria can transfer entitlement to his or her spouse, who is unemployed but not on the live register, in order for that person to qualify for participation on CE.</P>
    <P>These eligibility criteria only came into effect last year following a detailed review of CE and in response to the recommendations of the task force on long-term unemployment.  They were designed to target the programme at those priority groups already referred to.  I have no plans at present to widen the eligibility criteria. However, I do of course keep all programmes under constant scrutiny in so far as their objectives and effectiveness are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to FÁS mainstream training-specific skills training programmes I would point out that all unemployed people, including women in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or persons in receipt of a survivor's contributory pension, are eligible to participate in these programmes.  Also from time to time FÁS offer return-to-work courses for women who wish to return to the workforce.</P>

      <P>I understand that funding for the provision of advance factories in the southern Border counties does not fall within the ambit of the special support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. It would, therefore, not be appropriate for me to seek the funding requested by the Deputy.  Furthermore, Forbairt has no responsibility for the provision of advance factory space. Responsibility for same has, since January 1996, rested with IDA Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current policy in relation to the provision of factory space is that it will, in future, be provided by the private sector.  IDA Ireland will promote <Col N="422" /> all advance factory space provided by the private sector and will, in addition, encourage the private sector to provide advance factories in selected locations.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland seeks to ensure that the supply of advance factories in any area matches the demand.  This ensures that factories are not vacant for long periods and that private investors receive a return on their investments.</P>
    <P>I understand that there are two advance factories, each of 11,000 sq. ft., in County Leitrim at present.  They are located at Drumshambo and Rooskey.  Both are currently reserved for projects. There are also two vacant units of 3,160 sq. ft. each in Manorhamilton.</P>
    <P>Two projects have recently been announced for other advance factories in Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballinamore.</P>

      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that motor vehicles were exempted from detailed price control on the recommendation of the former National Prices Commission in April 1975.</P>
      <P>Principal among the reasons for this exemption was the intense competition for market share, in part based on prices and partly on the technical design and performance of the various categories of motor vehicles.  In the meantime there is no evidence that competition in the marketplace has declined, particularly in view now of the large diversity of suppliers and the multiplicity of car models on offer to consumers.</P>

      <P>Dublin and the east region generally have been very successful in securing a large proportion of inward investment projects over the last number of years.  The record rate of growth for 1996 recently reported by IDA Ireland, in terms of its national performance, is due very substantially to the exceptional capability of the east region to attract so high a proportion of mobile investment.</P>
      <P>Job creation performance by Forbairt companies has also been exceptional, resulting in a 1996 cumulative net gain in job numbers in IDA Ireland and Forbairt assisted companies in the Dublin region of 5,841.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> Furthermore, CEB's in the Dublin region have since their establishment approved almost 700 projects which have resulted in the creation of over 1,000 full time jobs.  Overall, the Labour Force Survey shows that in the year to April 1996, employment in Dublin grew by a record 26,200 or 7 per cent on the previous year.  I am confident that Dublin will continue this strong performance in 1997 and beyond.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these successes, there is a need to continue impacting on high unemployment and its concentration in certain parts of Dublin.  A recent announcement that the Local Employment Service will be established in four additional locations, with three of them in Dublin-Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Ballyfermot, reflect my determination to tackle this problem.</P>

    <P>The County Enterprise Board created 67 full time and 23 part-time jobs in Donegal in 1996.  Job loss figures are not available.  Notwithstanding these disappointing results, there were a number of positive developments in Donegal during 1996 as follows:</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland appointed a development manager to work with a select number of companies in the North West/Donegal region with a view to expanding their existing operations;</P>
    <P>On the greenfield investment side, IDA Ireland continues to market Donegal to overseas companies, with a number of small vacant buildings and industrial sites in various locations including Buncrana, Carndonagh, Moville, Ballyshannon and Letterkenny being promoted for overseas investment;</P>
    <P>In 1996, IDA agreed with Donegal County Council to develop a Business Park in Letterkenny. Work on this initiative has been ongoing and a full planning application will shortly be submitted to the council.  As soon as <Col N="424" /> planning permission and services have been put in place, work will commence on the park which will include the construction of a 25,000 sq. ft. advance building.  This will enhance the area's attractiveness to potential investors and will assist IDA in marketing the area to potential overseas clients.</P>
    <P>The recently announced greater focus by IDA on smaller regional centres should help to ensure that these developments in Donegal are exploited to the maximum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 236, 239 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>A submission to establish a new category of Extremely Disadvantaged Areas in Ireland was transmitted to the EU Commission on 3 October 1996, and was formally presented to the Commission on 9 October 1996.</P>
      <P>The Commission is carrying out a technical examination of the submission, involving discussions with my Department.  Until this process has been completed, it is not possible to say for certain which areas will be approved for reclassification as extremely disadvantaged.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate to comment on the inclusion or otherwise of specific areas in the submission prior to final approval being received from the Commission.</P>
      <P>I expect that discussions with the Commission on extremely disadvantaged areas will commence in the near future.  However, since the proposal envisages additional payment to farmers in the new areas, the implementation of the measures will not involve a separate application from farmers but rather a &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; on the normal application in respect of the relevant schemes.</P>

      <P>In this regard my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is presently examining the suitability of an office in Tallaght. This area would be much more convenient for farmers in north and south County Dublin and east Wicklow than the present location of the office in Dublin city centre.  If our accommodation requirements in terms of space and car parking facilities can be adequately met it is hoped that a new office will be opened in Tallaght later this year.  In the meantime it would not be practical or economical to relocate the office on a temporary basis in any other area in the district.</P>

      <P>The importation of livestock from other EU member states is governed by a number of EU directives which establish the animal health conditions for such trade, e.g. &mdash; Council Directive 64/432 on trade in cattle and pigs; Council Directive 91/68 on trade in sheep and goats.  Any livestock imported into Ireland must comply with the terms of these directives and, where appropriate, must be accompanied by the health certificate laid down by the relevant directive. Except where otherwise prescribed by the directive in question, I am unable to apply additional health guarantees to such trade.</P>
      <P>As it is not always possible to apportion the blame for an outbreak of contagious disease in a herd or flock to imported or domestic animals, statistics of the type referred to by the Deputy are not maintained by my Department.  However, a small number of outbreaks of mycoplasma bovis, Johnes disease and warble fly infestation discovered in herds have been attributed by the veterinary services of my Department to imported animals.  Voluntary codes of practice which set out additional health requirements in relation to the import of the major livestock groups are in place and I have on many previous occasions exhorted livestock importers to adhere strictly to the provisions of these codes.</P>

      <P>Pesticide usage in Ireland is low by European standards.  Plant diseases, weeds and pests in agricultural crops are controlled by good husbandry practices, better technology, improved varieties of seeds, biological methods of control and plant protection products.  In the case of plant protection products the regulatory system in this country ensures that no unacceptable influence on the environment should occur in terms of contamination of soil, water and air and effects on non-target species.</P>

    <P>My Department's policy as regards the marketing of and use of pesticides embraces the concept of reducing the amounts used to the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect.  Financial support is already available to encourage farmers to convert to organic production &mdash; the rural environment protection scheme contains a supplementary measure which provides generous extra payments to REPS farmers in organic production, and the Department's operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry, 1994-99 contains a scheme of aid for the <Col N="430" /> development of the organic farming sector.

      <P>A number of conditions had to apply when the Appeals Panel were considering areas for reclassification as more severely handicapped. One of these was that if an area did not join onto an existing or proposed more severely handicapped area, then it must form part of a block of at least 15,000 hectares in extent, all of which must satisfy the basic conditions relating to income and land quality, before the panel could consider it for reclassification.  The EU Commission require non-contiguous areas to be a <Col N="432" /> reasonably large size before they can be considered for inclusion.</P>
      <P>An appeal was received from a Slievenamon group, in respect of seven townlands covering three district electoral divisions in this area.  The total area appealed amounted to some 2,500 hectares. As this area is not adjacent to an existing more severely handicapped area, and since the total area appealed was well below the minimum area of 15,000 hectares required for such island areas, the Appeals Panel had no option but to omit this area from their considerations.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas now extend over some 75 per cent of the land area of the State, and more severely handicapped areas account for almost 79 per cent of all disadvantaged areas. Given these figures, I believe that the EU Commission would not be receptive to any further demands for changes to Ireland's less favoured areas, apart from some small amendments resulting from genuine omissions from the areas approved in 1995 and 1996.</P>

In this context I have increased the amount of the restructured milk pool which must be set aside for new entrants to dairying.  The definition of new entrants under the scheme has been expanded to include young produces who have acquired small quotas in recent years.  I have also asked the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal to address the situation of these recently entered small scale producers in so far as possible within the current year.  The broader issue of providing quota to new entrants is an ongoing matter of discussion within the milk quota review group and I have accepted that group's recommendation in relation to this category for the coming year.</P>

      <P>The level of ewe premium in any year is determined by the average prices paid in the EU market for that year.  During 1996, both the EU and Irish market prices for lamb were at record levels from March onwards, due to buoyant consumer demand.  Irish lamb producers who sold their lambs in 1996 benefited from prices about 21 per cent better than those available in the previous year.  The premium is designed to compensate producers for poor market returns and so in a year of good prices the premium paid is inevitably lower.  Overall, however, the combination of market prices and premium in 1996 resulted in a significant improvement in returns to producers compared to 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 269, 272, 273 and 275 together.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that other areas of the country should have the same choice of energy sources as those now served by the gas network.  Accordingly, I asked Bord Gáis to carry out a detailed investigation of the possibility of a major extension of the network.  I am considering the board's report on the study and I am having discussions with Bord Gáis in that regard.  No application has been made for EU funding for this purpose.  No funds have been allocated for gas network extensions under the 1994-99 economic infrastructure operational programme.  EU funding for energy projects under the trans-European energy networks programme are provided mainly for preparatory and feasibility studies and in only exceptional circumstances would the European Commission consider applications for such funding for investment costs.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the company concerned has increased its charges by the level suggested by the Deputy.  I do know that the company has recently increased the annual rental charge for its basic MMDS service from £170 to £179 which amounts to an increase of 5.3 per cent.  With the exception of the ending of a special introductory discount for some of its premium services I am not aware of any other increases applied by this company recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event the Deputy should be aware that, unlike the statutory provisions which apply to cable relay charges, increases to the annual rental <Col N="439" /> charge for MMDS services do not require my prior approval.  However, under the regulations which govern MMDS I may investigate the charges being applied by a licensee in respect of the service being provided.  Up to now I have not had cause to carry out any such investigation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answer to Questions Nos. 39, 40 and 42 of 12 February 1997.  In the light of additional information that has recently come to hand concerning Nirex's proposal for the construction of an underground rock characterisation facility near Sellafield, the UK Department of the Environment decided in February last that it would be appropriate to provide parties who appeared at the public planning inquiry in Cumbria with the opportunity to submit their observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This latest documentation confirms my concerns over the negative implications of the proposal as regards environmental protection of the Irish Sea and reinforces my view that plans for the development of an RCF in the Sellafield area should now be abandoned.  My Department have <Col N="440" /> examined this additional information and a comprehensive submission was forwarded by me to the UK authorities last week.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that yesterday in London I highlighted publicly my concerns and objections.  I have arranged for a copy of my submission to be sent to the Deputies.  As I understand it the results of this consultation process will eventually be considered by the UK Secretary of State for the Environment when he adjudicates on the appeal taken by UK Nirex against the refusal of planning permission for the construction of the facility.  In the meantime, I am considering, in consultion with the Attorney General, what future options are available to me at EU and international level in the event of the grant of planning permission for the repository.</P>

      <P>In addition to basic pay, personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £44.91 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates.  A military service allowance is also payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions. The current rate in the case of officers is £2,091 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £40.08 per week (£2,091 p.a.), with the exception of privates with less than 3 years' service who receive £14.43 per week. These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc. The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including military service allowance and Border duty allowance, were determined <Col N="442" /> by the Gleeson Commission in 1990.  The commission expressly stated its conclusion that military duties were clearly in a distinctive category and that it would not be appropriate to fix military pay on the basis of a direct comparison with the pay of gardaí.</P>
      <P>The provisions governing the payment of subsistence allowance to Defence Forces personnel are provided for in Defence Force Regulations. A shift allowance is not payable to members of the Permanent Defence Force.  Under the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the association.  The question of the payment of allowances to personnel involved with the BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by the association under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the association, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  You will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 282, 283 and 284 together.</P>
      <P>I announced on 2 Auguest 1996 that the Government had approved the award of a contract to Bond Helicopters (Ireland) Ltd., for the provision of a marine emergency helicopter including search and rescue based at Shannon Airport.  The contract commenced on 1 January 1997, on the expiry of the previous contract with Irish Helicopters Ltd., and is for a minimum period of two and a half years with an option to extend for up to five years.  Bond advised my Department on 20 February 1997, in accordance with their contractual obligations, that the fully compliant helicopter with auto-hover, which was to be delivered to Shannon by 28 February 1997, was now expected to be in service by the middle to end of March 1997.  The delay in the delivery of this helicopter arose from an electrial design fault identified during a recently completed independent quality check.  Adverse weather conditions have also hampered flight testing.  The fault has since been remedied and flight testing has resumed.  The Bond helicopter development programme, which commenced after the contract award in Auguest 1996 and has been the subject of close monitoring and regular review by the Department, was fully on schedule up to this recent development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fully serviceable marine emergency helicopter is already in permanent operation by Bond from Shannon.  This helicopter has been providing marine emergency response since 1 January 1997 and has carried out nine successful rescue missions to date.  It has rescued or assisted 19 people including the rescue in extreme weather conditions of 13 fishermen from a fishing vessel, which caught fire at a location 150 miles off the coast of Galway, on 1 March 1997.  It has all the features of a fully compliant helicopter, with the exception of an auto-hover system.  The absence of an auto-hover makes winching from a small <Col N="444" /> vessel at night difficult but not impossible.  Otherwise the helicopter is fully equipped for 24 hours marine emergency response.  Bond have made available, with effect from 1 March 1977, a second helicopter to improve the capabilities of the existing helicopter at night time and in bad weather conditions.  Crews and specialist lighting devices have been provided to support the operation of two helicopters on a rescue mission.</P>
    <P>The question of what penalty, if any, will be imposed on Bond for failing to provide a fully compliant helicopter by 28 February 1997 is under active consideration at present.  Since 1 January 1997 Bond has been providing a satisfactory search and rescue service which will be underpinned by the early entry into service of an autohover equipped helicopter.  My Department will continue to monitor developments very closely and will review all matters relating to the service, including contractual obligations, on a week to week basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 286 and 287 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new conservation regulations introduced for the 1997 season in respect of salmon and trout conservation complete the first phase of implementing the recommendations of the salmon management task force.  There has been, at <Col N="445" /> home and abroad, general acceptance that the measures introduced for 1997 are necessary to halt the decline in salmon stocks.  The measures contain compensatory gains as well as losses for the draft net sector in the interest of optimising the resource itself.</P>
    <P>In view of expressed concerns about the specific and localised impact on the draft net fishery of the new conservation measures, it has been decided not to restrict these tidally dependent fisheries to daylight hours only.  The weekend close period has also been staggered between the drift and draft net fisheries which will allow the draft netsmen one clear day each week when there is no drift net activity.</P>
    <P>In addition to actively encouraging a local catchment management approach to cater for specific needs in each area, the overall concerns and needs of the draft net fishermen and others engaged in the estuarial salmon fishery are currently being assessed from all perspectives and further consultations are under way on the matter.</P>
    <P>All legitimate salmon interests, including draft netsmen, will benefit from the survival and recovery of salmon stocks which is the underlying objective of the new conservation measures.  The question of financial compensation for the introduction of enhanced management strategies, which are of themselves designed to maximise the returns from the salmon fishery, is not under consideration.</P>

      <P>A lease of foreshore in respect of a slipway at Buncrana, County Donegal, was offered to Donegal County Council on 15 July 1996.  The rent for the foreshore site which was assessed by the Valuation Office was disputed by the local authority.  In the light of representations made, the Valuation Office has been asked to reconsider the matter and I understand that a valuer will be visiting the site shortly and discussing the situation with Donegal County Council with a view to reaching agreement on the rent.</P>

      <P>The Dingle boatyard site was originally the subject of a 99 year lease which commenced in 1948 and was subject to an annual rent of £1.  Ministerial consent was given in 1993 to a set of arrangements which in effect involved the transfer of this site from the previous beneficial owners to Dingle Harbour Developments Ltd.  I am aware that concerns have been expressed regarding the proposed development of the site and my Department has been actively engaged in efforts to progress matters on a satisfactory basis.</P>

      <P>The mid-term evaluation of the fisheries operational programme, 1994-1999, is being undertaken by the external evaluators for the programme, INDECON &mdash; International Economic Consultants. This evaluation will feed into the overall mid-term review of the Community Support Framework (CSF).  During the evaluation process INDECON have consulted regularly with the Department, the EU Commission, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Forbairt, the Marine Institute and representatives of the fishing industry.  The evaluation report has also been considered at a formal meeting of the operational programme monitoring committee.  The report, together with the views of the monitoring committee, will feed into, and inform, the overall evaluation of the Community Support Framework currently under way.  The case for the allocation of additional resources to the fisheries operational programme in the CSF review process will continue to be pursued over coming months and is being fully informed by the findings of the evaluation report.</P>

      <P>A new national strategy on fishing vessel safety is currently being finalised in the Department of the Marine.  I hope to shortly, be in a position to announce details of the measures to be taken to implement this new policy which will draw on the recommendations and objectives of the review group.  The proposed new strategy will aim to achieve fundamental improvements in the safety culture and standards of the sea fishing sector with the objective of avoiding, as far as possible, fishing vessel accidents and especially the loss of life at sea.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of the review group's recommendations are already being implemented, particularly in relation to training, safety awareness and on-shore radio communications.  I was pleased to see that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, recently announced that share fishermen will, in future, qualify for full PRSI.  The absence of mandatory social insurance cover for fishermen was identified by the review group as the cause of many trained deckhands leaving the fishing fleet.</P>
