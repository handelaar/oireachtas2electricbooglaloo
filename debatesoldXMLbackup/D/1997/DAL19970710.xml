      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 31 from Deputy Spring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 31 I wish to raise the following matter &mdash; that Dáil Éireann be adjourned to enable the Taoiseach to outline the steps he will take to provide Dáil Éireann with full disclosure of any other contributions from business circles to the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, and the potential such contributions had to influence Government policy in view of the admissions to the tribunal of inquiry on 9 July 1997 by the former Taoiseach that he received £1.3 million from Mr. Ben Dunne, which had been denied until yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 5a &mdash; appointment of the Committee of Selection; No. 5b &mdash; appointment of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; No. 1 &mdash; Registration of Title (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Second Stage (Resumed) and Remaining Stages; and No. 6 &mdash; statements on the Amsterdam EU Council Meeting.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that:</P>
      <P>(1) Nos. 5a and 5b shall be decided without debate by one Question;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 8 &mdash; motion <i>re</i> Local Government <Col N="366" /> Funding (Resumed) shall be taken on the conclusion of the proceedings on No. 5b;</P>
    <P>(3) The resumed Second Stage and Remaining Stages of No. 1 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1.45 p.m. today by one Question which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall, in relation to amendments to the Bill, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice;</P>
    <P>(4) No. 6 shall be confined to the Taoiseach, to the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who shall be called upon in that order; and the statements shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; and</P>
    <P>(5) The Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until Tuesday, 30 September 1997.</P>

      <P>There are five proposals on the Order of Business to be put to the House. Are the proposals for dealing with Nos. 5a and 5b, the appointment of the Committee of Selection and the Committee on Procedures and Privileges agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 8, Private Members' Business, agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 1 agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals for dealing with No. 6, statements on the Amsterdam EU Council Meeting agreed?  Agreed.  Is it agreed that the Dáil, on its rising today, will adjourn until Tuesday, 30 September 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;Tuesday, 30th September, 1997&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;within 10 days of the submission of the Report of Mr. Justice McCracken to the House&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to agree to this proposal.  It simply seeks an agreement in principle to the establishment of a tribunal.  It is not seeking detailed terms of reference and is not in that sense prejudging any detailed recommendations that have been made by the Dunnes tribunal. Furthermore, it is important to recognise that in view of collective responsibility, many members of the present Government served in office with Mr. Haughey during the period, as Taoiseach, when he received money from private donors. They are collectively responsible with him for all his actions as Taoiseach during that period. Therefore, it is not possible for members of both parties of the present Government, which supported and elected Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach, to attempt to remove their own responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer briefly to the same matter.  The Government is suggesting we should <Col N="367" /> adjourn until 30 September 1997.  That is quite ludicrous, given what was brought before the tribunal yesterday.  I suggest that we should meet within ten days or a fortnight of the publication of the report of the McCracken tribunal.  It would be unacceptable for this House or for the public if anything else was contemplated.  I ask the Taoiseach to give consideration to this and to make it clear to the House that the Dáil will be recalled within a fortnight of the publication of the tribunal report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>On the same matter, I have an amendment that is separate from and in addition to Deputy John Bruton's amendment.</P>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until Tuesday, 30 September 1997 or not later than two weeks after the publication of the report of the McCracken tribunal, which-ever is the earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the positions of the Opposition leaders, I would like to say a few words about this matter on which I have reflected overnight.  Everybody in this House has a duty to do everything in their power to uphold the highest standards of a democracy and to keep this Republic free of any taint or suggestion of venality. We are all deeply shocked and saddened by yesterday's events when issues which were in the public domain were confirmed.  There are no parallels in the annals of our democracy.  By acting resolutely and without fear or favour we must restore pride and confidence in our democracy which we will do so that any damage caused by yesterday's revelation will be properly and swiftly repaired.</P>
      <P>The McCracken tribunal set up by the House on 7 February, five months ago, will report over the summer and will complete its worked sometime before 30 September.  Last week it stated publicly its view that the tribunal should continue and complete the task in accordance with the present terms of reference.  When we have the report with the conclusions and recommendations, which the Government said in its programme for Government it is committed to implementing, we will see if there are matters which require a further tribunal or need to be addressed in another way, individually or in a broader context.</P>
      <P>Two issues arise so far, including the issue of Mr. Charles J. Haughey.  He has not come before the tribunal and is entitled to do so in accordance with the rights of natural justice.  The comprehensiveness of his evidence to the tribunal will be important to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Ansbacher issues, the tribunal stated last week that &ldquo;evidence has yet to be given in relation to the operation of the <Col N="368" /> Ansbacher deposits, how and why they came into existence and so forth.  It does not seem to the tribunal that decisions in terms of the scope of inquiries such as this should be taken until all the evidence has been given and I have reported to the Oireachtas.  At that point, the Oireachtas will be in a much better position to judge what steps it wishes to take, which steps are entirely a matter for the Oireachtas and not for the tribunal.&rdquo; We should await those matters until the tribunal reports.  There may be other issues, including Revenue.  The issue will arise as to whether Revenue is satisfied that it has the powers under its present remit to deal with all aspects and it should be consulted on whatever we do.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will also report on another important matter.  It will report on the considerations, motives and circumstances, which it was asked to do.  It will have to report on whether the admitted contributions in any way influenced Government policy and if other favours were sought or given as recompense.  Having said that, when we receive the report whatever matters need to be investigated will be.  I give that commitment to the House.  As soon as I have the report, I will consult with the party leaders because it is a matter for this House.  The tribunal was set up by the House and the report will be given to the Clerk, if I recall correctly what we agreed on 6 February.  I have no difficulty in agreeing to a resumption of the Dáil within a reasonable period, whether ten days or two weeks.  I ask the House to accept my word on this matter and that we deal with it on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to say I believe the Taoiseach is stalling on the issue of principle.  The issue of principle is clear.  We know the Dunnes payments tribunal can only inquire into payments made to Mr. Haughey by the Dunne family and cannot inquire into payments made to him by others.  We know that, if a serving Taoiseach received £1.1 million from one donor, he was obviously open to receiving donations from others.  The Taoiseach knows the Dunnes tribunal cannot inquire into donations by other individuals to Mr. Haughey and we know that must be investigated.  We should not wait until the Dunnes tribunal reports to establish this separate inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want nor am I interested in private consultation with the Taoiseach about this matter because it is public business.  Any business to be transacted about this issue will be done on the floor of this House.  I ask the Taoiseach to agree in principle that there must be a further tribunal of inquiry to investigate whether moneys were paid to Mr. Haughey by others while he was Taoiseach serving in a Government with the current Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, the then leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy O'Malley, and <Col N="369" /> other members of the Fianna Fáil Party currently sitting on the Government benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if payments were made privately to Mr. Haughey by the beef industry. That is not covered by the Dunnes tribunal. It is plain that the beef tribunal report was highly embarrassing for Fianna Fáil because it did not allow any meaningful debate on it in this House.</P>
      <P>We need to get to the bottom of these donations once and for all and the Taoiseach knows that.  In attempting to postpone this issue over the summer, he is allowing it to fester.  It would be better for him, the Government and the country if he would agree now in principle that we will need another tribunal.  He can defer its establishment and the settlement of its terms of reference until the Dunnes report is to hand, but he should agree now to the principle that we will need another tribunal if he is not interested in prevarication and delay.  He was plainly not able to ask Mr. Haughey the hard questions when he was leader of the party.  We needed a tribunal to get the information we now have.  We do not know if the Taoiseach ever asked Mr. Haughey the hard questions or if he was afraid to do so. We need to know now that this information will be obtained and the only way it can be done is by an acceptance in principle that a tribunal should be established.</P>

      <P>Do I understand that the Taoiseach, irrespective of what decision the House makes on Deputy Bruton's amendment, has undertaken that this House will reconvene not more than two weeks after the publication of the McCracken report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  To set out at this stage, in principle or otherwise, the terms of a new tribunal before the publication of the report of the current one is not advisable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no hedging of bets.  If a tribunal is to be set up, it must have a starting point and know what it must do to achieve its desired result.  The words I used were that whatever requires to be investigated will be investigated. Nothing can be clearer than that.</P>

      <P>Since both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment gave commitments prior to the general election in relation to the publication of certain matters in regard to the Brigid McCole case, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government has considered those commitments and when they will be honoured?</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Allen on Wednesday, 9 July 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann regrets the Government's decision to reverse the proposals of the outgoing Government to empower local authorities to use motor taxation as a devolved funding mechanism designed to enhance local government in this country, and to substitute in its place a highly centralised system of funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Dempsey on his appointment as Minister for the Environment.  As he is my next door neighbour, I will not have to travel far when seeking money for County Louth or a share of the funding granted to County Meath.  I wish him well.  I am a dedicated listener to LMFM and I will remind the Minister of everything he said when Opposition spokesman on the Environment. However, I will do so in a constructive way.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the outgoing Minister, Deputy Howlin, for his work in the Department of the Environment.  I have been involved in the work of two local authorities in County Louth for 25 years and I must place on record that his contribution to the Department, and to local government as a whole, has been outstanding.  I rate him as the best Minister for the Environment with whom I have had to deal during my time in local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I remind the new Minister for the Environment that on the last occasion Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in power County Louth and the entire country fared badly in terms of roads, housing and the infrastructure of local government.  For example, during that Government's term of office, 28 houses were built in my home town of Drogheda, the largest borough in the country.  The same pattern emerged in Dundalk and the entire mid-Louth area.  More houses were built in County Louth last year than were built during the term of office of the previous Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. I hope that a repeat does not occur during this Government's term of office, however long it may last.  I also hope that the commitment to build in excess of 7,000 houses outlined in this Administration's programme for Government will be honoured.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed on reading media reports about dismantling the arrangements for financing local government, something the Dáil has not been told much about to date.  It is a pity the previous Government's programme was not considered during the controversial debate over water and service charges.  It dealt with more issues than service charges and the transfer of car tax to finance local government.  In addition to new powers, many powers were being handed back to local authorities, something for which the General Council of County Councils, the local authority representative bodies, managers and town clerks had called for a long time.  It aimed at decentralising power from the Department to local authorities. That document was the brain child of Deputy Howlin and he should receive due credit because of the very positive things it contains in terms of local authority administration.</P>
    <P>The major issue is financing.  It does not matter what rules or regulations are introduced at local level unless finance is provided.  Without finance local authority will return to the bad old days. The proposal to again centralise financing and to reverse the decision to transfer car tax to local authorities, which is administered by them, is a retrograde step.  It will be interesting to see what happens when the Dáil resumes, because media reports refer to a percentage of tax in the context of financing.  We do not know if this refers to PAYE, VAT, or some other form of tax.  This is a retrograde step which the Government will come to regret.</P>

      <P>The essence of local government is local empowerment and decision making, but the concept of empowerment means little if anything without resources to back it up. For years we have witnessed cracks and strains developing in our local government system as it <Col N="378" /> became overburdened with an ever expanding cocktail of functions.  I am not against giving more functions to local authorities, but I am against giving them more functions or more so-called powers without providing resources and money to carry out those functions and to exercise those powers.</P>
      <P>The record of the House will show my consistency in this over the years.  I have long been an ardent proponent of local government.  I have long argued for its right to exist hand in hand with central government.  I have long believed in its potential to serve communities.  I am not and never have been convinced of the benefits of paying lip service to a lame local government system. We could conceivably be better off abolishing local government rather than presiding over its gradual downfall.  I am not suggesting the local government system is lame, powerless or without merit.  However, I am sounding the alarm bells and giving a clear signal that if something constructive is not done to properly resource local authorities, the future for local democracy, local empowerment and local communities is bleak.  It is a measure of the resilience of the local government system that it has survived its difficulties and is still around for revival.</P>
      <P>It was in recognising the importance of local government and in realising the threats and difficulties it faces that our programme for Government highlights it as a priority.  The principal aim of the Government in respect of local government, as set out in <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i> is: &ldquo;the restoration of real decision-making and power to local authorities and local people&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The key priorities identified in the programme for government, some of which the Minister mentioned in his speech yesterday evening, are establishing a statutory local government fund which will be a fixed percentage of national taxation; allowing greater discretion to local authorities in spending priorities based on their performance and the value for money they obtain; &ldquo;capping&rdquo; increases of commercial rates; financing county road improvements from national motor tax receipts with suitable equalisation and such funding to take into account the findings of the National County Roads Survey; introducing comprehensive value for money audits for all local authorities; improving efficiency throughout the system; enhancing the concept of customer service in local government; removing the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; by restoring real power to the elected members and, finally, facilitating a new partnership with the community and voluntary sector.  Although work was started on some of these issues by the previous Administration, the financing plans we propose are innovative and will provide a solid platform on which local government can look forward with confidence to making a continued and improved contribution to the lives of all our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing to be said about the Government's revised proposals for local funding is that <Col N="379" /> they do not involve the introduction of any new form of taxation.  Our programme for Government clearly states our recognition of the need to reduce the burden of personal taxation to reward effort and to give people an incentive to take up work.  To that end we have outlined our commitment to reduce the basic rate of income tax to 20 per cent and the higher rate to 42 per cent over the next five years with an objective of reducing the higher rate to 40 per cent if economic circumstances persist.  We have also given a commitment to increase basic allowances at least in line with inflation at each budget.</P>
    <P>Our proposals on local government are therefore entirely consistent with our overall taxation proposals.  Linking certain local government expenditure with national taxation, through the mechanism of the local government fund will have many advantages for local authorities.  It will enable local authorities to prepare and adopt their estimates with a large degree of certainty as to revenues they are likely to receive.  The situation that obtained heretofore was unacceptable, where the estimates process and all the important local policy and spending decisions involved in that process, had to be completed in the dark as to potential future revenues.  For example, in recent years it was only after the estimate was actually adopted that a local authority was notified of its rate support grant for the following year.  The previous Government's funding proposals would have improved the situation somewhat but the reality is that authorities would have continued to be asked to adopt their estimates blindly as they waited to see what sort of an allocation they could expect from year to year from a combination of retained motor tax proceeds and equalisation funds.  Providing a specified percentage of national taxation to local government will ensure that local authorities will in the future be in a position to know the level of income they may expect to receive in the following year from the State.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most critical element in any funding system is that it should be capable of producing a sufficient yield to enable the business at hand to be carried out in an effective and efficient way.  The KPMG report on local government funding identified lack of buoyancy as one of the greatest drawbacks of the funding system then operating.  While there is undoubtedly a degree of buoyancy in motor taxation, the extent to which this tax alone had the capability, apart altogether from doubts about its appropriateness, to fund the ever expanding demands on local government is questionable.  Linking local government to national taxation will ensure there is a significant degree of in-built buoyancy in the local government fund.</P>
    <P>As I suggested, there are doubts about the propriety of using motor tax to fund all of the services which the local government sector is expected to deliver.  It was clear from public reaction while we witnessed the embarrassing difficulties <Col N="380" /> of the previous Government earlier this year on the issue of group water schemes and private water supplies, that it was not acceptable to use motor tax to fund the abolition of water charges primarily in urban areas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new local government fund, the Government will also re-establish the old road fund concept which existed until 1978 and under which motor tax funded part of the roads programme.  The Minister discussed the whole roads issue in detail yesterday and I do not intend to go over that ground again other than to fully endorse the view that it is entirely fitting that motor tax should fund roads and not water supplies. I am sure Deputies will support the Government's commitment to take account of the findings of the national county roads survey in making future allocations to local authorities for their road programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked about the Government's commitment to the provision of social housing. An Action Programme for the Millennium provides the framework for the Government with regard to housing.  We are committed to providing a suitable standard of accommodation for all. One of our key priorities is to continue the local authority housing programme as the mainstay of the response to meeting social housing needs.  It is my intention that local authorities will continue to meet the programme with high quality dwellings provided in a socially sensitive way.</P>
    <P>A number of schemes exist to assist local authorities to improve substandard housing and to upgrade the physical environment in certain older local authority housing estates.  The Government will continue its support for the remedial works scheme and the estate improvement programme. These will assist local authorities in tackling the environmental and related problems of severely run down urban housing estates and flat complexes. They will help eliminate or modify certain undesirable aspects of the layout and design of estates, carry out improvement works to enhance the living environment for tenants and establish improved estate management arrangements.</P>
    <P>With regard to social housing measures, I am concerned that the output on some of these schemes has not reached its full potential to meet social housing needs.  I will examine how the uptake of the schemes might be improved and I will impress on local authorities the need for more active promotion by them of the various measures.  The voluntary sector has grown rapidly and its continued efforts in providing an alternative to local authority housing will also be supported by the Government.</P>
    <P>In keeping with <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium,</i> the Government will make an all out assault on disadvantage.  We will seek to establish an inclusive society where all citizens, including the homeless and the travelling community, have the opportunity to participate in social and economic life.  We want everyone to share in the benefits of economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> Another area, linked to the renewal and regeneration of local communities and of particular interest to me, is that of the urban renewal schemes which have operated in various centres since 1986 and which have succeeded in attracting major private investment into run down and derelict areas.  This was confirmed in a consultants' study on the schemes published last year.  In areas where the urban renewal scheme has achieved its objectives a proactive local authority has been identified as one of the major contributing factors.  Many local authorities have put much effort into making the schemes work in their areas.  They have actively promoted the schemes among the investment community and they have facilitated developers with pre-planning consultations. In some cases they have used their compulsory purchase powers to regularise difficulties with the title to derelict land, thus freeing it up for development.</P>
    <P>The willingness of local authorities to respond positively in this way to the introduction of the urban renewal schemes is heartening.  It has also highlighted the case for local authorities to take the lead role in the urban renewal schemes of the future.  As Deputies will be aware, there are plans to introduce a new urban renewal scheme in August next year when the current scheme expires.  The new scheme will be more integrated and focused than the schemes to date.  The physical renewal which the schemes encouraged will no longer be seen as an end in itself.  It is now recognised that any future scheme will have to become a means towards securing the overall socio-economic renewal of run down areas.  The new scheme was developed in that context.  Its successful implementation will require a significant amount of planning and this process has already started.  A major element of the planning process will be the identification of priority areas for renewal and the preparation of plans which show how each area's physical development is to be linked to its wider renewal.</P>
    <P>In recognition of their pivotal role in the development of their areas, local authorities must take the lead role in preparing these plans.  This process will be participative, one in which all the relevant local organisations and communities will have an input.  In effect, local authorities will be working in partnership with the other relevant interests.  Local authorities recognise the merits of a more planned approach to the new scheme, an approach to which I am confident they will respond enthusiastically.</P>
    <P>One of the proposals contained in the Government's action programme relates to the capping of rate increases and the Minister touched on this point briefly yesterday.  Behind the proposal is an appreciation of the need to provide for the needs of local authorities while at the same time ensuring that rate increases do not adversely affect the competitive position of the commercial sector. While it is important that certainty exists in local government funding &mdash; the Government's proposals will help to achieve this &mdash; it is equally <Col N="382" /> important that the commercial sector will know what it is expected to contribute to local government. This will enable businesses, small businesses in particular, to map out their financial commitments and plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>In 1997 total local authority current expenditure will amount to over £1 billion.  Of this, about £360 million will be obtained from commercial rates.  This income is significant for local authorities and is used to provide important services which benefit all sectors of the community, including commercial ratepayers.  The Government's concern relates to rate increases which are far in excess of inflation.  Not alone must the commercial sector pay rates but there are other costs for business such as charges for water, refuse and costs involved in pollution licences, fire certification, building control compliance, development contributions, etc.  We do not want business to be put at a competitive disadvantage as a result of local authority charges.  Therefore, we are examining this whole area to ascertain whether and to what extent central control or capping of commercial rates is needed.</P>
    <P>The positive actions set out in <i>An Action Plan for the Millennium</i>, together with the momentum already evident in local government, due in no small measure to local authorities' response to the challenges set out in the last Government's Better Local Government document, will ensure a bright future for local democracy, local communities and local businesses.</P>

The Ceann Comhairle and his family have a long history in politics in Carlow and Kilkenny.  My father served with his father in the local authority in Kilkenny and my father and I served with the Ceann Comhairle.  The people of Kilkenny are pleased that he has been elevated to such high office and have no doubt he will carry out his functions in an exemplary way and thus bring further pride to his family and the party he serves.  It is pleasing that his mother, who enjoyed her husband's career at local and national level, now enjoys seeing her son assume such an honour in this Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of a local authority for the past 18 years I am glad steps are being taken to provide proper funding to the local authorities.  I disagreed with the proposals of the previous Minister <Col N="383" /> and I am glad they have been corrected. When the funding structures are put in place they will acknowledge the services being provided in local authority areas and will give flexibility to the local authorities to develop and provide quality services.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have a dual function &mdash; serving the local needs of their constituents and as legislators.  Discussing local government reminds us of the needs and aspirations of the people we represent at local level.  I encourage the Minister to focus on the needs of local authorities and their proper development.  There is no point devolving powers to local authorities unless they are properly financed.</P>
    <P>I hope the new structures will allow us to deal with the recurrent problem of county roads.  I am glad it states that there will be proper funding to deal with this problem in an efficient way which will allow local authorities to prioritise various roads and how they should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The issue of planning for designated areas and tax incentives has given rise to various problems. I hope the new financing of local government will take into consideration the interests of medieval cities such as Kilkenny.  A huge development was imposed by An Bord Pleanála which served the city's economy well but such developments pose planning problems for local authorities.  More people must be employed to deal proactively with planning applications so that conditions laid down by local authorities can be policed. However, more control and local financing is needed in order to do that.</P>
    <P>Our architecture and heritage needs to be protected because of these developments.  Further money is required to monitor them, particularly in Kilkenny.  I refer to the building of ring roads. In Kilkenny city one leg of the ring road was completed in 1984 but the remainder has still not been completed.  It is only at design stage and it is time the funding for its completion was made available.  The same can be said of Carlow which is being choked by traffic.  A bypass of Carlow town is required urgently.  These decisions should be made by the local authority with the proper financing in place so that they can prioritise how they approach and develop our cities, towns and counties.  Perhaps the article on county government published recently in an English magazine is a way forward.  It relates to the proper financing of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The extension of services is critical.  The structure proposed by the previous Minister would leave Kilkenny, for example, far short of what it needs just to maintain present services.  People demand more, cities and town are growing and counties need to be develop.  As a result, services need to be extended and proper financing must be put in place.  I agree with organisations such as Respond in regard to our social housing programme. In Kilkenny there are almost 750 applicants on the housing list, but this year only 40 houses will be completed.  That list will double <Col N="384" /> next year and there is no end to the requirements that must be met by various corporations and county councils.  I wish to see more funding channelled through local authorities so that there can be a proper, active social housing policy, thereby giving hope to the many people on housing lists. It is important to reflect on these issues in terms of the financing of local government.</P>
    <P>Finance should be channelled in partnership between various local communities and public representatives who are accountable to the public. They answer queries and are at the cutting edge of local democracy, yet they are often bypassed in terms of funding for various local projects. A greater partnership is needed.  That was achieved somewhat through county enterprise boards but there is further scope for development. These boards should work in greater liaison with local authorities, be part of the county development team and contain more risk takers from outside.  There are enough safe hands on county enterprise boards to provide goalkeepers for future World Cups.</P>
    <P>Most counties look abroad for greater participation in tourism and indigenous industry.  Various programmes in tourism and marketing are financed by local authorities.  Kilkenny has allocated substantial moneys to this area.  Further moneys must be available in the allocation to fund local authorities because by achieving success in tourism and marketing and servicing indigenous industry in a proactive fashion, local government will develop more efficiently along commercial lines and will deliver a service of which public representatives can be proud.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this Administration delivering on its promises and was pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, outlined a number of cases.  A great deal of work must be done but much will be achieved.  However, it hinges on the financing of local authorities.  If the proper steps are taken to reinvigorate local authority structures, more successful local economies will result.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann welcomes the Government commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to introduce a comprehensive new funding arrangement for local government, which will give maximum local discretion on expenditure to local authorities and which will ensure value for money for the taxpayer.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> This is an important debate.  The motion as presented by Deputy Allen expresses regret rather than the more usual condemnation of the Government for the proposed changes.  All speakers recognise funding for local authorities is a fundamental issue which has posed enormous difficulties.  These are well known to everybody since the reason most frequently cited for important works not being carried out is a lack of finance.  We also need to recognise that many EU directives as well as legislation emanating from this House have a knock on cost effect for local authorities which is generally not provided for and which almost always undermines the quality of the service which can be delivered.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that there can be no autonomy for local government unless there is control of finances or, at the very minimum, sufficient finance to undertake necessary programmes of work.  I spoke a number on months ago on the previous Government's proposal on water tax.  One of its faults was that it was an existing form of taxation and was not replacing the charges which had been removed.  There is a strong case to be made on the merits and demerits of those charges, but there was merit in local authorities having control on the level of charges and their collection.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bell that many aspects of the document on better local government published by the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, deserved more consideration that those which hit the headlines.  That will continue to happen in this debate.  I welcome the concept of partnership as outlined by Ministers Molloy and Dempsey, particularly between local government and local development and community organisations.  I also welcome the commitment to quality of service.</P>
    <P>There has been a substantial improvement by local authorities in this area but it must be recognised that where further improvement is required there are cost implications which will have to be met.  Reference has been made to the KPMG consultant's report on the funding of local authorities and the fact that it highlights the increase of 20 per cent in the current expenditure requirement of local authorities between 1995 to 2000. This will bring it close to £1.5 billion which is a very considerable sum.</P>
    <P>The format of Estimates as presented, and as required under law to be presented at local authority meetings and to local authority members, does not lend itself to democratic participation.  If anything it seems to be designed in such a way that a local authority member would have the maximum level of difficulty in trying to understand exactly what was involved.  Some of the eight programme groups are archaic and no longer refer directly to the central fund functions of local authorities.  Almost every report commissioned on the funding of local authorities draws attention to the need for a separate system of taxation, preferably in the control of the councils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> The abolition of domestic charges is now <i>fait accompli</i> as the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said last night and we have to accept that.  We have to accept also there is not likely to be an adequate stand alone system for local authority funding which is directly in the control of local authorities. The motor tax proposal was entirely artificial and a flimsy camouflage for direct funding by the Exchequer, particularly when we take into account the equalisation fund and the fact that the amount that could be removed from councils was variable, not to mention the amounts they might be fortunate enough to receive back.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the undue burden of commercial rates and the Minister of State has indicated it is proposed to have a cap on unreasonable increases.  That is welcome.  There is a strong case for defending from excessive charges those who pay commercial rates.</P>
    <P>Past experience of the rate support grant was that when times became tough for the Exchequer local authority finances suffered most.  That will continue to be the case regardless of what system is introduced if funding comes from the Exchequer.  There were difficulties also with the bounty in lieu of rates which I have outlined here previously.  There were particular difficulties in my county and elsewhere with the principle that if commercial ratepayers and others were obliged to pay rates the Government and its various Departments ought, at a minimum, to pay rates on their property.  Presumably that will not arise in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome this motion as it gives us an opportunity to debate local government. Anybody who has been through the recent hustings will know just how important local government services are to the people we represent.  It is regrettable that virtually the first act of the new Government is to rip the heart out of reform of local government measures introduced by the last Government.  There is no use in saying one is in favour of the measures recommended in the document, Better Local Government, introduced by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Brendan Howlin and then ripping the financial heart out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real problem with local government reform down through the years has been that everybody is in favour of it, everybody talks about it and everybody issues the platitudes but when it comes to funding nothing has happened. The outgoing Government was the first in 30 years who took the question of the financing of local government seriously and made firm <Col N="387" /> decisions on it, who decided to abolish water charges which had been unacceptable to so many people and to replace them with a designated tax for local government in the form of the road tax &mdash; a highly appropriate form of taxation given the use of our roads and on environmental grounds as well.  Where are we now?  The Government proposes to get rid of the measures introduced by the previous Government for the funding of local government but with what will it be replaced?  I have listened to what the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, said yesterday and what the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, said today and quite frankly I am not clear on what it is being replaced with except some form of centralised control on the funding of local government.</P>
    <P>Great emphasis was placed on the discretion local government will have in how it spends its money.  It is easy to have discretion about spending money if one does not have the money and that has been the real problem with local government. The degree of discretion which local authorities have had, to some extent, up to now in raising funds, for example, in the area of commercial rates and so on, is to be removed.  It is early days in the life of this Government and one has to look at the small print in the speeches by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, to find out what exactly is the Government's intention with regard to local government funding.  I am not comforted by what I find in the small print.  For example, in his speech yesterday the Minister said:</P>
    <P>However, the reality of the situation today is that the principle of seeking a local source of finance was buried and abandoned by the decision of the previous Administration to abolish domestic water and sewerage charges. In practical terms, there is no going back on that decision.  We must now build on what we have.</P>
    <P>I interpret that to mean the Government will not reintroduce water charges as they were known but the principle of local authorities having a generalised charge on the public remains at the heart of what the Government has in mind.  Bearing in mind the Tánaiste's adherence to charging on an economic basis, anybody who took a shower and &ldquo;the polluter pays&rdquo; principle, which she articulated so strongly before the election, it seems the Government has in mind a localised charge which will not be called &ldquo;water charges&rdquo;.  That is the principle that appears to be underlining what the Minister is talking about.</P>
    <P>On the fund he talked about establishing &mdash; this is the most alarming aspect &mdash; he said:</P>
    <P>In order to ensure implementation of certain national policies, part of the fund could be allocated towards specific programmes.</P>
    <P>I am talking about a carrot and stick approach to local government.  The rewards of local discretion will go to those local authorities who demonstrate their abilities to deliver the <Col N="388" /> right kind of services, serving their customers to best effect and who show an appetite and desire for responsibility.</P>
    <P>Does that mean some local authorities which have a Fianna Fáil majority will get more funds than those who do not, that some local authorities that are more inclined to rezone land, for example, will be rewarded for their efforts, because they are pursuing the right kind of policies? This is the big hand of central Government being used in a way that has never been seen here.  Up to now whatever degree of centralised allocation of resources there were to local government applied equally across all local authorities. We will now have not only some kind of centralised funding system for local government but centralised government will decide who are the good local authorities and those which will not be funded.</P>
    <P>I am alarmed by the subtext of the Government's proposals.  No doubt, in time, we will see more of them and have a better opportunity to examine them.  In the meantime, local authorities are back where they were 20 years ago when a Fianna Fáil Government first landed them in the fix of not knowing where they stood on funding.  It would be useful if the Minister could tell us when we will see firm proposals for advancing the Government's programme.</P>
    <P>The question of housing was referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy.  I wish him well in the portfolio that was so ably held by my party colleague, Deputy McManus.  I am concerned by what the Government seems to have in mind in relation to housing.  Its programme does not mention targets for social housing.  The outgoing Government set specific targets for the number of house starts to be implemented in its lifetime; it restored some degree of hope to the tens of thousands of families on housing waiting lists; and, in accordance with agreed targets, it made a start in providing housing and in refurbishing old housing stock.  Other than a generalised statement which is wide open to interpretation, there is no mention here of targets, no figures, and no idea of the number of houses to be provided by the present Government.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated by Deputy Molloy's assertion that &ldquo;It is my intention that local authorities will continue to meet the programme with high quality dwellings provided in a socially sensitive way&rdquo;. I wonder what exactly that means.  When the last Fianna Fáil-PD Government was in office it effectively cut the house building programme.  It was not announced as a cut but as an effort to achieve a social mix by not allowing housing schemes greater than 25 houses.  This, of course, was a ruse to ensure a very small housing programme. This policy of advancing the local authority housing programme in a socially sensitive way raises the question of to whom it will be socially sensitive.  If it is to be sensitive to people on the housing lists, that is one thing, and we can expect lots of houses to be built.  If it is to be <Col N="389" /> sensitive to those who, on occasions, resist the construction of local authority housing schemes at local level, it will be quite a different matter. When the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, gets the opportunity to do so, he should clarify what exactly is meant by the socially sensitive housing policy that the present Government intends to pursue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to share my time with Deputy Ring.</P>
      <P>On this, the second real sitting day of the new Dáil, we are discussing what is, in effect, the dismantling of the programme for the reform of local government.  I am astonished this has happened so quickly and that it is being pursued so enthusiastically by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. I fail to understand how the Minister and the new Government have so rapidly changed their minds on the question of the importance of local authority funding.  The purpose of allowing local authorities to retain the revenue from motor taxation was to give them an independent source of funding from moneys raised in their areas.  What could be more democratic than that?  What most surprised me was that the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, a product of a local authority, having risen from the status of county councillor to the status of Minister for the Environment, should be the one to promote the idea of removing this method of funding.  Why does he, so lately in office, want to claw back to central government this potentially valuable method of funding local government?  There was a genuine attempt by the outgoing Government to tackle the question of the reform of local government.  Why does the Minister want to take back that independence from local authorities?  Why does central government want to continue to control the proper funding of local government and, without proposing any alternative, dismantle this independent method of funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In l996 the outgoing Government published a major new programme entitled Better Local Government Programme for Change.  This was the first attempt in many decades to look seriously at reform and particularly funding of local government by giving local authorities an independent source of finance.  The Government's proposal is the thin end of the wedge in dismantling the package of reform of local government which was being implemented by the last Government.  I am disappointed the Government is taking that line of attack on democracy in local government.  Apparently central government, the Civil Service, the Progressive Democrats, or whoever is advising the Minister, want to exercise control over the vital aspect of local government that is funding.  There is no other logical explanation, even if it is to be replaced by another local charge &mdash; from a study of the Minister's speech, I do not think that is intended &mdash; or to provide funding from central government. Like Deputy Gilmore, I detect in the small print of the Government's proposals a desire by <Col N="390" /> central Government to have control of local government.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to my constituency colleague, Deputy Molloy whose appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the environment I welcome.  I welcome also the appointment of my other two constituency colleagues, Deputies Ó Cuív and Fahey &mdash; I must be unique in having three Ministers in my constituency. They can be assured of my full co-operation in whatever they can do for West Galway.  I hope Deputy Molloy, who is a supporter of the Mutton Island project, will get on with it as soon as possible now that he is in a position to do something about it.  Deputy Ó Cuív, who will have responsibility for the islands and the Gaeltacht will have my full co-operation and will be welcome to any advice I can give him.  I hope Deputy Fahey, who will have responsibility for health, will fulfil his promise to allocate £75 million for a new hospital and the siting of a cardiac unit in Galway.  I hope he will continue the good work done by the outgoing Minister, Deputy Noonan, in terms of the hospital and hospice in Galway.  As a backbench Deputy from west Galway I will help the Minister to honour the commitments he made in that regard during the election campaign.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, stated the Government may consider abolishing local authorities.  If that is the intention, the Progressive Democrats obviously hold local authorities and councillors in very low esteem.  Local councillors are being denied the right to vote in the Seanad elections.  This is indicative of the disregard the Progressive Democrats have for county councillors.  Rather than nominating candidates to the Seanad &mdash; a body they want to abolish &mdash; the Progressive Democrats are doing a deal with the Taoiseach to nominate four of them to the Seanad.  That is not only undemocratic, it is also illegal.  I hope the Progressive Democrats have abandoned the idea of scrutinising the votes of their councillors in the Seanad elections because councillors will not tolerate it.  It is also contrary to the constitutional provisions governing Seanad elections.  Article 18 states that every election of the elected members of Seanad Éireann shall be held under a system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote and by secret ballot.  Many PD councillors are concerned about their rights under those provisions.  They have a right to vote in their local authorities.  While the PD tail is not yet wagging the dog, it is beginning to annoy it. The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, stated that if we cannot fund local government perhaps it should be abolished.  If that is the attitude of the Progressive Democrats, county councillors should not be enticed by a dangling carrot.  I have met ten councillors who have been promised a Seanad nomination, six of whom have certainly been misled. They should be careful not to give away their democratic right to Fianna Fáil or any other party, irrespective of what they are promised. They should protect their rights as county councillors <Col N="391" /> because the Government does not want to give power to local authorities.  It wants to take away their financial base and it is trying to deny its councillors the right to vote for their candidates. I will continue to highlight this matter until the Seanad elections take place.  Members of local authorities have every right to be concerned that the Government, influenced by the Progressive Democrats, may abolish local authorities or diminish their authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your appointment.  I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, well on his appointment.  On my first occasion to speak since the general election, it would be remiss of me not to state that this is the first time since the foundation of the State that we do not have a Minister in Connacht, not to mention in County Mayo which has always had one.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, who was given responsibility for food safety and older people. There will be large numbers of older people in the west if this Government has its way because, without a Minister from the west at the Cabinet table, we will not get much of the national cake.</P>
      <P>Matt Durkan, a publican in Balla who is well versed on the political scene, told me last week that he knew Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats would be elected and he is convinced that water charges will be reintroduced.  People on social welfare should not have to pay for water.  The authorities see fit to take a poor person receiving £70 or £80 per week to court for failing to pay water charges while others can receive £1.3 million.  We fail to send those who murder or place bombs under cars to jail, but we have no difficulty jailing those who fail to pay the local authority a few pounds for water.</P>
      <P>When I was elected to the Dáil in 1994 the main issue concerning most councillors was county roads.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his super sub, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, should honour the commitment of the previous Government in a ten-year plan to give a major injection of funding to county roads.  In the past two budgets large sums of money were allocated to county roads.  County Cavan, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, received massive funding for county roads.  Large sums of money should not be allocated to counties Wicklow and Kerry because of deals done with Independents.  That is not the way to run a Government.  I hope substantial funding will be provided for county roads in the next budget.  County councillors from all sides want the previous Government's commitment honoured.  Mayo County Council devised a five year plan for county roads and deals done with Deputies Fox, Healy-Rae or others should not prevent the completion of that plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government also provided funding for the building of a record number of houses in the past few years.  Housing is a major problem for all county councils.  In the past when a family <Col N="392" /> were housed, they were housed for life but because of separations and people entering second relationships, that is no longer the case. When the previous Government introduced the urban-rural pilot scheme, we did not realise the effects it would have on the young people who want to continue to live in their local towns.  Most people who were born and reared in Westport want to continue living there, but that is not possible because of the large number of people from Dublin who now own property in the town.  The tax breaks given under that pilot scheme have resulted in a shortage of housing for the people of Westport.  More people are leaving Westport to live in Castlebar, Newport and surrounding towns.  That trend will have an impact on the school population, the post office, other services and the general population of Westport.  In future when planning permission is sought by a contractor for the provision of, say, l00 houses under a pilot scheme 50 per cent of those houses should be cost effective.  Unlike what is happening now, the price of 50 per cent of those houses should be controlled and they should be made available at a reasonable price to people living and working in town.</P>
    <P>In Westport big business people from London, Dublin and elsewhere own more property than the local people who live in the town.  I hope the Government will consider this matter.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, has responsibility for housing and urban renewal.  I would like a future scheme to cover towns which need an injection of funding like Ballinrobe, Newport, Erris and others in north Mayo.  I would prefer if derelict areas were developed and local people rather than big business people from London, Dublin and elsewhere were encouraged to invest in such towns.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of rates.  I cannot understand why The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland have not brought a case to the High Court to challenge the constitutionality of the imposition of rates only on business people. House owners pay direct tax, but so do business people.  It is time the Government devised a way to abolish unjust rates which penalise business people.  I am in business and I know of other business people who pay rates, water charges and taxes.  It is time the Chambers of Commerce brought a case to the High Court to test if it is constitutional to require business people to pay rates when no one else has to pay them.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about reforming local authorities.  In recent years my local authority stopped employing workers, including bin men, and people who cleaned the drains and the graveyards. The response from the county manager is to involve the community in cleaning up graveyards and the roads.  I will ask my county manager at the estimates meeting this year what is the function of the county council.  Its function appears to be to have more senior executive engineers than ordinary workers.  There are too many chiefs and no Indians to do the work.  I will <Col N="393" /> observe the actions of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, who was a very good Minister and did an excellent job.  It has taken the present Minister and two junior Ministers to replace him and they will have a major job in doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that one of the first major debates of the new Dáil should concern local government.  Right up to the beginning of the decade the road to the reform of local government was paved with reports, studies, commissions and so on.  In fairness, those worthy studies were accompanied with good intentions.  Successive Governments were often genuinely concerned that something should be done.  Unfortunately, something else generally arose to crowd local government off the political agenda.</P>
      <P>The 1990's saw the beginning of the process of reform.  First, there was the Barrington Report on Local Government Reorganisation and Reform. That was quickly followed by the Local Government Act, 1991 which ushered in some substantial reforms.  Among the most notable of those was the introduction of broad powers of general competence for local government to act in the interests of the local community.  This reform removed the negative and restrictive <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine which had stifled local government thinking.  In many ways the Barrington report and the subsequent legislation acted as a stimulus to the major programme of reform on which we are about to embark.</P>
      <P>We are in the happy position that there is broad consensus among all the main political parties that local government's time has come.  This has to be good news for all of us who have seen so many false dawns for local government.  I know debates such as these can tend to be somewhat confrontational.  That is the nature of the system. However, I am heartened on this occasion because there is so much on which both sides of the House agree and progress can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement that the role of the councillors should be strengthened so that they are more meaningfully involved in policy development and review, as well generally monitoring local authority operations.  There is broad consensus that local democracy has to be widened to include relevant sectoral interests.  Of particular importance is the proposed integration of local government and local development, as proposed <Col N="394" /> by the Devolution Commission, among others.</P>
    <P>On the delivery of services by local authorities, I doubt if any of us would disagree that the emphasis has to be on local authorities providing a first class service for their customers.  Similarly, there is a broad political welcome for reform measures such as the application of strategic management throughout local government and the comprehensive modernising of the local authority accounting system.</P>
    <P>In his contribution to this debate yesterday evening the Minister touched on the concept of value for money in local authorities.  Deputy Allen also spoke about this.  Unfortunately, the Minister was beaten by the clock yesterday and did not get a chance to expand on his views.  I will take up where the Minister left off and put on record the views of the Minister and the Government on value for money.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated last night, if local authorities want to be awarded greater discretion on how they spend their money, they must make and be seen to make the best possible use of the resources allocated to them.  We will put in place arrangements to ensure that greater value for money and improved performance are essential prerequisites for increased discretionary spending. I am confident all authorities will be anxious to improve the manner in which they do business.</P>
    <P>Society is becoming more and more consumerdriven. This point is not lost on local authority management and staff who in many ways already demonstrate that they appreciate the importance of improving and developing their operational methods to meet the needs of this changing society.  The public expect and demand high standards of efficiency and effectiveness for local government.  It is one of this Government's primary objectives to ensure these standards can and will be met.</P>
    <P>Strong emphasis was placed on value for money in &ldquo;Better Local Government&rdquo;.  In addition, the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997 put the value for money unit in my Department on a statutory basis and established a legal basis for value for money audits of local authorities.  We are committed to building on those initiatives.  The value for money approach shifts the emphasis away from the traditional audit on to a broader view of the organisation as a whole and how it achieves its objectives. This is very much a progressive, outsidein approach which takes an overall view of the organisation as well as looking at each specific area of work.  No area will be exempt as the value for money concept must permeate and become part of each individual cog in the overall local government wheel.  By adopting this approach local authorities will become more focused on achieving results, on satisfying their customers, and less focused on pure administration.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to strengthen the core requirement of value for money in all local government operations.  Arrangements are being <Col N="395" /> made to introduce comprehensive value for money audits in all local authorities.  The role of the VFM unit is being extended to carry more indepth analyses of a wider range of local authority activities.  Value for money must become part and parcel of everyday activity.</P>
    <P>The achievement of efficiency in local government has to be an integral part of any reform programme. It is a crucial aspect of the customer service approach about which the Minister spoke earlier.  Performance indicators and service standards will become the yardstick of efficiency for customer service.  Local authorities have had performance indicators in planning for more than 30 years.  The legal requirement to respond to a planning application within two months is certainly a spur to customer service.</P>
    <P>Efficiency will not just be confined to the delivery of services, important and all as this is.  The drive for efficiency will also extend to the whole finance function in local authorities.  The aim will be to make the local government financial reporting system more transparent, more understandable and more accessible to the public.  The reporting system will be underpinned by a range of financial performance indicators which will tie in with the focus on customer care.</P>
    <P>All of the initiatives on funding and value for money which the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, and myself have spoken about will place local government back where it should belong &mdash; as a vibrant leader in local communities. It will have the financial resources to provide optimum services to all its customers.  It will be ready to face the challenges of the 21st century from a solid footing.</P>
    <P>There is no intention, as has been suggested in Opposition contributions, to reintroduce water charges.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dempsey stated this clearly in his speech yesterday evening.  There should not be any misinterpretation of the direction the Minister intends to take on local government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hayes Mr. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to wait and see.  I listened intently to the depressing speech by the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, this morning. It is readily accepted by most county councillors and officials of local government that the radical reforms implemented by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Allen, over a short period of time could now amount to nought as a result of the Government's proposal.  That is why Fine Gael has placed this timely motion before the House.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to propose that motor taxation revenue should not contribute to local government funding.  The empowerment that Deputy Dempsey spoke about was based on the fundamental idea that for the first time a dedicated source of finance from national moneys would go to local government.  This idea has been disregarded by the Government.  It is a depressing time for local government and councillors who are at the coalface, delivering a service in local authorities.  The reforms we introduced in the past two years will amount to nothing.</P>
      <P>The Government amendment states that comprehensive new funding arrangements for local government will be put in place.  However, we have not seen any fleshing out of these ideas, at last week's press conference or in the House. There has been no elaboration of what the Government wants to do about funding arrangements. It is ironic that it is only 20 years since Fianna Fáil abolished the source of funding which provided decent local authority services.  We are still paying for that disastrous decision.</P>
      <P>There were some huge hints of democratic centralism in Deputy Molloy's speech.  All power is to be given to the Minister and central Government. We gave control and power back to local authorities.  The new Government, in only two weeks of power, has taken that control away. There were some gems in Deputy Molloy's speech, including the proposed capping of commercial rates.  I am a member of a local authority which covers two of the country's five worst areas in terms of deprivation and poverty.  It does not have a huge pool of commercial rates as a resource.  By capping commercial rates in our local authority, an opportunity to give more resources to the people it serves will be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another whopper in Deputy Molloy's speech was the reference to facilitating a new partnership with the community and voluntary sector.  Will we return to the year zero or work from the model which has been in place for the past ten or 15 years &mdash; partnerships, county enterprise boards and the regional authorities?  The programme for change tried to make sense of all of these interesting and exciting levels of government when the strategic committees were established. Does this Government want to abolish that new structure?  Does it want to weed out the consensus which has been reached in those bodies at local level?  It is a dangerous time for all local <Col N="397" /> authority members because of this Government decision.</P>
    <P>I favoured motor taxation as a dedicated source of moneys.  For the first time, irrespective of how the economy was performing, local government would have known what it was receiving.  Motor taxation is a buoyant source of revenue.  Ireland has one of the lowest rates of car ownership in the EU.  As the economic boom continues, the affluence it will bring will result in more cars on the road.  As a result of this Government decision, local authorities will no longer receive this source of revenue.  This is bad for local government and local democracy.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, ensured for the first time that local authority members would be consulted about the equalisation fund and the allocation of central Government funds.  Is there any commitment to the representation of local councillors or their representative bodies in the proposed funding process?  Will the democratic centralist position of Deputy Molloy mean their views will be ignored?  If we go down that road, it will be a bad day for local government and councillors who are democratically elected to serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment was right when he said there will be ongoing financial difficulties for local authorities.  He said £1.3 billion is allocated to local authorities at the moment and this may increase to £1.6 million by 1999.  Much of this is due to the fact that there are huge maintenance costs coming on stream as a result of EU Structural Funds.  Those new moneys will have to come from a new source of Government revenue. This Government does not appear to have given any great consideration to the new funding proposals. It was a grave day when, within two weeks of taking office, the Government decided to give more power to the Minister at the centre and less power to local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell" hpid="Ms O. Mitchell Ms O. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, on his appointment. I wish him well in the job.  Yesterday evening I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech.  Before finding fault with it, I should say that I fully accept his good intentions with regard to the reform of local government funding.  It is needed because, despite all the lip service paid to the notion of local authority autonomy by successive Governments, inexplicably no party has succeeded in granting autonomy to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result is that we have the most centralised system of local government in Europe.  When a system to allow autonomy to local authorities through a dedicated system of finance from motor taxation seemed to be within our grasp it was snatched away and that perplexes me. Nobody seems to know why the Minister considered it so important to withdraw that power from local authorities in what was almost his first act in office.  The Minister can correct me if I am <Col N="398" /> wrong but I see the dead hand of the Department of Finance in this.</P>
    <P>The proposed system of financing local authorities from motor taxation, although not a perfect one, offered many advantages.  It had the advantage of being publicly acceptable as an existing tax, which could be collected and spent locally.  It had the benefit of certainty from year to year and did not isolate local government from economic changes, which is the way it should be. No more so than central Government, local government should not have to cut back when economic restraint is required.  The proposed system also allowed local discretion which is the key to local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the need for local authorities to have enough money, which is important. However, the Minister knows, as does anyone involved in local government, that the real determinant of autonomous local government which can deliver an effective service is the funding mechanism, not the level of funding, important though that is.  Real local government can only happen if each local authority can set its own objectives and priorities to deliver services in a way best suited to local needs.  Such needs can only be ascertained locally.</P>
    <P>Local government can only have that kind of autonomy if it is funded by a dedicated, ringfenced and independent method.  It must have its own source of finance by right, not by the whim of this or future Ministers for the Environment or Finance.  Such independent financing can be achieved in various ways.  Motor taxation is one and a percentage of the national tax take is another.  Even though the latter is a centralised way of funding local government, it can and does work in other countries.  However, the difference there is that it is a fixed percentage guaranteed by legislation over a number of years.  That is the only way to guarantee the autonomy of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and wish him well.  I listened carefully to the language he used during the week when he spoke about the new local government fund.  It started off as a fixed percentage, although the time span was not mentioned.  It is now a specified percentage, but what exactly does that mean?  The awful realisation is dawning on all of us that it simply means local government will be funded by the Exchequer and that this local government fund does not have any basis in reality.  It is just a notional concept that can be changed at the whim of this Minister or his successors at the first hint of economic change.  If that is true it is the most retrograde step in the long and sad history of local government's emasculation.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points concerning value for money auditing of which the Minister has made much.  Nobody is against value for money auditing, which has already been incorporated by most local authorities as part of their strategic management initiatives involving performance indicators.  While no one objects to the <Col N="399" /> notion of value for money, local government decisions are a matter of judgment which local councillors are elected to make.  That is the essence of local government.</P>
    <P>If national standards are set which remove discretion from local authorities to provide the wide variety of services needed in different areas &mdash; given their different economic, social and physical conditions &mdash; one takes away all notion <Col N="400" /> of local accountability.  One is either accountable to the centre or to the local population.  One cannot have two masters.  That has been the eternal problem of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied there will not be a reduction in the level of service provided and that, with the use of modern technology and means of communication, any difficulties can be kept to a minimum. The Registrar of Titles has communicated regularly with members of the legal profession practising in the counties concerned to keep them informed of the position and I am sure any teething problems which might arise will be promptly dealt with.</P>
      <P>For the information of those members of the legal profession who have expressed misgivings because of the possible inconvenience of travelling to Waterford rather than Dublin, I have no doubt the policy of decentralisation is correct. While there might be some minor change to work patterns, I am satisfied the benefits for everyone involved &mdash; staff moving to decentralised locations and existing communities &mdash; are enormous. The revitalisation of communities and the increased economic activity are extremely beneficial to all.  I invite anybody who has any doubts about this to visit my constituency of Kerry South, where about 140 staff of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are based in Killarney, to see the operation there for themselves. The facilities there are first class and no difficulty has arisen with work being done there which was previously done in Dublin.  I ask people who have misgivings to co-operate fully with the change.  If there is any doubt about the willingness of civil servants to fully co-operate with decentralisation, the fact that more than 1,000 applications for transfer to Waterford were received should dispel these doubts.  Future decentralisation of parts of Departments from Dublin should take place and I intend to vigorously pursue opportunities for further decentralisations.</P>
      <P>The Bill is short.  Its main purpose is to amend the Registration of Title Act, 1964, to provide the necessary legislative basis for the decentralisation of part of the Land Registry to Waterford.</P>
      <P>The law relating to the registration of land is governed by the 1964 Act, section 7 of which provides that there shall be a central office located in the county borough of Dublin and a local office in each county other than Dublin.  This central office is to be the office for registration of all land in the State.</P>
      <P>Following on the Government's decision to decentralise certain operations of the Land Registry to Waterford, it becomes necessary, to provide a clear legal basis for the move, to amend section 7 of the 1964 Act.  The necessary amendments, which the Bill before the House will effect, will essentially provide for the establishment of constituent offices of the central office which will carry out the work currently performed by the central office under the 1964 Act.  The result of this change will be that the functions currently carried out by the central office of the Land Registry will be regionalised through the establishment of constituent offices in Dublin and outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>While the Land Registry will continue to consist of a central office and local offices, the Bill's effect will be that the central office will not be a physical entity but will be made up of constituent offices to be located in Dublin and in any county so designated by an order made by me, as Minister. This will permit the designation of Waterford as an area within which a constituent office may be located.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly deal with each section.  Section 1 amends section 7 of the 1964 Act in two respects. First, it provides for the substitution of a new subsection for subsection (1) to provide that the central office of the Land Registry will consist of one or more constituent offices to be located in Dublin and in any other area which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, by order, <Col N="403" /> designate.  There will continue to be local offices in each county other than Dublin and any county where a constituent office is located.</P>
    <P>Second, by the addition of a new subsection, subsection (5), the Minister is given the necessary power to make or revoke an order designating any county as an area within which a constituent office will be located.  Because the Dublin office will service the greater Dublin area there will be no need to establish a local office within any of the three administrative counties of South Dublin, Fingal or Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Neither will it be necessary to have one in any county where there is a constituency office.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with transitional provisions so that the central office of the Land Registry, at present located in Dublin in accordance with section 7 of the 1964 Act, will become a constituent office under the terms of the amended section 7. The section states that the central office of the Land Registry, which is located in the county borough of Dublin, after the passage of this Bill will become a constituent office or constituent offices of the central office in the county borough.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill simply provides that the short title will be the Registration of Title (Amendment) Act, 1997, also stating that it will be construed as one with the 1964 Act.</P>
    <P>Those are the terms of this short but important Bill without which the proposed decentralisation of parts of the Land Registry to Waterford could have given rise to the need for cumbersome and expensive procedures to ensure compliance with the 1964 Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> the location of the central office.  That would also have raised doubts about our commitment to genuine decentralisation by requiring certain operations in relation to the registration of land in the counties to remain in Dublin.  With this Bill we will ensure that there is genuine decentralisation and a proper legal base therefor.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  Given the commitment, expertise and vigour of the staff involved, I am confident that the decentralisation of part of the Land Registry to Waterford will be a success.</P>

      <P>My party will be supporting this technical Bill to leave room for no doubt whatsoever in the transfer of part of the business of the Land Registry to Waterford as to whether and where titles can be finally registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The move of part of the business of the Land Registry was a good decision taken by the then Government in 1992.  Nonetheless, it is gilding the lily somewhat for the Minister to contend he is introducing the legislation to provide the necessary <Col N="404" /> legislative framework.  The legislation to give legal effect to the overall changes envisaged in Land Registry is not yet ready and we will await its introduction before complimenting the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>Section 1 (5) (a) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may, from time to time, designate by order any county. as an area within which one or more than one constituent office of the central office shall be located.</P>
    <P>Is that subsection included because the Minister intends creating a 36-county or 47-county Ireland in the near future?  Does this encompass some master plan <i>vis-à-vis</i> Ireland of which we are not at present aware?</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that the recently created Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council are covered by the provisions of this Bill &mdash; not having been county boroughs in their own right heretofore &mdash; I question the inclusion of this subsection giving the Minister the right, without referral to the Dáil, to revoke an order designating any county, already designated, in order to replace it with a different county borough.  I should like the Minister to elaborate when replying. The reason may well be to obviate the necessity for additional legislation but I would welcome his explanation.</P>
    <P>I might refer to the changes which have taken place in regard to land registration generally. When I first entered this House I had very little knowledge of the operations of the Land Registry because I did not encounter many problems in relation thereto in the early days of my political life.  However, I recall sharing offices with rural Members who appeared to spend endless hours contacting the Land Registry querying folio numbers and various dealings.  Although no doubt begun beforehand, I am glad to report that during my term of office an enormous change was effected in the manner in which its business was conducted.  I want to pay tribute publicly to Catherine Treacy, Chief Registrar in the Land Registry, at Assistant Secretary level, on the phenomenal changes effected, leading to a reduction in the length of time it takes solicitors and others to conduct their business with that office.</P>
    <P>Any examination of the strategic management initiative document prepared by that office some months ago would make it abundantly clear that its aim is to provide all its services within defined, acceptable time limits.  The clientele of all offices and organisations should expect and obtain delivery of requisite services within an acceptable timescale.  The administration of the Land Registry has striven in recent years to improve its output, to modernise its equipment, install computers, channelling all counties into its computerised system to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> As all Members know, legal transactions can be extremely complex, yet since 1988 there has been a 48 per cent increase in the workload of the Land Registry and a 62 per cent increase in the workload of the copy map section.  At the same time, as the Minister acknowledged, there has not been a commensurate increase in the number of staff.  This means that all these improvements have been due to the efficiency and management skills of those administering the office to ensure that, despite increased business, scarce resources are usefully deployed, much to their credit.  Having visited its various sections and a number of courts dealing with land registration matters on many occasions I was very impressed with its method of operation.</P>
    <P>The number of legal transactions undertaken by the Land Registry office amounted to 91,381 in 1989 and 119,395 in 1996, with an output in 1989 of 72,668, the corresponding figure for 1996 being 114,024, representing a 64 per cent increase. In addition, map holdings increased by 62 per cent.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, the decision to convert the Land Registry to semi-State status was taken a considerable time ago.  While during my term of office it was not possible to make progress on the relevant legislation, I trust the Minister, a working Deputy from South Kerry &mdash; who no doubt will have encountered many constituents' problems &mdash; will ensure that the relevant legislation will be prepared and introduced expeditiously, thus completing the circle commenced in 1992.  A great deal of additional work was carried out in the past couple of years, along with the new building now available in Waterford for the transfer of part of its business there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat ironic that today we are engaged in amending the Registration of Title Act, 1964, introduced by one of the Minister's predecessors, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Charles J. Haughey.  That was one of his better contributions to political life and constituted a milestone.  In introducing that Act, the then Minister, Charles J. Haughey, said that the system of registration was intended to be &ldquo;cheap, simple and effective&rdquo;, yet on many fronts over a considerable number of years it transpired that registration under the system then introduced was not cheap, simple or effective.  Like many other things Charles J. Haughey said, it turned out not to be correct at all.  In the 1990s, when the same Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach, a crisis obtained within the Land Registry.  I am now reciting notes I made, having spoken here in 1990, when I proposed a motion deploring the enormous delays and deteriorating position within the Land Registry, calling for its establishment as an efficient business-orientated semi-State corporation.  That was the contribution of Mr. Charles J. Haughey to the Land Registry system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proper to give credit where it is due and there has been an enormous improvement in the <Col N="406" /> Land Registry in recent years.  Ms Catherine Treacy and her staff have done a fantastically good job and the position has been very much improved.  With an increased volume of business, arrears, although still substantial, have been reduced.  At the end of December 1990 there were arrears of 50,624 while they now stand at about 40,000.  Extra work has been taken on and current business is being dealt with, but there is still a substantial backlog of arrears and every effort should be made to ensure it is cleared without delay.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer in passing to a matter that is indirectly related to the Land Registry, the Land Commission.  The Land Commission is to blame for many of the delays in the Land Registry because many papers have not been sent to the Land Registry from the old Land Commission office.  I know of a case that has been ongoing for ten years and the papers have not yet reached the Land Registry.  From his experience in Kerry, the Minister will be aware of this problem and he should ensure the issue is dealt with.  Land Commission sub-division applications are a total waste of time for the parties involved and the officials who have to deal with the applications.  Perhaps they should be retained for purchasers outside the EU, but otherwise they should be abolished.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made with computerisation but much more needs to be done to complete this process.  There is also the related problem of premises.  Computerisation cannot take place in Chancery Street and proper premises are required there.  The new premises in Waterford will be state of the art, but it is important that the computerisation process is completed in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry is a self-financing body with a fee income of about £12 million.  There has been no increase in fees of any consequence for a long time.  The Land Registry has coped with extra expenses by way of increased business and I welcome the business orientated approach adopted by it.  I moved a motion here in 1990 calling for the establishment of the Land Registry as an efficient business orientated semi-State corporation, but that label is still outstanding.  That matter must be dealt with.  When the Minister comes back to the House with the necessary Bill in that regard we will give him credit for helping to bring the Land Registry into the next millennium.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very important Bill.  I welcome the decentralisation of the Land Registry.  It will be of benefit to the local economies involved and to the overall administration of business.  The Midland Solicitors' Association which communicated with the Minister and his predecessors is concerned about decentralisation to Waterford, particularly as it affects people in Offaly.  I have great admiration for Waterford and I wish the <Col N="407" /> new offices well.  It is proposed to have three Land Registry regions: Limerick, Waterford and Kerry; Cork; and Tipperary, Kilkenny, Carlow, Laois, Offaly and Wexford.  Since Edenderry in Offaly is only about 45 miles from Dublin, it would be much more convenient for the people there to continue to do business in Dublin rather than Waterford.  There is a train service from Tullamore to Dublin which takes approximately an hour and many people in that town would find it more convenient to do business in Dublin than Waterford.  People in towns such as Portarlington and Portlaoise would also find it more convenient to do business in Dublin.  I am sure work will be carried out efficiently in Waterford and the office there will be of benefit to the people of Waterford, but it would be much more convenient for the people of Offaly and Laois to do business in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been a great improvement in the Land Registry in recent years.  In 1980 there were 565 staff dealing with 222,000 applications and now there are 515 staff dealing with 300,000 applications, which shows a remarkable improvement. Even though there are arrears of 40,000, great progress has been made in that regard.  I congratulate Ms Catherine Treacy and her staff on the work they have carried out.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to delays in the allocation of land by the former Land Commission. In some cases land held by the Land Commission still has not been vested in the Land Registry. There are many delays with farm retirement pensions and grants because people cannot prove title.  Queries are being raised with the Land Commission in regard to some of the land vested in the Land Registry.  There is total chaos and many decent people are deprived of their livelihoods. This problem must be sorted out.  I will raise the matter again on the resumption of the Dáil if it is not dealt with in the meantime.</P>
    <P>A large body of opinion is in favour of turning the Land Registry into a semi-State body, but having dealt with the Land Registry for 35 years, I doubt if that will happen.  The staff in the Land Registry are very courteous and helpful.  The system has been improved.  However, the office did not have access to adequate numbers of staff or the necessary facilities for many years.  The existing staff worked in Dickensian conditions and were not provided with computers or modern equipment.  These problems have been overcome but before a final decision is taken I ask the Minister to consult the staff of the Land Registry who work at the coalface.  I wish the Minister well in his Department and I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <P>I welcome this legislation which is the final <Col N="408" /> technical legal adjustment to a project which has been some time in gestation.  Construction of the new state-of-the-art building in Waterford, which is almost complete, began under the previous Government.  Also nearing completion in the immediate vicinity of the new building are the new office for social services in Waterford and the new community care headquarters of the South Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Minister was involved on a number of fronts during her term of office.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Enright's statement regarding County Offaly the new building is located on a national primary route and access to it from that route, with the possible exception of peak times, will not be restricted.  Access to Waterford city is also being greatly improved.  A new roundabout is being built on the northern side of the bridge in Waterford in addition to a four lane highway through the Sallypark area.  Therefore, access to the new building will be quite easy.  If we balance the scenarios of people travelling to Waterford or other areas, the difficulties involved are not great.</P>
      <P>I am opposed to diluting this project because the number of civil servants being sent to Waterford is not great.  During his contribution the Minister stated the number involved will be 140. My recollection is that the initial staff allocation would be slightly higher than that.  To dilute this project further would not be acceptable to me and the people of Waterford.</P>
      <P>I will not delay the House.  I welcome the legislation and I wish the Minister and his family well during his term of office.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies O'Shea, Owen, O'Keeffe and Enright for condensing their remarks to allow other Members to contribute to the debate.  I congratulate Deputy O'Hanlon on attaining the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I also congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make was alluded to by Deputy O'Shea who stated that he does not want the decentralisation proposal for County Waterford to be diluted.  I sympathise with his view because he represents the city and county of Waterford.  However, there are a number of compelling reasons for the removal of Counties Laois and Offaly in my constituency from any proposed decentralisation to Waterford.  People engaged in dealing with the decentralisation of the Land Registry did not have adequate consultation at any level.  Removing the Land Registry from Dublin to Waterford will not serve the legal practitioners or, more importantly, the consumers of Counties Laois and Offaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The midland counties have suffered in the past by not being part of a clearly identifiable area which could be described as the &ldquo;midlands region&rdquo;, from the point of view of tourism, health <Col N="409" /> boards, Garda divisions, courts and regional authorities. Irrespective of the Department of Justice, the people living in the midlands have no relationship with those living in the south east and County Waterford.  I do not mean any disrespect to the people of County Waterford or those represented by Deputy O'Shea, but the midland counties have no connection with the south east and it is very difficult in terms of transportation and access for people in Counties Offaly and Laois to travel to County Waterford.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Shea made a feeble attempt to state that access to Waterford will be easy because a new roundabout has been built.  There might be a new roundabout in Waterford but it is 120 miles from north County Offaly to that city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I said much more than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a national primary route linking Counties Laois and Offaly with the south east.  The road system between Counties Offaly and Waterford, which runs through County Kilkenny, is deplorable and it has been neglected by successive Governments in terms of infrastructural development.  There is no public transport between Counties Offaly and Laois and County Waterford and I cannot understand how the public interest is being served by transferring the Land Registry from Dublin to Waterford as far as the provision of a service to the people of Counties Laois and Offaly is concerned.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.  If he cannot do so, I ask him to liaise with his colleagues to ensure that a sub-office of the Stamp Office is transferred to Waterford so that consumers visiting County Waterford to lodge documents in the Land Registry will avoid having to make a trip to Dublin to stamp such documents before lodging them.  If such documents could be stamped in Waterford, it would reduce the inconvenience involved.  If the Minister insists in proceeding with decentralisation to County Waterford, will he consider situating a capital taxes branch in that county so that a practitioner or punter making an inquiry could have access to such a facility which deals with those capital tax queries which go hand in hand with Land Registry and Stamp Office queries.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter in so far as it concerns Counties Offaly and Laois. If these counties were to be excluded from the proposed decentralisation to Waterford and retained in the Dublin jurisdiction, I do not see how the service operated in Waterford for the people of the south east would be diminished.  I do not envisage a need to reduce staff and I do not believe the decentralisation project outlined in the legislation will be diluted.  The Minister should reconsider this matter because it will be extremely difficult for people living in the midlands region to carry out their business in County Waterford with which Counties Laois and Offaly have no connection in terms of regional development or other projects.</P>

      <P>An issue was brought to my attention in respect of the Waterford offices when the project under discussion was first proposed in 1992 and I understand that a number of submissions have been made in respect of it.  I have a vested interest in this matter because my uncle retains an interest in a law searches office.  Many of my friends are involved in the industry and they are able to avail of the information provided by the various offices based in the Dublin region. I am not in favour of decentralisation and my view will not change regardless of the side of the House on which I sit.  If we decentralise these offices to Waterford, what are we saying to people who have built up practices over the years?  Are we saying people must now establish a Waterford based office to deal with certain queries for certain areas?  Is that a practical proposal? If so, it must be outlined.</P>
      <P>Many eminent people involved in this line of work have made submissions on this matter.  If they are practical and logical they should be reviewed rather than steamrolling an old proposal that may merit proper review.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Enright, O'Shea and Flanagan for their congratulations on my appointment as Minister.  I extend a warm welcome to Deputy Enright on his return to the House.</P>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.  It is unlikely that any other legislation I propose to the House will be as relatively uncontentuous, although there have been some murmurings regarding aspects of this legislation.  I will bring remarks made during the course of the debate to the attention of the Registrar of Titles.</P>
      <P>Decisions remain to be taken about the future organisation of the Land Registry and its status. This will form part of a heavy programme of administrative reform which I will undertake.  It will include a new court service and a prison authority.</P>
      <P>For all the technical nature of the measure before the House, it is important to see this Bill in the context of a policy of decentralisation.  The programme for Government contains a commitment on decentralisation and there is a growing realisation that, with modern technology, barriers that may have existed before can now be overcome.</P>
      <P>In her contribution, Deputy Owen wondered about the insertion of section 1(5)(a).  This provision allows the Minister to designate any county as one in which the central office may be located. It has no sinister intent other than to allow further decentralisation to take place if that is deemed appropriate.  It would hardly be necessary for a separate Bill to be introduced should such a decision be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's statement regarding the Land Commission.  I will bring his remarks to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  There would appear <Col N="411" /> to be some difficulty with regard to tracing documentation. It might be appropriate for the Minister to look at ways in which the situation could be improved because this could only lead in turn to titles being dealt with more expeditiously where Land Commission papers are required.</P>
    <P>Deputies Enright and Flanagan commented on concerns raised by the Midlands Bar Association and others.  I appreciate these concerns.  However, if we are determined about decentralisation there will have to be an acceptance of new practices and arrangements, especially given the enormous benefits it brings to local communities.  I am sure Deputy Callely will also understand that.</P>
    <P>I am very optimistic that this decentralisation will work in practice without giving rise to great difficulties.  I assure the House that, as always, the Land Registry will co-operate fully with solicitors. I realise, as Deputies Flanagan and Enright have said, that some people in County Offaly would prefer to deal with the Dublin office.  However, there has been welcome decentralisation to the midlands over the years which has benefited local communities.  That is as it should be.  In the same way, this decentralisation will benefit the people of Waterford and ensure that Waterford continues to be a viable place.  The movement of a significant number of civil servants to the city can only be of benefit.  I do not believe anybody begrudges Waterford its place in the sun where decentralisation is concerned.  Furthermore, the vast majority of work with the Land Registry is done through the post.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill.  It has limited ambitions, but it represents a good day for Waterford.  It is a worthwhile measure and I thank Deputies for their support.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate you, Sir, on your appointment and wish you well in your duties as Leas Cheann-Comhairle.  The Amsterdam EU Council Meeting was a very important event of the European Union.  I am pleased the House is now afforded the opportunity of hearing statements on the outcome of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the unusual position of reporting to the House on the Council, which was attended by my predecessor, Deputy John Bruton, and the then Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, accompanied by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the then Minister <Col N="412" /> for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>As the House will note, the outcome of the Council was very satisfactory from an Irish viewpoint. This was due in no small measure to the negotiating skills of the Government lead by Deputy John Bruton leading up to the Council.  I salute their performance in this regard.  I am also grateful to the previous Government for the briefing we received prior to the Council on the issues arising in Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute to the achievements of the previous Government in the area of European affairs.  This was perhaps most exemplified by the successful Irish Presidency of the EU during the second half of 1996.  The Irish Presidency gave a major impetus to the EU and in such key areas as the Intergovernmental Conference and economic and monetary union.  Perhaps most importantly from an Irish viewpoint, the efficiency and effectiveness of the Presidency, as indeed of the previous Irish Presidency in 1990, testify to the ability of a small member state in general, and Ireland specifically, to run a successful Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Council was billed in advance as the council to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference and this was its main achievement. The Council also addressed other issues, albeit briefly, and these are detailed in conclusions to the council.  Copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Intergovernmental Conference outcome I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Spring throughout the negotiations at ministerial level on the Intergovernmental Conference.  I also express on behalf of the House the appreciation of the outstanding work done by Mr. Noel Dorr, Ireland's representative on the Intergovernmental Conference negotiating group.  Apart from most effectively and constructively representing Ireland's interests, Mr. Dorr made a major contribution to the successful outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference in his period as chair of the negotiating group during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction to the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, as reflected in the Treaty of Amsterdam, was somewhat muted. Reaction centred on the assertion that the outcome does not represent a great leap forward towards further European integration.  This response ignores the real advances in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Unrealistic ambition would have meant there would not have been agreement in Amsterdam and the consequences of such a failure would have been most serious for the EU with regard to economic and monetary union and future enlargement.  It was important for the momentum of these two major projects that the EU leaders were able to demonstrate at Amsterdam the political will to agree on a wide range of issues and, thereby, conclude the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Dutch Presidency and, <Col N="413" /> particularly, Prime Minister Kok also deserve praise for this outcome.</P>
    <P>From the viewpoint of strategic Irish interests, the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference has been most satisfactory.  Four areas were of particular concern: institutional issues, especially the retention of the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission; common foreign and security policy issues; a strengthening of provisions in the justice and home affairs area, including the fight against crime, while still protecting the common travel area with the UK and assisting the EU in addressing the real concerns of its citizens more effectively.</P>
    <P>With regard to the institutional issues the outcome ensures Ireland will maintain the right to nominate a full member of the European Commission. This was a priority objective shared by all sides in this House and I am pleased it was realised.  The treaty provides for a future review of institutional arrangements, including the composition of the Commission.  The outcome of such a future review is not prejudged and, specifically, there has not been a decision to limit the size of the Commission in the future to 20 or any other definite number of Commissioners.  In effect, the larger member states have agreed, in the context of the first round of the next enlargement, to give up their right to nominate a second Commissioner provided that before this there is a limited reweighting of votes in the Council acceptable to all member states.</P>
    <P>More generally with regard to the institutions, the significant extension of the co-decision power of the European Parliament will mean greater democracy in the decision-making procedure of the EU.  The treaty contains the new provisions on flexibility which allow certain member states, in strictly defined circumstances, to co-operate more closely using the institutions of the EU.  Sufficient safeguards are included to prevent this development leading to a two tier Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will deal in greater detail with common foreign and security policy issues in his contribution.  I am satisfied Ireland's best interests have been served by what was agreed, especially with regard to defence, as it protects our position of military neutrality, while allowing us to contribute constructively to peacekeeping and humanitarian tasks with our European partners.  I am glad to see a distinctive European contribution developing along these lines rather than by an integration of the EU and Western European Union.  I welcome the opportunity for Ireland to continue on a case by case basis, under EU auspices, the peacekeeping work we have done for many years under UN auspices.</P>
    <P>The treaty includes strengthened provisions in the area of justice and home affairs, most notably by equipping the EU to act more effectively at Community level in the fight against organised crime.  With regard to the issues of freedom of movement, asylum and immigration, as well as the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement <Col N="414" /> into the Treaty on European Union, Ireland's overriding concern was the preservation of the common travel area with the UK.  This concern is fully met by a separate Protocol in the treaty.  We are also concerned, however, to continue to play as full a part as possible, compatible with the preservation of the common travel area, in developments at EU level in the area of justice and home affairs.  The Treaty of Amsterdam acknowledges this by providing that Ireland may opt in to some or all of the Schengen arrangements and the new Title on Freedom of Movement.</P>
    <P>A key aspect in this regard is the decision-making procedure for Ireland exercising its right to opt in.  As Deputy John Bruton is aware, Ireland believes what was agreed at Amsterdam was that Ireland and the UK could opt in to some or all of the Schengen arrangements unless a qualified majority of those countries participating in Schengen objected.  The text of the treaty circulated after the Amsterdam Council states that unanimity would be required to approve such an opt in.  Deputy Bruton has written to me on this issue and I am aware of his strong views on the matter.  We are seeking to resolve the matter in a way satisfactory to every member state.  I have no doubt that with goodwill it will be possible to resolve these issues.  It is important that we have the facility to opt in to some or all of the Schengen Agreement and the new treaty arrangements on freedom of movement while protecting the common travel area.  We will carefully monitor developments to see how our interests can be best served in the future by seeking to exercise our right to a partial or full opt in.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the Treaty of Amsterdam is the concentration on issues of real concern to the EU's citizens.  The treaty will allow Europe to address more effectively the most direct concerns of citizens about employment, crime, the environment, public health, consumer protection, social exclusion and non-discrimination.  Nobody is under the illusion that the new Employment Chapter in the treaty will of itself solve Europe's unacceptably high level of unemployment.  It will, however, underpin and advance policy co-operation between member states with regard to employment policy. It also contains a new provision for some limited EU funding in this area.</P>
    <P>With regard to social issues, the provisions on social exclusion and the incorporation of the Maastricht social Protocol are welcome, especially from an Irish viewpoint.  The social exclusion provision was promoted by Ireland and I am aware that the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was a particularly strong advocate.  The provision will allow the EU to develop programmes to the benefit of the most needy and socially excluded in European society. The incorporation of the social Protocol will allow for a single coherent legal basis for action by the 15 members on social issues.  Perhaps more importantly from an Irish viewpoint, the UK's acceptance of the social Protocol will ensure a <Col N="415" /> level playing field in this area between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam will enable more effective action at the EU level in combating international crime.  It is particularly important that the provisions in the treaty facilitating greater co-operation in the fight against organised crime and drug trafficking are fully utilised. Ireland will work to ensure this through the Justice and Home Affairs Council.  It should also be noted that on foot of an initiative taken during the Irish Presidency, an action plan on organised crime was endorsed by the Amsterdam Council. The Justice and Home Affairs Council has been mandated to implement the plan and will report on progress to the European Council in June 1998.  There is also a welcome provision in the treaty, again proposed by Ireland, in the health area, providing for the Community to complement member states' action in reducing drugsrelated health damage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the treaty provision which allows every citizen of the EU to write to the EU's institutions and have an answer in the same language will now also apply to the Irish language.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Amsterdam Council state the treaty will be formally signed in Amsterdam in October next.  While the formal legal advice of the Attorney General in the matter is awaited, it is the expectation of the Government that the treaty will be put to the people for approval in a referendum with the support of practically all parties in this House.  I also anticipate that the Government will produce a White Paper on the treaty for the information of the public in advance of the referendum.  The White Paper and the conduct of the referendum will take account of the McKenna judgment and the Government will assess the position in the light of the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied the Treaty of Amsterdam represents an outcome which is good for Ireland and for Europe.  Membership of the European Union is overwhelmingly in Ireland's national interest and this remains the view of the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>At Amsterdam the European Council took decisive steps towards EMU.  It agreed the detailed legislation to give effect to the Stability and Growth Pact, the main elements of which had been agreed already at the Dublin European Council at the end of the Irish Presidency.  The pact is designed to ensure budgetary discipline in the third stage of EMU and is vital to ensure coherent European economic policies in the future. The agreement on the Stability and Growth Pact was complemented at Amsterdam by the adoption of a European Council resolution on growth and employment.  This resolution, together with the proposed new Title on Employment in the treaty, is evidence of the firm commitment to place employment at the top of the EU's political <Col N="416" /> agenda.  The European Council also adopted a resolution which lays down the principles and fundamental elements of the new exchange rate mechanism, ERM2, to be established on 1 January 1999.  This resolution will ensure that member states outside the euro area which participate in the mechanism orient their policies to stability and foster convergence.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam European Council endorsed the design of the common face for euro coins. Together with the euro banknotes, this gives tangible evidence to citizens of preparations for the euro.  Some outstanding aspects of the legal framework for the euro were also agreed and the Council decided that the text of the relevant regulations should be published to ensure maximum certainty for the markets in their preparations for EMU.</P>
    <P>Europe remains on course for the introduction of the single currency on 1 January 1999.  Member states have once again confirmed their commitment to the commencement of EMU, in accordance with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the timetable agreed by the European Council in Madrid in December 1995.  The Government believes EMU will commence on time and Ireland will be a member from the outset.  The successful transition to economic and monetary union is a key challenge facing the Government. As stated in An Action Programme for the New Millennium, a major task is to ensure the Irish economy copes successfully with the challenges of entry into EMU, in accordance with the provisions in the Maastricht Treaty, particularly in the initial absence of Britain.  The Government's action programme also identifies a number of requirements for successful EMU entry, including tighter fiscal discipline and support for the Maastricht criteria across Europe and support for Europe wide employment measures.  This approach is fully consistent with the conclusions of the Amsterdam Council.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the employment issue in my comments on the Intergovernmental Conference and on EMU.  The Amsterdam Council decided to convene an extraordinary meeting of the European Council under the Luxembourg Presidency, to review and maintain the momentum in the fight against European unemployment. Ireland's employment performance has been well above the European average in recent years.  A stable macro-economic policy allied to the social partnership approach are the keys to this success and the new partnership Government will continue to support this national consensus.</P>
    <P>The completion of the Single Market is of great relevance to the employment problem.  The Amsterdam Council considered the Commission's action plan for the single market and endorsed its overall objective of a better functioning internal market.  Ireland fully supports measures to make the Single Market deliver to the full its employment creation potential.  The Commission has tabled proposals to reform regional aid guidelines in the context of the Single <Col N="417" /> Market action plan.  Discussions on these proposals are ongoing between the Commission and member states and we will be vigilant to ensure Ireland's interests are protected in this regard. The Amsterdam Council also adopted conclusions on a range of EU external issues, and these will be dealt with by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his statement.</P>
    <P>Negotiations for enlargement, which is one of the Agenda 2000 items, will begin as soon as possible after December 1997.  The others include the future financial framework of the EU beyond 1999 and CAP reform.  The Commission is expected to unveil its outline view on these issues in a paper to be circulated on 16 July next.  I stress that these will be Commission proposals. Decisions on them will be for the European Council in the final analysis.  Agenda 2000 has major implications for Ireland.  The outcome of the negotiations on future funding, especially Structural and Cohesion Funds, and the implications of CAP reform will significantly influence Irish economic and social development into the next millennium.  Ireland has made impressive economic strides over the relatively recent past. Notwithstanding this, Ireland still has major infrastructural needs, an unacceptably high level of unemployment, urban and rural deprivation and a growing labour force.  There must be full recognition of these factors in the Agenda 2000 negotiations. It is my intention to ensure a comprehensive and co-ordinated Irish negotiating position on these crucial issues.  The Ministers and secretaries group on EU policy, which I chair, will formulate and oversee implementation of this position.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam European Council was a success. The Intergovernmental Conference was concluded, thereby paving the way for the EU to move on to its next business.  Economic and monetary union remains firmly on target.  The Amsterdam Council signalled the highest priority in the fight against unemployment.  The EU has a series of crucial decisions to take before the year 2000.  The objective must be that the EU should arrive at the next millennium as a cohesive, unified entity, delivering prosperity and security in Europe, and with an ever more influential political and economic voice in the world.  The EU has much to be proud of in its first 40 years of existence. We can also be justly proud of our contribution to Europe during the 25 years of membership. I look forward to this mutually beneficial relationship continuing and intensifying into the next century.</P>
    <P>I am in the unusual position of presenting the report to the House but I acknowledge the work of my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, the ongoing work over the past four and a half years of the former Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and that of the former Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  As a nation we can be very proud of the contribution which Ireland made in implementing change over the past number of years, particularly during <Col N="418" /> its Presidency and the achievements in Amsterdam.</P>

      <P>I congratulate you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your election and wish you well during your term in office.  I thank the Taoiseach for his kind words which are much appreciated and wish him and his Government, in particular the Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, well in their new duties.  I join him in congratulating Mr. Noel Dorr on the work done in the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is unusual to name civil servants in the House but I might add the name of Bobby McDonagh since he worked with me on the reflection group and with Mr. Dorr on the Intergovernmental Conference. They did a very good and important job. I express my appreciation to the officials in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs who worked very professionally in this area.</P>
      <P>Jean Monnet writing of the 1953 Draft Treaty seeking to establish a European political community stated in his memoirs:</P>
      <P>Nothing that has been conscientiously made in this way is ever useless; for, by working together, everyone acquires a better knowledge of his partner's and their problems, and he passes it on to others in his turn..  The constitution-makers were. insufficiently (cautious) when they imagined that European unity would begin with the establishment of a federal political system..  It was a step in the right direction; but it proposed to go too fast, without waiting for the force of necessity to make it seem natural in the eyes of Europeans.</P>
      <P>We should reflect on these words but must also acknowledge that the member states which talked most about &ldquo;deepening&rdquo; the EU before &ldquo;widening&rdquo; did not follow through on their rhetoric.  The designation &ldquo;European Union&rdquo; is not to be found in the Treaty of Rome and it was not until the 1991 Treaty on European union, the Maastricht Treaty, that the concept was brought into existence.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable more progress was not made in Amsterdam but from the enforcement of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) Treaty (the Treaty Of Paris, 1951) in 1952 to the Treaty on European Union (1992) in November 1993 there have been nine treaties in the evolutionary process of the EU.  The Amsterdam Treaty will be the tenth.  I refer to the proceedings at the Amsterdam Summit in regard to Ireland and Britain being able to opt into individual parts of the Schengen aquis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dutch Presidency's draft treaty provided that a decision to allow this would be taken by existing members by qualified majority vote.  During the meeting at Amsterdam, the Spanish Prime Minister, José Aznar, sought to change this to require unanimity for the decision.  He raised this and was asked by the chair to circulate an alternative <Col N="419" /> treaty wording.  No such wording was ever circulated at the meeting or agreed to by it. However, despite this, the language of the treaty was changed, along Spanish lines, in the draft circulated the following morning after the Summit was over.  This procedure is not legal or valid. Unless a new amended wording was circulated and agreed to at the Summit, one must presume that the existing draft wording as circulated remained unamended by the Summit.</P>
    <P>The nine treaties to date are the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty (Treaty of Paris 1951), which came into force in 1952 and concluded for 50 years the Schuman Plan among the then six member states; the European Economic Community (EEC) Treaty, (Treaty of Rome, 1957), which came into force in 1958 and gave the EEC a broad range of objectives, being therefore the most important Treaty; the European Automatic Energy Community (EURATOM) Treaty which was also signed in Rome in l957 and came into force in l958, having specific objectives of limited application; the Treaty establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities &mdash; the Merger Treaty, l965 &mdash; which came into effect in July l967 and amended the ECSC, EEC and Euratom Treaties to create a Council and Commission which served all three Communities; the Treaty amending certain budgetary provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities, and of the Merger Treaty &mdash; Treaty of Luxembourg, l970 &mdash; which came into effect in l971 and laid down a new procedure for settling the budget, introducing the system of &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;; the Treaty amending certain financial provisions of the Treaties establishing the European community, and of the Merger Treaty, l975, which came into effect in l978 and refined the budgetary procedure to give the European Parliament more power and to create the Court of Auditors; the Act concerning the election of members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage &mdash; European Elections Act, l976 &mdash; which came into force in l978 and was the basis for a directly elected European Parliament, commencing in l979; the Single European Act, l986, which came into force in July l987, and amended and expanded the EEC Treaty, most significantly by extending the scope of qualified majority voting, and laid down new foreign policy co-operation procedures; the Treaty on European Union &mdash; the Maastricht Treaty, l992 &mdash; which came into force in November, l993, establishing the European Union, amending and expanding the EEC Treaty, creating the co-decision procedure, introducing a new pillar structure into the union consisting of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, and co-operation in the fields of Justice and Home Affairs, JHA, the inter-governmental second and third pillars which complement the Community pillar; the draft Amsterdam Treaty of June, l997 which will be <Col N="420" /> signed in October next and shall come into force after the required ratification procedures.</P>
    <P>This tenth treaty falls into six broad sections: an area of freedom, security and justice; the Union and the citizen; an effective and coherent external policy; the Union's institutions; closer co-operation &mdash;&ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;&mdash; and simplification and consolidation of the Treaties.</P>
    <P>Given that the Taoiseach has set out most of the details there is no need for me to repeat them. The whole process of preparation and conclusion of the Amsterdam Treaty took almost two years from the setting up of the Reflection Group, on which I had the honour to be the Irish member, which had an intensive round of meetings between June and December l995 and which prepared the annotated agenda for the inter-governmental conference which commenced its work under the chairmanship of the Spanish EU Presidency, then the Italian Presidency, signally the Irish Presidency which brought about a draft treaty for the Dublin European Council meeting in December l996, and concluded under the Dutch Presidency on 16, 17 and 18 June, l997.</P>
    <P>Some may frown at the length of time it has taken to bring about the new Treaty, especially given its lack of ambition.  Having read the advice of Jean Monet quoted in my opening comments we might be thankful for the progress made to date.  The problem is we do not have a blank page on which to draft a constitution for Europe; we must do it stage by stage and bring the people with us at each stage.</P>
    <P>We might reflect also on how business was done in the first half of this century before the institutional arrangements which have produced the tenth treaty &mdash; an important step in European integration.  In the first half of this century 60 million Europeans lost their lives in two wars.  So far this century approximately 190 million people have lost their lives in wars and conflicts.  What is now the European Union, and its predecessors, has been a great source of peace and stability in Western Europe.  This peace and stability has given us the opportunity to enjoy unprecedented prosperity and material wealth across Western Europe.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty, building on nine other treaties, is helping to pave the way for a Union of 15 to become a Union of 25 or more member states.  The Union will spread from the west coast of Ireland to the Black Sea and from Finland in the north to, I predict, Malta in the south.  This will ensure the peace and stability we enjoy in Western Europe will continue because the whole continent of Europe will be at peace and stable. This will allow us to continue to enjoy the levels of prosperity we now enjoy and to share that prosperity with our nearest neighbours.  Furthermore, it will allow Europe as a continent to organise to keep its place in a global system which is becoming increasingly competitive.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the GNP of all 11 applicant states added together would equate to that of about one medium-sized existing EU state, i.e., <Col N="421" /> the Netherlands.  This indicates the challenge which faces the Union in the next stages of enlargement but these challenges must be met.</P>
    <P>Next week the European Commission will present its opinion on the state of preparedness of the applicant states and will at the same time give its view of the financial perspectives from l999 to 2004.  For the cohesion states and those states enjoying transfers of Structural Funds, as well as for the common policies and, in particular, the Common Agricultural Policy there will be challenges in the years ahead.  However, by the investment which has taken place here over the past almost quarter of a century since we joined the European Union, and by the transfers which will continue to flow to 2004, Ireland and other cohesion states, will be prepared for the challenge. We have been given the tools with which to do the job.  We must not be too defensive, not only will the stability of Europe continue to produce great opportunities and prosperity but an enlarged market will mean new outlets for member states, such as Ireland, for our products. We must not see the glass as half empty, we must see it as half full.  We have common purpose with our neighbours in the European Union and with our neighbours who wish to become members of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is good news for our children and grandchildren.  Never again should Europeans go out to kill each other in the name of &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo;.  No longer will the strongest army and strongest navy determine the course of European history.  The word &ldquo;nationalism&rdquo; comes from the word &ldquo;natio&rdquo; which means &ldquo;greater community&rdquo;.  As Irish men and women we are members of the Irish nation but also members of the European &ldquo;Greater Community&rdquo;. We should be proud to be Irish in Europe playing our part in bringing about agreed integration and institutional arrangements for the governance of a civilised, democratic and free Europe into the third millennium.  The Amsterdam Treaty is the tenth step, and an important one, on the road of European integration.</P>
    <P>On the issue of security and defence we need to ask ourselves two questions.  What do we want of Europe?  What role do we want for Ireland in the role we want for Europe?  It is time we stopped being reactive.  I note the Government will present a White Paper on defence.  Once and for all I hope we can have a civilised debate on the whole issue of defence and security where differing views can be offered so that we can see the principles on which our approach to this whole question are based.</P>
    <P>This State is now three quarters of a century old.  For the first half of the century we were outside the EEC, for the past quarter of a century we have been within what is now the European Union.  Far from taking from our sovereignty our membership of the Union has given us a new and important role.  If the founders of the State could have looked forward three quarters of a century to see us successfully conclude our fifth Presidency <Col N="422" /> of the Union while at the same time conducting the chairmanship of an inter-governmental conference on the future of the whole continent of Europe during the most critical stage of that conference they would have been very proud and we too should be proud.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union, EMU, will move to stage III on 1 January l999, with the locking of participating currencies.  The decision as to which countries will participate will be taken by a special European Council meeting in May l998 and will be on the basis of the most recent and reliable actual data for l997.  Convergence tests for member states wishing to join EMU include long-term interest rates, inflation rates, exchange rates and general Government deficits as well as gross State indebtedness.  The criterion for judging whether Government deficits are excessive is that they should not be more than 3 per cent of GDP, and the general Government gross debt should not be more than 60 per cent of GDP. However, deficits can exceed 3 per cent if &ldquo;the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to the reference value, or, alternatively, the excess over the reference value is only exceptional and temporary and the ratio remains close to the reference value&rdquo;.  The debt-GDP ratio can exceed 60 per cent &ldquo;if the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Interpretation of these provisions of EMU depends on a political judgment on how the Commission and the Council will choose to apply the provisions.  A strict interpretation might exclude most member states while a loose interpretation could include most.  Some of the larger member states whose ambition has been to advance the EMU project are encountering difficulties meeting the criteria &mdash; I refer specifically to France and Germany.  It is, therefore, understandable that these member states may not have been in a position to be as ambitious as they would have wished in relation to, for example, the extension of qualified majority voting and the question of Commission membership and weighted voting in Council.  However, it is clear from the Amsterdam Treaty that the question of Commission membership and weighted voting will be dealt with in advance of enlargement.  It is in Ireland's interest that these issues be considered together. Larger member states did try to change weighted voting procedures now and change Commission membership later.  We insisted that these issues are related and should be decided upon together, and would have been content to deal with these at Amsterdam.  However, our concerns are covered in the procedures adopted.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the Amsterdam Treaty, the EMU project and the preparations for enlargement and enlargement itself combine to make the next stage of European integration a significant step in European history.  It is a pity the Summit was not more ambitious, but we must now build on the foundations so far laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, let me offer you my congratulations and wish you every success in your position as Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Taoiseach for his remarks on the performance of the previous Government in the lead-in to the Amsterdam Treaty.  I too wish to thank Mr. Noel Dorr and Mr. Bobby McDonagh who took the burden of the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference, and Deputy Mitchell who was our representative on the Reflection Group.  I also thank the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and the officials from his Department for their co-operation and work, because it is important in the national interest that all ministries work together, particularly the Ministers and Secretaries Group.  Many meetings were held.  We had vital national interests to secure.  Four particular areas of concern were outlined, the institutional questions, the common foreign security policy issues, the strengthening of justice and home affairs and the addressing of the concerns of ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the Amsterdam Council was a success from our point of view.  It does seem a long time since the Spanish Presidency and since the launching of the Intergovernmental Conference in Turin, but it is the way Europe works.  As Deputy Mitchell said, we are not working off a blank sheet of paper.  We are where we are through ten treaties.  There will be more treaties, and in terms of issues of importance, there are very heavy issues on the agenda. One which I raised this morning with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business is the Commission's opinions which will start a whole new debate within the European Union.  Agenda 2000, will encompass many of the areas.  The Special Employment Summit during the Luxembourg Presidency will be of vital importance.  It is unacceptable that we have 18 million people unemployed in Europe, and we owe it to ourselves and to future generations to ensure that Europe is able to compete with the United States of America and with the ASEAN countries in particular.  We have lost out in recent years to these countries.  We have lost our edge in terms of the role of Europe and we have to readdress that.</P>
      <P>The proposed reforms of the common agricultural policy are topical.  These will bring considerable difficulties for Ireland, but we have to face up to them.  We will all have to work together in the negotiation that will take place once the President of the Commission has launched his proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of enlargement will be a fundamental one for the European Union for the next ten to 15 years.  The past few years have seen the enlargement of the Union with the addition of Finland, Austria and Sweden.  If anything, that was an easy negotiation, because it was beneficial to the Union.  They were coming to Europe to make a contribution.  This House welcomed Finland, Austria and Sweden.  They have, to some extent, shifted the dynamic of the debate within <Col N="424" /> the European Union, and I welcome that.  They are excellent Europeans and make a very positive contribution.  We have a great deal in common with them in terms of attitudes towards neutrality or towards common foreign security policy positions.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the opinions of the Commission. I am not sure what the procedure will be.  Obviously the Government will get them.  I hope they will be available to all of us because, as has been said by Deputy Mitchell, given the disparities between the developed European Union countries and the African countries in terms of GNP, in terms of level of development, the transition they will have to undergo to come effectively from communist systems into market economies will be a long one and will present the African countries with difficulties.  However, it will also be an enormous burden on the European Union.</P>
    <P>We have to look at other aspects of the applications and the enlargement countries in relation to the level of co-operation they are exercising among themselves.  It is very important that they would seek to build a union among the African countries while they are preparing themselves for membership of the European Union.  To some extent we are speaking in a vacuum; we have some of the information currently and we will have more after 16 July.  However, when the Dáil resumes for normal business on 30 September &mdash; it may well resume for other business in the meantime &mdash; we need to have a longer discussion. By then the new Government will have had the opportunity of looking at all the issues in the wake of the Amsterdam Summit.  I hope that by then we will have resolved the question mark over Schengen in relation to the Irish and UK positions, because it was our understanding that we would have the option to opt in.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Mitchell that there were no formal proposals accepted or agreed to in relation to the Spanish proposition.  That is something that will have to be sorted out in the coming weeks.  I would ask the Taoiseach to bear in mind that we should have a discussion soon after the Dáil resumes.  By that time we will have much more information on the Common Agricultural Policy proposals which will warrant debate within this country; likewise in relation to the preparations for the employment summit which, because of the 18 million unemployed, will be very important for all of us; and, of course, the debate on Structural and Cohesion funding which the Minister for Finance commented on in Brussels at his first meeting last Monday.  That will be an extremely difficult debate and negotiation for this country, not that there has ever been an easy negotiation &mdash; negotiations do not come easy in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation now where our income per capita has increased significantly to the extent where it is higher than that in the UK and that has a bearing on the response we get from our European colleagues.  All of these issues &mdash; EMU, <Col N="425" /> enlargement, justice and home affairs, employment, Structural and Cohesion funding and the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; will put a very heavy burden on the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other colleagues in relation to preparing for the negotiations.  It does warrant an early debate in the House, particularly enlargement.  Perhaps the committee on foreign affairs will be established by that time and it can look at it in more detail.  However, it behoves all sides of the House to work together to ensure that Ireland is well prepared for the next millennium in the context of Europe.  We are regarded as good Europeans and long may that last.</P>
    <P>On the Amsterdam Treaty, we have protected Ireland's interests and, at the same time, made a very significant contribution to its success.  The ambition was limited but, at this time for Europe, that was the correct approach.  Any more ambitious agenda by the bigger countries would not have proven successful or achievable in the context of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he has sought and received from the British Government full disclosure of all dumping of radioactive material, including dumping by the Ministry of Defence, in the Irish Sea; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14005/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply concerned about the recent revelations by the UK authorities that radioactive material was dumped in Beaufort Dyke during the 1950s.  The Beaufort Dyke dumpsite is on the Scottish side of the North Channel.</P>
      <P>The emergence of this information is particularly disturbing in view of the close co-operation which has developed in recent years between scientists and officials and at ministerial level on both sides of the Irish Sea in the appraisal and management of the Beaufort Dyke and mutual marine interests generally.  Its inconsistency with the assurances given previously by the UK side that no such dumping had taken place raises serious issues of credibility and public confidence in previous statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At my request last Monday I met the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Rt.  Hon. Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP.  This followed an exchange of letters between myself and Dr Cunningham. At this meeting we agreed certain action to address concerns on both sides of the Irish Sea.  A team under the direction of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will carry <Col N="426" /> out an intensive archival investigation as a matter of urgency.  Departments requested to supply material include Defence, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Scottish Office and Environment. Officials from the two Governments will liaise closely on the progress of these investigations. Minister Cunningham undertook to immediately make available to me any information arising from these searches.  Consideration will be given to additional monitoring and follow up action.</P>
    <P>I expressed my deep concern to the UK Minister regarding the dumping of radioactive materials in the Irish Sea.  While I welcomed the open approach of Dr Cunningham, I emphasised to him that the way in which the information emerged raised major questions about the credibility of previous public statements and information from the UK authorities about the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I regard close liaison and co-operation with the UK authorities as crucial to ensuring that all the facts are brought out into the open.  However, it is essential that we on this side of the Irish Sea are in a position to fully appraise the information which is currently available and any further information which might emerge.  In order that I have the best advice available, in consultation with my colleague the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, I am setting up a task force representative of experts in the fields of radioactivity and the marine environment generally.  This task force will advise me in my ongoing contacts with Dr. Cunningham as the archival search for any further dumping incidents unfolds.  It will provide the best professional assistance to me in determining the adequacy, comprehensiveness and implications for the marine environment, of the information on dumping now available and that which might emerge.  It will assess and recommend, in the light of all emerging information, what should be done &mdash; in other words, whether any further surveys are necessary of Beaufort Dyke dumpsite and any other sites which might emerge in the archival searches.  It will also advise me and my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, on whether and how existing monitoring of Irish Sea radioactivity might be extended or improved in the light of new information emerging.</P>
    <P>The task force will aim to provide the best advice to me on how to ensure the right questions are asked of the UK authorities so that we can satisfy ourselves that all relevant information is forthcoming and that appropriate and commensurate follow-up action is taken.  My aim is to ensure the public can be confident not only that the issue is receiving priority attention from me and my professional advisers, but also that the necessary steps are taken to protect and maintain the Irish Sea environment in the light of the dumping of this most insidious form of marine pollution and that no such dumping ever again takes place in the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have received copies of the UK records found to date.  These <Col N="427" /> are currently being examined by experts in the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. While the documents are rather scanty in detail, they show that small quantities of laboratory waste and luminous materials which fall within the definition of low or intermediate level radioactive waste were dumped in Beaufort Dyke in the 1950s.  I have been assured that further searches of archive records are being undertaken as a matter of urgency and that any documentation found will be made available to me.  I should also mention that at a recent meeting at which this matter was discussed Prime Minister Blair personally assured the Taoiseach the matter will be fully investigated.  Minister Cunningham assures me his Department carry out extensive monitoring for radioactivity throughout the Irish Sea, involving regular sampling of seawater, fish, shellfish, seaweed and sediments.  He is satisfied that this monitoring would be sensitive to any significant releases of radioactivity from Beaufort Dyke, none of which has ever been detected.</P>
    <P>I want to allay concerns about the possibility of future dumpings of radioactive materials.  The position is that Ireland and the UK are both parties to the International London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (1972).  In 1993 all contracting parties, with the exception of Russia, agreed to a permanent ban on marine nuclear dumping.  Prior to this there had been a moratorium on all such dumping in operation since 1982.  I have been given an absolute assurance by the Minister that nothing untoward has happened since that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister, Deputy Woods, every success in his new portfolio.  I am sure he will get the same co-operation from the officials that I was privileged to get during my time in the Department.</P>
      <P>In view of the disclosure of information that was hidden by successive British Ministers, does the Minister agree the least we should expect from the British Government is a full inquiry into why the information was concealed from another sovereign Government who has a keen interest in the safety of lives on both sides of the Irish Sea and on the possible damage to fish life?  Did the Minister ask his opposite number in the British Government why a full inquiry will not be carried out and that all documents should be made available? Does he agree that for far too long it was acceptable to dump all types of material in the sea, but that it is now up to us to ensure our strict legislative efforts are carried through by other members of the European Union, particularly by the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his good wishes on my appointment and, like the Deputy when he was Minister, I will be as co-operative as possible in respect of all matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> The question of an inquiry will arise if we do not get the necessary information.  The British Minister was open with my predecessor in respect of the dumping of munitions in Beaufort Dyke. This information was discovered by a member of the Minister's staff in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It was on public record.  It was not hidden, but nobody saw it because of the volume of information available.  Assurances were given that there was nothing to report.</P>
    <P>An inquiry is a matter for the UK Government in the first instance.  From our point of view the proper procedure is to get what information we can.  We will get it in a matter of weeks.  The Minister has a team of five people working on this. He has taken it quite seriously and is anxious to maintain the relationship he had with the previous Minister to get this information.  We will see where we stand at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked that all the documents and papers be made available and the British Minister has undertaken to make them available to us. More importantly, scientific personnel are available to us through the task force to analyse, examine and advise us on the documentation.  I will make that information public.  I want to get to the bottom of this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While I note the Minister's acceptance of the genuine approach being taken by the British Minister, it is a scandal that successive British Ministers prior to his arrival concealed this information, which is not unimportant to people living on this island, particularly to those engaged in the fishing industry.  It is also important because of the damage that could be caused from consumption of fish caught from the Irish Sea.  If a sovereign Government hides vital information from another Government we should ask for a full inquiry into why that happened.  Will the Minister give an assurance that all the necessary information will be made available to our scientists so that they, on our behalf, can confirm to people living on this island that there is no risk to human or fish life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that this is a particularly important issue.  When news of it broke on Monday I quickly become involved.  I have set a number of procedures in train.  The British Minister agreed to meet me at short notice because he was particularly disturbed about this issue.  I had discussions with scientists from the Marine Institute and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  I have gained a good deal of knowledge and information.  I want research information and all other relevant information compiled and simply documented.  I hope the task force will undertake that work.  I want to be assured and to give assurance that radioactive materials will not be dumped in the Irish Sea.  I made that clear to my counterpart in Britain and he was forthright and agreeable about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am responsible for regulating the dumping of <Col N="429" /> materials in the Irish Sea, marine life, the foreshore and our waters.  It is vital to communities on both sides of the Irish Sea this matter should be dealt with thoroughly now.  I want it dealt with scientifically and thoroughly.  I do not want terms like &ldquo;acceptable levels&rdquo; used; I want the issue put in its proper context and to see figures.  I made that clear to the British Minister.  There were aspects of the information we received that were incomplete and I want them delved into more deeply.  I can assure the Deputy that I want to get to the bottom of this issue.  I want all the information on the table.  If we proceed in this way at this time, we will do a service to communities on both sides of the Irish Sea.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to ensure the future of Waterford port.</Quest>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for the Marine, I have kept in close touch with developments in the examinership of Bell Lines. I hoped the examiner would succeed in securing new investors for the company.  I assisted Waterford Harbour Commissioners in their attempts to ensure the success of the examinership.  I gave my consent to the proposals contained in an interim agreement negotiated by the commissioners with the most recent proposed investor group.  I was extremely disappointed that, as a result of other factors beyond my or the port's control, the examinership did not succeed.  My deepest sympathies are for the employees of the Bell group and all who might be adversely affected.</P>
      <P>Bell Lines Shipping Company and four related companies were wound up by order of the High Court on Friday, 4 July 1997 and a liquidator was appointed.  It is a matter for the liquidator to realise the assets of the companies and, in the case of the Bell group, it is likely the assets will be sold, as going concerns.  The Bell Lines liquidator was appointed by the High Court and, in performing his function and using his powers, he is at all times subject to the supervision of the court.  While it is early days yet, I am confident the liquidator will be successful in securing the future of the core businesses of the Bell group, thus saving the maximum number of jobs possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately following the appointment of the liquidator, I assured Waterford Harbour Commissioners of the Government's full support in maintaining and developing their businesses into the future.  With a view to guaranteeing and securing the future of Waterford Port, I have put the following action plan in place.  I will make top level, marketing and business development expertise available to Waterford Harbour Commissioners to accelerate recovery.  I have ensured that repayments on European Investment Bank loans will be met without adversely affecting the financial position of Waterford Port.  My Department <Col N="430" /> and Waterford Harbour Commissioners will give every assistance to the liquidator to maintain the maximum number of jobs and level of business in the port area.</P>
    <P>Waterford Port has benefited from a substantial State supported investment programme of more than £35 million in the past six years, including substantial EU Structural and Cohesion Funds aid, and this investment must be protected as a basis for future growth and development. Waterford Port has a strong state of the art infrastructure and a proud tradition in the provision of portal and shipping services.  Belview Terminal is one of the most modern container ports in Ireland and can provide national and international carriers with direct and cost efficient access to the UK and continental Europe. Already, Waterford Harbour Commissioners are looking for alternative carriers to operate out of Waterford Port and have already received queries from some carriers as to availability of facilities. In the meantime, shipments are going in and out of the port.</P>
    <P>I will work directly with the commissioners to secure the future of the port as a major strategic port.  I intend to review with port management on a regular basis over the next few weeks the strategic options open to them.  In this connection I will visit the port in the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the negotiations between the examiner and potential investors collapse? Can the Minister reassure the staff of Bell Lines, many of whom have worked there for a number of years and are now in receipt of unemployment benefit with no possibility of redundancy money?</P>
      <P>The port of Waterford deals with approximately 40 per cent of lo-lo container traffic, which is of vital importance to the economy.  What steps are being taken to ensure the port remains available to exporters and importers?  Can the Minister ensure that we do not make the mistake made in the past where one operator had total control of the operation of the Belview terminal? It is always a dangerous exercise in business to depend on one group.  This group tied up Waterford port because of agreements which could have been difficult to extract themselves from.</P>
      <P>I want an assurance from the Minister that the port will function as normal, that every effort will be made to attract new carriers and that every step will be taken to ensure that those who worked for Bell Lines in Waterford port will obtain employment from the new operators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of staff, Bell Lines is a commercial operation and is not under my control.  I am concerned about the position of the staff and if I can do anything to assist them, I will. Deputy Barrett mentioned that the redundancy position is bad.  There is statutory redundancy.  In the package available prior to this one, there was a reasonable provision for redundancy, both from <Col N="431" /> the company and the State.  This is no longer available due to the collapse of the examinership and staff are relying solely on statutory redundancy, which I regret.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett also asked why prospective investors pulled out.  A group of investors led by the Irish Continental Group withdrew from discussions on 3 June last.  They were concerned about matters relating to the Bell Group's Irish and British pension schemes, severance arrangements for senior executives living outside Ireland and the UK and the threat of legal action by Waterford Harbour Commissioners.  A second potential group of investors, comprising IAWS, ACT and Imari was then located by the examiner. Imari pulled out of the rescue deal on 2 July because it believed sufficient information was not available to make a hard factual analysis of which parts of the Bell Group were profitable.  There were serious concerns about the viability of the Bell Group, especially its European dimension. Tragically, the group went into liquidation on 4 July.</P>
      <P>On the question of Bell Lines being the sole operator in Waterford port, it was more a case of one operator having a high level of priority. Technically, the group was not the only operator but in practice what Deputy Barrett said is correct. There will be different arrangements now.  I accept the Deputy's point, which is important and should be borne in mind in future developments to maximise the port's facilities.</P>
      <P>I will take every step possible to establish the best package for the port to enable it to return to operation as early as possible.  The straw that broke the camel's back was storm damage to one of two new cranes which cost £7 million.  The damage to the crane was unusual and unfortunately took a long time to repair.  One of the cranes is back in operation, together with a small crane.  The carriers have been helpful to Waterford Harbour Commissioners in allowing the port to proceed and return to business.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I regard this crisis as a major tragedy.  Waterford is a vital regional port and I will do everything I can to get it back into operation as quickly as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he will take to achieve the commitment in the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats programme for Government to seek the banning of flags of convenience fishing vessels from Irish waters.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met the fishing industry representatives last week, I confirmed my commitment to finding workable solutions to the flagship problem and in particular to mounting, through rigorous enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of all fishing vessels, irrespective of nationality, in our waters.</P>
      <P>I intend to pursue the flagship issue from three key strategic perspectives.  The first is to ensure that the activities of flagships fishing in our waters are rigorously controlled and monitored at sea and on land.  The second is to press, with the support of the commission, other member states concerned to play their part in properly controlling and monitoring the activities and landings of flagships. The third is to work with the commission and likeminded member states in order to ensure the necessary link between the economic benefits of national fish quotas and the coastal communities concerned.</P>
      <P>As the coastal State most directly concerned, we are committed to delivering effective enforcement in order to protect fish stocks in our waters from illegal fishing activity.  The Government is committed to strengthening the Irish fisheries protection services.  Efficient and effective deployment of our existing protection resources, together with enhancing and expanding those resources with EU assistance, is the key priority in tackling illegal fishing activity in these waters, irrespective of nationality.</P>
      <P>There are particular enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships.  Other member states have legal responsibilities in this regard and I intend to push hard at European level for better practical co-operation between member states on fisheries control and enforcement. Most of the 150 flagships operating in Irish waters are UK registered, so I will be seeking to build on the existing co-operation arrangements with the UK authorities.  I will also be pressing the Spanish authorities to improve significantly the policing of landings by flagships into their ports.  I will also be pressing the Commission to bring forward new tougher measures of enforcement to ensure that fishermen landing their catch abroad cannot escape controls.  I will be meeting my UK and Spanish colleagues, as well as Commissioner Bonino, at the earliest opportunity in order to pursue this agenda.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the principle that there should be a demonstrable link between a fishing vessel and the member state in which it is registered, in order to ensure that the economic benefits of national quotas accrue to the fisheriesdependent communities concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary problems in Irish waters derive from flagship vessels registered under the UK flag.  I will be pressing my UK colleagues to clarify their intentions in relation to enhancing the economic link between UK registered vessels and quotas.  Progress on their part would greatly assist our own enforcement and control priorities.  For my part, I will also be examining the possibilities, <Col N="433" /> within existing EU treaty frameworks, of strengthening the economic link for vessels operating under the Irish flag.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the economic link issue is a complex one which must have regard for general treaty provisions on right of establishment and freedom of movement as well as the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Commission's recent clarification of the legal parameters of economic linkage is a helpful development and is being thoroughly analysed and assessed from the Irish perspective.</P>
    <P>Tangible progress on this threefold strategy is the key to delivering workable solutions on flagships and their fishing activities.  I will be pushing to keep up the momentum both at EU level and with other member states to deliver on these strategies in the interests of the Irish fishing sector and to secure the viability of fish stocks in our own waters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but he has not answered my question.  In the programme for Government he said he would seek the banning of flags of convenience fishing vessels from Irish waters, but his reply has nothing to do with banning such ships.  In other words, the Minister is already backtracking on the commitment given in the programme for Government.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that everything he has told the House is precisely what I was doing when I was Minister for the Marine?  When his party was in Opposition, however, it gave a clear commitment, with the support of one particular fishermen's organisation, to seek the banning of flags of convenience fishing vessels from Irish waters. That is what the Minister told the electorate before the election but how will he ban such ships?  What steps is he taking to achieve such a ban?  I am well aware of all the controls and other measures that have been taken but how will the Minister proceed to ban flagships from Irish waters, which was the commitment given to the electorate prior to the last election in the programme for Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the first steps for the Deputy.  I have said what we are doing and how we plan to proceed.  In the first instance we want to ban the illegal activities of these flagships in our waters.  We also want to tie in the flagships to create economic links with the fishing communities, and we want to have tight control of those vessels when they come back into port.  We will go as far as we can in seeking to ban the kind of activity they are involved in and I intend to pursue that objective vigorously.</P>
      <P>I have already raised the matter with the British Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, since so many of these vessels are registered as British flagships.  We will go as far as we can to curb and, if possible, ban their activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister, everything he has just said is precisely what I was doing in the course of my term in office.  Is the Minister living up to the commitment he gave to Irish fishermen in the programme for Government to ban such flagships from our waters? Nothing the Minister has said convinces me that he is able to live up to that promise, which people bought prior to the election.  We were criticised for precisely the same things the Minister now says he will do.  All those things are in place.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the British Government has done nothing other than make noises about these flagships, which are entirely under its own control?  The British Government has not assisted in the surveillance of British flag vessels fishing in Irish waters.  It should have been doing so for the last few years as I requested of it on a number of occasions.  The Minister says he is seeking co-operation from the British Government but he will want to obtain greater co-operation than has been evident to date.  It is the British Government's responsibility.  These vessels are fishing from British quotas, yet the British authorities have done nothing about it.  What precise steps is the Minister taking to ban such flagships from Irish waters?  I do not want to know about the controls or the economic links because I am well aware of them.  I have already outlined all those things myself.  How will the Minister live up to his commitment to ban flagships from Irish waters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of what the British Government is doing.  As I said, I have already met with the British authorities in this connection and they assured me they are anxious to co-operate in this area.  The British Government has already secured clarification, by way of an exchange of letters on the margins of the Intergovernmental Conference, which indicated possible parameters for the imposition of economic linkage principles within the bounds of Community law.  This is something that may have been available in any event and we are proceeding on the grounds that we can do that anyway.</P>
      <P>It is now a matter for the UK authorities to bring forward proposals as to how they intend to implement the economic linkage requirement for these vessels on their register.  That is one of the matters we want to discuss with the British and Spanish authorities.</P>
      <P>On foot of the Intergovernmental Conference clarification an action was taken by a member state, which must be seen against the last attempt by the UK Government to remove flag vessels from the fishing register.  When the UK removed licences from such flag vessels the action was successfully challenged in the European Court by the vessels' owners and that matter is still ongoing.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have taken action.  We have stated in our policy document that we will seek to ban these flagships and we will certainly do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for Government, <i>An Action Programme for the Millennium</i>, stresses the strategic importance of our shipping industry and the necessary infrastructure to handle ever increasing volumes of tourism and trade, and recognises that the sector must be underpinned by continued investment and the maintenance of competitiveness.  The programme identifies as key priorities the development of comprehensive and strategic policies for both the shipping industry and for commercial harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While major progress has been made in recent years in investment in ports and in shipping services and the development of new corporate structures for the commercial ports, we must begin to analyse and plan for the future, especially in the context of the requirements for capital expenditure in the post 1999 Structural Funds situation.  With this in mind, I will commence shortly a comprehensive assessment of Irish commercial seaport capacity.  This will be funded under the technical assistance programme &mdash; TAP &mdash; of the 1994-9 operational programme <Col N="436" /> of transport &mdash; OPT &mdash; and will provide a firm foundation for future portal policy.</P>
    <P>Alongside this initiative, I will consult widely with other policy making agencies and Departments, as well as service providers, such as ports, shipping lines, etc., and major customers, such as importers and exporters, and business and professional organisations.  The purpose of this process will be to identify the needs for the future and if there are bottlenecks or constraints which will require the State to intervene by way of investment or other support in the best interests of the growth of trade, tourism and the wider economy.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it would be pointless to speculate on what the funding requirements may be.  This will depend on the outcome of the analysis and the process.  When it comes to the point, probably during the second half of 1998 when issues of funding post 1999 fall for consideration, the needs of the maritime transport sector, including shipping and commercial harbours, will have been fully articulated.  In the meantime, progress will be maintained in developing corporate plans for both the individual commercial seaports and for the commercial portal sector as a whole, taking account of all the issues affecting maritime transport and recognising that maritime transport policy must be developed in an integrated manner with the other links in the transport chain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the mid-term review of Structural Funds is taking place at present?  He said it would be premature to consider additional funding until mid 1998.  However, does he not agree it will be too late at that stage because the mid-term review will be completed and funds will be allocated in other areas to the detriment of commercial ports and major fishery harbours?  Is he making efforts to ensure additional funding will be made available in the mid-term review so that his proposals can be implemented as soon as they are presented?  Will the Minister concentrate his efforts on some of the major commercial ports to the exclusion of others or will he treat all commercial ports equally?  Does his policy include the development of commercial and fishery harbours?  I presume commercial harbours, which are mentioned in the programme for Government, include commercial fishery harbours such as Killybegs, Castletownbere, Rossaveel, Dunmore East and other major fishery centres?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Any number of requests are made each year for extensions to the commercial and the rod angling seasons for salmon fishing at various locations.  Extensions have not been granted to the drift net salmon season since 1978.  Based on the scientific advice available to me on the poor state of salmon stocks generally, and interim reports from the Marine Institute on fishing activity during the commercial salmon season to date this year, I do not consider there is a case for granting extensions to the current drift net season beyond 31 July.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware the new salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season contain gains as well as losses for both the commercial and recreational salmon sector including, as part of the overall package, the legalisation of monofilament nets which had long been sought by the drift net fishermen.  In addition, commercial salmon fishermen have been permitted to continue fishing to 31 July in those areas where fishing in previous years finished on 25 July.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Department, the Marine Institute and the central and regional fisheries boards to provide me with the earliest possible analysis, as soon as the season is over, of the impact and effectiveness of this year's salmon conservation measures with a view to deciding whether any additional or modified measures should be introduced for 1998.  I also look forward to hearing at first hand the views of the representative user groups, both commercial and angling, on salmon management strategies that can best deliver results in the interest of the resource and of all those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation.  I have also asked the Marine Institute to expedite its work on proposals for the introduction of a TAC, quota and tagging regime for salmon which, as Deputies will be aware, was recommended by the Salmon Task Force as an essential prerequisite for any future consideration of extensions into August of the commercial salmon season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that 1997 is exceptional when compared to other years as regard drift-netting for salmon in that fishing has been severely curtailed this year?  The months of <Col N="438" /> April and May have been eliminated.  Prior to that March was eliminated.  Therefore, drift-net salmon fishermen can only operate in the months of June and July.  Is the Minister aware of that?</P>
      <P>Is he aware that the weather in June was the worst on record?  It was the wettest, coldest and windiest June on record.  In effect, drift-net salmon fishermen have been unable to fish during most of the month of June and their fishing has been confined to July.  As that is the case, will the Minister make a case to have the fishing season extended to 15 August?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the weather has not been suitable but, according to scientific information, it is not the weather but the stocks which are causing the problem, especially given the use of monofilament nets and new methods of fishing which were approved this year.</P>
      <P>The new conservation regulations, which were introduced for 1997, complete the first phase of the implementation of the recommendations of the task force report.  The primary aim of these measures was to restrict salmon exploitation to allow a greater number of fish escape up river to spawn and contain compensatory gains as well as losses for the various sectors in the interests of optimising the resource.</P>
      <P>The regulations affecting the main commercial sectors relating to drift-net fishing were a reduction in the proscribed maximum number of licences, the reduction in the sea area in which salmon fishing is allowed from 12 to six nautical miles from the base lines, the deferral of the opening day to 1 June, the introduction of day only fishing between the hours of 4 a.m. to 9 p.m., the extension of the weekend close period to three days, that is, Friday to Sunday, inclusive, the use of the monofilament netting legalised in the drift-net fishery, which was very important in terms of catches, and increases in the maximum depth of mesh permitted from 30 to 45 meshes. This was part of the plan introduced for this year and it is part of the report of the salmon management task force which was established in 1995.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that it is believed that the problem is one of stocks rather than weather.  I have no objection to listening to people, but I do not want to go against all that has been developed by the scientific people and others who are attempting to improve the stocks.  The Deputy will know that, in relation to other countries, Ireland would be quite different in allowing drift-net salmon fishing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the net result this year as far as of the introduction of regulation is concerned &mdash; they confined them to four days fishing per week, and weather conditions, which, as the Minister will probably be aware, can be too calm as well as being too rough for drift-net fishing &mdash; is that it will be the shortest season on record for drift-net fishermen? I am sure the Minister and his officials are monitoring the catches to date.  It is not that the salmon <Col N="439" /> are not there but that the fishermen are not able to catch them.  The catches being landed are the smallest on record for this time of the year. In view of that, will the Minister monitor the situation between now and the end of this month and, if there is no significant improvement, will he look at the feasibility of extending the season for a fortnight, as requested by Deputy Deasy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will monitor the situation and, as I said to Deputy Deasy, I will listen to the points made, but I have great fears for the stocks.  That is what the report, which was commissioned and implemented by my predecessor last year, is based on and I do not want to depart from it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister give an assurance that he will also monitor the situation in the Foyle fishery area?  We all recognise the need for conservation but, at the same time, the season is quite short there.  The licence fee there is twice that in other areas and fishermen want the best value from their licences.  If a sufficient number of salmon have passed above Sion Mill's Weir and it is viable in the context of the conservation measures, I ask the Minister to apply pressure to extend the season?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already replied comprehensively to these questions in my earlier reply to Deputy Barrett.  I would, again, express my deep concern about the recent revelations of dumping of radioactive material at Beaufort's Dyke during the 1950s.  My concern in this regard has been expressed to the UK Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Rt.  Hon.  Dr. Jack Cunningham, MP, at our meeting on Monday last and <Col N="440" /> I assure the House that I will do my utmost to ensure that the action agreed upon at that meeting will be followed through.</P>
    <P>Minister Cunningham has indicated to me that every co-operation will be afforded me and my officials in this matter.  He has also assured me that his Department carry out extensive monitoring for radioactivity throughout the Irish Sea, involving regular sampling of sea water, fish, shellfish, seaweed and sediments.  He is satisfied that this monitoring would be sensitive to any significant releases of radioactivity from Beaufort's Dyke, none of which have ever been detected.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in my earlier reply, I will also be setting up a task force in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  This task force will be representative of experts in the fields of radioactivity and the marine environment generally, and will have the aims of providing the best advice to me on how to ensure that the right questions are asked of the UK Authorities, that we can satisfy ourselves that all relevant information is forthcoming and that fully appropriate and commensurate follow-up action is taken.  My aim is that the public can have a level of confidence that the issue is getting priority attention, the necessary steps will be taken to protect and maintain the Irish Sea environment in the light of the dumping of this most insidious form of marine pollution, and no such dumping ever takes place in the Irish Sea again.</P>
    <P>I, again, avail of this opportunity also to allay any concerns about the possibility of future dumping of radioactive materials.  The position is that Ireland and the UK are both parties to the 1972 International London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter.  In 1993, all contracting parties, with the exception of Russia, agreed to a permanent ban on marine nuclear dumping.  Prior to this there had been a moratorium on all such dumping in operation since 1982.  I have been given an absolute assurance by Minister Cunningham that nothing untoward has happened since that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we all know radioactive material has a certain lifespan, has the Minister's English counterpart informed him of the lifespan of the radioactive material dumped by the British authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Some elements of radioactive material have a long lifespan, the ascertainment of which is the objective of the taskforce and the procurement of the information the Radiological Institute is at present obtaining for me.  Those were the kinds of essential questions I put to my British counterpart, but even without that information it is necessary to know what has been dumped and where not only in Beaufort Dyke but in any other locations in the region, in addition to the levels recorded in those areas. <Col N="441" /> That monitoring will ascertain just what is taking place or has taken place there.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is the danger that some element may be disturbed at some time and there could be a higher discharge of dangerous substances. Constant vigilance must be maintained from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right, but that is the kind of detail I want to obtain and have quantified, which is the reason I want the report of this taskforce to contain all of that information, enabling us to place it on the table of the House and all Members to see precisely where we stand. Above all other matters this is one in respect of which we want all cards openly laid on the table. We need to establish precisely what occurred in the past and to protect people for the future through constant monitoring and close surveillance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Comhghairdeas leat ar do phost nua.  Before posing two questions to the Minister I would hazard a guess that some of that radioactive material might have a lifespan of between 200,000 and 250,000 years, probably beyond our comprehension, not to mention &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or indeed that of any particular Government.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the prospect of the recovery of any such material should figure highly on any agenda because if the Beaufort Dyke was also used for the dumping of munitions &mdash; some of which can be quite volatile &mdash; it is important to pursue it.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister include in the remit for dealing with this issue of dumping of nuclear waste the issue of shipments of nuclear waste and nuclear submarines in the Irish Sea particularly given its contained nature?  Since prevention is better than cure, will the Minister take account of inherent dangers in the shipments of nuclear waste?  In the event of an accident, very often such ships become nuclear waste dumped, by accident or design, in our waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>My responsibility in this area is twofold.  First I have clear statutory responsibility for dumping, which is why I became involved in this issue immediately on appointment.  The Deputy's question on shipments would probably be more proper to another Department.</P>
      <P>Since my second responsibility is for marine life, I will be very concerned to monitor and know precisely what is and has happened.  While the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be responsible for Sellafield and any discharges from that plant, I am responsible for the ocean floor, the foreshore and other aspects, leading to an obvious need for co-operation between both Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> On the matter of dumping of radioactive waste at sea, mine is the leading Department but the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will co-operate with me, requesting the co-operation of the Radiological Institute with us, all of which is in train.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter of recovery of radioactive waste with my British counterpart.  The difficulty is that the amount discovered so far has been so small and nobody is sure of its location, Beaufort Dyke being very long, broad and deep.  Consequently, one could do more damage attempting to locate it than not, a difficulty of which my British counterpart is very conscious.  We would also need to ascertain the feasibility of recovery from any information obtained in the course of searches which might also indicate the locations of any other dumping sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>While most recent attention in regard to radioactive waste has focused on the Beaufort Dyke area &mdash; particularly between Northern Ireland and Scotland &mdash; no doubt the Minister is aware, as it has already been admitted by the United Kingdom authorities, that there has been extensive dumping approximately 70 miles north west of Tory Island in my constituency, discussed here already by the Minister's predecessor and me as early as l987.  However, the new twist in the story is that radioactive material has been dumped by the British authorities in the Beaufort Dyke and other areas.  Can the Minister ascertain whether there has been any radioactive waste dumped north west of Tory Island because there were some indications of munitions and different poisonous gases having been dumped there in concrete drums?  Will the Minister request the British authorities to provide an index of locations of dumpings of these radioactive materials, with particular reference to north-west Donegal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <Quest>when the results of the inquiry into the sinking of the fishing vessel, Jenalisa, off Dunmore East, County Waterford, will be released; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was decided to raise the wreck of the fishing vessel, <i>Jenalisa,</i> which sank on 4 February 1996 to progress the investigation into its sinking.  As well as carrying out a number of tests and experiments, the marine survey office of my Department recently completed a stability assessment of the vessel to establish how the accident happened.  A report of the investigation is being finalised and will be made available in due course, subject to normal legal considerations.  I am very disappointed and upset about the extent of the delay, which has been brought to my attention. I appreciate that uncertainty about what happened their loved ones adds very much to the trauma of loss for families.  I intend to bring forward the report as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Three fishermen were drowned in this incident and their families are particularly concerned that no report has issued as a result of the inquiry by the Department.  I would greatly appreciate if the Minister would give a timescale of when he expects the report will be issued.  In the meantime he should request a senior official of his Department to liaise with the families concerned to let them know what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly do that.  I greatly appreciate the sense of loss, bereavement and trauma for the families involved, particularly in the two cases where the bodies were not recovered. I will arrange for an official to speak with the families and let them know the position.  It is expected the report will be available in September. Among the reasons for the delay in this case is that one of the principal officers who carried out the initial investigation left the Department and took up work elsewhere.  There was considerable difficulty in trying to establish what happened, but I accept the delay should not have been so great.  When the report is available the Attorney General will have to advise on what can be legally published.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Obviously this incident took place prior to his taking office.  On 9 April I spoke to officials in the Department of the Marine and was told the stability evaluation would be completed within a month.  The Minister said it is now completed.  I understood that as soon as that was ready a report would be sent to the Minister, which would <Col N="444" /> then have to go to the Attorney General before publication.  The Minister has indicated the report will not be ready until September.  Why is there a delay in publishing the report?  Given that it has to go to the Attorney General, it looks as if it will be 1998 before it will be published.  Will the Minister give an assurance that it will be published later this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as I can, I will certainly give such an undertaking.  I will pursue the matter and try to have the report published by September. Staff difficulties arose in this case and the chief official dealing with the survey left, creating further difficulties.  I understand the seriousness of the tragedy and I will try to have the report published as quickly as possible.  I thank Deputies for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern about the status of such reports?  Will he give an update on the group currently considering inquiries into fishing vessel disasters so that, leaving aside the length of time it takes to compile such reports, there can be no doubt about whether those reports can be published once completed?  There have been ongoing difficulties regarding publication of reports and raising of expectations, as well as legal difficulties about whether reports can be published.  Has the Minister information on how the group is progressing in terms of drawing up future reports and who should be responsible?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The investigation of marine accidents policy review group, established in November 1996 by the then Minister, Deputy Barrett, to review existing policy procedures and the legislative framework for maritime casualty investigations in Ireland, is chaired by Mr. Vincent Power and includes representatives of the Department of the Marine as well as other people with relevant knowledge and experience.  This very important group considers issues such as the duty to report accidents, the purpose of the investigation, the categories of accidents and appropriate levels of investigation, the information to be established, the guidelines for surveyors, the follow-up action, the publication of reports, the question of dealing with bereaved families and the follow through in the case of bereavement, which is particularly important.  From my dealings with health and social welfare, I am very familiar with the importance of that aspect.</P>
      <P>The report will also deal with the media, the industry and political representatives as well as the role of the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office, jurisdiction liaison with flag states and the need for new legislation. It is expected the group will report by end September and that the report, which will be very important and relevant, will be published in October.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 18 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I have already dealt in detail with these issues in the context of my reply to priority questions. In summary the position is as follows: Bell Lines Shipping Company and four related companies were wound up by order of the High Court on Friday, 4 July 1997 and a liquidator was appointed.  It is a matter for the liquidator to realise the assets of the companies and, in the case of the Bell group, it is likely that the assets will be sold, as going concerns.  I am confident the liquidator will be successful in securing the future of the core businesses of the Bell group, thus saving the maximum number of jobs possible.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the appointment of the liquidator, I assured Waterford Harbour Commissioners of the Government's full support in maintaining and developing their businesses into the future.  With a view to guaranteeing and securing the future of Waterford port, I have put the following action plan into place: I am making top level, marketing and business development expertise available to Waterford Harbour Commissioners to accelerate recovery; I have ensured that repayments on European Investment Bank loans will be met without adversely affecting the financial position of Waterford port; my Department and Waterford Harbour Commissioners will give every assistance to the liquidator to maintain the maximum number of jobs and level of business in the port area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Belview Terminal is one of the most modern container ports in Ireland and can provide national and international carriers with direct and cost-efficient access to the UK and continental <Col N="446" /> Europe.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners are looking for alternative carriers to operate out of Waterford port and have already received queries from some carriers as to availability of facilities. I will work directly with the commissioners to secure the future of the port as a major strategic port.  In that connection I will visit the port in the next few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave comprehensive replies to the questions tabled by Deputy Barrett and myself and on the Adjournment last evening. Will he make a point of meeting the workers employed by Bell Lines when he visits Waterford in the coming days?  These people feel extremely hard done by, believe the company collapsed through no fault of theirs and are of the opinion that there was poor communication between themselves and management during the crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts in respect of Bell Lines, particularly the statement he issued on Friday last regarding future development of the port.  However, I am concerned about the major State investment already in place.  What steps will be taken to ensure that the finance invested by the Government in Waterford port will be protected?  Disturbing revelations were made to me by the workers at Bell Lines and I agree with Deputy Deasy that it was through no fault of theirs that the company went under.  I am concerned if the port progresses in a certain way in the future because we do not know who will assume responsibility for the various aspects of the Bell Lines operation.  It has been suggested that if we are not careful the same scenario could recur in two to three years.  In view of the major State investment already in place, I seek an assurance that the Government will take steps to ensure it is protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be quite happy to meet with the workers but, as stated earlier, I am not the Minister responsible for dealing with their concerns.  However, I will be happy to meet with them to hear their views and communicate them to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I will do everything possible to facilitate their position.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Kenneally stated, State investment in the port is a major concern.  There has been some improvement in the situation given that Waterford Harbour Commissioners have increased flexibility in dealing with the Bellview terminal.  A clause was built into the original contract which gave Bell Lines a high degree of priority as the initiators of the project.  However, the contract has lapsed and the harbour commissioners will now have more flexibility in that regard.  I take Deputy Kenneally's points and I will pursue the matter further.  I already raised this issue, about which I am concerned, and I undertake to raise it with the Waterford Harbour Commissioners in the coming days.</P>

      <P>The Committee of Selection reports that it has nominated the following Members to serve on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges: Deputies Theresa Ahearn, Seán Barrett, Michael Bell, Séamus Brennan (<i>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</i>), John Browne (<i>Carlow-Kilkenny</i>), Ivor Callely, Donal Carey, Charles Flanagan, Tony Gregory, Jim Higgins, Brendan Howlin, Cecilia Keaveney, Tony Killeen, Brian Lenihan, Desmond J. O'Malley, Dick Roche and Brendan Smith.</P>
      <P>I want to give an undertaking to Democratic Left, the Green Party and others in the House that the Independent position on this committee is being filled by Deputy Gregory merely to enable it to commence its work.  As soon as procedures are agreed to receive a nominee from those groups and the Independents, the position will be filled in that way.</P>

      <P>It was agreed on the Order of Business that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be appointed.  However, there was no agreement with regard to when that motion would be taken by the House.  For some reason best known to himself, the Government Chief Whip chose to arbitrarily select and appoint an Independent Member of the House when parties with two and four Members, respectively, were not consulted about this matter.  I do not wish to delay the important work of this committee but I am at a loss to understand the arbitrary selection that has been promoted by the Government Chief Whip.  If I understand his remarks correctly, <Col N="448" /> the Government Chief Whip also stated that this arrangement will be reconsidered.  However, if I am not to call a vote on this matter I must ask him when it will be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Arising from the meeting of the Committee of Selection, am I to understand that it will be reconsidered when and if this House, in accordance with this morning's decision, is reconvened to consider the McCracken report?  Will negotiations about the groups arrangement be done in the interim?  With the utmost respect to the House, I must indicate that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brennan, will be surprised at the extent to which my party will be able to not facilitate the speedy work of the House.</P>

      <P>I will endeavour to satisfy the Deputy's requirement as soon as the House meets again, if that proves practical, and ensure that that nomination is properly received from the Independent groups.  The Deputy is aware that substantial negotiations must take place regarding the mechanism by which we receive a nominee of the Independent groups.  I understand that substantial discussions must take place about the number of technical groups that may be available and other related matters.  It is a simple choice: we either proceed with the work of the committee by this mechanism or we postpone its deliberations until the autumn.  I have chosen to do the former and I give the Deputy my undertaking and that of Deputy Gregory that his involvement is merely a technical measure to enable the committee begin its work.  A proper procedure to fill that Independent position will be put in place as soon as is practical, possibly on the next occasion on which the Dáil meets.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification on a number of points.  One way or the other, this House will reconvene on 30 September.  In order to reassure everyone in the House that business is being done properly, would it not be better that the appointment of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges be time limited up to that date and that we would appoint a new committee at that point?  It appears that it would be virtually impossible for the House to insist on Deputy Gregory stepping down from that committee unless there is a written guarantee to this effect by him or unless the House decides that he should do so, that is, that the appointment is time limited.  As matters stand, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is being appointed for the duration of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State referred to Independent Members of the House.  I am not an Independent Member but a member of a political party.  The formation of this committee is very important.  It deals with Members' rights and privileges. I am anxious to have my rights represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> I understand that Standing Orders require that the committee is required to be appointed so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.  It cannot be impartially representative of the Dáil if one of the parties is not represented.  I also understand that on the last occasion a party represented in this House comprised of four Members it was represented on the committee. Will the Minister of State indicate how I, as a member of a party, may be represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, given its wide remit and its importance for the rights and privileges of Members?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if we can debate the committee structures here because, given the make up of the Dáil, substantial negotiations must take place on all of the committees and how they are to be filled.  As of now, I have received no notification of a technical group of seven Members, although I have an indication of a proposal from Deputy Rabbitte to amend the Standing Orders and make six the minimum membership of such a group.</P>
      <P>There is nothing untoward here.  A consultant's report has been ordered from Professor Lever which is due imminently.  Given the request of Deputy John Bruton that some work be done in committee I considered it important that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges receive that report this month or next and study it over the recess so that when the Dáil resumes it would be in a position to advise on how we might structure the rest of the committees.  If we do not do this it could be well into Christmas before the committees are properly established.</P>
      <P>That is the only reason for the haste here. There is no other agenda.  Deputy Gregory indicated to the Committee of Selection this morning that his involvement in this is purely technical. He understands that he will vacate the position in order to seek a nominee from whatever groups are enabled to make one when the shape of the technical groups, etc., becomes apparent.  That does not mean he will not be available to be renominated, but he has indicated to the Committee of Selection that he intends to proceed in this way.  I take his word for that and I recommend that the report by the Committee of Selection be adopted.  I understand it is for the information of the House.</P>

      <P>This is not about Deputy Gregory, nor about whether one accepts his word or not; there is no question of not accepting it. That is not the issue.  When the Minister of State says there is nothing untoward here there may have been nothing untoward intended.  However, the Committee of Selection was established this morning without any consultation with my party or the Green Party.  That committee has a major influence on the selection of virtually all of the <Col N="450" /> committees of this House.  It was a major decision, yet two parties in the House were not even consulted.  By contrast, the Chief Whip arbitrarily decided to approach an Independent Deputy and appoint him.  I do not suggest that this was intended.  It is 25 years since the Minister of State first pulled a stroke like that on me and I am sure he would not do it now.  However, that is its effect.</P>
      <P>It is important that this be put right because the Committee of Selection will have a major influence on the network of committees formed by this House.  As it stands at present, two parties, the Green Party and my party, were not consulted about this move.  It should not have been done this way because it should have been fairly representative of the groups and parties in the House.  As it stands, it is not.</P>

      <P>It is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges we are discussing.  It has a very important role with regard to the House, the operation of the House and the work of Deputies.  The Ceann Comhairle is automatically its chairperson.  It is not, therefore, an ordinary committee.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that for the next three months at least, a committee will operate which will have excluded two parties, Democratic Left and the Green Party, apparently at the whim of the Chief Whip who has decided to request Deputy Gregory to sit on the committee.</P>
      <P>Suppose Deputy Gregory intends to comply with his offer to act on a technical basis in a temporary way but that other negotiations do not proceed as the Government wishes, what mechanism is there for the Chief Whip or the Government to disband the committee having established it, given that it is a committee established by the House?  It will not be possible to ask any Member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, or of any committee of the House, to stand down because this is not within the remit of the Chief Whip or the Government.  In view of this, I ask that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is being established today should be time limited to 30 September at the latest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that my first statement in Dail Éireann as Minister for Foreign Affairs should deal with the development of the European Union, for I expect this to be one of my main preoccupations in the period ahead.  I appreciate that EU membership is at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy.  I acknowledge also, as has the Taoiseach, the significance of the Amsterdam European Council for the future of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Amsterdam European Council was an important meeting for four reasons.  First, it brought to a close the Intergovernmental Conference and agreed the Amsterdam Treaty. Second, it marked a further step on the road to economic and monetary union.  Third, it dealt with the vital issue of employment to which a special European Council will be devoted during the current Luxembourg Presidency.  Fourth, the Amsterdam European Council opened the way for the EU to enter into the next stage of its development.  This relates primarily to the further enlargement of the EU's membership and to the <Col N="453" /> major issues that have to be dealt with in that context.  Chief among these are the EU's future financial perspectives and modifications to some of its key common policies.  The complex of issues connected with enlargement will have significant implications for the future development of the country.  I want to ensure Ireland contributes positively and constructively to the further building of Europe, taking account of our specific traditions and interests.  I will spare no effort in ensuring that our interests are looked after as the EU continues to evolve and strengthen in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has provided an overall assessment of the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council, including of the Amsterdam Treaty which represents the culmination of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference represents a limited but important step forward for Europe and Ireland.  The outcome must be judged against the scale of the task of mapping a way forward for Europe with the unanimous agreement of all the member states and the full support of citizens throughout the EU.  The process and depth of European integration, which is greatly in the interests of all member states, including Ireland, remains without parallel elsewhere in the world.</P>
    <P>The successful outcome to the Intergovernmental Conference will first and foremost allow Europe to address more effectively the most direct concerns of citizens including those in relation to employment, the fight against crime, the environment, public health, consumer protection, social exclusion and non-discrimination.  The outcome will also better equip Europe, internally and externally, to protect and promote the interests of its citizens.  The successful conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference will allow the EU to turn to addressing the other major challenges which lie ahead, including its future financial priorities and the process of further enlargement.</P>
    <P>Ireland has every reason to be satisfied at the further step which the new treaty represents in the development of the process of European integration in a way which responds to the concerns of citizens.  Moreover, many points of specific concern to Ireland have been addressed in a satisfactory way, including the continued right of all member states to nominate a full member of the European Commission.  I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor and his negotiating team both for their role in protecting Ireland's specific interests and for their contribution, most notably during the Irish Presidency, to carrying forward the work of the Intergovernmental Conference in the interests of the EU as a whole.</P>
    <P>I will address one specific and important aspect of the Amsterdam Treaty in more detail, namely the new provisions on the common foreign and security policy.  One of the main challenges facing the EU has been how to improve the functioning of the CFSP so that the EU could act more effectively and cohesively on the international scene.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> The Intergovernmental Conference focused on this issue and, specifically, on how the Maastricht Treaty provisions relating to security and defence required revision to take account of international developments since Maastricht.  In these related areas the outcome of the European Council was satisfactory from the Irish standpoint.  The new Treaty provisions will enhance the capacity of the EU to act more coherently and effectively in its response to international developments.  At the same time it fully safeguards the specific character of the policies of member states, such as Ireland, who attach importance to military neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach has been clearly stated in the programme for Government agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. We will ensure that Ireland plays a full and constructive role as a member of the international community.  We have made it clear that positive and constructive participation in the further building of Europe is a key priority.  This participation must take account of our specific traditions and interests.  The framework provided by the Amsterdam Treaty is one through which we can achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>The outcome on security and defence is satisfactory from Ireland's standpoint.  Although many of our EU partners wished to see substantial movement towards common defence arrangements, this has not happened.  There are five main reasons why I regard the outcome as satisfactory. First, the chief new element in the Amsterdam Treaty is the explicit inclusion of the Petersberg tasks, covering humanitarian, rescue, peacekeeping and crisis management activities.  I welcome the inclusion of these tasks in the Treaty.  This accords fully with Ireland's interest as a UN peacekeeper with over 40 years experience in contributing to European peace and security in a manner that is in keeping with our commitment to international peace and security and our policy of military neutrality.  The revised Treaty provides that all member states of the EU, including the Western European Union observers, are entitled to participate fully, should they so wish, in Petersberg tasks undertaken by the Western European Union at the request of the EU, including participation in planning and decision-making processes in relation to such tasks.</P>
    <P>Second, Ireland's position outside military alliances is further protected in the Amsterdam Treaty.  The key clause from the Maastricht Treaty which provides that the EU's policy &ldquo;. shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states .&rdquo; is not only included but is given added prominence in the new Treaty.</P>
    <P>Third, I am pleased to report that, despite considerable pressure from a number of partners for the integration of the Western European Union into the EU, the new Treaty does not provide for this.  Nor is EU-WEU integration stated anywhere in the Treaty as an objective.  The Treaty provides for closer institutional relations and <Col N="455" /> practical co-operation between the EU and the Western European Union which will facilitate implementation of the Petersberg tasks. However, EU-WEU integration is mentioned only as a possibility, subject not only to the requirement of unanimity in the European Council but also to the assent of each member state, including Ireland.  I do not see how integration could be compatible with our policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the approach to the framing of a common defence policy, originally agreed at the time of Maastricht, will now be structured around the Petersberg tasks, and not the creation of mutual defence commitments more suitable to an alliance.  A common defence for the EU remains, as it was in the Maastricht Treaty, no more than a possibility, which would require unanimity in the European Council and the assent of each member state, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fifth, while the new Treaty provides for a review mechanism &mdash; the convening of a further Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; it does not stipulate any time frame for this review.  The Treaty makes it clear that any decision in this area would have to be taken by unanimity.</P>
    <P>Some partners sought to strengthen provisions which exist under the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty for co-operation in the field of armaments.  This is a sensitive area for many member states and the text as agreed does not commit partners to any course of action within the EU.  Any EU co-operation with regard to armaments must embrace also more effective control of arms exports.  I am pleased, therefore, that the European Council explicitly underlined in its conclusions the vital role of concerted international efforts towards proper regulation of arms exports and called for renewed and sustained work in this area.</P>
    <P>I turn to the institutional aspects of the CFSP. The Amsterdam Treaty reflects a balance between strengthened structures to facilitate the more efficient functioning of the CFSP and the preservation of the intergovernmental character of the Second Pillar.  Among its provisions are changes in decision-making, external representation, CFSP financing and the establishment of a planning and analysis capacity.  Ireland is satisfied with the agreement reached at the Summit on the reform of decision-making procedures for the CFSP.  Decisions have up until now been taken by unanimity.  Although the Maastricht Treaty made provision for implementing decisions to be taken by qualified majority, this provision has not been exercised.</P>
    <P>Certain member states saw the unanimity requirement as a barrier inhibiting progress towards the development of an effective EU foreign policy, arguing that there was a strong risk of paralysis in decision-making on foreign policy issues in an enlarged EU.  The outcome at Amsterdam envisages limited movement towards qualified majority voting while providing <Col N="456" /> adequate safeguards to prevent a member state being outvoted on sensitive foreign policy issues. This is a pragmatic compromise.  We can accept the need for greater use of majority voting in certain instances, subject to the proviso that a member state can exercise a veto if national interests are at stake.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam has created a new instrument for formulating policy &mdash; a common strategy.  Common strategies will be adopted by the European Council acting unanimously and will lay down general policy guidelines on CFSP issues.  The General Affairs Council will decide by consensus on recommendations for common strategies to be submitted to the European Council. Once the European Council has defined a common strategy, subsequent decisions in respect of its implementation will be adopted by the General Affairs Council by qualified majority voting. Consequently, a common strategy cannot be developed without the prior support of all member states at the General Affairs Council and unanimous endorsement by the European Council.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam text retains a safeguard that any member state be allowed to oppose the adoption of a decision by qualified majority for &ldquo;important and stated reasons of national policy&rdquo;. This safeguard has been described as an emergency brake; it is a procedure to be used only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Some member states had favoured the introduction of flexibility mechanisms into the Second Pillar, allowing any group of member states to proceed with a particular action if certain criteria were fulfilled.  Others were concerned at the detrimental effect of such arrangements on the internal coherence and external perception of the EU's policies.  The Amsterdam text adopts a procedure known as &ldquo;constructive abstention&rdquo;, whereby a member state can opt to abstain while allowing other member states to proceed with a particular action.  This outcome again appears to represent a pragmatic compromise.</P>
    <P>As regards the external representation of the EU, the Treaty provides for an enhanced role for the Secretary-General of the Council who will assist the Presidency by exercising the function of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.  The Presidency's pivotal role in CFSP is maintained &mdash; an issue of particular importance to the smaller member states &mdash; while the structures for assisting the Presidency have been strengthened.  A policy planning and early warning unit will be established in the EU secretariat to strengthen the EU's ability to anticipate and react to international developments. Agreement was reached at the Summit on proposals relating to the financing of CFSP actions. Operational expenditure will be charged to the Community budget.  The European Parliament and the Council will agree an annual budget for CFSP on the basis of a Commission proposal.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a legal personality allowing the EU to negotiate and conclude international <Col N="457" /> legal agreements, the Amsterdam text will give the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, the authority to undertake the negotiation of agreements under Title V (CFSP) and Title VI (Justice and Home Affairs) on behalf of the Council.  This is helpful in reinforcing the representational role of the Presidency.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the only separate declaration issued by the Council was on the situation in the Middle East.  This reflected the critical state of the Middle East peace process.  The Council appealed to the peoples and governments of the Middle East to renew the spirit of the mutual confidence generated at the Madrid conference in 1991 and through the Oslo agreement of 1993. The central message, and major new departure for the EU, is a reference to Palestinian statehood in the following terms:</P>
    <P>Europe calls on the people of Israel to recognise the right of the Palestinians to exercise self-determination, without excluding the option of a state.</P>
    <P>The declaration reaffirms the central principle of land for peace which underpins the 1991 Madrid conference and the subsequent Oslo accords and which must form the basis for a resumed peace process.  The document addresses fundamental concerns such as respect for the legitimate rights and aspirations of the people of the region, the rejection of all forms of terrorism and respect for human rights.  The Government will attach priority to efforts, together with our EU partners, to revive the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Council also adopted conclusions relating to Russia, Former Yugoslavia, Albania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  With regard to the last, it stated that it considers the principles of respect for human rights and international law, as well as a genuine commitment to democracy, to be essential cornerstones for the rebuilding of the country.  It also specified its expectation that President Kabila give effect to his agreement with the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to allow an immediate investigation into alleged human rights violations and to implement the concrete steps he has announced regarding the democratisation process.  The world has been outraged by the reports of massacres in former Zaire and the Government fully supports the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to have them investigated.</P>
    <P>The successful conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference opens the way for the beginning of accession negotiations with applicant countries of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus in six months.  As the conclusions of the Amsterdam European Council stated, the Commission will present its opinions on the membership applications by central and eastern European countries on 16 July.  At the same time, the Commission will publish a comprehensive communication, entitled Agenda 2000.  This will address a number of areas in the context of enlargement, including the development of the <Col N="458" /> common policies and the future financial framework for the EU beyond the year 1999.</P>
    <P>In December, the European Council at Luxembourg will receive a comprehensive report from the General Affairs Council on the Commission's opinions and Agenda 2000.  It will then take a series of decisions as to the overall management of the enlargement process and it will also decide on a reinforcement of the pre-accession strategy for the associated states.  In this regard it is expected that care will be taken to ensure that co-operation is strengthened with all of the applicant countries, including with those which are not likely to be in the first round of accessions.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise the historic importance of the enlargement process which is about to commence. Enlargement of the EU to include the new democracies of central and eastern Europe will enhance stability and confidence to the benefit of all European countries.  It will restore to countries which have long been cut off from the process of European integration their rightful place in the construction of a new Europe based on shared democratic principles, respect for minorities and for the human rights of all, and economic opportunity in accordance with the principles of the market economy and social justice. The prospect of enlargement has already opened up major new opportunities for Irish people and companies in central and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have acknowledged that enlargement is both a political necessity and a historic opportunity for Europe.  We are committed to playing a full part in ensuring that the EU and the applicant states together meet the challenges presented by the enlargement process to the benefit of Europe as a whole.  Enlargement presents considerable challenges to the EU as well as to the applicant states and it must take place in the context of the further deepening of European integration.  The unique features of the EU which have made possible its many important achievements must be preserved and its commitment to economic and social cohesion must be strengthened.</P>
    <P>We accept the need for control of the EU budget.  However, we shall seek to ensure that in the next round of financial perspectives adequate provision is made for programmes and policies of central importance for Ireland, especially the CAP and the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  We will particularly wish to see provision for a further substantial round of structural funding for Ireland.  The Commission has stated there should be no sudden shock in the case of Ireland and we endorse this.  Ireland's accelerated economic development is relatively recent and the Irish economy has not yet reached the level of wealth, and therefore the fiscal capacity, which would allow us to fund the major infrastructural developments still necessary to sustain and consolidate our economic growth.  Ireland has a young population and will continue to have large training needs.  Fixed capital investment is still well below the EU average and, despite the recent impressive <Col N="459" /> figures for economic growth, it does not yet benefit from the accumulation of wealth which exists in other European countries.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that the Government's essential aim &mdash; and my abiding personal objective &mdash; will be to achieve the maximum benefit to Ireland, in economic and financial terms, and in terms of conditions generally, in this important process.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of Gaelscoil Osrai which seeks funding to proceed with a new school.  The school authorities, who expected to have the building in place this year, operate from a number of prefab buildings which have reached the end of their life span.  This project requires the immediate attention of the Department and the school authorities want an indication that the work can proceed.</P>
      <P>The second matter relates to the Church of Ireland model school, New Road, Kilkenny. Gaelscoil Osrai has been negotiating on its school for the past ten years.  The Church of Ireland school which has been negotiating with the Department prior to that and is at a critical stage in its development is linked to Kilkenny College. A backlog of young students have requested places in that school.  Given that Kilkenny College is developing, it is putting pressure on the Church of Ireland school.  Both schools are essential to the education infrastructure in the city and I recommend they receive the go-ahead to the next stage of their development as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGuinness for raising this matter on the Adjourment.  I take this opportunity to outline to the House my Department's position regarding these important building projects at the Church of Ireland national school and Gaelscoil Osrai, Kilkenny city.</P>
      <P>Gaelscoil Osrai has staffing of a principal and 11 assistants and a shared remedial teacher.  The enrolment at September 1996 was 298 pupils.  The current classroom accommodation consists of 11 classrooms, all of which are prefabricated.  Provision for a new school is included in my Department's Capital Programme.  The original brief for the project was eight classrooms plus appropriate ancillary accommodation.  It was proposed that the school would retain three of the existing prefabs which, I understand, are relatively new and in good condition.  Discussions have taken place with Kilkenny County Council on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following these discussions and a review of the accommodation brief by my Department's planning section, the project was revised in February 1997 to provide 12 permanent classrooms with <Col N="460" /> appropriate ancillary accommodation.  Architectural planning is proceeding on this basis.  The project is now at planning permission stage. When all the planning work has been completed the project will be considered for release to tender in light of the available funds.</P>
    <P>The Church of Ireland national school has staffing of a principal, four assistants and a shared remedial teacher.  The enrolment at September 1996 was 134 pupils.  The current accommodation consists of five classrooms which are inadequate. It is planned to provide a new five classroom school with appropriate ancillary accommodation and plans have been prepared by the school's architect.  The costings for these plans are being evaluated within my Department.  When this evaluation has been completed, my Department will be in further contact with the school management and local Deputies, including Deputy McGuinness.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the urgent need to provide both these schools with their new facilities as quickly as possible.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter and assure him when all the planning stages have been completed satisfactorily for both projects, I will give every consideration to releasing the projects to tender and contract.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo comhghairdeas a thabhairt duit agus tá siúl agam go néireoidh leat sa phost nua.  This morning I raised the matter of the possible closure of the Asahi plant.  Since then, unfortunately, events have been overtaken with the terrible news at 1.30 p.m. today that the Asahi plant is to close. This news is disappointing for the north Mayo region as it involves the loss of 315 jobs and the loss of an annual investment of £10 million into the local economy.  There is already a serious unemployment problem in the north Mayo region and a resultant dependency on the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>The loss of the 315 jobs affects not only people in Mayo but people in neighbouring counties such as Sligo.  The news is particularly disappointing given that today I spoke to staff members of the Asahi plant and also to the union representatives. I have no doubt that had this matter been referred to the Labour Court tomorrow, as offered by the union representatives, a solution could have been found.  I am disappointed the Japanese management could not wait an extra 24 hours to see if it was possible to find a solution to this serious problem which has thrown the north Mayo region into crisis.</P>
      <P>The union representatives would have been available today, or tomorrow at 2.30 p.m. as arranged, but unfortunately, they received a negative response from the Japanese management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions must be asked.  This company has been in existence for the past 20 <Col N="461" /> years and even though there are different cultures between the Japanese and the Irish, the Japanese management was well aware of the industrial relations procedures that exist in Ireland and that it is common for matters to be referred to the Labour Court Why could an additional 24 hours not have been given?  It raises the question of whether the viability plan drawn up by the previous Government before the general election was viable or was just an election gimmick to get us over that date in June.  This is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts being made by the Minister. I have just come from a press conference with her a moment ago and I accept she is making every effort to ensure that another industry will be found for the north Mayo region.  However, the track record of State agencies in this regard in County Mayo is very poor.  Last year the IDA announced 17,000 jobs in Ireland as a whole but not one job in County Mayo.  I know the Minister is committed, but I would also ask for commitment from the State agencies to ensure that a real effort is made under the new North Mayo Enterprise Initiative to find an alternative industry. Currently in County Mayo thousands of people are devastated as a result of today's decision which they cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Is there any possibility, even at this late stage, that the Japanese management might reconsider and go to the Labour Court tomorrow?  Is there any possibility that if the employees in the Asahi plant, who are meeting at present, reballot their members this evening, the factory could be saved?  I thank the Tánaiste for her efforts to date.  The loss of this factory is of primary concern to the people of Mayo.  The proposal to look for a viable alternative is welcome, but it would be better to save the factory we have because it is very difficult to attract jobs to this region.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  I share with her the concerns she has expressed about the announcement today by Asahi Chemicals of its decision to withdraw from Ireland.  That will be a devastating blow to the workers involved, to Killala and to the north Mayo region.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy of the Government's commitment to act immediately to put in place a North Mayo Enterprise Initiative with a view to seeking an alternative buyer for the plant at Killala, looking at the possibility of training or retraining the workers involved, working with the IDA to find an alternative foreign investor for the plant and supporting indigenous Irish industry in any efforts it might make to locate in that region.  I am particularly conscious that there is an advance factory in Ballina.  It would be my intention, working with the new North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, to find a suitable industry to locate in that area, and we will leave no stone unturned to bring that about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="462" /> The textile industry generally and the synthetic fibre sector of that industry have been going through enormous rationalisation over the past ten years.  This company has suffered enormous losses, notwithstanding the fact that it has received substantial grant-aid and State support. In Europe generally only nine out of 20 plants remain, and only five out of 11 companies in this business.  The parent company in Japan made a decision some time ago to withdraw from certain segments of the market.  That included a decision to withdraw from Killala.  It wanted to withdraw on favourable terms by supporting a management buy-out option.  That option was a very good one, and the company was supportive of it.  I regret very much that the workers did not think alike. For that investment-led option to work the support of the workers was necessary because it would have required enormous restructuring in work practices and in other areas.  In a letter dated 3 July, the parent company made it clear to the workers that they would accept the outcome of the ballot.  Unfortunately, it was in the negative and the company acted accordingly.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ballot, the industrial development agencies, Forbairt and the IDA, met for some considerable time yesterday with the vice-president, Mr. Namba.  Later last evening I and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met him and his colleagues.  We asked for more time to give the workers an opportunity to reflect on the decision that had been made.  We were keen that the industrial relations machinery of the State should be made available to resolve the difficulties if that were possible.  However, it was very clear that there was no going back; they were not willing to go back on the decision they had made because the board of the parent company had made that decision and had made it clear all along that the only basis on which they would support the management buyout was with a decisive vote from the workers.</P>
    <P>Today the workers were told of the management decision and, although the Chairman of the Labour Court made it clear that she was willing to intervene, the company is not prepared to facilitate a hearing tomorrow before the Labour Court.  We may regret that.  I certainly regret it. The SIPTU official, Ms Jeanette Hughes, said today that the decision was final, that there was no way of going back.</P>
    <P>However, we must not engage in the blame game.  We must look to the future, and it is with that in mind that this morning I invited the County Manager, Mr. Des Mahon, to chair the new North Mayo Enterprise Initiative.  It will include members of the IDA, Forbairt, FÁS and from the Ballina Chamber of Commerce, a representative from the local community and Bishop Finnegan.  I hope they will set about their task very quickly.  I intend to meet them shortly, and the Government will give them every support in seeking alternative opportunities for the workers involved here and for the region generally.  We hope that our combined efforts, the partnership <Col N="463" /> approach that we are supporting in making this announcement, will succeed in delivering an alternative opportunity for the workers and their families in a region that will tonight be very devastated by what they have just heard.  I hope that this initiative will work in the same way as the initiatives taken when there were factory closures in Tallaght, Ballyfermot, Tipperary and Galway. People working together, focused on the future, wanting to provide opportunities and fill the vacuum that will inevitably be created can achieve an enormous amount.  In that, they will have my full support and that of the Government.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Cooper-Flynn who has been in touch with me constantly in relation to this matter, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt. I hope to work with her and the other representatives from the area to turn around a devastating blow in a very short time.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of Social Welfare of which I have some knowledge.  I wish him every success.</P>
      <P>The matter I raise relates to a reply to a parliamentary question tabled yesterday.  The information in the reply was needed for a specific purpose today.  A more serious problem may have been created because the information is out of date.  The reply states that the assessment is based on self-employment and that this is based on the most recent figures available to the Department. On closer examination it was found that one of the most recent assessments was in 1993.  Two Governments have come and gone since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information should be updated for three reasons.  First, a long time has elapsed; second, legislation relating to seasonal and part-time workers has changed in the meantime which would make it more beneficial to the person concerned; and, even more important, the whole source of the part-time employment which was in existence at that time has gone.  That is the vital element which needed to be updated and brought <Col N="464" /> to the attention of the Department.  The assessment does not reflect that position.  I am not attributing blame to the Minister.  It is the fault of the system.  It is important that up to date information is available at all times.  I merely ask the Minister to examine the case in question.  Up to date information would eliminate much of the confusion for the individual concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue which was the subject of a parliamentary question tabled by him yesterday.  The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at a reduced single rate on the basis of a means assessment of £33 per week.  The means are derived from self-employment and are based on the most recent figures furnished to the Department by the person concerned.  The means are assessed for a 12 month period up to 3 October 1995, not 1993.  I accept the Deputy's comments and ask him to supply any information that would assist the Department in dealing with this matter.</P>
      <P>The man in question was interviewed on a number of occasions about his earnings from self-employment. The inspector dealing with the case is satisfied the assessment is reasonable having regard to the man's circumstances, but is not satisfied the person concerned has ceased self-employment. The most recent decision on this case was given on 12 May 1997 by a deciding officer in my Department.  The person concerned did not appeal this decision nor has he claimed supplementary welfare allowance from the community welfare officer, to which he would be entitled based on the amount of money he is receiving.</P>
      <P>If the circumstances of the person concerned have changed it is open to him to seek a further review of his means and a form for this purpose can be obtained at his nearest local office.  In the meantime payment of unemployment assistance will continue to issue at the reduced rate.  Deputy Durkan should encourage this man to seek a review of his means and the Department will examine all the circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 30 September 1997.</P>

      <P>In my earlier reply to the priority question on this matter, I spelled out in detail the threefold strategy I will be pursuing to address the flagship problem.  The first component of that strategy is to mount, through rigorous enforcement, an effective ban on the illegal activities of all fishing vessels, irrespective of nationality, in our waters. The second is to press, with the support of the Commission, other member states concerned to play their part in properly controlling and monitoring the activities and landings of flagships.  The third is to work with the Commission and likeminded member states in order to ensure the necessary link between the economic benefits of national fish quotas and the coastal communities concerned.  I am committed to making tangible progress on this threefold strategy which, I believe, is the key to delivering workable solutions on flagships and their fishing activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>A key priority in the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium, is to seek to upgrade our fishing fleet and to make the industry attractive to providers of capital by examining the provision of tax breaks and subsidised loans. As I have already confirmed to the industry, my priority is to make immediate progress on the renewal of the white fish fleet for safety and economic reasons, in line with available fishing opportunities.</P>
      <P>I have decided, therefore, as a first step to press ahead with the introduction of a pilot grant scheme to support investment in a number of new white fish boats in order to test the viability of such vessels.  I have instructed the Department and BIM to speed up the work of drawing up the necessary guidelines and conditions with a view to early clearance by the EU Commission and its implementation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am also pursuing the necessary additional EU and Exchequer funding for the scheme.</P>
      <P>In addition to testing the waters with the pilot grant scheme, I have also asked the Department to examine urgently the scope for tax breaks and other financial incentives to make investment in our fishing fleet more attractive to providers of capital.  This will be done in full consultation with the industry itself with a view to bringing forward proposals within a very short timeframe for consideration in the context of the budget for 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the Operational Programme for Fisheries we will continue to provide funding for the modernisation of existing boats within the fishing fleet.  I intend to ensure that this funding continues to support essential investment aimed at delivering on the objectives of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet as a whole.  There has been good take-up to date with a significant number of applications in the system at present.  I expect to be in a position to announce a new round of modernisation grants in the early autumn.</P>

Funding has been provided in the 1997 fishery harbour development programme towards the cost of the necessary technical investigations which are a prerequisite of such a scheme.  A dredging programme will be considered in the light of the findings of the site investigations.  The Department is currently in discussion with Donegal County Council on the practical arrangements for undertaking the technical investigations.  I am advised that the county council will take a decision shortly on whether it is in a position to undertake these works directly with, of course, whatever practical assistance the Department's engineers can provide.</P>

      <P>I fully agree with the Deputy on the importance of ensuring a viable future for the fishermen based in Howth.  On all the advice available to me, however, I am not convinced that the co-operative in question, as presently constituted, is the appropriate vehicle for progressing the interests of the fishermen concerned.  It is also the case that, given the unsatisfactory history of the cooperative's tenancy at Howth over the years, I am not in a position to renew the lease to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>In order to take matters forward, however, I have requested the Department, in consultation with the Howth fishermen, to review all possible options for encouraging the take-up of genuine fishing opportunities, together with scope for a soundly-based strategy to facilitate marketing, distribution and value-added.</P>

      <P>In November 1994 my Department contributed £5,000 towards the cost of carrying out an economic and feasibility study, undertaken by a firm of consultants, McCarthy and Partners, for a proposed deep water berthing facilities at Ross Point, Killala, County Mayo.  This study was a follow on to earlier studies carried out in 1978 and again in 1983 by McCarthy and Partners.  The development proposals at Ross Point involves an investment of between £6 million and £10 million.  The final report received in February 1996 indicated that it would be unrealistic to proceed with the construction of a jetty before a commitment has been received from a suitable and substantial new &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; industry.  As of now there is no market demand for deep water facilities at Killala.</P>

      <P>To date four groups holding offshore petroleum authorisations are drilling or plan to undertake drilling programmes in the Irish offshore during 1997.  Total Oil Marine plc commenced drilling an exploration well on 3 July 1997 in block 35/17 in the Porcupine Basin off the south-west coast of Ireland.  Marathon plan to drill an exploration well in block 35/30 this year, also in the Porcupine Basin.  Current expectations are that the well will commence <Col N="469" /> in late July or early August.  Both of those wells will be drilled under Frontier Exploration Licences granted in 1995.</P>
      <P>Enterprise Oil plc proposes to drill an exploration well in the Kish Bank Basin, offshore Dublin, and while it has not yet set a definite date for drilling they expect to be in a position to commence towards the end of the year.  Statoil, which holds a Lease Undertaking over the Connemara Field in block 26/28, also in the Porcupine Basin, is currently conducting a two well appraisal programme on the field to determine whether it can be brought into long-term commercial production. An essential part of this appraisal work is to produce oil as part of a long-term test from the field over a period of about two months and is expected to begin today.</P>
      <P>Four companies have acquired a total of almost 15,000 kilometres of 2D seismic data in the South Porcupine Basin so far this year.  Another company is in the process of conducting a 420 square kilometre-3D seismic survey in the Slyne Trough. In addition five companies have plans to conduct further seismic surveys off the west coast of Ireland and in the Celtic Sea within the next few months.</P>

      <P>While I have a statutory role in relation to the superannuation schemes in some State bodies &mdash; under section 20 of the Air Companies Act, 1966, all changes to the existing schemes in Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta are subject to my approval, following consultation with the Minister for Finance &mdash; the determination of general policy in relation to such schemes is a matter for the Minister for Finance. Having said that, the co-ordinated arrangements which apply since 1970 are inherently logical and there is no proposal to change them. Under these arrangements, eligibility for social welfare pensions, where it arises is taken into account in setting the arrangements in vocational schemes both in relation to contributions and benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case under reference co-ordination was introduced in the context of proposed amendments <Col N="470" /> to the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme.  In the course of granting approval for those changes, the then Department of Transport and Power required that the scheme be co-ordinated with social welfare benefits. This arrangement applied to new members joining the scheme after 1 April 1970.  Existing members were given the option of joining the new arrangements or remaining in the existing scheme.  This type of co-ordination is now a fundamental feature of most public and private sector schemes and since April 1995, has been extended to all new entrants to the public service who are on full PRSI.</P>

It is, accordingly, a legal function of the director in the first instance to address the question of licensing such operators.  Any licensing regulations proposed by the Director of Telecommunications Regulation would be subject to my consent.</P>

Such an inspection was carried out on the applicant's farm, as he was due his second year payment, and a problem was uncovered as a result.  On two occasions since, a revised agri-environmental plan was requested to rectify the problem, but on each occasion the revised plan was found to be deficient.

      <P>Ireland already exports cattle and beef to over 60 markets worldwide.  Given the importance of this sector to the national economy, no effort has been spared to maintain existing markets and to secure additional outlets for Irish product.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department visited Libya, Russia, Egypt, Iran and the Gulf States to promote Irish beef.  Already this year, agreement on veterinary certification has been secured with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates thus ensuring that beef exports will continue unimpeded to these destinations.  As regards Russia, beef exports are continuing at significant levels and further discussions are envisaged with the Russian authorities in the near future in order to have the current restrictions on Irish beef reviewed. On Iran, technical discussions are continuing with a view to agreeing an acceptable veterinary Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the countries which import Irish beef and cattle, and particularly in the Middle East, contact has been maintained with the authorities either directly or through the diplomatic service on the spot, who keep me informed in detail of <Col N="475" /> developments which affect our exports and who accord the highest priority to ensuring access for Irish products to these important markets.  Various delegations have also been received from a number of these countries.</P>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Department of Foreign Affairs, An Bord Bia and my Department are actively engaged in seeking new markets in other countries such as Morocco, Syria, Poland, Azerbaijan and Turkey which do not as yet have a tradition in importing Irish beef.</P>

      <P>The Freedom of Information Act was passed into law on 21 April 1997.  The Act will commence for Government Departments and certain other public bodies on 21 April 1998, i.e. 12 months from enactment as provided for in section 1 (2) of the Act.  Each individual Department and public body must ensure that the rights conferred by the Freedom of Information Act can be exercised fully and effectively by citizens, clients and customers of their services from the date of commencement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To assist Departments and other public bodies <Col N="476" /> in their preparations for meeting the requirements of the legislation, a central policy unit was established in my Department.  This unit is now leading the implementation process and providing ongoing advice and support to public bodies in their general preparations for commencement of the legislation.  In addition, by working with Departments through a high level interdepartmental working group, key issues are being addressed so as to ensure its effective application in areas such as: the provision of training for freedom of information; guidance in relation to key publications required under sections 15 and 16 of the Act; and improvement in systems for managing information so as to respond efficiently to Freedom of Information requests.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are also in progress for the establishment of the Office of the Information Commissioner who will undertake a key role in relation to appeals under the legislation.</P>
    <P>Given the extensive range of preparations now in train, I am fully confident that the deadlines for the introduction of the provisions of the Act, as set by the Oireachtas, will be adhered to.</P>

      <P>I have been further advised by the Southern Health Board that its current practice in relation to the delivery of hospital services is to increase day-patient work and out-patient throughput as an alternative to in-patient care.  The board has in the past number of years supported this development through the designation of a number of dedicated day beds in Mallow General Hospital and the provision of equipment and staffing resources to enable an increase in day work.  In the context of the board's assurances concerning the achievement of agreed activity levels at the hospital, I am satisfied that this is an appropriate approach to the delivery of services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen) Brian Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>As I explained last night to the House, recent media reports referring to the vaccination of children in orphanages in 1960-61 and in 1973 are not new.  They were the subject of media comment in October 1990 and May 1991 and the then Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, answered questions in the House on the matter on 7 May 1991.  Essentially, we are now addressing the same issues.</P>
      <P>The administration of the vaccines to the children in the children's homes was not in any way experimental.  The children were due to be vaccinated in accordance with scheduled vaccination programmes at the time and the vaccines used were all approved under the regulatory framework which prevailed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the studies was to determine which of the approved vaccines was most appropriate for use in the national vaccination programmes. The 1973 study was the larger study <Col N="567" /> and was not confined to children's homes.  The medical officers attending the homes gave their permission for the administration of the vaccines and were perceived to be acting <i>in loco parentis</i> in so doing.  All the information available to me indicates that not only were the studies carried out in accordance with the then prevailing ethical guidelines but that additional measures were taken on a voluntary basis to ensure the highest standards of safety and efficacy.</P>
    <P>The 1960-61 study was the subject of a subsequent report in the British Medical Journal of 21 April 1962.  It described a comparative study comparing 3-in-1-diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and separate polio immunisation with a 4-in-1, all vaccines combined, carried out on 52 children resident in five orphanages.  The vaccines were administered to the children as part of the child immunisation programme.</P>
    <P>The study was carried out in accordance with the then prevailing ethical guidelines and no adverse reactions occurred which were ascribed to the immunisations.  The immunisations were conducted with the consent of the medical officers attending the children's homes and this is acknowledged in the BMJ article.  It is a fact that information on this study has been in the public domain for 35 years.</P>
    <P>In 1973, the Eastern Health Board noted above expected levels of transitory adverse reactions following the administration of DPT vaccine and discussed this with the pharmaceutical company. The health board co-operated with the company in carrying out a comparative study comparing four types of DPT vaccines, two of which were already in use and two of which were composed of the same basic components and which were approved.</P>
    <P>Prior to the study being undertaken, Wellcome, the company supplying the vaccine, submitted a detailed Protocol to the NDAB, to which the board raised no objection.  This was done on a voluntary basis as there was no statutory requirement to do so.  The study proceeded on this basis. A total of 116 children were involved &mdash; 59 children being in the community and 57 children from two children's homes in the Dublin area. The children participating in this study were due to be immunised with DPT vaccine as part of the national immunisation programme.  The results of the study were inconclusive, in that no significant difference between the vaccines emerged.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any other similar studies or trials involving children in orphanages but I have asked all health boards to report on the situation to the Department as a matter of urgency.  When this information is received I will review the situation and decide what further action, if any, should be taken.</P>
    <P>I have asked Glaxo Wellcome to provide a comprehensive report on the relevant studies. They have undertaken to provide such a report at the earliest possible date which I will make available to the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements have been in place since 1968 under the Irish Medicines Board &mdash; formerly the National Drugs Advisory Board &mdash; to monitor adverse reactions to medicines, including vaccines.  I have asked the board to provide me with an initial report on their assessment of reported reactions to DTP vaccine in the last five years and I will communicate the outcome of this assessment to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Officers of the Department, during the period 1979 to 1982, gave regular consideration to the establishment of an appropriate objective mechanism to determine compensation in proven cases of vaccine damage.  However, having particular regard to the report of the expert group established in 1977 to assess individual cases and the May 1981 report of the DHSS on whooping cough vaccine no further consideration was given to this proposal after 1982.</P>
      <P>The DHSS report had concluded that in general there was a very small risk associated with the pertussis vaccine, that it was not possible to clearly identify any specific syndrome associated with the vaccine and that there was no way of proving in any particular case that brain damage had been caused by the vaccine.  As the reports of the Irish Expert Medical Group had been based on the balance of probabilities, it was felt that in the Irish context vaccine damage had not been absolutely proven.  There is no record of any advice having been given by officials to the Minister in this matter.</P>
      <P>Extensive international research has been conducted over many years regarding the possible link between pertussis vaccination and chronic brain damage.  In the latest edition of Meylers Side Effect of Drugs, a publication of international standing, the conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to indicate either the presence or absence of a casual relation between DTP vaccine and a range of conditions, including chronic neurological damage.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to initiate further ongoing research on this matter but will continue to monitor closely all reported developments in this area.  At a practical level I would like to reiterate the advice given in the recently published guidelines on immunisation in which particular stress is laid on the identification of children who may have contraindications to this particular vaccine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. D. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Different categories of social welfare recipients have differing needs.  The social welfare system must be flexible enough to respond adequately to these needs.  The different methods of assessing earnings as between the various social welfare payment schemes and as between different household situations reflects specific policies which are aimed at targeting particular groups of recipients for special attention.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the two household situations described in the question are not similar. One relates to a household where there is a single earner only, while the other relates to a household where the income is provided by two people.</P>
      <P>In relation to the one-parent family payment, which was introduced earlier this year, research carried out by the ESRI has clearly shown that one-parent families are particularly at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  Under this scheme, a lone parent can earn up to £6,000 a year without affecting his-her entitlement to payment.  This measure is aimed at facilitating lone parents who wish to return to the workforce, by providing positive support so that, over time, they can gain a foothold in the labour market and become less reliant on social welfare for their income needs.</P>
      <P>The £60 earnings threshold is one of a number of different methods which are used to determine whether a claimant's spouse is to be regarded a financial dependant for qualified adult allowance purposes.  Where the spouse of a claimant is adjudged to be financially dependent, then the allowance, together with full child dependant allowances are paid to the claimant, in addition to his or her personal rate of payment.  Where the spouse is not regarded as a dependant, then the allowance is not payable and only half of the child dependant allowances are payable.</P>
      <P>However, the sudden withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance and half of the child dependant allowances where the income of the spouse of a claimant exceeds £60 a week creates a sharp poverty trap.  The national agreement: &ldquo;Partnership 2000&rdquo; provides that &ldquo;measures to alleviate this poverty trap will be considered, in consultation with the social partners&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> As a first step in addressing this problem regulations which will be made later this year, will provide for the introduction of a tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult allowance in the case of recipients of unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit, disability allowance and pre-retirement allowance, with effect from October.  Under the new arrangements, where the spouse's weekly income exceeds £60 the allowance will be withdrawn on the basis of £6 for each additional £5 of income, with the allowance being withdrawn completely where the spouse's weekly income exceeds £90.  It is estimated that approximately 9,760 families will benefit under this proposal at an annual cost of almost £10 million with an average gains for families amounting to over £19 a week.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure fairness in the way that the State supports families, whether the parents concerned are married, cohabiting or parenting alone, a working group has been appointed to identify ways of ensuring consistent and equitable treatment of such households under the social welfare and income tax codes.  As part of its remit, the working group has been charged with the task of reviewing the concept of adult dependency, as well as examining the income support arrangements for labour market programmes. The establishment of this group also marks the first stage in meeting the commitment contained in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy to examine individualisation of payments.  The group is due to report by March 1998.</P>

      <P>The person concerned qualified for family income supplement in April 1994 and was paid until April 1995 at a rate of £33 per week.  She again applied in September 1995 but the family income, including the income of her husband who had taken up employment in the meantime, exceeded the appropriate limit for entitlement to the supplement and the application was disallowed. The decision to disallow the application was upheld on appeal and there is no claim for payment of the supplement for the period in question.</P>

      <P>In March 1997 the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the next school year with the Irish National Teachers Organisation.  These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of all surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources.  In this context, the programme specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 103 one teacher primary schools with ten or more pupils in the country.  A further 23 schools are due to become one teacher schools from 1 September 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since there are no teaching posts available to me from the 1997-98 demographic dividend for allocation to these schools, I am currently examining a range of options with a view to identifying the most appropriate way to fulfil the Government's <Col N="573" /> commitments to one teacher schools, and especially to the 23 schools referred to above.</P>

      <P>The steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education was asked to examine &ldquo;within the overall national context. the needs for higher education on a regional basis.&rdquo;.  Following its examination of Dublin and the surrounding counties, the committee recommended Blanchardstown, Dublin 15 as the appropriate location for the establishment of a new regional technical college to serve the north, north-west and north-east Dublin regions as well as growth areas in County Meath and County Kildare.</P>
      <P>In the light of the steering committee report, which was accepted as a benchmark for future planning in the sector, a decision was taken to establish an regional technical college at Blanchardstown. My Department is in negotiation with Fingal County Council regarding the acquisition of approximately 45 acres of land as a site for the college.</P>
      <P>A planning group is currently undertaking the development of a strategic plan for the college which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, industry links, support services and research and consultancy.  The courses at certificate, diploma and degree levels will focus on the needs and the human resource requirements of leading-edge high technology industries and on languages, business, science and engineering fields.</P>
      <P>The new regional technical college will initially cater for around 1,000 students.</P>
