      <P>It is proposed to take No. 7a &mdash; motion re nomination of member of the Government which shall be taken following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21; No. 8a &mdash; Europol Bill, 1997, Committee and Remaining Stages; and No. 9 &mdash; statements on the 1996 Annual Report of the Ombudsman (resumed).  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on No. 7a, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. tonight and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the speech of the Taoiseach and of the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; (iv) the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall be called upon not later than 6.35 p.m. tonight to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes.  If the proceedings on No. 7a conclude earlier than the time stated, any division demanded thereon shall be postponed until 6.45 p.m. tonight; (2) Private Members' Business, which shall be No. 15 &mdash; motion re farmers' incomes &mdash; shall take place today directly after the Order of Business for 90 minutes, following which the proceedings on the motion shall adjourn and shall resume at 7 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>The matter is covered by No. 7a &mdash; motion re nomination of member of the Government shall be taken following the announcement of matters on the Adjournment under Standing Order 21.  There are two proposals to put to the House.  Is the proposal for dealing with item No. 7a agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the motion has not been circulated but will the Taoiseach in his statement announcing the person to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of the former Minister, Mr. Burke, also announce any consequential vacancies, including those at Minister of State level?  It would not be fair to keep them waiting for a few days.</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to bring forward the Equal Status Bill on which much work was done by the previous Government? The Bill was referred to the Supreme Court because some constitutional deficiencies were found in it but the bulk of it is constitutional. When will this legislation which guarantees non-discriminatory treatment of people, a matter of some importance, be brought forward by the Government?</P>

      <P>Given that the Government intends to introduce the budget in December will the social welfare Bill, which is normally introduced in March, also be introduced earlier?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill does not normally have to be introduced until April but it will be introduced in good time so that any necessary changes arising from the budget can be given effect to within a suitable timescale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach reflected further on the question about the Local Government Act raised with him last week?  Does he intend to amend the Act to allow the date of the next local elections to be moved?  It is important that councillors and potential councillors have reasonable notice of any such move.  In light of comments made by the STAD group, has the Taoiseach reflected further on re-establishing the Cabinet sub-committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: In light of a High Court decision last week that assault and battery may no longer be a crime, is it proposed to bring forward amending legislation, particularly in the context of the Offences Against the Person Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Higgins is aware that was an interim High Court decision and, <Col N="248" /> therefore, it would be wrong to comment on it. However, there will be a further review based on the final decision of the High Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach make Government time available to discuss the present position on economic and monetary union having regard to the carefully prepared leak by the British Government in respect of its attitude towards it?  Such a debate would be timely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would favour a debate not only on economic and monetary union but on all issues concerned and the Whips should look at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the generosity of the Taoiseach there are a number of separate but related issues.  There would be a loss of focus if we had a general debate.  We need to have separate debates on Agenda 2000 and the implications for the mid term review on Structural Funds, but more importantly &mdash; and particularly from the point of view of the economy in the light of the very carefully designed leak by the British Government published in the <i>Financial Times</i> last Friday week &mdash; there should be a debate on this issue.  That is what I am specifically asking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, might discuss that issue with the Whips who might welcome a debate on it.</P>

      <P>Given that the former Minister for Foreign Affairs signed the Amsterdam Treaty on behalf of the State, does the Taoiseach propose to bring that treaty before the House for approval and when is it intended to hold a referendum on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated in reply to a question last week that we would have a debate on that issue during this session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The treaty was signed and I am not sure if it is necessary to bring it before the House.  I stated that when the constitutional amendment is prepared it will have to be brought before the House and a White Paper is being prepared. At that stage the matter will have to be brought before the House.  I was asked last week if we would have a debate on the matter prior to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome a debate in the short-term if Members wish to have one.  The matter must be brought before the House when the constitutional amendment is prepared.  The White Paper will be published during the next few months, hopefully by November, and it is hoped the referendum will take place in March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the severe threat to many farmers' incomes this year, arising in particular from the collapse of live exports to both the EU and third countries, the continuing Russian ban on exports of carcase beef from seven Irish counties, the failure to secure payment of national compensation of £17 million to beef producers (£50 slaughter premium) and the disastrous grain harvest especially in the south and south-east of the country, condemns the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government for their inadequate and ineffective stewardship of agriculture since coming into office and calls on them to take immediate and effective action to redress the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Connaughton and Ring.  The current Minister for Agriculture and Food, in his then capacity as Opposition <Col N="251" /> spokesman, introduced a similar motion which was debated in this House on 15 and 16 April.  The following month the general election was called and shortly afterwards Deputy Walsh became Minister.  I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in the vital position he occupies for Irish agriculture, but I do not have much else good to say about him.</P>
    <P>It is very revealing to look at the record of last April's debate and particularly the words of the Minister and his leader, the Taoiseach, who contributed to that debate and whose contribution was an indication of the importance the then Opposition placed on agriculture.  Deputy Bertie Ahern stated that agriculture needs a Government prepared to act with energy and to maintain farm incomes.  He stated that a Fianna Fáil-led Government would do a better job, would be far tougher in negotiations and that as leader of such a Government he would give the highest priority to reopening third country markets which are vital to healthy competition.</P>
    <P>In the same debate the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, stated that the single most important thing the then Minister could do was to seek to have live export markets reopened.  He roundly criticised the Minister for neglecting the real work which needed to be done in Brussels, Cairo, Tripoli, Tehran and Moscow.  He referred to the failure to deliver on matching compensation for green pound revaluations.  On the EU market Deputy Walsh stated that in regard to cattle prices there was no BSE or animal disease problem but there was a ferry transport problem.  He then promised that on return to Government Fianna Fáil would immediately embark on an action programme which would confront all the issues highlighted.  He said the first step would be to embark on a tour of capital cities of third countries to reopen beef and live cattle markets. There was a strong implication that not only would the Minister tour those cities but also the Taoiseach, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, to whom I extend congratulations and good wishes, made a characteristically spirited contribution to that debate, in the course of which he stated that live exports have been the backbone of the cattle industry and that we must have live exports. Deputy O'Keeffe asked what happened the young farmer installation aid and the reason for the delays in that scheme.</P>
    <P>I will not take up the time of the House with endless repetition and quotes from the then Opposition &mdash; there are many other references which are even more juicy.  Replies furnished by Fianna Fáil to the IFA pre-election questionnaire, published in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, stated that Fianna Fáil would negotiate the reopening of the vital live cattle trade and beef markets currently closed or restricted.  They stated that Fianna Fáil would ensure live cattle exports are always facilitated so that there is a <Col N="252" /> maximum price competition for cattle at all times. In response to a questionnaire from Macra na Feirme, Fianna Fáil stated in regard to installation aid for young farmers that the party is committed to the continuation of this scheme which is very important not only for young farmers but for the general profile of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Against the background of those recent statements and undertakings it is reasonable to ask how the Government is measuring up to the expectations which those statements raised in the minds of farmers.  It is precisely because the performance to date has fallen so far short of expectations that my colleagues and I in Opposition felt it incumbent on us to put down, at the first opportunity, this motion of censure and to seek an urgent debate on the serious decline in the incomes of many farmers as well as on the threats and uncertainties surrounding agriculture.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer first to the crucial issue of live exports to the European Union and to third countries. The Minister knew in Opposition that the only substantive impediment to the export of live cattle to the European Union is the unavailability of suitable marine transport.  Yet it has taken him practically three months to obtain a commitment from his Cabinet colleagues to provide a subsidy for the establishment of a roll-on roll-off ferry, even though the necessity for such a commitment was as evident on the day he took up office as it was in the middle of September.  I hope I am wrong, but even now we are not sure if he has negotiated approval from the European Commission for this subsidy, despite the fact that as an island nation without a shipping service for our cattle exports to the EU we are at a serious and continuing trading disadvantage.  That is certainly not in the spirit of EU regulations.  Furthermore, in the peak season for the export of weanlings and heavier cattle, farmers still do not know whether a ferry service to the Continent will materialise or, if so, when.</P>
    <P>There is also a market for the export of heavier cattle to the European Union.  It is obvious that a specialist cattle ship rather than a roll-on roll-off ferry would be more suitable than a ferry service for the export of such cattle.  There is a proposal to provide such a service through the port of Cork in a Danish registered ship the <i>Caroline</i> which meets all EU regulations, but falls slightly short of a small number of additional Irish regulations. I accept these additional Irish regulations were introduced during the term of the Minister's predecessor but, nonetheless, will the Minister consider relaxing them a little, on a trial basis only, in the light of the current transport crisis?</P>
    <P>As of now all exports of live cattle to the European Union are blocked due to the absence of suitable marine transport.  Given the Government's stated priorities this position is not good enough and has continued for far too long.  Farmers are entitled to demand that such an intolerable imposition on the export of their produce be removed immediately.  It is the duty of the Minister to respond without further procrastination or <Col N="253" /> delay to this entirely reasonable demand and I hope he will do so in his response.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the high priority afforded to third country exports by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the abject failure to open the Egyptian and other Middle Eastern markets is indefensible.  When the Minister finally decided to visit Cairo farmers could have been forgiven for assuming that positive news was at last at hand.  However, other than a vague proposal to export a trial batch of 2,000 cattle at some indeterminate date in the future, the visit appears to have been a damp squib.  Reading the reported statements of the Taoiseach at the ploughing championship last week, in which he clearly set out to lower expectations, it would appear the trip to Cairo was not as successful as we had hoped.</P>
    <P>It is worth contrasting this with the position at the beginning of June when the then Minister, Deputy Yates, received a letter from his counterpart in Cairo on 4 June which stated:</P>
    <P>Following our meeting in Cairo during the first week of May, and the letter of Secretary John Malone of May 12, 1997 to Mr. Hassam Salem, the Egyptian Ambassador to Ireland, and our telephone conversation on June 2, I am pleased to inform you that the Egyptian Veterinarian Authority has thoroughly examined the proposal of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry of Ireland concerning exports of live cattle to Egypt.  It has been agreed, in principle, to allow imports of live cattle, ready-for-slaughter and not more than two years of age, from herds that were never fed meat and bone meal and from areas declared &ldquo;Free of BSE&rdquo; in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The details of the implementation of the terms of the proposal, however, should be outlined by the Veterinarian Authorities in both countries as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I accept that was a decision in principle and that some details needed to be followed up, but it is now early October and that market appears to be as tightly shut as it was when Deputy Yates received that letter.  I disregard comments that the letter was written in the context of a general election.  The Minister for Agriculture in Cairo is not likely to be drawn into an Irish general election. I do not believe it had any significance in that sense, although it was obviously something the then Minister was anxious to produce.</P>
    <P>I do not need to outline to the Minister or the Taoiseach the importance of live cattle exports to Ireland.  By their own words they have identified this issue as their priority, but what effective action have they taken since coming into office last June?  As far as Irish farmers are concerned they have done nothing and that is a severe indictment of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The Russian ban on the export of carcase beef from seven Irish counties continues.  While gladly acknowledging the recent reduction from eight to seven counties, it is a minimal return from a Minister <Col N="254" /> who had invested so much apparent effort and energy in this high priority area for him and the Government.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours on this issue, but farmers expect him to achieve more sooner rather than later.  As long as a ban remains in respect of any Irish county, third country exports will be rendered much more difficult.  Our competitors are not slow to use the ban to further their ends and to damage exports of Irish live and carcase beef.</P>
    <P>The Minister's failure to date to secure payment of national compensation of £17 million to beef producers is inexplicable.  That £50 slaughter premium was announced by his predecessor at a meeting in the Red Cow Inn on 23 April last.  I understand that at that meeting Deputy Walsh described the payment as much too little and much too late, but five and a half months later not one penny of this national compensation has been paid to hard hit beef producers.  I spoke to my colleague, Deputy Yates, about this matter and he is in no doubt that he would have been able to deliver on this commitment if he were still in power.  He further stated that he received a personal assurance from the Farm Commissioner, on the margins of the April Council meeting, that the Commissioner would not oppose the payment of national compensation in this case.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, and given the high priority afforded by the Minister to this issue, it is incumbent on him to negotiate and obtain immediate clearance for the payment of the promised £50 slaughter premium to beef producers, at a cost to the Irish Exchequer of £17 million.</P>
    <P>On the issue of installation aid for young farmers, given the unequivocal Fianna Fáil undertaking to Macra na Feirme, to which I have already referred, how can the Minister or his Government maintain any credibility with young farmers? They naturally assumed the Fianna Fáil commitment to the continuation of this scheme meant what it said, but they have been cruelly and cynically deceived.  I call on the Minister to try to reverse this disgraceful decision to renege on such a solemn and clear-cut undertaking to young farmers, and to restore this scheme immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained some of the reasons for the discontinuation of the aid from 7 August in his reply to my question yesterday.  However, it has caused a great deal of cynicism in the minds of young farmers, many of whom I met at the ploughing championship.  They cannot believe this Minister, for whom they have a high regard, would cynically remove that scheme, irrespective of the reasons.  I ask him to look at that again.</P>
    <P>The final subject to which I will refer is the question of support for those grain growers who have experienced such a disastrous harvest this year.  This is the issue of which I have most knowledge because of my involvement in that business. However, given the present climate, I emphasise to the Minister that I have no personal interest in what I am asking him to do because I was <Col N="255" /> extremely fortunate &mdash; rather than skilful &mdash; in having nothing but winter feed barley which was harvested in July and were, therefore, free of the problems to which I will refer.</P>
    <P>Grain growers, especially in Counties Cork, Waterford and Wexford, were devastated by the continuous rain and wind which persisted throughout most of August and much of September. Many crops were badly lodged, sodden, sprouting and, in some cases, totally unharvestable. Ground conditions were appalling, more akin to midwinter than late summer.  In the southern counties few can remember such unfavourable conditions.  In addition, the prices available to grain growers are way down on last year, in fact, they are the lowest in 20 years.</P>
    <P>This double tragedy of a disastrous harvest and rock bottom prices is destroying the livelihoods of many grain farmers, especially those dependent on grain for their sole or main income.  It is no exaggeration to describe the situation as a crisis and, furthermore, a crisis outside the control of those suffering the consequences.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances, it is the duty of the Government to look with sympathy on the plight of these unfortunate people, especially when a booming economy offers the means to offer some tangible assistance.  There are precedents for a sympathetic and practical response to weather made calamities.  When disastrous floods struck the west in 1994-5 and again in 1996 in the Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir areas I was directly involved as Minister responsible for the Office of Public Works in obtaining disaster aid from the EU and matching funds from my Government colleagues.  That was not easily achieved, especially the EU funding element.</P>
    <P>While the present situation is not identical it has clear parallels as the essential cause of all these events is excessive rainfall.  I have no hesitation, therefore, in asking the Minister to seek financial assistance, both from the EU and his Cabinet colleagues, for the worst affected grain farmers whose incomes have been demonstrably devastated this year.  I am not asking him for a blank cheque but rather a focused and targeted response to those whose incomes have been so damaged as to clearly jeopardise their livelihoods and future viability in farming.  Teagasc can easily identify such farmers and focus any funding on those in the most obvious need of support.</P>
    <P>In addition to direct financial assistance for the worst hit victims I strongly recommend the following proposals.  First, prompt payment of area aid to grain farmers, at least 90 per by mid-October and the balance by the end of October. Second, Government matching funds with EU revaluation aid.  This would cost the Government approximately £3.8 million, which in the circumstances of the 1997 harvest is more than justified. Third, the brief to Teagasc should be extended to look at grain growers other than those whose crops were unharvestable.  I understand the original instructions to Teagasc were to look at and <Col N="256" /> concentrate solely on farmers who could not harvest their crops.  Some farmers tried desperately to harvest practically unharvestable crops and they should not be outside the net.  Finally, the possibility of providing Government subsidised very low interest long-term loans for the worst affected grain growers to get themselves off the floor should be considered.  Again, this could be carefully targeted by Teagasc.</P>
    <P>These measures when taken together can offer hope and practical assistance to the worst hit grain growers, many of whom without such assistance cannot and will not survive in business.  I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to these proposals and I look forward with anticipation to his response.</P>
    <P>Farmers need a Government and a Minister who understands and shares their concerns and who will take decisive action on their behalf. Judged on that criteria and on the stated priorities of the Government, the performance of the Minister and the Government has fallen far short of the expectations of farmers.  I await with interest the Minister's response to the points made by my colleagues and me in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Ring.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He is an old hand and I wish him well.  I appreciate he is in a difficult position and people who do not understand that do not understand agriculture.  I am sure the Minister hopes to be in Government for some time but that does not appear likely today.  That is politics, but if the next 100 days are as bad as the first 100 days for the Minister, farmers are in for an awful time. The Minister is not new to his portfolio but since he took office matters have been particularly bad for farmers.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the atmosphere at the National Ploughing Championships which the Minister attended last week.  There was huge anxiety among the 150,000 people who turned up at that event about their futures and the Minister did not escape without being told about it.  The current concern revolves around the problems with the Egyptian live trade market.  Before the last general election the Minister and other current members of the Cabinet said the then Minister, Deputy Yates, was the only reason live cattle were not on their way to Egypt.  The case was made at the time that serious negotiations were under way but the current Minister specifically stated that if he was at the helm, live cattle would be in Cairo.  He said he would ensure that was the position as soon as he returned to office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dithered for the past four months and there is no sign of live cattle going to Egypt.  Sources in the trade tell me all the Minister took from Cairo last week was a lollipop.  He was told there would be a trial shipment.  I hope I am wrong but I understand now that even the trial shipment might not work.  What has gone wrong?  Deputy Coveney outlined the letter which arrived in the Department on election day. <Col N="257" /> If it was intended for inclusion in the election manifesto, it was pointless receiving it on election day.  Obviously, the letter meant what it said.  Will the Minister outline why the Egyptians do not want our cattle?  Why are we unable to negotiate a deal which is vital to this country?</P>
    <P>The Minister has approximately two weeks to resolve this matter before the factories pull the price back to 80p.  I am severely critical of what has occurred with regard to the factories. Although the current position is bad, there is no reason every meat processor in this country should not pay a flat price of 85p.  As days pass and it is obvious to the factories that the live trade will not operate, I guarantee the price will be reduced to 80p in a fortnight.  This is the point the factories want to reach.  The only hope of saving farmers from meat processors is to ensure the ships start sailing.</P>
    <P>If a man deserves credit, he should receive it and I congratulate the Minister for securing Exchequer funding for the roll-on roll-off service. I hope it will work for that service which is most important to my area in terms of the weanling trade.  There is no need to remind the Minister but in my lifetime I have never seen the price of heifers so low.  I attended a number of the western marts this week and the prices were deplorable. The only way to change that position is to ensure a live outlet, particularly for weanling heifers.</P>
    <P>Regarding the £70 million made available last year from the Exchequer by the former Minister, Deputy Yates, it is one thing to get clearance from the European Union to pay its money but it is a different matter when a pip squeak in Brussels decides that the Exchequer cannot pay money to our farmers.  I understand an expert in Brussels stated that the proposed payment of £50 per head was too much.  When the collapse occurred in June, there was a difference of almost 10p a pound in prices between one Monday morning and the next.  The loss to producers of heifers over a certain weight was £45-£50 per head in mid 1996.  It is bad enough that the experts in Brussels should claim the subsidy is too great but what is overlooked is that the same farmers a year later were hit twice as badly and there is no reference to compensation.  Will the Minister inform the officials in Brussels that those who suffered a loss of £50 per head in 1996 are losing £70 on their heifers this year.  Irrespective of what those officials say the Minister should not accept that the compensation is too great.  It is the greatest load of codswallop I have ever heard and this was pointed out by every farmer at the National Ploughing Championship.</P>
    <P>On the question of installation aid for young farmers I know the Minister has a soft spot for young farmers as I have seen him in action as Minister for Agriculture in a previous Government. I do not know the reason the Government decided to withdraw this aid.  In reply to a question yesterday the Minister said a body was set up to advise him and the previous Minister on <Col N="258" /> installation aid.  He said it became known to this expert group that it did not appear the payment of the installation aid helped the transfer of farms.  I would like to know who was the author of that.  I cannot understand how the withdrawal of £5,600, at the point where young farmers incur the greatest expenditure in their lifetime, would mean there would be the same level of farm transfers.  This is a kick in the teeth to every young farmer at a time when everybody here and in Europe is talking about mechanisms to keep people on the land.  If that is our answer to keeping people on the land, God help them.</P>
    <P>On the export of cattle, I reiterate what Deputy Coveney has said.  I recall being involved when the former Minister introduced the new restrictions and new conditions on ships sailing the high seas with Irish cattle.  There was a good reason we should have a high standard since the Compassion in World Farming people were clamouring to close down the whole show.  It appears that for short journeys to Europe the vessel, <i>The Caroline,</i> could do the job.  While I am not a technical expert I understand there is a problem with the roll of the vessel and while it meets international criteria it does not meet our criteria. Anything the Minister can do on that issue would be welcome.</P>
    <P>For the past couple of months I have made a case that where possible, given the plethora of payments, headage, premium, etc.  from the Department of Agriculture and Food, an effort should be made, in a year of low cattle prices, bad weather, and when grain farmers were affected, to pay the full amount on the due date.  I thank the Minister for doing that and I understand it is his intention to pay the full headage due to farmers in the next couple of weeks.  This will help those who are buying cattle and it will improve confidence in the trade.</P>
    <P>As to quality assurance, the Minister should ensure that the scheme is farmer friendly and other professions will not make money on the backs of farmers.  As spokesman on food I want to be sure the quality of the food placed on the tables of consumers in Ireland and across the world is never in doubt on the basis that it came from Ireland.  However, I do not want others piggybacking on the farmers and getting more out of this than the farming community.  I call particularly on the Independent Deputies, most of whom come from rural constituencies, to send a message to the Government that not enough is being done for agriculture.  They will have an opportunity to do that this evening at 8.30 p.m. The internal squabbling in the Cabinet and the problems that have beset the Government are no reason to crucify farmers.  The Minister has much to do.  Unless he comes out fighting on behalf of farmers they will judge him harshly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish the Minister the best of luck.  I feel sorry for him, having listened to the rumblings of his leader last week when he told farmers to be patient.  How much patience does <Col N="259" /> he think farmers have?  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevey, did not send out a positive message either.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister when I say farmers are saying they wish Deputy Yates was back as Minister because at this time we need a strong Minister to get officials here and in Europe working to resolve our problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the present Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Brian Cowen at public meetings in this city, and my own colleagues at county meetings in Mayo, spoke about what they would do for farmers so, although I was disappointed not to be back in Government after the election, I thought that if Fianna Fáil did only half what they said they would do when they were in Opposition, life would be easy for rural Deputies.  We are getting messages from the Taoiseach and from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, but there is no action on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Food. Nearly three months passed before the Minister went to Egypt to try to open the Egyptian market, a market that is causing great concern within the farming community.  If this market is not opened factories will have a monopoly, and we know what the factories did to farmers, large and small, when they had a monopoly.  If this market is not opened the factories will do as they have done during the past few weeks; they will stop killing for a few days to ensure a glut with a resulting drop in the price of cattle.  It is time the Minister took on the factories and this very important market in Egypt was opened.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulty of the Minister's job.  Some Members of the Dáil and other people outside the Dáil tell us they do not want to see the live cattle trade opened.  These people have no investment in agriculture.  They do not know how hard people in rural Ireland have to work. Our beef is the best in the world and should be sold as organic beef because farmers have responded to what they were asked by Europe and by our Department of Agriculture and Food. If someone invests so hugely in agriculture, it is wrong if, when they come to sell their product, there is not a good price.  Farmers tell me that prices now are worse than they were ten years ago and that the industry is nearly dead.  That has not happened in any other industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae tells us that he will be saviour of rural Ireland.  I hope he will walk through the lobbies tonight with us in Fine Gael and the other Opposition Deputies and show the Government that we are not happy with what is happening to farmers throughout this State.  The Minister should invite the delegations from Egypt, Russia and other markets to return to show them we have the finest beef in the world. I was informed recently by somebody who went to Cairo on holiday that Irish beef received bad publicity.  Therefore, we have a PR job to do.  If there is one thing politicians and departmental officials are good at it is that they know how to <Col N="260" /> handle the media and issue press releases.  I compliment our judges for not being lenient in dealing with the cowboys who have tried to destroy an industry which we have worked hard to build and on which many people depend.  They should be put behind bars.</P>
    <P>Each time a new case of BSE was reported &mdash; I raised this issue at a committee meeting well before the election &mdash; the image of a staggering cow was shown on RTÉ.  Following representations RTÉ agreed to remove it.  It was bad publicity, this was the image shown on television in Egypt and Russia and on video by those campaigning here against live exports &mdash; certain political parties and individuals who have no interest in agriculture.  The only piece of grass they have to worry about is the grass they have to cut on a Saturday afternoon.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for taking steps to improve the position in relation to the roll-on roll-off ferry.  Like Deputy Connaughton, I come from the west where weanling producers are encountering major problems in selling their stock.  There is a need to reopen markets to avoid a glut.</P>
    <P>When there was severe flooding in the west, particularly in north Mayo, the Minister did not respond well.  Whenever there was a crisis during the term of office of the previous Minister, Deputy Yates, he responded.  The IFA and other farming organisations did not give him the credit he deserved.  They now realise that he was a strong Minister and wish he was still there at what is a crucial time for farmers to fight on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Beef producers were promised £17 million from the Exchequer.  However, the European Union has instructed us not to pay this money. This is a serious matter.  The farming organisations may not like this but major protest marches were organised to this House at times when there was no need to do so.  Now is the time, at a time of crisis, that farmers need help and support and a strong Minister to fight on their behalf. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, do not seem to be taking the matter too seriously.  Last week the Taoiseach asked farmers to be patient.  For how much longer must they be patient?  I will watch the Independent Deputies tonight.  I will not have them saying in their constituencies that they support rural Ireland when they have an opportunity tonight to vote in support of rural Ireland and farmers. Farmers need support.  I will be watching Deputies Healy-Rae, Ó Caoláin and Fox and I will issue a statement on that tomorrow.  I hope they will vote with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, recognising the threat to many farmers' incomes this year, supports the Minister for Agriculture and Food and <Col N="261" /> the Government in their efforts, since coming into office, to maintain farmers' incomes, to reintroduce live exports to the EU and third countries; to improve access to the Russian market for carcase beef; to secure the approval of the European Commission for the payment of national compensation to beef producers and to seek ways of assisting grain producers who were seriously affected by recent adverse weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the beef industry has gone through a very difficult period over the past 18 months since the announcement in the House of Commons on 20 March 1996.  It has been a very sensitive time for An Bord Bia and the food industry as we market beef throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Virtually all problems which have beset the industry since have emanated from that announcement, which led to an immediate and dramatic fall in beef consumption in the EU, and in our most important worldwide markets.  Fortunately, the situation has improved gradually, particularly among Irish consumers.  Beef consumption in Ireland has returned to pre-20 March 1996 levels and it is also recovering in EU States.</P>
    <P>A number of measures were introduced by the Council of Ministers last October in the context of mini-reform of the beef sector.  The more important measure relates to the two calf slaughter schemes.  These were designed to divert one million calves per annum from beef production and recent indications are that these measures will achieve that objective.  Approximately one million calves have been slaughtered under the calf slaughtering scheme in the past 12 months while a recent Commission report estimates that the early marketing premium for veal calves will increase the number of calves used for veal production by approximately 300,000 head.  Given the nature of beef production in continental Europe, it was always expected that the effect of those measures on beef production would not be seen for approximately 18 months.  There is now evidence that beef production in the UK and continental Europe is beginning to decline as a result of these measures.  There are expectations in the United Kingdom particularly that the combined effects of the calf slaughtering scheme and the over 30 months scheme which has removed 1.73 million animals since the beginning of the scheme will result in higher beef imports to the UK in 1998.  This means that three million animals have been taken out of the system in these schemes.</P>
    <P>The combination of the recovery in beef consumption and the decline in beef production has substantially improved the balance in the EU beef market.  This is reflected in the substantial decline of sales into intervention in recent months.  The vast bulk of beef now sold into intervention comes from two member states: Ireland and Germany.  The improved balance in the European market is of dual benefit to the Irish beef industry.  First, it creates market opportunities which have not existed since the beginning of the BSE crisis in March 1996.  I do not <Col N="262" /> accept that the renationalisation of the European market since that crisis began makes it more difficult than previously for the Irish beef industry to exploit these market outlets.  Nevertheless, there is now a significant opportunity for the Irish beef industry and I have every confidence in the ability of our industry to exploit the situation.  Our exports to the EU market are expected to increase by some 40,000 tonnes this year in comparison to 1996 and this represents substantial progress in difficult circumstances.  We have a minimal BSE incidence in Ireland but it is there. We have increased exports to the EU, which is the most difficult market in the world.  Because of the slaughter schemes which have taken three million calves out of the system, there will be increased opportunities from the beginning of next year.  We have the immediate difficulty of getting over this autumn, which we are addressing.</P>
    <P>The priority of our beef industry is to expand and strengthen our presence in the European market.  It is reasonable to assume that further progress can and will be made in the next year as beef production continues to decline in the EU as a result of the slaughtering schemes.</P>
    <P>The second benefit of the improved balance in the EU beef market is that it will relieve pressure on the third country markets on which we are particularly heavily dependent.  One negative effect of the BSE crisis in the last 18 months has been the substantial increase in competition between member states for third country markets as they sought to offload their increased surplus on these markets.  However, because of the decline in production due to the slaughter schemes, other member states who were in competition with us will not have the same numbers of cattle.  The inevitable result of this competition was a sharp fall in prices on third country markets. While competition on these markets remains strong, there are indications that it is becoming less severe, and this is evidenced by the gradual increase in third country prices.  Prices in Russia, for example, have increased by $400 per tonne in recent months.  Reduced competition on third country markets should also reduce pressure on the GATT ceiling on subsidised exports. That is another problem with which we have to contend, as it makes matters more difficult for us in these important markets.  However, we have a further opportunity because of the balance in the EU.</P>
    <P>Exports to third country markets are supported strongly by export refunds.  For example, prime Irish beef is purchased in Russia and Egypt at 15 and 19 per pound.  One would not get beef in Ireland at that price.  The balance is made up by substantial export refunds.  It was disappointing that the Commission considered it necessary to reduce export refunds last month to dampen down demand for export licences.  It was pleasing, however, that the Commission sought to minimise the impact of the decision on Irish beef producers by confining the 10 per cent cut to female <Col N="263" /> animals and, in so far as it was possible, to beef from female animals.  Given that most of our beef exports to third country markets come from steers, the impact of this cut should be minimal on cattle prices.  Nevertheless, the reduction in export refunds was unnecessary and I will press the Commission to pursue alternative strategies regarding compliance with GATT limits rather than relying simply on reducing refunds.</P>
    <P>Following two years of disuse, the intervention system has become an important element of the market support system since the BSE crisis began in March 1996.  It is very likely that it will continue to play an important role in supporting the market, at least until the end of this year.  I was pleased that, at a recent meeting of the Beef Management Committee, the Commission extended the current intervention arrangements to the last quarter of this year.</P>
    <P>This will permit cattle of up to 360 kg weight limit, with the important O4 grade, to be taken in, thus allowing up to 50 per cent of steers to be eligible for intervention.  So far this year the EU has accepted almost 50,000 tonnes of our beef, which is 21 per cent of the EU total.  While it is not in our long-term interest to be dependent on intervention, I am satisfied that it is used by the industry only as a last resort and it is necessary for market support, particularly during our peak disposal period.  However, there are good grounds for believing that the improved market balance in the EU will significantly reduce the need for intervention next year and that the Irish beef industry will substantially increase its presence on EU markets.  This will enable us to put in place the best foundation for further development into the next century: getting out to the marketplace and the consumers.  We have sent 40,000 extra tonnes to the EU this year despite being under the cloud of BSE, and this augurs well for the future.  It shows that the industry and An Bord Bia are doing excellent promotional work.  Other countries with BSE have been kicked out and kept out of various markets.  In contrast, Ireland has done relatively well in the important markets world-wide.</P>
    <P>While there has been an overall improvement in cattle prices compared to this time last year, prices remain below those which prevailed before the BSE crisis.  Bord Bia's <i>Market Monitor</i> of 4 October 1997 compares last week's prices with those of the same week in 1996.  Prices for steers &mdash; the continental type &mdash; Friesians, Herefords, heifers and cows are about 2p to 3p per pound higher this year than they were the same time last year.</P>

      <P>I will not do what my predecessor did last year.  He went around the country, talked down prices and pressurised farmers into selling cattle for less than they were valued.</P>
      <P>The lower prices are due to a combination of factors which are well known.  The balance in the EU market is beginning to improve.  These developments combined with an effective intervention system offer good grounds for optimism that cattle prices should at least be maintained at current levels in the short-term with the medium term outlook for gradual improvement in prices. Prices this autumn are better than would have been predicted a few months ago and current prices are better than at this time last year.</P>

      <P>This country exports cattle and beef to 60 countries world-wide.  Due to the extremely low incidence of BSE and the effectiveness of our controls trade is continuing normally to a wide range of international markets, although a number of countries have imposed BSE related restrictions.  I pay tribute to our inspectorate, departmental officials, assurance schemes and the disciplines in the system for this.  The removal of these restrictions is a matter to which I am giving the utmost priority.</P>
      <P>Egypt, which was an important market for live cattle, has been closed to imports from Ireland since the beginning of January 1997.  A commitment, in principle, was given by the Egyptian authorities, as was stated in the letter from them read by Deputy Coveney.  On election day, my predecessor stated clearly that the market would open in a matter of weeks.  There was no basis for that statement because as was stated in the letter, the commitment, in principle, was subject to conditions that had to be taken on board.  That was not emphasised given that it was election day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to resolve the problem of restrictions.  As soon as I came into office, I contacted the Egyptian authorities and as a result, two delegations of senior officials from the Department and veterinary inspectors visited Egypt in August.  Members of the delegations voluntarily interrupted their holidays to make those visits during August and I express my appreciation to the officials concerned. During those visits many of the veterinary requirements for the resumption of trade were agreed and a package of proposals was offered, including assistance by the industry here on the removal of specified risk material.  The latter was important in terms of allowing the Egyptian authorities to provide the same type of health guarantees <Col N="265" /> available domestically and to consumers of Irish beef in the EU.</P>
    <P>Final agreement on reopening the market was delayed mainly due to increased concerns in Egypt relating to food imports generally, particularly bad press in relation to food and food scares.  A number of our publications were photocopied and sent to Egypt which did not do the position of Irish officials or that of our trade any good.  Once the technical difficulties had been overcome, I visited Egypt and met the Egyptian Deputy Premier and Minister for Agriculture, Dr. Wally, in Cairo on 28 September.  I also met the Minister for Trade and Supply, Dr. Goweily.  As a result of my meetings, during which I got a clear understanding of the Egyptian concerns about live cattle imports, the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment subject to certain conditions.  A detailed proposal for such a shipment is being formulated by the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with the Live Cattle Exporters Association for consideration by the Egyptian authorities.  I hope a trial shipment, properly controlled, will convince the Egyptian authorities to reopen the market fully to live Irish cattle imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Egypt is one of our most important markets for beef exports which have increased substantially this year.  On my visit to Egypt, the Egyptians said they had stopped importing live cattle since 1 January 1997 but they had increased the amount of beef they were taking from Ireland.  They took 30,000 tonnes in 1996 while in the first half of 1997, they took 30,000 tonnes. Some 30,000 tonnes is roughly the equivalent of 100,000 head of cattle.  In the remaining six months of this year, they will take a further 30,000 tonnes.  In the full year, they will take 200,000 head of cattle.  The additional 30,000 tonnes is roughly the equivalent of what they took in live cattle in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Egyptians said they were taking our beef because they recognised its quality; they had no difficulty with it and were extremely pleased with it.  They said they were taking our beef because it was processed in Irish plants, that they were confident about quality because Irish and EU consumers were eating the same beef and they wanted no less than that available to Irish and EU consumers.  However, they were unhappy about live cattle.  Their problem with live cattle, which we sought to resolve, is that they contain the risk material associated with BSE which lodges in the brain and the spinal cord.  The risk material is taken out in Irish factories so they have no difficulty with beef.  We said we would put in equipment in Egyptian factories to take out the risk material, the brain and the spinal cord. They said they had one further difficulty, that when the live cattle come into Egypt, a small number are not included in the system in their <Col N="266" /> transportation to plants and so on.  Therefore, they are concerned that those live cattle would get into their herds, causing them difficulty.  Since we had the advantage of processing cattle within the country, having jobs in our factories here, as well as added-value, they could not understand why we would want to transport live cattle, taking the jobs and added-value to Egypt.  That is a fairly complex problem to solve.  We continue to make the case that live cattle export is vital to competition with the factories.  That is the position and the reason we shall continue to do everything possible to ensure that the live trade is reopened and will continue.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that Egypt is an enormously important market and takes a considerable amount of beef and live cattle equivalent at present.</P>

      <P>This week we are submitting proposals regarding transshipment.  It is like trying to sell any other product.  For example, in a supermarket if you want a whole shelf filled with your product, you might never get a market niche there whereas if you took a corner of a shelf, and it is proven that consumers are happy with the product, you would then seek to increase your percentage share of that market.  It is our hope and expectation that the same thing will happen in this case.  I must emphasise that even if you were only selling a second-hand bicycle, you need to convince a potential purchaser that it is a good bicycle since he or she must take the decision to purchase.  Similarly, we seek to sell live cattle to Egypt and those who must take the decision in regard to the contract are the purchasers.  We are seeking to convince them in every possible way that they will be getting the best possible product, prime Irish beef.  We shall continue to encourage them by providing equipment for the risk material as well as quarantine arrangements.  We are literally turning ourselves inside out to encourage them to take that decision.  Nonetheless, at the end of the day, to use the old cliché: one can take an animal to water but cannot make it drink &mdash; we are dependent on the Egyptian authorities to take the decision.</P>

      <P>Another important market for our live cattle exports is Libya, which imposed a ban on our imports in March 1996.  Shortly after returning to office I contacted my Libyan counterpart as a follow-up to the visit here of a Libyan technical delegation earlier this year. Since then contact has continued at diplomatic level.  I intend to visit Libya as soon as appropriate arrangements can be made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring referred to people inside and outside this House who were not in favour of the live trade.  There are a few people prominent in a number of parties in this House who have expressed publicly their opposition to the live cattle trade.  I am in favour of the live cattle trade and am working diligently day and night to have that market reopened, as it is a vital element of our industry.  I do not accept the argument of spokespersons and Members of political parties opposed to the live cattle trade who speak out against it.</P>
      <P>Russia is another important market.  To date this year Russia has taken 40,000 tonnes of beef, the equivalent of approximately 125,000 head of cattle.  The Russians imposed restrictions on our beef imports in November 1996.  Following a recent delegation, led by its deputy Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Scherbak, I was particularly pleased that the first easing of restrictions on that market was achieved.  Anybody who had discussions with the Russian's chief veterinary officer, Dr. Avilov, will be aware that they are quite tough negotiators.  The Russians take a considerable quantity of our beef, a percentage I expect to increase.</P>
      <P>Contacts with other markets which have imposed BSE-related restrictions continue to be maintained by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and An Bord Bia.  I am pleased to report also that Qatar indicated recently it will lift its ban on Irish beef, subject to certain conditions. This will mean that all our markets in the Gulf will be open to Irish beef with the exception of Oman.  A technical delegation from my Department will be visiting that market next week.</P>
      <P>My objective is to ensure that all remaining restrictions are removed.  I am confident this can be achieved and that An Bord Bia and the industry will maintain the momentum of its promotional effort in those markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to live exports to the Continent, extremely important to our industry, mentioned by several Members.  When I returned to office I had been hearing of and given assurances in <Col N="268" /> relation to ferry services for the live cattle trade, in particular that P &amp; O Ferries, Pandoro, would continue its service.  That has not been the case as that service with the exception of pedigree cattle, was terminated during the summer.</P>
    <P>Irish Ferries had been providing a service up to the end of last month which necessitated my having to obtain an alternative service from the beginning of this month.  I was happy that the Government accepted my proposal that finance be made available for the provision of this service. Subject to clearance from the European Commission, I have identified a vessel and a proposal for support which clears the way for that vessel to sail, subject to EU approval within a matter of days.</P>

      <P>In relation to European Union approval of national compensation to beef producers, and the reference to the payment of £17 million, I was at the Red Cow Inn on 23 April last and, of course, encouraged my predecessor to have it paid as quickly as possible.  On 6 June we had a general election, followed by a change of Government, so that a fair amount of time elapsed, yet that payment still had not been made.  Why was it not paid?  The answer was that it was subject to EU approval in the case of my predecessor over those months and revolved on me on assuming my present portfolio.  Eventually we got the European Union Commission to accept a proposal which must now be endorsed by the relevant Commissioner.  I expect those payments to be approved also within a matter of days.</P>
      <P>I accept the difficulties experienced with the grain harvest this year and that Deputy Coveney is not engaging in any special pleading on his behalf.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address this issue which concerns an industry of fundamental importance to the Irish economy.  I do so from the perspective of being constructive and not engaging in the negative politics which was so pervasive in this Chamber during the period the last Government was in office.  I appreciate a certain amount of politicking will be engaged in but when it reaches the absurd it is time to call a halt.  I have never engaged in that type of behaviour nor do I intend to do so.  This issue is too important to the farming community and the industry must be treated with the respect it deserves.</P>
      <P>I recall the discussions held and submissions made by farming organisations when I was a member of the subcommittee on EU legislation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in relation to the agricultural aspects of the GATT and the implications for Ireland of that agreement.  It was clearly stressed that because of the importance of beef to the Irish economy and the dependence of the Irish beef industry on exports, particularly on exports to non-EU countries, the problems arising from this particular agreement were magnified for Ireland.  All of us understood that.</P>
      <P>Let me illustrate this point.  Beef is 11 times more important to Ireland's economy than to the overall EU economy.  Only 12 per cent of Irish beef production is consumed in Ireland which means that almost nine out of every ten animals produced here have to be exported.  Ireland, therefore, is the most vulnerable of all the EU countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a particularly high dependence on beef exports to non-EU countries.  While this country accounts for less than 7 per cent of total EU beef production, we account for almost one quarter of EU beef exports, and we are the largest net exporter of beef to third country markets in the EU.  I make these factual observations to indicate that we were all well aware that the combination of the reformation of the CAP and the new GATT would impact on beef prices, and it was for this reason that the new subsidy regimes were put in place to help compensate for these reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture remains the most important sector in our economy and it is especially critical to the well-being of rural communities.  Agriculture, food and forestry account for approximately 14 per cent of GDP, 175,000 direct jobs or 13.5 per cent of the workforce, and over a third of our net <Col N="270" /> foreign earnings come from the trade.  Farming and related industries are the bedrock of many rural communities.  Approximately 85 per cent of total gross agricultural output is derived from livestock which is clearly the highest figure of any member state in the European Union.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are deeply committed to maintaining the maximum number of farm families and to do so by providing and securing the necessary supports to facilitate the competitive output of high quality products at farm level and at the processing and marketing levels.  We would also support the focusing and targeting of structural and market supports to achieve those aims.</P>
    <P>I support the live export trade without ambiguity. I come from a county where dry stock production is the main source of income on 80 per cent of farms.  In the past ours was a major winter finishing county with large investments made in shelter accommodation.  Over the past two years, however, this has become unprofitable and losses have been incurred.  That has had a devastating effect on beef producers and the wider industry. In the midland counties, some winter fatteners saved up to £20,000 last year by not going back into that area.  While that is fortunate for the farmers involved it will have a knock on effect down the line, and many people suffered as a result of those decisions.</P>
    <P>While it is obviously desirable to have as much value added as possible to our primary products at processing level, and in the process create much needed jobs, it should also be recognised that competition in the beef sector, which is afforded by the live export market, is critical in relation to cattle prices paid to 100,000 Irish cattle producers.  It directly improves their income and employment viability and indirectly helps to maintain the fabric of the rural economy in which they live.  That issue is very close to my heart and that of my colleague, Deputy McGrath, as we both come from a rural constituency.</P>
    <P>Dr. John O'Connell from the Department of Agribusiness and Rural Development at University College Dublin, in a paper prepared for the Irish Livestock Exporters Association, indicated that the price and revenue enhancing effect came about for three main reasons.  First, because of increased competition engendered purely by the extra numbers of buyers of cattle when there is a strong live trade.  That is the reason my colleagues stated it is critical to reopen the livestock export trade to Egypt over the next two or three weeks, although one mart manager told me that he would fill that trial shipment before 12.30 p.m. I appreciate the Minister is doing his best but I am merely outlining the magnitude of the problem. In the next three weeks we will also have the trough: peak ratio, which is so prevalent and which the Minister knows about coming from the dairy industry.  Factories will be waiting to drop cattle prices by 3p and 4p per pound which will start the cycle again and result in a negative impact on farming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> The second reason given by Dr. O'Connell is a preference in most countries, which has grown stronger since BSE, for beef which is stamped as having been domestically produced.  That is another positive effect on the live export trade. The third reason given is the fact that the live trade serves distinct demands in certain countries for home slaughtered fresh beef which cannot be served by the factory sector.  The Minister made reference to that also.</P>
    <P>The opening of these markets is not simply a matter of getting on an aeroplane, a view echoed by the Minister and some of his colleagues when in Opposition.  I did not become involved in the negative aspect of that debate, and my contributions in this House reflected that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a simplistic view of how these matters operate and clearly indicated that their sole motive was to gain short-term political advantage by embarrassing the efforts of the then Tánaiste, my party leader, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, rather than engage in constructive, co-operative politics where the vital national interest was at stake.</P>
      <P>I remember my party leader being vilified in this Chamber and Members did not have any opportunity of redress.  I knew he was doing his best at that time because I was with him on those occasions.  I have a strong background in farming and agriculture, and thank God some of my constituents recognise that, but I could not understand the reason for some of the detrimental statements made in this House &mdash; the Minister referred to those in his contribution.  Remarks made in this House or elsewhere may inhibit the Minister as he goes about his work.  I appeal to all speakers in this debate to be constructive and to remember that in this age of the Internet, statements made in this House are known in other countries within minutes, and they have an impact.</P>
      <P>We do not need platitudes or meaningless gestures to reopen the market but painstaking efforts at a technical level to reassure the relevant authorities in Egypt, Iran, Russia and elsewhere about the safety and quality of Irish beef.  I recall the commitment given by the Minister in the Red Cow Inn.  I was present and I must admit it was a tough place to be, particularly for a Labour Party Deputy, with 1,000 baying farmers looking for what they thought was their due funds.  I answered the questions as they were put to me.  I did not shilly-shally.  I told the truth and I am proud of that.  People in the farming community are discerning and educated.  They are not fools and they know when they are being sold a pup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his efforts in regard to the roll on/roll off issue which is critical to the weaning end of the beef industry, particularly in the west.  An auctioneer told me last <Col N="272" /> Monday night that if this does not come about, the west will be destroyed.  There is a vessel available in Cork, the <i>Caroline</i>, referred to by Deputy Coveney.  The Minister's experts will know more about this matter but I understand there is a problem in relation to Statutory Instrument No. 17 of l996, the Disease of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Order.  Perhaps the Minister might examine that with a view to addressing the problem because heavy cattle must also be shipped out.  I appeal to the Minister to instruct his officials to examine chapter 1, section 1, paragraph (h) of that Statutory Instrument in relation to the minimum roll period.  I realise we must have the highest standards in regard to the transport of animals but we should examine this order to see if it could facilitate a trial voyage.  It would not cost the Exchequer one penny &mdash; we are normally looking for money from the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the difficulties encountered by grain farmers, I estimate that between 2,500 and 3,000 hectares of grain crop were unharvestable.  There are also the high moisture content problems and additional losses associated with the crops which were harvested.  This means a gross loss for grain farmers of £20 to £25 million.  Thirteen inches of rainfall was recorded in south Leinster and Munster during August.  Farmers in counties Cork, Wexford, Waterford and Tipperary were badly hit.  While there was also high rainfall in County Westmeath it is not a large grain growing area: we buy much of our grain from the Minister's county. Bringing forward the arable aid payments of £91 million would be a help to grain farmers.  The financial institutions could also make a direct contribution to those farmers who have been worst affected.  While financial institutions never have a negative return, farmers often have negative returns.  It may not be possible under EU law to divert resources from financial institutions in this way but consideration should be given to my proposal.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the issue of installation aid at Question Time yesterday.  I do not want to politicise this matter but many young farmers are in limbo in this respect.  Young farmers who have plans ready to be signed by the agricultural adviser or chief agricultural officer have a legitimate expectation that they will receive aid.  If I was in the same position as these farmers I would take the Department to court.  One cannot cut off a scheme in mid stream and dash expectations. Under the scheme the maximum grant was £5,600.  There are approximately 25 young farmers in County Westmeath affected by this decision.  It is important to maintain these farmers in rural areas.  Many farmers say they cannot get a son or daughter to take over the farm.  Yet these young farmers who have the necessary training and qualifications and have plans ready for signature are being severely hit.  I went to college with the brother of the Minister for Finance.  He is an agricultural adviser and can tell the Minister exactly what is involved.  I would be surprised if <Col N="273" /> he did not do this as he was always a great man for practicalities.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his policy document gave a commitment to ensure support for the highest number of family farms and to achieve a more equitable distribution of support payments by reforming the direct payments scheme.  I can see where the Minister is coming from in this matter and I support him 100 per cent.  Why should more than 70 per cent of income support payments be directed to fewer than 30 per cent of farmers? There is something wrong with the system and it must be looked at.  The Minister should listen to those organisations which make submissions on this matter.  We must ensure that these payments are directed to farm families who do not benefit at present.  There are approximately 43,000 farmers with ten suckler cows or less.  If we want to keep these farmers on the land the level of aid they receive must be trebled.  We should tell the EU we can handle our affairs and will distribute the money ourselves.  The Minister will have the support of the Labour Party if he does this.  The Department has made no effort to address the problem.</P>
    <P>A problem which is exercising the minds of farmers and members of local authorities is animal waste management.  The relevant legislation in this area is the European Communities (Disposal, Processing and Placement on the Market of Animal By-products) Regulations, 1994, which transpose EC Directive 90/667 into Irish law, and the Diseases of Animals Act (Specified Risk Material) Order, 1997, which was introduced in response to the BSE crisis.  The only plant licensed to take specified risk material is Monery By-Products in County Cavan.  At present the extra costs have to be recouped from farmers.  Westmeath County Council has asked to meet the Minister to explain the problems in this area.  If knackeries are forced to close down because of extra costs it will create further problems and lead to illegal dumping etc.  I appeal to the Minister to meet the council which will outline the problems to him.</P>
    <P>On rural development, we must introduce an integrated strategy which focuses on a rural renewal concept which ensures that the problems of rural areas are addressed in a meaningful way. I have called for the implementation of a rural renewal scheme similar to the urban renewal scheme.  Under this scheme special taxation incentives would be granted to entrepreneurs and business people who locate much needed industry in rural areas.  To ensure that the drift from rural areas is halted &mdash; approximately 5,000 people leave the land every year &mdash; we must have a more focused approach which encourages investors and promoters to locate their industries in rural villages and towns.  Since we joined the EU in 1973 policies affecting rural areas have been largely determined by EU requirements.  In the area of agriculture and rural development we have relied too heavily on EU schemes and have not <Col N="274" /> developed a vigorous rural development policy suited to our needs.</P>

      <P>Under the orders of the House, which continue to baffle and disturb me, two of my parliamentary questions were disallowed. The first question asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food his views on the prospect of the early lifting of the Russian ban on carcase beef from the named seven counties.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister secures the lifting of the Russian ban on carcase beef sourced in the named seven counties.  It is patently obvious that a new arrangement for Russian veterinary inspection is required.  The Russian market accounts for a quarter of all beef exports.  If everyone faced up to their responsibilities and pulled together we could substantially increase the 130,000 tonnes of beef sold to that market in 1996.  I hope the Minister can give farmers, their families and all those who recognise the central importance of agriculture within the economy an assurance that this ban will be lifted.</P>
      <P>My second question asked the Minister to give details of the efforts by him and his Department to date to ensure immediate, full and unrestricted access for full live cattle exports to Egypt and Libya.  Previous speakers did not exaggerate when they referred to the level of public concern at the failure of the Government &mdash; I believe it is the fault of successive Governments &mdash; to reopen the Egyptian market for live cattle exports.  Other opportunities would clearly follow if this market was reopened.</P>
      <P>The apparently laid back and laconic approach adopted by the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues merits criticism, challenge and continuous prompting.  I sign up to all three of these.  The efforts by some Deputies this morning to regain the high moral ground in all these matters lacks credibility.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Penrose for affording me the opportunity to speak and I commend him on his declared positive approach to this problem.  We must recognise that all farmers are not fools and we must work together in their interests.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) A word or expression that is used in this Act and is also used in the Convention, the 1996 Protocol or the 1997 Protocol has, unless the contrary intention appears, the meaning in this Act that it has in the Convention, the 1996 Protocol or the 1997 Protocol, as the case may be.</P>

    <P>The amendment proposes the insertion of a standard interpretation clause.  It seeks to repeat the exercise used in the Liability of Defective Products Act, 1991.  Its purpose is to ensure there will be no ambiguity in the interpretation of the Bill and where there is any ambiguity that we refer back to the Convention and the Protocol as our points of reference.  I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for her amendment which primarily concerns a drafting issue.  The type of wording proposed is sometimes used in legislation where a large amount of a Convention has been restated in a Bill.  I understand from the parliamentary draftsman's office that it is not considered necessary in this case because there is nothing in the Bill which would warrant it.  The Convention and the two Protocols will be given the force of law as provided for in section 2.  In the circumstances I am not prepared to accept an amendment of this nature and I trust the Deputy understands the position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (3), line 22, before &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;Criminal Assets Bureau and the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment because it is important to learn from our past mistakes in relation to the lack of co-ordination between different State agencies in tackling crime and from our good experience over the past few months since the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  I am sure we would all accept that it was not until that agency was established with all its powers, including its capacity to draw expertise from other relevant agencies, that we started to get to grips with our crime problem.  Unless the Bill is amended as I suggest, a difficulty will arise at some future point when we will need to provide for the inclusion of members of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the national unit.  For that reason I suggest the Criminal Assets Bureau should be specifically mentioned as the pool of important and relevant people from whom members should be drawn for the national unit.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I agree with the thrust of Deputy Shortall's argument.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been one of <Col N="276" /> our success stories in tackling crime.  From the point of view of interaction, co-operation and co-ordination, the blending together in one office of all the agencies that deal with various elements of crime and possible areas of crime management highlights that there should be as much co-ordination as possible between them.</P>
      <P>We have for the first time ever, a mass exodus of criminals from this jurisdiction.  Criminals are on the run as never before.  They have gone to ground overseas and elsewhere because their assets are being seized and their ill gotten gains, their motivation for committing crime, are being taken from them.  There is a crying need for maximum co-ordination to avoid possible conflicts, duplication or triplication of work and to ensure there is maximum cohesion that is relevant and evident from the point of view of tackling crime.  There is a good deal of merit in this amendment and I ask the Minister to give it serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The objective of Europol is to improve the effectiveness and co-operation of the competent authorities in member states, which are responsible for preventing and combating crime.  Europol's initial remit will cover unlawful drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trade in human beings, motor vehicle crime and cases where there are factual indications that an organised criminal structure is involved and two or more member states are affected by the forms of crime in question in such a way as to require a common approach to the scale and consequence of the offences.</P>
      <P>The national units will be involved in transmitting and receiving information from Europol.  The increased flow of information which will result from the establishment of Europol will assist in the detection of crime and in the identification of major criminals and should be of assistance to the Criminal Assets Bureau of the members states. The position is that while Europol will do very worthwhile work in tackling major crime it will not deal with the seizure of assets.</P>
      <P>The expertise which will be required in respect of members of the national unit will not be the same as that required in respect of members of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Also, the expertise required in the national unit may change over time as Europol's remit is extended.  The wording in subsection (3) and the proposed section 3(6) as set out in amendment No. 4 provides the flexibility to allow for the assignment of personnel to the national unit most suited to the task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances I ask Deputy Shortall to withdraw her amendment.  I take her point about the importance of co-ordination between the various agencies, such as the Garda and the Customs. Amendment No. 4 is intended to cover the concern expressed by Deputy Shortall.  I again commend the Criminal Assets Bureau, which undoubtedly has done outstanding work since its establishment and continues to do so.  While I <Col N="277" /> fully understood the points made by Deputies Shortall and Higgins, I trust it is accepted that the amendment cannot be taken for the reasons outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the comments of other Deputies and support the Minister's work. However, Deputy Shortall's point about the co-ordination of the various services is a good one. We all know the Criminal Assets Bureau has done a magnificent job.  Its creation was probably the single most successful anti-criminal measure taken in this House in many years and it has scared the wits out of the criminal element which we want to eliminate.  Al Capone was not charged with murder or racketeering &mdash; he was caught by the US Internal Revenue, the equivalent of our Revenue Commissioners, and sent to prison for tax offences.  There is much to be said for co-ordination between the Revenue and the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned co-operation between various states.  In my Second Stage contribution I mentioned extradition, although the Minister did not refer to it in his reply.  His initial Second Stage contribution referred to extradition between Ireland, Canada and South Africa, but why can the infamous drug barons now living in London, Amsterdam and the Costa del Sol not be extradited back to Ireland?  It is incredible that they can still mastermind the activities of their Irish gangs from those locations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's arguments.  He has given no reason for not accepting this amendment.  In the past, the gardaí had great difficulty bringing prosecutions against known criminals because of their cleverness in conducting their affairs and the difficulty in proving their involvement in serious crime.  Now, with the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, an individual's tax or social welfare record can be checked because of the involvement of the relevant agencies.  It is on those grounds that criminals can be brought to book or sufficient pressure put on them to force them to leave the country.  A number of points have been well made in this respect, in particular about the capture of Al Capone, as this was the principle on which the Criminal Assets Bureau was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of the bureau is much more than the seizure of assets.  If a person leaves the country as a result of pressure brought to bear on him through the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau, there may not be enough evidence against that individual to request his or her extradition.  Nonetheless, given the information which the Criminal Assets Bureau may have against that person, it should be possible to pursue him or her.  Rather than allowing cases to develop where it is difficult to acquire or exchange information on the business activity or family circumstances of criminals and it becomes necessary to draw up new legislation, we should include the Criminal Assets <Col N="278" /> Bureau at this point to give the Minister sufficient flexibility to include those persons so that background information on them can be made available. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to including the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to Deputy Deasy's question about extradition, I understand that a new treaty dealing with this matter was signed during Ireland's recent Presidency of the EU and I have no doubt this will assist this matter.  In response to Deputy Shortall, I emphasise that while Europol will do useful work in tackling major crime, it will not deal with the seizure of assets because that is not within its remit.  I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment because it would provide a specific reference to the Criminal Assets Bureau when Europol will not be dealing with the work done by the bureau.  I appreciate the point made by Deputies Shortall and Deasy but Europol will not be dealing with the seizure of assets and therefore it would be quite inappropriate, to say the least, to involve the bureau in the way suggested by the Deputy.  I assure her that, in so far as any amendments are introduced which will assist in the co-operation between authorities in tackling crime, I will be only too happy to accept them if they can be put into effect.  In this instance, I regret I cannot accept the amendment for the reasons outlined and I trust she understands that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. Higgins (Mayo) Mr. Higgins (Mayo)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I still find it difficult to accept the Minister's rationale.  In setting out the purposes of the Bill, the explanatory memorandum states that the crimes within Europol's initial remit will include unlawful drug trafficking, trafficking in nuclear and radioactive substances, illegal immigrant smuggling, trade and traffic in human beings, motor vehicle crime, and related money laundering activities.  One of the successes of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been its tackling of money laundering, so the Bill specifically deals with an area which comes directly within the remit of the bureau and is one of the platforms of its success.  I ask the Minister to again consider this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the Minister's remarks about amendment No. 4 and I thank him for it.  I said on Second Stage that this Bill, like many others, uses broad discretionary language &mdash; that is, it frequently uses the phrase &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo;. However, from the viewpoint of co-ordination it is important to include the Customs and Excise authorities, because they are specifically trained in the detection of many of the goods brought within the context of this Bill.  Even before the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the most successful operations were joint operations, either surveillance or direct action, involving members of the Garda drugs unit and the Customs and Excise authorities.  Those authorities have a nose for detecting wrongdoings in particular goods or substances, they should be included <Col N="279" /> within the terms of the Bill and I thank the Minister for doing that.</P>
    <P>In amendments Nos. 4 and 6 he is providing for the possibility of membership of the Customs and Excise authorities by a Europol liaison officer.  If the Minister accepts the amendment on the Criminal Assets Bureau he would be including the Customs and Excuse authorities because they are within the structure of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  He should accept the thrust of the proposed amendment because it makes sense and underpins the principle of cohesion, co-operation and co-ordination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the experience of the recent past where two major criminal figures, namely, Mr. Gilligan and the person known as The Boxer, are before the courts for crimes they are alleged to have committed in other jurisdictions.  Were it not for the fact that they committed crimes in another jurisdiction it would not have been possible to extradite them back to this country.  It should be possible to extradite people who leave this jurisdiction because they are under investigation by the Criminal Assets Bureau and go to live in the Costa del Sol and elsewhere.  The extradition application would be presumably based on information compiled by the Criminal Assets Bureau. I see no reason for the Minister not accepting this amendment.  It would not tie anybody's hands and would not restrict the operation of the legislation. I intend to press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Higgins's point, the appointment of a Customs and Excise officer to the national unit will be one of the first matters I will address on passing this legislation.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments in that respect and take them seriously because involvement by the Customs and Excise is of fundamental importance.</P>
      <P>I fully understand Deputy Shortall's intention is to strengthen the legislation, but Europol is not involved in the seizure of assets.  The exchange of information which will result from the strengthening of Europol can, and no doubt will be utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau in hunting illicit assets of criminals.  In this respect the principal vehicle used by the Criminal Assets Bureau is the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which I introduced on behalf of my party in Opposition.  That Act provides for the freezing and subsequent disposal of illicit assets without the need for a charge, let alone a conviction.  I suspect information gathered by the Garda in the normal course of its work is utilised by the Criminal Assets Bureau in making applications to the courts.  Similarly, I anticipate information made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau through Europol will be utilised to hunt down illicit assets of criminals in this country.  The entire philosophy behind Europol is to ensure there will be as high a degree as possible of exchange of information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> I ask the Deputy to accept that the Criminal Assets Bureau will unquestionably have the opportunity to utilise the information made available to it with a view to ensuring illicit assets are frozen and, if possible, subsequently disposed of to the Exchequer or in accordance with the other provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment because Europol will not be involved, in the foreseeable future, in the seizure of assets.  For that reason it would not be appropriate for me to involve the Criminal Assets Bureau in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great time for the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.  His appointment is a breath of fresh air and he is very good at his job, but I often wonder about the likelihood of Ministers being led by civil servants.  Deputy Shortall's proposal is highly reasonable.  The Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners should work together.  Six, seven or eight years ago there were many problems with the importation of drugs because the Garda and the Revenue Commissioners were pulling against one another.  It was publicly known there was rivalry as to who should be in control of surveillance off the coast. That rivalry apparently allowed criminals to escape and shipments of drugs to come into the country undetected, which was abominable.  It is reasonable to expect the two bodies should work together in harmony.</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he severely criticises the lack of activity on the part of the Revenue Commissioners.  They need the expertise of the Garda Síochána to work effectively in detecting and prosecuting people who have so-called invisible assets and are clearly living beyond their means, such as drug barons and people involved with them in laundering money, people with houses worth £1 million, cars, racehorses and all the trappings that go with that, whose income seems to be negligible or who are virtually on social welfare income.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out a deficiency in that area.  There needs to be a tightening up in that regard, and the Garda working with the Revenue Commissioners could plug that loophole.  The Minister should agree to a far more pertinent and constructive attack on crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: By way of clarification &mdash; perhaps the Minister is not in a position to give this information &mdash; in terms of the composition of Europol, what is the experience in other countries where this convention has been transposed into domestic law?  Has the equivalent of the Criminal Assets Bureau been included in its membership?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Assets Bureau, which is consequential on the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, is relatively new.  As far as I can recall, only one other country, the United <Col N="281" /> Kingdom, has ratified the Europol Convention and, therefore, I cannot assist Deputy Higgins in terms of precedent on the international stage.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for his kind comments, particularly from a person as experienced and enlightened as him &mdash; I am not involving myself in a back-scratching exercise.  Section 3 deals with the designation of a national unit within the Garda Síochána.  The designation of a national unit will not involve the creation of an entirely new unit.  A unit already exists in Garda Headquarters to liaise with the Europol drugs unit. Under the legislation the Minister is empowered, following consultation with the Commissioner, to designate a unit to be known as the national unit which will subsequently operate under the control of Garda superintendents.  Deputy Deasy and others should note that it is within the remit of the Garda Commissioner to assign as many members of the Garda Síochána to the national unit as he sees fit.  Likewise, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Finance, may appoint as many officers of the Customs and Excise and others who are not members of the Garda Síochána to the unit as he sees fit.  It should be clear to Members that the commissioner, in so far as the Garda is concerned, and the Minister, in so far as Customs and Excise is concerned, have the power to appoint to the national unit members of the Criminal Assets Bureau or people who may subsequently be appointed to it.  The legislation is open ended and gives the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Finance the power to appoint to the national unit people who are or may in future be members of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for the concerns of Deputies Deasy, Shortall and Higgins.  It would not be appropriate to specifically include the Criminal Assets Bureau in the legislation when, under the terms of the convention or the legislation ratifying it, Europol will not be involved in freezing or seizing of assets.  I hope my comments have allayed Deputies' fears about the possible exclusion of the bureau.</P>
      <P>The question of co-ordination in so far as the enforcement authorities are concerned has been referred to frequently by Deputies since I became a Member of the House more than a decade ago. I have a deep understanding of this matter and respect the points of view expressed.  In the light of my comments, I ask Deputy Shortall to accept the current proposal as being the best way forward.</P>

      <P>The Minister persists in making great play of the Proceeds of Crime Act.  While I am sure all Members accept the importance of that legislation and acknowledge the Minister's role in putting it on the Statute Book, his emphasis on it implies a lack of understanding about the reason we have been successful in tackling crime <Col N="282" /> in recent months.  This success is based on the new approach to crime adopted by the Criminal Assets Bureau, appropriate inter-agency co-operation. The Garda did not have information on revenue or social welfare matters and Revenue and Department of Social Welfare officials did not have the Garda protection to pursue the individuals concerned.  It was the co-ordinated approach adopted by those agencies to criminals that resulted in our recent success in tackling crime.  The Minister said Europol information can be relayed to the Criminal Assets Bureau, but if we are to pursue criminals in other jurisdictions there must also be a mechanism by which information held by the Criminal Assets Bureau can be relayed to Europol.  In the past agencies were expected to work together but problems arose regarding data protection.  To ensure these problems do not arise in the future the Criminal Assets Bureau should be specifically included in the legislation as an agency from which representatives can be drawn for the national unit.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (6), lines 30 to 34, to delete paragraph (a) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a) The Minister, after consultation with the Commissioner, the Minister for Finance and any other Minister of the Government as the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances and, in relation to officers of customs and excise, with the Revenue Commissioners, may, from time to time, appoint such and so many persons who are not members of the Garda Síochána to be members of the national unit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with Government amendments Nos. 4 and 6 and the Opposition amendment No. 7, which is in the name of Deputy Shortall, together.  These amendments relate to the appointment of non Garda members to the national unit and the sending of non Garda members of that unit as liaison officers with Europol.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 replaces section 3(6)(a). This proposed amendment differs from the existing wording, in that it includes provision for consultation with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the appointment of customs and excise officers to the national unit and provision for similar consultation with any other Minister whose staff may be assigned to the national unit.</P>
      <P>These consultation provisions are necessary for two reasons.  They take account of the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are independent of the Minister for Finance in the exercise of their functions and in the disposition of their staff. They also cater for a situation where other expertise is required in the national unit arising, for example, from a possible extension of Europol's remit to include other crimes listed in the annex to the convention, such as illegal trafficking in body parts, hormonal substances and other growth promoters or in endangered plant and animal species.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 provides for the replacement of section 4 with a new section.  Unlike the previous wording, it provides in subsection (2) that the nominating function in respect of members of the national unit, other than members of the Garda Síochána, who may be sent to Europol as liaison officers will be as follows &mdash; on nomination of the Revenue Commissioners, in the case of customs and excise officers, or on nomination of such other Minister, if any, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day considers appropriate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="284" /> Similar to amendment No. 4, this amendment takes account of the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are independent of the Minister for Finance in the exercise of their functions and in the disposition of their staff, and caters for a situation where expertise, other than Garda or customs and excise, is required in the national unit.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment also includes at the beginning of subsection (1) the additional words &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2) and the Convention&rdquo;. I have already explained the reference to subsection (2).  The reference to the convention is included because article 5 of the convention provides that the number of liaison officers who may be sent by member states to Europol will be laid down by unanimous decision of the management board.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7, which was tabled by Deputy Shortall, provides for the deletion of &ldquo;or members&rdquo; from section 4(1).  Government amendment No. 6 already deletes these words and replaces them with the words &ldquo;one or more than one member&rdquo;.  While we have at present only one liaison officer, this number could be increased in future.  As I have already mentioned, the number of liaison officers who may be sent by member states to Europol will be laid down by unanimous decision of the management board. Some member states already have more than one liaison officer.</P>
    <P>I am only surmising this, but it is possible that Deputy Shortall may have in mind the provision in the Interpretation Act, 1937, which states that every word importing the singular shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the plural.  The parliamentary draftsman has advised that the wording proposed in amendment No. 6, that is, &ldquo;one or more than one member&rdquo;, is necessary.  In those circumstances, I respectfully request Deputy Shortall to withdraw her amendment.</P>

One of the singular badges of Irish success over the early years of our involvement in the United Nations was the fact that Irish military personnel, flying under UNIFIL, UNSO and so on, distinguished themselves and brought great honour to this country.</P>
      <P>The development of the concept of using members of the Garda, whether in Bosnia or Cyprus, has also brought great honour and distinction to Ireland.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Defence for two and a half years I had the pleasure of seeing in Cyprus, Israel and other areas of operation of Irish forces overseas, the manner in which the Garda Síochána have distinguished themselves wearing the blue beret of the United Nations.  The manner in which members of the Garda are sought by the United Nations for duties on the ground and supervisory officers and have gained promotion in the ranks has been a source of considerable satisfaction to all of us.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: On Second Stage I laid emphasis on the need for maximum data protection. It is of the highest importance given that, on the one hand, the interchange and exchange of information is crucially important from the viewpoint of combating and coping with crime while, on the other hand, a balance must be struck between the effective use of information and the aspect of confidentiality and the need to ensure that the information in question does not get into the wrong hands or the wrong domain.  This underlines the need for the maximum possible safeguards and guarantees.  The Bill is to be commended. It takes considerable measures to ensure that the maximum confidentiality is maintained from the point of view of using information.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks.  It is important that the system not be abused and I assure him there are safeguards to ensure this.  These relate to the standard of data protection restrictions on access to data by users of the system, rules regarding the use of data, time limits for storage and deletion of data files, security measures to prevent unauthorised access and an arrangement whereby each national supervisory body has an overseeing role.  An independent joint supervisory body will have the task of ensuring that the rights of the individual are not violated.  That is of considerable importance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> The purpose of this amendment is to require the Government to make a new declaration to allow all courts in this country to refer issues to the European Court of Justice, as provided for under paragraph 2(b), rather than just allowing the Supreme Court and other courts where there is no appeal to do so.  This will strengthen the legislation and I ask the Minister to give consideration to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1996 Protocol determines the conditions under which the Court of Justice of the European Communities may have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation of the convention.  It allows member states to accept such jurisdiction by making a declaration which may specify that such jurisdiction will be in accordance with either paragraph 2(a) or paragraph 2(b) of the Protocol.</P>
      <P>It is important in this context that I highlight the difference between paragraph 2(a) and paragraph 2(b).  Paragraph 2(a) of the 1996 Protocol provides that only those courts or tribunals of the member states concerned against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, may request the Court of Justice of the European Communities to give a preliminary ruling on a question raised in a case pending before it and concerning the interpretation of the Europol Convention if that court or tribunal considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment.  Paragraph 2(b) provides that any court or tribunal of the member states concerned may request the Court of Justice of the European Communities to give a preliminary ruling on a question raised in a case pending before it and concerning the interpretation of the Europol Convention if that court or tribunal considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment.</P>
      <P>The difference, therefore, is that where a state opts for paragraph 2(a), only those of its courts or tribunals against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law may request such rulings, whereas if it opts for paragraph 2(b), any of its courts or tribunals may make such a request.  Ireland made a declaration in 1996 when agreeing to this Protocol that paragraph 2(a) of the Protocol and not paragraph 2(b) would apply and the wording of section 10 of the Bill reflects this.</P>
      <P>Ireland at that time opted for paragraph 2(a) in view of the serious difficulties which could arise under our legal system if criminal trials had to be suspended for lengthy periods while rulings were obtained from the Court of Justice of the European Communities.  The difficulties would be particularly serious in the case of jury trials.  In other words, we want to ensure, in so far as we can, that there will be as little disruption as possible to the progress of a criminal trial once it has commenced.  All would agree that is a desirable objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> For these reasons also, Ireland exercised a similar option regarding other conventions involving criminal matters, for example, the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities Interests.  For the reasons I have I outlined I am, therefore, not in a position to accept an amendment of this nature.  I trust Deputy Shortall will understand my position.</P>

      <P>Given that we are an island State, that we have hundreds of miles of coastline, that we have a limited amount of fishery protection vessels which are also supposed to do a certain amount of drugs surveillance and that there is a danger in such a situation that Ireland has been, is being or will be used as a depot for the distribution of drugs to the wider European market, is it proposed to make the argument at European level that it is in Europe's interest to give Ireland assistance in terms of protection of our coastline to try to intercept and abort the dropping of drugs in Ireland and the use of Ireland as an international distribution point or depot?  Given also that it was the theme for our EU Presidency in 1996 and that we have been enormously successful in dealing with drugs and the interception of drugs within our jurisdiction it is in Europe's interest to try to see the argument for making funds available to assist us in even greater vigilance and greater protection of our coastline.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  There is no doubt Ireland's peripheral location as an island nation adjacent to mainland Europe means that it should receive special attention in so far as the fight against drug trafficking concerns our EU partners. It is something I will raise at EU level when the opportunity arises.  Nevertheless, the information which will come into the country arising from the implementation of the legislation ratifying the convention, which will be replicated in other states, will be of considerable benefit to the authorities in hunting down perpetrators of the various crimes covered by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred previously to the number of visits to the regions and I welcomed the fact that the Ombudsman and his staff travelled to Galway, Waterford, Cork and Limerick.  I was surprised that the number of complaints received by the office in 1996 was 3,181.  I thought the figure would be higher.  People would have greater access to the Office of the Ombudsman if it was more widely advertised on local radio.  Approximately 40 people work in the office and it has the facility to deal with complaints.  The public, particularly in rural areas, should have easier access to the office.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman's point in his report that FÁS, voluntary hospitals and vocational education committees should come within the remit of the legislation governing his office is most important.  It is difficult to understand why FÁS and the Health and Safety Authority, which were previously under the Department of Labour, were not included.  It is time to take up the Ombudsman's recommendation to include those bodies.</P>
      <P>I increasingly use the Office of the Ombudsman although I was once reminded by a party leader that every Deputy is an ombudsman.  It is no reflection on the Government that from time to time Deputies make inquiries of the Office of the Ombudsman on behalf of constituents.  The public also uses the office and I hope more people will do so in the future.  I recall a case when the first Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, was in office.  I could not get a satisfactory resolution to a query concerning what was then called the prescribed relative's allowance, now known as the carer's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man was refused the allowance because he was told that as a small farmer he did not have enough time to look after the elderly person involved.  The then Ombudsman, Mr. Mills, indicated that because the farm was so small and the man received social assistance anyway, he should be entitled to the allowance.  This gave me greater confidence in the role of the Ombudsman and I have raised many issues over the years with the office, particularly with regard to social welfare problems.  Regarding the carer's allowance, many carers are now lobbying strongly that they should be entitled to some time off.  The regulations governing the scheme are very strict and people qualifying for it are supposed to provide care 24 <Col N="290" /> hours a day to a relative.  I would welcome an investigation of that area by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>A striking aspect of the report is the delay in dealing with issues brought to the attention of various bodies by the Ombudsman and his staff and their frustration in securing redress for complainants. The Ombudsman gives the example of a farmer who waited 17 months for a decision relating to a cattle headage grant.  Many public representatives have had the same experience in terms of trying to get a decision.  I had a case a number of months ago concerning school transport. Although the Department accepted there was a sufficient number of pupils, that they were the correct ages and the correct distance from the school, it said it could not be sustained for a number of years and refused to sanction the school transport scheme.  It took the Ombudsman 12 months to get the Department to agree to provide a service.  Thankfully, it is now in place but the case highlights the problems encountered by public representatives.  The Ombudsman refers on a number of occasions in his report to the frustration involved in waiting for decisions and particularly in getting documents from Departments to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>Many cases relating to local authorities are mentioned in the report.  For example, my local authority, Galway County Council, did not accept that it was responsible for the flooding of a person's home.  It took many months to reach a compromise where the council agreed with the Ombudsman's proposal to pay half the cost of the damage caused by the flooding.  The sum involved was £3,000 and it was a major achievement by the Ombudsman.  The report might appear as problem pages in terms of the issues highlighted.</P>

      <P>As the member state holding the EU Presidency it is for Luxembourg in the first instance to propose topics for discussion at the Luxembourg European Council.  It is unlikely the Presidency will finalise its proposals in this regard until much closer to the date.  It is expected, however, the December European Council will debate the major proposals put forward by the Commission in its Agenda 2000 document, in particular the necessary decisions concerning the launch of the enlargement process. Other matters likely to arise at the Council include the fight against organised crime, including <Col N="291" /> drugs, EMU and the Union's external relations.</P>
      <P>Ireland's priorities for the European Council will be to ensure that the main challenges facing the Union at this time &mdash; the completion of the third stage of EMU and the enlargement of the Union &mdash; are satisfactorily progressed.  It will be important, in relation to the non-enlargement aspects of Agenda 2000, to ensure any broad orientations or priorities which the European Council may adopt take adequate account of Ireland's continuing development needs.</P>

In relation to the Deputy's concern, which has been mentioned in the media, there is no great difficulty at this stage but we have raised our concerns.  I will be meeting President Jacques Santer shortly and will discuss these issues with him.

Will the Taoiseach consider it would be useful to look at particular asymmetric shocks that could cause a problem in the early years of the euro, in particular, for example, a sudden increase in oil prices, to identify which parts of the Euro zone would have greater adverse effects from that than others?  I am not aware of any analysis being done on that point at this juncture but it is important that it be initiated.  Perhaps the Luxembourg summit would be an opportunity to initiate contingency planning against possible asymmetric shocks.</P>

      <P>The issue raised in the second part of the Deputy's question is a fair point.  In the early years of the euro there is still much uncertainty about what might and might not happen when the currencies are inextricably linked, how the world markets will look at a system that is moving speedily into the next millennium to the dollar, the yen and the euro.  I will certainly speak to the Minister for Finance about the studies already undertaken.  I am not sure if the studies outlined by the Deputy have been done but I will raise the issue.  In relation to the other question it is hoped to make substantial progress at the Luxembourg summit on what countries will move to the accession negotiations.  The larger countries are still divided in their view.  Five or six countries have been mentioned.  How the other four or five are treated and in what way they can all feel they are moving forward into some level of pre-accession negotiations over the next five years or so is a major issue.  Prime Minister Juncker, as President of the Council, is making strident efforts to resolve those issues this month and hopes to discuss them at the dinner and on the fringes of the employment conference <Col N="293" /> and summit and to move them to a decision in December.</P>

      <P>The next round of enlargement presents great challenges because the GNP of the ten applicant states together is equal to the GNP of one of the existing medium-sized states such as the Netherlands.  It also presents great opportunities and we, in Opposition, support the Government view on enlargement.  Will the Taoiseach raise at the European Council meeting our concerns regarding our cohesion status, Structural Funds and the common policies, in particular the Common Agricultural Policy, and the need to clarify the position for Ireland and other states in advance of the referendum here so that people will know exactly where they stand on those issues before they are asked to vote on the Amsterdam Treaty?</P>

      <P>It is likely that the discussions will have advanced to the stage of completion. The Structural and Cohesion Funds do not complete the present round for another two and a quarter years.  The proposals have just been published and debate has commenced on the issues. I do not see that these matters will be progressed, if at all, in Luxembourg but will continue to be discussed throughout the whole of next year.  The issues raised by the Deputies are of concern to us.  We are already putting down strong markers about cohesion, the CAP and the Structural Funds, and we have presented a detailed analysis of the Irish case.  The important issue for us is the objective one status.  The Deputy will know from Agenda 2000 that proposals have been put forward regarding the transition period which we are exploring.

      <P>My question relates to what Deputy De Rossa has just put to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach will recall that the debate surrounding the Single European Act was less than satisfactory because of the long delay and how it was handled by successive Administrations.  Let me reinforce the point made by Deputy De Rossa because the three or four parties represented in the House currently &mdash; I do not know the position of the Green Party &mdash; have a shared view on what is more of a mouse than a mountain in relation <Col N="294" /> to the Amsterdam Treaty.  The Taoiseach mentioned specifically the month of March.  If the local elections are to take place in the same year I strongly urge the Taoiseach to consider combining the two events on the one day.  There are reasons of cost &mdash; a referendum alone costs in the order of £6 million.  To commit oneself gratuitously to an extra set of costs does not make sense, unless the Taoiseach is making a decision with regard to the local elections.</P>

      <P>I met the new chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and a delegation of his colleagues on Wednesday, 1 October 1997.</P>
      <P>At the meeting I commended the increasingly common practice of mid-career public servants undertaking four years' study to acquire professional accountancy qualifications.  The commitment of such time will help to develop the skills and know-how to support the strategic management initiative, performance management systems, value-for-money analysis and other measures involved in public sector renewal.</P>

      <P>I remember a time when that view was held to be totally unhelpful because a centralised unit at the Department of Finance controlled everything.  The idea of having qualified accountants out in the system was considered to be a bad thing, and there was a practice of not approving accountancy posts.  I had some difficulty in my career many years ago in receiving approval for a post on that basis.  However, this has changed and now there are many accountants across Departments from all of the institutes.  This trend is growing and the CIPFA practice of trying to qualify more people in the public service is to be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As set out in the programme for Government, the Government is fully committed to the implementation of the strategic management initiative.</P>
      <P>On 29 July, as part of my address to the social partners at the second quarterly meeting on monitoring the implementation of Partnership 2000 in Dublin Castle, I announced the Government had established an implementation group drawn from secretaries general of Departments and heads of offices to drive the process forward within the Civil Service.  I will circulate copies of that address to the House with this reply.</P>
      <P>As I said in July, it is time to roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty to guarantee that the vision set out in Delivering Better Government is brought to life.  The implementation group has been asked to report on progress to the Government, through the overall SMI co-ordinating group, every three months.  I will also circulate the press release issued at the first meeting of the implementation group on 10 September.</P>
      <P>As a key element of SMI/Delivering Better Government, the Minister for Finance has commenced the Public Service Management Act, 1997 with effect from 1 September.  The Act, which was drafted and enacted during the lifetime of the previous Government, contains some important features which are central to the modernisation programme.  These include the preparation of revised strategy statements for Departments and offices by 1 March 1998 and the delegation by secretaries general and heads of offices of authority and accountability for the performance of functions to other officers.  Guidelines from the Government to Departments and offices on these issues are currently being prepared and will be considered by Government shortly.  In order to support these changes, a new performance management system is being developed and will be ready for roll-out early in</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> 1998.  Other changes, principally to financial management systems, will come on stream shortly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked about the structures in place to develop and implement the overall SMI.  In addition to the co-ordinating and implementation groups I mentioned, there are six working groups dealing with quality customer service, openness and transparency, regulatory reform, human resource management, financial management and information technology.  Where required, specialist subgroups have been established to develop individual elements of the overall change agenda. In addition, in the case of quality customer service, human resource management and information technology there are also front-line groups.  These groups have been developing the individual programmes of action in respect of their areas, which will in turn be brought together by the implementation and co-ordinating groups for consideration by Government.  I will circulate the information requested in relation to the membership of the groups and the number of meetings since 1 July.</P>
    <P>The next key steps in the implementation of the SMI/Delivering Better Government are: 1 November 1997 &mdash; the publication of quality service statements for Departments and offices; 1 January 1998 &mdash; roll-out of the performance management system throughout the Civil Service. Beyond that, the following are the key action points: updating of departmental strategy statements in line with the Government programme and changes in Departments' responsibilities by 1 March; delegation to and within Departments which clearly sets out authority and accountability at the different levels in accordance with the Public Service Management Act; producing Partnership 2000 action programmes for change; working with the National Centre for Partnership, particularly in joint management-staff and union training; arranging for the operation of the Freedom of Information Act from April 1998; setting and implementing a programme of regulatory reform; commencing the systematic public expenditure programme reviews based on outputs and results to be achieved and the actions to do so; implementing improved accounting systems to ensure greater effectiveness and transparency in the use of resources; and developing an action programme for information technology covering the developments in financial management, human resource management, quality service programmes, regulatory reform and to link with the work of the Information Society Commission.</P>
    <P>Continuing all-party support for the SMI will be a vital element in successfully implementing the radical change we are seeking.  I have recently written to the Opposition leaders to inform them of developments and to invite them to identify issues on which they wish to receive further briefing.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply.  Many of the proposals to which <Col N="297" /> he referred were on the table when his Administration took office.  The SMI has cross-party support and will continue to have the support of the Labour Party.  Until I receive a copy of the Taoiseach's reply detailing the frequency with which meetings have been held I am unable to comment on the sense of urgency which informs this Administration with regard to the SMI. Based on my experience in Government and on the contacts and friendships I have formed through interaction &mdash; this is inevitable in a city as small as Dublin &mdash; the SMI is waffle and gobbledygook from senior management so far as ordinary and middle ranking civil servants are concerned.  The Taoiseach referred to his address at Dublin Castle on 29 July and the first meeting of the implementation group on 10 September.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach realise, if one parses and analyses his reply &mdash; I appreciate he has been busy in recent days &mdash; that there is no sense of urgency in implementing the SMI?  Does he agree the public sector unions and middle ranking civil servants feel no sense of ownership and that if this is not acknowledged nothing will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his offer of continued support for the SMI on behalf of the Labour Party.  I was involved in the process from the outset and readily acknowledge that the Deputy drove it forward when he held the position of Minister for Finance.  I remind him that Ministers and officials tend to go on holiday during the month of August.  Meetings were held on 29 July and in early September.  One can see from this that action was taken speedily.</P>
      <P>The Deputy indicated the views of lower and middle ranking civil servants.  I will not repeat the words he used but that is the reason I established the implementation group.  The idea behind the SMI &mdash; I have a deep interest in public service management &mdash; is a very good one.  It is based on three simple objectives: the provision of an excellent service to the customer, maximising the contribution to the economy and national development and the efficient and effective use of resources.  It is no more complicated than that.  I am not blaming politicians or civil servants but one of the difficulties is that the more one talks about it and presents reports, strategy statements and documents the greater the chance people will forget what it is all about.  It will take some time for middle ranking civil servants and consumers to see the benefits.  The Deputy is correct that many civil servants see their role as responding to the crisis of the day but this is a different issue, it is about effecting change in the medium to long-term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will readily acknowledge that the purpose in establishing the working groups on quality customer service, regulatory reform, <Col N="298" /> openness and transparency, human resource management, financial management, information technology and so on was to convince more people at different levels that the SMI has value and meaning.  The more we involve them the better.</P>
    <P>There are a number of key dates.  Quality service statements for Departments and offices will be published in November.  This is normal practice in business but is not the case within the Civil Service.  On 1 January the performance management system will be introduced throughout the service.  That is the key element.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by a number of Members on both sides of the House that there should be a parliamentary group or a subcommittee of an existing group on the SMI.  I have an open mind about this.  It is a matter we could discuss on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that part of the problem is that, while the means of rewarding employees in the commercial world has changed through the payment of bonuses and the provision of incentives, structures remain unchanged within the Civil Service?  As long as public service structures remain the same, irrespective of how hard one works one must trudge through the whole structure and hope to one day have an interview for a small promotion.  In the meantime one is paid so long as one turns up for work.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose that the implementation group look at these areas of motivation in the public service to bring it into line with modern industry and business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That issue is being developed.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is right and that is why I have said the central issue is the performance management system.  When dealing with the Financial Services Clearing House Committee, this matter was raised by people who are paid enormous salaries we can only dream of, because the civil servant dealing with the committee had moved on due to a minor promotion and this inconvenienced the committee members greatly.  I will not name the individual concerned as it would not be appropriate, but Deputy Quinn can probably identify him. That is the system, and it has a lot of advantages in terms of keeping out corruption, but the downside is that often good civil and public servants are not given the advancement they would receive in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a former Minister for Labour, and I am conscious of other former Ministers for Labour being present, implementing that system into our industrial relations machinery is as difficult as it is for the Government to change the system.  The performance <Col N="299" /> management system is at the heart of making this system work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, when the Taoiseach mentions the performance management systems, is he alluding to performance-related pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The performance management system is the broader issue, but one aspect of this matter, as Deputy Barrett said, is some remunerative reward within the system.  I am conscious of the difficulties involved.  Deputy Quinn mentioned the feelings of workers and I do not disagree with him.  Workers in this area do not see any reason to put in the effort as they would in the banking, insurance or chemical industry.  That is the downside and I sympathise with those concerned, as I sympathise with many Members who are in the same system: no matter what they do, it is the same reward for everyone.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.</P>
      <P>Does he agree that Exchequer returns for the third quarter indicate that the Exchequer, by way of revenue buoyancy, will collect about £700 million more than was planned in the last budget by the then Government and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn?  In that context, are tax concessions in the forthcoming budget in the order of £500 million not very modest?  What is being proposed in effect is that money which the Exchequer and the Department of Finance never intended to collect would be restored to the taxpayer. Will the Minister confirm that in his approach to the budget the minimum tax concession on offer to PAYE workers will be £500 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of requests from inside and outside the House, Deputy Noonan will be aware that I have no intention of announcing my <Col N="300" /> budget proposals.  The overall tax package will be announced on 3 December, but commitments were given in Partnership 2000 that will be honoured. Commitments given in the joint programme of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will also be honoured.</P>
      <P>Regarding the revenue buoyancy in 1997, there is a mistaken impression given by commentators that an influx of money one year necessitates tax cuts the following year.  All that this year's increased revenue over the budget target will do is lessen, to a small degree, the borrowing requirements for the servicing of debts for 1998 and beyond.  The Department of Finance will estimate next year's revenue based on the outturn for this year.  That is all that influx does.</P>
      <P>I caution all Deputies regarding expectations for 1998.  They should look at where we have come from and examine the recent ESRI report published in the lifetime of the last Government, which suggested several reasons for the increase in economic outturn of the last few years.  One danger the report mentioned was raising expectations to a considerable degree.</P>

He should adopt the strategies of the last Government and expand the bands and increase allowances so that those on moderate and low income benefit.  The budget should not be perceived as only giving tax concessions.  Taxation should be seen as a lever for economic development.  The tax reliefs targeted as I suggest would have a far greater impact on the labour market.

      <P>This matter was last raised by Ireland at ECOFIN by Deputy Quinn.  At the November 1996 ECOFIN Council meeting, the Deputy called for an EU wide study to be undertaken by the Commission, but he had little support from our partners at that time.  The Commission has consistently refused to undertake an EU wide study, a position it repeated at a conference on duty free held in Brussels on 24 September at which the Minister for Public Enterprise gave a keynote address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the position of the Commission and the lack of support from our partners, it was decided that an independent study into the consequences for Ireland be undertaken by consultants who would report to the Minister for Finance.  I am pleased to confirm that following the tender procedure the Deputy started, I awarded the contract to KPMG Management Consulting.  This study <Col N="302" /> should be completed by the end of the year. When I have studied the report from the consultants I will consider the most appropriate action to take.  In the meantime, my colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, also intends to raise the awareness of the duty free issue with her colleagues on the Transport Council.</P>

      <P>The public has not been misled. Since the November 1996 meeting, there has been a change of emphasis in many member states on this issue.  As Deputy Quinn will know, this matter comes within the remit of the Commission.  If changes are to be put forward, the Commission must put something on the table.  A number of member states, including Ireland, are looking at this issue which gives some hope it may be raised again.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn, as Minister, commissioned a consultancy report, with which I agree, to give further ammunition to the Irish Administration in pursuing this case.  I appointed the consultants under the procedure outlined by Deputy Quinn and they will report by the end of the year when we will be in a better position to pursue our goals.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Minister for Public Enterprise may have inadvertently misled the public when she failed to draw attention to the fact that if the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, had exercised his veto in 1991 in respect of this matter, he would not face the problem which she has landed on his desk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>I do not accept that because matters have moved on since 1991.  As the Deputy knows, there are various opinions on this issue.  I hope my position will be strengthened when I get the consultancy study.  Other member states are also looking at this issue in a wider context and perhaps some of the difficulties envisaged in 1991 are not those we face today.  This matter is receiving more consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission has set its face against this. After the meeting in Brussels on 24 September, attended by the Minister for Public Enterprise, the commissioner in charge of taxation, Commissioner Monti, made strident remarks on the change in this area.  I would not like to mislead anybody into thinking that changing the route pursued by the Commission will be easy.  Other <Col N="303" /> member states are looking at this issue and without being overly optimistic, I believe the matter will be revisited.</P>

This is recognised in the Government's joint programme, An Action Programme for the Millennium, which states that public service pensions will be protected.

      <Quest>if his Department has yet received a reply from the Central Bank to its letter of 25 August 1997, in which his Department requested the bank to conduct a detailed investigation of the issues raised in the McCracken report in its references to exchange controls; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exchange controls existed in this country under the Exchange Control Acts which were in force from 1954 to 1992.  Day to day administration of exchange controls was delegated to the Central Bank by the Minister for Finance in 1965.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> My Department wrote to the Central Bank on 25 August last, the day on which the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry &mdash; Dunnes Payments &mdash; was published, asking the bank to instigate a detailed investigation of the issues raised by the references in the report to exchange controls.</P>
    <P>I understand from the bank that the investigation is well in progress and is being given priority.  However, in view of the volume of records to be examined and the need for the bank to consult a number of other banks, the process takes some time.</P>
    <P>I am advised by the bank that it expects to receive shortly the material required to finalise the reply to my request which will then be submitted to my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Taoiseach said when this matter was debated here before &mdash; and as I said in a press release &mdash; was that when these details are submitted to my Department, if there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of any breach of exchange control regulations, the matter and all documents relating thereto will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>In the debate here on the McCracken report the Minister indicated that his Department had written to the Central Bank on 25 August.  In the same speech he also indicated he would discuss the issue of tax evasion with the Revenue Commissioners.  Has he done so and will the Revenue Commissioners investigate the Ansbacher accounts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of separate questions later on in relation to the Ansbacher accounts to which the McCracken report referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already outlined the position with regard to this question.  My Department wrote to the Central Bank on the day the tribunal report was published and have had further communications with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank had hoped to report back to me by end September. However, the bank wrote to me quite recently saying it hoped to be in a position to supply all <Col N="307" /> information relating to the possible breach of exchange control regulations in the very near future.  The report of the McCracken tribunal said that two Isle of Man bank accounts for the benefit of Mr. Michael Lowry were contrary to the exchange control regulations then in force.  That section of the McCracken report and anything else relating thereto was forwarded to the Central Bank.  When I receive its report I will consider it and gladly lay it before both Houses of the Oireachtas unless, as I said, I am advised to the contrary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now saying something different, that the Central Bank is basing its investigation on payments made to Mr. Michael Lowry.  That was not what I understood to be the Minister's commitment given to this House on the day.  Will the Minister correct me if I am wrong, that his commitment was that the issue of possible breaches of exchange controls in respect of the Ansbacher accounts would be investigated by the Central Bank?  If I understand the McCracken report correctly Mr. Lowry was not paid through those Ansbacher accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Noonan read the report of the McCracken tribunal which said that &ldquo;two payments to Isle of Man bank accounts for the benefit of Mr. Michael Lowry were contrary to exchange control regulations then in force&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>No such statement was made in relation to anybody else.  My Department wrote to the Central Bank on 25 August saying:</P>
      <P>You will note that the report of the tribunal published today, copy enclosed, contains references to exchange control issues.  In view of the Taoiseach's statement today, attached, that the relevant State agencies should take all necessary action, I would like to formally ask the Central Bank to instigate a detailed investigation based on the bank's records of the issues raised by references in the report.  Your report on the outcome of this investigation, together with all relevant supporting information, should be conveyed to the Department as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

Am I to take it that the Minister has not met the Governor of the Central Bank and that he has not taken any proactive measures to uphold the tax laws of this country, and that the Ansbacher issue is considered to have been dealt with by McCracken?

      <P>The Minister said in reply to previous supplementaries that the sole references to <Col N="312" /> breaches of exchange controls in the McCracken report are in respect of offshore accounts held in the name of Deputy Lowry.  We are all fairly familiar with the McCracken report.  Deputy Lowry was not connected with the Ansbacher accounts in so far as McCracken established.  The Minister indicated to us when we debated this matter that he was raising it with the Central Bank and that the Central Bank was investigating the Ansbacher accounts.  I am now asking the Minister to confirm to the House that the Central Bank is investigating the Ansbacher accounts in respect of possible breaches of exchange controls.</P>

There is no specific reference to exchange controls in connection with the Ansbacher accounts.  The Minister will not inform us whether the Central Bank is investigating those.  He is simply saying that when the report comes to hand he will read it and will then be in a position to tell us.</P>

It is the responsibility of the Central Bank, on foot of the McCracken tribunal, to investigate those particular matters because the Central Bank was the organisation charged with monitoring exchange controls from 1965 to 1992.  The Central Bank will investigate all matters relating to exchange control breaches and when that has been done it will forward its report to me.

I accept that the Minister has an honourable record.  He then went on to say that as Minister for Finance he regarded this as the worst financial scandal in the history of the State. He heaped praise on the McCracken report which found, on any reasonable inference, that there are questions to be answered by the Central Bank in connection with foreign exchange control as it relates to these memorandum accounts.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister telling the House today that apart from the perfunctory letter from the Civil Service and until he received the question from Deputy Noonan he had done nothing practical to ensure that this important aspect of the McCracken report was pursued to the degree that it might reasonably be pursued?  The public regards this as one important dimension of this financial scandal and the Minister for Finance has done nothing to ensure that the logic of McCracken is pursued in respect of foreign exchange control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the long-standing policy of the Commissioners of Public Works to provide access facilities for disabled persons to public buildings in their care.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 1,300 public buildings in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works.  I am satisfied the majority of these buildings, in particular the larger and more recently constructed ones, have adequate access for disabled persons, including wheelchair users, old age pensioners and other categories of people.</P>
      <P>All new buildings and major refurbishments of existing buildings undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works are designed in accordance with the requirements of the building regulations with regard to access, including access for disabled persons.</P>
      <P>The commissioners recently undertook a survey of existing buildings which identified a wide range of works which were required to improve access for people with disabilities to some of the buildings in their care.  Arising from this survey, a specific programme of improvement works was commenced.  It is anticipated that £1,000,000 will be spent this year on improving access for disabled persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Is he aware a large number of the 738 Garda facilities do not have access for disabled people?  Will he indicate the number of Garda facilities that do not have such access?  Will he outline the number of buildings that provide access for those with sensory disabilities?  We hear a good deal about physical disabilities, but not so much about sensory disabilities, which includes those with hearing and visual difficulties.  In many cases there is no provision by the Office of Public Works for people with that type of disability.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works has been to the fore in ensuring buildings have access facilities for people with disabilities.  No other organisation has done as much in the recent past to keep abreast of these changes.  I do not know the number of Garda facilities that do not have access.  If the Deputy wanted such a specific answer he should have tabled a question on it.  I can assure the Deputy that access for the disabled is central to the development and design of new</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Garda buildings which is one of our biggest programmes with the Department of Justice.  There are difficulties in putting in older Garda stations access facilities for the disabled because of their original design, but there is a rolling programme of improvement which includes Garda stations to which the Deputy referred.  We will maintain that programme until such time as the totality of access to which he referred, particularly for those with hearing disabilities etc.  which are not as obvious as physical disabilities, has been put in place.</P>

      <P>Is it the Minister of State's intention to make the Chamber and the public gallery accessible for wheelchairs?  I have campaigned for such access for years.  It was not until Senator Crowley was elected to the Seanad that the House, including the Seanad Chamber, was made accessible for wheelchairs.  This Chamber and the public galleries are not accessible for wheelchairs.  Does the Minister of State not consider we should start to make progress in this area at home?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that with the external refurbishment of this building access has been provided.  However, I agree it is important that the most important forum for democracy should be accessible for all our citizens irrespective of their disabilities.  I am reviewing various programmes of development specifically in this area.  The Deputy can be assured I will consider and want to implement whatever changes are necessary to ensure total access at all levels to this building.  There are ongoing improvements of which the Deputy is aware.  There are some difficulties in providing access to certain listed buildings where it is difficult to find a compromise between preserving the facade of the building and providing access.  We are conscious of that problem and try to overcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general positive thrust of the Minister of State's response.  He is doubtless aware that it is now nearly a year since the publication of the report of the list of recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  Will the Minister of State agree it is important that the State should move to implement those recommendations as they relate to accessibility?  Will he indicate the full cost of the programme to which he referred in his reply?  A million pounds while a good start seems a relatively small amount in terms of what will probably be needed to ensure full accessibility. Will he agree the Government should give its full support to implementing the commission's recommendations and should not be inhibited by what seems an extraordinary prohibition, the 4 per cent increase on gross supply services which the Government has imposed on itself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked that question also, but one of the difficulties in getting an answer to it stems from the fact that we do not have an assessment of the overall cost because there are so many different buildings, including listed and older buildings.  It is not until we submit an application for planning that we can get an assessment of what will be granted in planning terms which determines how we can design access to buildings.  The only figure I have been able to establish is that the cost for the Dublin area is about £6 million.  There is no point in giving figures across the floor of the House as these costs may be tied up in planning matters and only emerge at the end.  I hope I have been open with the Deputy in providing that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the conflict between conservation and access.  Are guidelines available to the Office of Public Works and other bodies involved in the provision of access to listed buildings to provide a balance between conservation and access?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Regulations for the provision of facilities are set out but the design concept of every building must have the flexibility to ensure that its build module provides full access to a range of disabilities.  It would be wrong to put that into a straitjacket of regulations which could be applied to every building.  One must use common sense and the many skills available with the architectural services of the Office of Public Works to look at each building in turn to ensure we can incorporate access for the disabled into the design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That a building is listed should not be an excuse for not providing access to it but it has been used in the past, although perhaps not by the Office of Public Works.  For example, Dublin Corporation has refused planning permission to the National Association for the Deaf to modify its building but that is not in the Minister's brief.  There may be access within a building but it may not be accessible from the street or people may be unable to cross the street to it.  In those instances, does the Office of Public Works have a scheme to cover the surrounding environment, not just the building itself but the approaches to the building, as they may present people with major difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the impression that the Office of Public Works would use the listed status of a building as an excuse not <Col N="321" /> to provide access for the disabled.  The opposite is the case and the Deputy is well aware of the position at the National Gallery, the Four Courts, the Custom House, Leinster House, and the National Museums in Kildare Street and Merrion Street, to name but a few important buildings much used by the public where the Office of Public Works has provided access, although total internal access may not be provided.  We have led the way in providing access and there is no question of the listed status of a building being used as a reason to ignore it.  My commitment, and the view of the Office of Public Works, is that if a building is listed it is even more desirable that people have access to it.</P>
      <P>As to the other question, the Office of Public Works does not have the right to consider the greater external access.  Much of that comes under the domain of local authorities as to facilities in their areas.  As a body, the Office of Public Works works with all local authorities to ensure that it maximises the access available.</P>

      <P>While the Government has not yet taken a decision on corporation tax I can confirm it is our intention to introduce a single low rate of corporation tax for trading profits with a higher rate of tax for non-trading profits.  This will be phased in over the coming years and will eventually replace the current regime.  The details of the new corporation tax regime will be decided on by the Government in due course and will be announced in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate why there has been a delay, given the impact it may have on international investment here?  Is it because, as reported, the deputy leader of Fianna Fáil and Minister for Public Enterprise advocates <Col N="322" /> rates lower than 15 per cent on traded profits and 25 per cent on other income, as decided by the previous Government?  Is that debate still live?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is as decided by the previous Government until the current Administration takes a decision on it.  I see no difficulty with this because the outgoing Administration decided to establish a low single rate of 12.5 per cent on traded income and 25 per cent on non-traded income.  That remains the official Government position and An Action Programme for the Millennium, agreed between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, commits us to establishing a single, low rate.  There is no difficulty with the decision made by the outgoing Administration but there is a slight difference between our preferred rate of 10 per cent and the previous Government's rate of 12.5 per cent.  The position remains as it was and the IDA and international investors know that.  We will consider this matter before budget day, 3 December, and any changes will be announced then.  The rate will certainly not be higher than that announced by the outgoing Administration.  Those policy decisions were brought to the attention of the Commission by the previous Minister for Finance and that remains the current Government's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that it has been a central, effective and successful instrument of Government policy through successive Administrations that the rate of corporation tax has remained fixed and was not subject to variation from year to year?  If he accepts that, does he agree that any uncertainty surrounding the position after 2010 is detrimental to the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for foreign investment? Will he therefore confirm that the position as published with regard to the end rates will not be changed, given that the manner in which we arrive at those rates is subject to an announcement which he will make in this year's budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certitude on this matter has been an outstanding feature of the success of the Irish economy in recent years and that will continue to be the position.  The policy proposals initiated by the previous Administration after considerable study remain the position as of today.  On budget day I will give a clear indication of how I intend to progress to the lower single rate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to policy certitude in the corporation tax regime but is he not undermining that certitude by deferring the announcement of a decision until budget day?  There is uncertainty at present and his reply has increased it.  There is no fiscal consequence in making an announcement of this matter in advance of the budget particularly if, as</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> I gather from his reply, there is no active reconsideration of the decisions taken by people on this side of the House when in Government.

The only minor point of difference is that we advocated in our programme a 10 per cent rate whereas the outgoing Administration decided on a 12.5 per cent rate.

      <P>I have not raised the matter with the European Commission because the Government has not yet decided what will be our single rate.  As the Deputy and previous Ministers for Finance will be aware, the taxation regime has come under considerable scrutiny in recent years by the Commission and other countries.  The Government's position is as outlined by the previous Administration.  The only possible bone of contention relates to the fact that the Government may decide on a 10 per cent single rate while the outgoing Administration, after due consideration of a number of different rates, decided on a 12.5 per cent rate.</P>

      <P>In view of the extraordinary hostility, of which the Minister must be aware, in the European Commission, particularly among the Monti committee, to competitive tax rates between member states of the European Union, will the Minister accept the strongest card of this Administration is the all-party support, to which Deputy Mitchell referred, for the existing Government decision which will not be revisited other than in regard to the form and speed with which the single integrated rate of 12.5 per cent will be reached?  The Minister is weakening his negotiating position with Commissioner Monti and the ECOFIN Council and creating considerable uncertainty with the IDA and foreign investment, particularly with those already located here &mdash; I am speaking in particular about the pharmaceutical industry &mdash; who are contemplating substantial capital investment programmes.</P>

There was some uncertainty in the period leading up to the time the previous Administration made its decisions on a single rate.  There was considerable lobbying by the IDA, IBEC and individual foreign institutions to have the matter clarified.

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Michael Smith, Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for appointment by the Commission, constituted as provided in section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution, to be a Member of the Government.</P>

Accordingly, I intend to recommend to the Government that Deputy Treacy be appointed as Minister of State at these Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again today I reiterate my commitment to integrity but also to justice in public life.  I have played a leading role in the establishment of inquiries into matters of major public concern without fear or favour.  I want to dispel the poisonous innuendo that hangs over our political <Col N="327" /> life by acting with justice and objectivity, not simply by feeding it victims.  I am working to overcome the legacy of the past in a way that properly discriminates between the good and the bad so that we can have a public life of which we are proud and in which there can be trust.</P>
    <P>While public confidence was greatly shaken by the outcome of the McCracken tribunal, it should be borne in mind that actual instances of high level political corruption, as distinct from quite unacceptable behaviour, have not so far been established, although the dangers were indeed great.  In recent weeks, I have not attempted to hide anything or anyone.  All I have tried to prevent is the type of summary political justice which pre-empts or prejudices the findings of judicial inquiries and makes them largely a waste of time, because people have made up their minds in advance about the results.</P>
    <P>Sadly, I have been unsuccessful.  Due process has gone out the window.  Is that the way we are supposed to run our democracy?  Is that the way other countries run theirs?  How will we attract good people into political life if years of service can be forgotten in a moment, as reputations are torn apart without just cause being shown?  In most jurisdictions, people await the clear outcome of inquiries or the obvious absence of a coherent defence to serious charges before deciding whether a resignation is warranted.  It would be much better if we did that here, foregoing short-term political advantage.  Otherwise, the report goes out abroad that a Minister here resigned over a financial impropriety, when no such thing has been established.  The sooner the better we establish an ethics commission, which I have consistently advocated, allow it to do its work and not jump to conclusions where there is serious dispute about the facts.</P>
    <P>I appointed the former Deputy Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs because I believed he was the best qualified for the job.  Not only was he one of the most experienced Ministers, he had also been involved in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in the late 1980s, standing in first as Minister for Industry and Commerce for the late Brian Lenihan and later in his own right as Minister for Justice.  He was also involved in the 1991 talks.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson for Foreign Affairs in Opposition, he was intimately involved in every step we took to maintain channels to all shades of opinion in the North and to restore the IRA ceasefire. Mr. Burke was integral to the recent major advances in the peace process, which resulted in the restoration of the IRA ceasefire after we had been only three weeks in office, and the commencement of the inclusive all-party three strand talks.  Recently he attended a meeting of the United Nations and met President Clinton to update him on the peace process.</P>
    <P>The ability of Mr. Burke to do his job quietly and efficiently and to achieve early results is the principal test of political competence.  We have <Col N="328" /> overcome the obstacles, some of which arose from Deputy Bruton's erratic handling of the Northern Ireland peace process during his period as Taoiseach and which marred the positive elements of progress that were made.</P>

      <P>Mr. Burke achieved a good working relationship with the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, and with many of the different parties at the talks.  He had sound political judgment on Northern Ireland.  He created in this sensitive area no unnecessary antagonism on the Unionist side, whose inevitable criticisms were mild by previous standards.  It was well known from his term as Minister for Justice that he held strong views on political violence from any quarter.  He made a valuable contribution to the leadership and steady response given by my party to the crisis caused by the breakdown in the IRA ceasefire in February 1996.  While the peace process would have benefited considerably from his continued involvement, I have full confidence in the ability of his successor to continue the success achieved to date.</P>
      <P>Many Northern Nationalists in particular are shocked at the way Mr. Burke has been harried into resigning.  Articles in this morning's editorial in the <i>Irish News</i> state:</P>
      <P>Much praise has been heaped on Tony Blair and his Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, for their role in bringing republicans to the table. But Mr. Burke deserves as much credit.</P>
      <P>It is unlikely that we would have made the same degree of political progress without his input.</P>
      <P>His political opponents claimed that the row over political donations made to him compromised his position at the peace talks.  This was a pretty insubstantial stick with which to beat him.  There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that he fell short of his obligations to the people of Northern Ireland.  And that is not something which could be said with the same confidence of his opponents when they were in office ..</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those articles go on to state:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that he is out of the way, the opposition has turned its attentions to Taoiseach Bertie Ahern.  He is accused of an error of judgment in appointing Mr. Burke to such a sensitive position in the first place.  This too is a load of rubbish.  Mr. Burke's qualifications for the office he held were impeccable.  Throughout his <Col N="329" /> career he has been a robust opponent of violence. The IRA owed him no favours.</P>
    <P>Unionists failed to warm to him, and yesterday Ken Maginnis claimed he was difficult to communicate with.  This could be seen as a negative, but there is not a single Irish foreign minister who has been given a good press by the unionists ..</P>
    <P>The last thing the peace process needs now is political instability in the Republic.</P>
    <P>My experience of Mr. Burke as a ministerial colleague is that he was courteous, careful, conscientious and correct.  He was responsible and intensely committed to the job in hand.  He always tried to do the right thing and to do it by the rules.  No one has produced any evidence to date to show that he consciously or wittingly broke any rules.  He exercised his powers as Minister for Justice only when he was advised that it was in order to do so.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret that he has resigned not only his ministerial office but his Dáil seat.  I believe he resigned both as the strongest protest that he could make at the shameful treatment to which he has been subjected by certain parties in this House and by certain sections of the media who cynically regard politics simply as a blood sport. Deputy Owen has complained that the Opposition were roundly criticised for &ldquo;not going for the kill&rdquo;, and not claiming all sorts of wrongdoing. She stated &ldquo;We were not aware of any wrongdoing&rdquo;.  I praise her for saying that, although it would have had more effect on her colleague from North Dublin if she had said it earlier.  Even the former Tánaiste and Labour Party Leader, Deputy Spring, complained last Sunday about the relentless political bloodlust of some in the media.</P>
    <P>Some Members of this House are not exempt from the same fault.  One Member opposite will be remembered to the end of his days for his unfortunate comment that he came &lsquo;looking for a head&rsquo;.</P>

      <P>A senior Fine Gael front bencher once boasted that &ldquo;heads in baskets&rdquo; was what politics was all about.  That is not how I have ever regarded politics, which I understand to be about public service.  That is not how Fianna Fáil regained office on this or any other occasion.  We did it based on what we could positively offer the electorate.  A posturing political righteousness is seen by certain parties in this House as a surer passport to power than having competence or experience in handling the real problems of the country or developing new and imaginative policies to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject completely Deputy Bruton's accusation that my knowledge of certain matters in any way makes me responsible for the events which led to <Col N="330" /> the resignation of Mr. Burke.  I appointed him after careful consideration in the firm belief that he had done nothing wrong and that he had earned the Foreign Affairs portfolio.  Accepting an unsolicited gift of £30,000, of which less than half was retained for his personal campaign, was certainly imprudent, but a few weeks ago in this House almost no one considered it a hanging offence.  I was not aware of the letter written within three days of the contribution, which has been referred to the new inquiry.  It has yet to be shown that the letter, which is open to an entirely innocent construction, has any connection with the payment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton defended the known wrongdoing of one of his Ministers, simply because his misdeed predated his appointment to ministerial office.  Yet he expects me to prejudge somebody where there was and is no established wrongdoing and not to appoint him.  This is typical of Deputy Bruton's hypocrisy.  He nobly talks about the principles of natural justice, but ignores them in practice and called for Mr. Burke's resignation before there was any evidence of wrongdoing, as</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen has rightly pointed out, even if too late.  Mr. Burke's political career was ended by Deputy Bruton and his likes, not by me.</P>

I tried to bring some humanity and decency into political relations across the floor of the House.  That more dignified approach was appreciated, if not by those opposite, by the public generally.  It is regrettable that some of the Opposition benches are occupied by people less scrupulous in the pursuit of their ambitions and who do not mind whose careers they bury along the way.</P>
      <P>In choosing Mr. Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I had good reason to believe I had picked the right man for the job and I make no apologies for that.  He can take great satisfaction from what he has achieved and from the long record of public service given by his family for over half a century. History will judge him for his achievements, not the unsubstantiated innuendo that may well fall away now that its purpose has been achieved.</P>

      <P>All members of this Government gave their support and sympathy to Deputy Ray Burke in the midst of personal tragedy and political turmoil.  I thank our partners in Government for their solidarity in the face of the barrage that was directed particularly at them.  We are a united Government, more determined than ever to see a peace settlement and the completion of the rest of the Government's very full agenda over the years ahead, particularly the next four or five years.</P>
      <P>On the naturalisation-based investment scheme, it has been a long-standing practice, followed by successive Governments, not to reveal details concerning investments made by individuals. The reason for this is to protect the right to privacy of individuals who would have dealt with State authorities on what they took to be a confidential basis, and also to maintain confidentiality in relation to information which could be commercially sensitive, in so far as the companies benefiting from investment were concerned.</P>
      <P>The Mahfouz family, who were the investors in the case that I will deal with, have expressed grave concern about the publicity which surrounded their dealings with the State and have been assured by the Department of Justice, following contacts in 1996, that we will continue to maintain confidentiality in relation to any contacts they may have with us.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that the circumstances generally are quite exceptional, it is in order for me at least to provide clarification concerning my own contacts with Ray Burke and others on the subject.</P>
      <P>Ray Burke's involvement in the issuing of passports to Sheikh Mahfouz was brought to my attention by Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, then Minister for Justice, on 30 November 1994.</P>
      <P>She gave me the details orally and followed up at my request with a note headed &ldquo;Secret &mdash; Mahfouz and Others&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In so far as Ray Burke was concerned, this note indicated that the:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>naturalisation certificates were signed personally by the then Minister and dated 8 December 1990.  This was a Saturday.  The normal procedure is that these certificates are <Col N="332" /> signed by an official at A/Secretary rank &mdash; acting on the delegated authority of the Minister for Justice.  The certificates actually include a reference to this.  In these cases, this was crossed out and initialled by the then Minister. Normally, naturalisation certificates are only signed by the Minister if there is a &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; interest in them &mdash; for example, the late Sidney Nolan.</P>
    <P>However, it is wrong to infer that the former Minister, Ray Burke, had consciously decided to set the normal practice aside, in so far as the signature was concerned.  A perusal of the file shows that the formal departmental note, which the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, read on that Saturday evening, on his return from a European meeting, stated that &ldquo;Normally these could be signed by somebody authorised on your behalf but I have left them for your personal signature&rdquo;.  This departmental advice note from the Secretary certainly did not convey any suggestion that signatures by a Minister was something of an exception &mdash; quite the contrary, in fact.</P>
    <P>Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, as Minister for Justice, briefed me on this case on 30 November 1994, because it was believed I would become Taoiseach in a matter of days.  As is now known, that did not happen, not least through the influence of another so-called new story which appeared in a newspaper with the intention of frustrating the formation of a Government.  While the detailed procedures normally followed in the issuing of passports under the naturalisation-based investment scheme were not followed in this case, an examination of the file now makes it clear that no evidence or allegation of wrongdoing was made in it in relation to Ray Burke.</P>
    <P>The next contact with the issue that I recall is reading an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> on 31 December 1995.  That article followed closely the items referred to in the note that had been given to me.  It stated:</P>
    <P>However, government sources could confirm that the manner in which the passports were granted was &ldquo;very loose&rdquo;, although there is no evidence of any impropriety by the individuals involved.  They could not confirm when the inquiry will be complete, and were awaiting for a reply from the sheikh's solicitors.</P>
    <P>There was further reference to the issues raised in other media reports early in 1996, and I recall discussing them with Máire Geoghegan-Quinn on possibly two further occasions.</P>
    <P>When forming the present Government, I discussed some issues with Deputy Ray Burke of which the issuing of these passports was one.  He told me he believed that, given the proposed substantial investment available, the issuing of passports in the Mahfouz case was reasonable, while accepting that the normal procedures in relation to the processing of the application should have been followed.  He said that he had returned from abroad just before the issue of signing the naturalisation certificates arose and, in doing so, he <Col N="333" /> had followed a note from the then Secretary of his Department.  He did not accede to a request to meet Mahfouz family representatives and had referred them to officials.  He further said he would have no problem with any investigation the Government might undertake into the naturalisation-based investment scheme.</P>
    <P>After the Government was formed in late June, I discussed a number of items of concern with the present Secretary-General of my Department.  In the current case, I asked him to speak to the present Secretary-General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to ask for a report on the circumstances of the case.  That discussion took place, and the report I received from the Secretary-General of my Department was based on an updated version of the report prepared in the Department of Justice in 1995.  It essentially summarised the facts in the handling of the Mahfouz case that I have presented here today.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards the Tánaiste and I discussed the case and I informed her of the facts.  The Tánaiste and I have now reviewed all the facts as they are in the Department of Justice file on the matter.  On foot of that, I believe it correct that I should refer in this statement to a Government &ldquo;Early Warning&rdquo; report of February 1995 &mdash; in other words, a system of signalling potential sources of controversy in good time.  The then Minister, Deputy Owen, drew to the then Taoiseach's attention:</P>
    <P>Investigation of the granting of Citizenship in a certain case in which the speed of decision, lack of documentation, faulty procedures give cause for concern.  Interim report submitted.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Early Warning&rdquo; report stated: &ldquo;Following interim report, details of investment made have been sought and are awaited&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to state that there is still an element of uncertainty as to the sum invested in the Mahfouz case, and I have no difficulty in having this or any other aspect of this matter further examined.  I note that the former Minister, Deputy Owen, has confirmed that there was no evidence of wrongdoing. It is a great pity she did not communicate this to her party leader before he started baying for the Minister's blood and indeed my own, because I knew about this matter.  I take great care to investigate matters carefully before passing political judgment.  Deputy Bruton does not.</P>

      <P>I should also draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government has considered the whole issue of the naturalisation-based investment scheme.  I can inform the House that in early September of this year the Government decided:</P>
      <P>that further consideration of the future of the Scheme should be deferred pending a report which will be submitted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> (a) the principle of the scheme,</P>
    <P>(b) the nature and impact of investments under the scheme, in terms of creating and saving employment,</P>
    <P>(c) how such schemes operate in other countries,</P>
    <P>(d) the applications in this regard which are on hand at present, and</P>
    <P>(e) the extent to which commitments have been honoured; and decided that the drafting of the legislation as approved by Government on 25 March, 1997, should not proceed at present pending further consideration of the overall matter by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced this scheme should be continued in any form &mdash; legislative or otherwise.  In its favour is the fact that many businesses which were badly in need of investments have benefited, and it is probable that many jobs have been saved as a result.  Many of the most senior Deputies on the Opposition side of this House have lobbied for applicants to help firms in their constituencies. Are they certain that their role in these matters can stand the same critical scrutiny to which Deputy Burke has been subjected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a danger that such a scheme may attract a proportion of more controversial applicants?  Why in normal circumstances should foreigners put such exorbitant value on an Irish passport?  Are the investments of any real or lasting value?  Does a scheme that has been dogged with controversy do anything for the country's international standing?  The Government will await the report of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before it decides what action should be taken.  I will be glad to take on board any views that may be expressed by Members of the House as to whether we should, in principle, retain a scheme of this kind in any form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, this Mahfouz case is one in which the normal procedures as regards the processing of the relevant applications under the naturalisation-based investment scheme should have been followed.  Equally, I have not been provided with any evidence which suggests wrongdoing on Deputy Ray Burke's part in the case, and nothing I have seen or heard so far, either inside or outside this House, contradicts this view.  In tendering his resignation to me, former Deputy Ray Burke expressed the belief that the holder of the <Col N="335" /> office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs must be allowed the opportunity to give total focus to the pressing issues of the historic talks on the future of our island and the major challenges we face in Europe.  He stated that the ongoing public controversy which confronted him did not afford him this opportunity.  I reluctantly have to agree with that assessment.  His role in the talks was skilfully used as a form of political blackmail to force him from office.</P>
    <P>I again wish to pay tribute to the excellent work done by former Deputy Ray Burke as Minister for Foreign Affairs in leading the Irish delegation to the multi-party talks and in moving the peace process forward.  Since the Government took office enormous progress has been made. The ceasefire was restored on 20 July.  Agreement was reached on 24 September on moving into substantive negotiations and these were opened this week in the three strands.  We recognise the critical importance of maintaining this momentum. The breakthrough achieved on 24 September presents us now with an unprecedented opportunity to lay to rest long years of division and conflict.</P>
    <P>There are also major challenges facing Ireland in its relationship with the EU over the coming years with which the new Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to grapple.  These include Economic and monetary union, the EU Commission proposals on Agenda 2000, which relate to the future enlargement of the union, its future financial arrangements and reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>In addition to dealing with the above mentioned key challenges in the EU area, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will also be actively involved in the ratification process of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The Government is committed to producing a White Paper on the treaty so that the people will be fully informed on its provisions before the advance of the referendum on ratification which is likely to take place next spring.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews is a highly regarded previous incumbent of the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He took part in the 1991-2 Northern talks.  He also won wide respect for his championing of human rights and cases of miscarriages of justice, such as the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four.  I am certain that his appointment as Minister will be widely welcomed and will have the support of the House and the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith has a distinguished record as a Minister.  He is noted for his ability, integrity and conscientiousness.  He has been on two occasions an outstanding Minister in charge of science.  He was also an excellent Minister for the Environment.  He worked in Opposition on the in-depth policy papers that we presented on the much needed reform and modernisation of the Defence Forces.  He will now have an opportunity to put that policy into effect.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Andrews on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He has a loud voice, as we could hear yesterday, and I have no doubt it will be useful to him in some of the meetings that he will have to attend.  I also congratulate Deputy Michael Smith on his return to the Cabinet and Deputy Treacy on his appointment as Minister of State.  I will return later to the subject of Foreign Affairs and to the appointment of Deputy Andrews, the reasons for which are well known.</P>
      <P>I repeat what I said yesterday: I regret the circumstances which led to former Deputy Ray Burke's resignation.  However, his resignation was made almost inevitable in recent days by the vacillation by his own party leader and Taoiseach as well as by the covert undermining of his position by his partner party in Government and by anonymous Government sources who were predicting that he would go, thereby making his position untenable.</P>
      <P>The burden of proof concerning the suitability of Ministers to serve in high office is different to that required in a court of law.  The greater good of the country must be considered when judging whether a Minister should be appointed to or should stay in office.  The Taoiseach does not seem to understand this distinction between politics and law.</P>
      <P>In politics there is no primary right for any individual to hold office or for any party to be in Government, which right is then up to others to disprove.  The burden of proof is on an office holder to prove his own or his party's fitness for office, not for others to disprove it.  The standard for judging suitability for office is not the same, as the Taoiseach seems to think, as a criminal or even a civil court case.  The needs of the country come first.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and his party are profoundly mistaken in their view of ministerial responsibility, which they revealed in recent days when they demanded, with apparent conviction and sincerity, that others must first prove wrongdoing before the Taoiseach would consider acting on the matter.  That concept is neither politically realistic nor constitutionally sound.  Nobody has a right to be a Minister and no party has a right to be in Government, but the Taoiseach does not understand either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has known for many months, if not for many years, about all the matters which brought former Deputy Ray Burke under pressure in recent weeks.  He conducted at least six investigations that we know of into the former Deputy and his dealings before and since he appointed him a Cabinet Minister.  What the Taoiseach knew and what he did or did not tell the Tánaiste have been the central issues for some days, and not the actions of the former Deputy.</P>
      <P>The public is entitled to expect decisive and timely leadership, courage and judgment from the Taoiseach.  These have been absent in recent weeks.  The Taoiseach has been reluctantly dragged to a point where we have now agreed terms of reference for a new planning tribunal. For his own reasons, he refused the more obvious, time saving and money saving option of having the Moriarty tribunal examine identified planning issues.  He saw no need for a planning tribunal until <i>Magill</i> published extracts from a letter. Suddenly, following publication of this letter on this one case the Taoiseach wanted all planning issues everywhere investigated.  Hitherto, he had been opposed to any investigation but the letter required a screen that would spread the smoke as widely as possible.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from his Government partners the Taoiseach chose to announce this decision on radio without any of the prior consultation with the Opposition parties that had been a feature of the preparation of the terms of the reference for the Moriarty tribunal.  He then produced terms of reference for this further tribunal which he wanted agreed and finalised by the Dáil the following morning.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference were so badly and evasively drafted as to be useless.  Under sustained pressure from this side of the House the Taoiseach relented and changed them.  At no time did he seem to be in charge of events.  He was merely reacting to contradictory pressures.  We now know that the Tánaiste and her party were whispering their concerns in his ear.  We know from remarks Senator Gibbons made in Kilkenny that Fianna Fáil's partners were divided on the issue of former Deputy Ray Burke's future as long as ten days ago.  In his normal style, the Taoiseach listened, agonised, dithered and did nothing, apart from authorising his spokespersons to anonymously smear every other party in the Dáil. As usual, his policy was to appear to be friendly, to give the appearance of wanting to do something but to never do today what could be left over until tomorrow and, most importantly, to get his associates to blame everybody else.  That is the Taoiseach's formula for survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately for the Taoiseach, we now know that he was concealing from the Tánaiste some of the key information that was at his disposal.  He only told her of his inquiry into the Mahfouz passports one month after the Government was formed and only when she asked about it and <Col N="338" /> only when it appeared to be too late to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>This is par for the course for Fianna Fáil-led coalitions.  The golden rule is to only tell one's partners the minimum.  We know, and the Progressive Democrats know, what happened to previous Governments when this Fianna Fáil house rule of coalition was applied on two occasions.</P>

      <P>It is common knowledge that a string of Progressive Democrats sources said last Saturday that the former Minister, Mr. Burke would have to resign.  The Drumcondra summit on Monday morning was only a formal rubber stamping of their wish; it was a ritual.  The revelation last week that the former Minister had been investigated by the Taoiseach on the issue of passports for investment as well as large cash donations makes one wonder exactly how much of his time the Taoiseach spends investigating his current and former colleagues.  Does he do much of this work himself or does he have a crack team of sleuths and investigators to do it for him?</P>

If not, why not?  In light of the McCracken revelations has the Taoiseach commissioned the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, to investigate former Education Minister, Deputy O'Rourke's role in the Carysfort purchase?  Did the Taoiseach investigate that matter himself or did he think it was not worthy of investigation?</P>

      <P>Being Taoiseach involves making timely decisions based on the information available.  The reality is that perfect knowledge is unattainable as is perfect proof.

      <P>The Taoiseach had all the knowledge he needed but none of the judgment to apply it.  This is the only reason Mr. Burke had to endure such a painful and prolonged process over the past month or so.</P>
      <P>Regarding a wider issue, we now know for certain the amount of money received by former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, to maintain his lifestyle over a short period.  We also know his system of working &mdash; meetings without officials present, the ignoring of Cabinet and official procedures, instructions to Ministers to sign this or that and no collective responsibility.  We also know the Haughey system was only allowed to continue by complacent and compliant ministerial and Cabinet colleagues who did his bidding time and again.</P>
      <P>We further know that several attempts were made to end this system by removing its author but every time, in the face of every challenge, the current Taoiseach resolutely defended Mr. Haughey and the continuance of Mr. Haughey as Taoiseach and his known system of operation.  I wish to pose a serious question to Deputies of both Government parties: is the country's interest served by maintaining in high office any of the Ministers who were intimately and knowingly involved in and who had political responsibility for operating, sustaining and defending the Haughey system of Government?</P>

      <P>One might say they are just procedures, but that is not the case.  They are rules put in place to protect the State from corruption and unwise decisions in the granting of passports. Under law the Minister is responsible for ensuring that these procedures are abided by.  One might ask why this was not acted on in 1995, 1996 or the first half of 1997.  There are two simple reasons.  First, Mr. Burke was not a Minister in the last Government so the issue of his suitability for office did not arise in 1995, 1996 or the first part of 1997.  Second, the Cole report is put in an entirely different light by the McCracken revelations of an obviously deeply corruptible style of Government operated by Mr. Haughey with the aid of his Ministers.  That turned the breaching of procedures which might warrant a simple reprimand in another context into a potentially profoundly <Col N="341" /> serious matter in the context of what we now know about the way in which Mr. Haughey's lifestyle was sustained.</P>

There is no evidence of corruption on the file.  However, there is evidence of a level of carelessness and compliance with bad practice which justifies serious conclusions being drawn about the continuance in office of any of the people who sustained that system of Government under Mr. Haughey, and that includes the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>Under no circumstance did we wish at any stage to compound his personal difficulties. However, I say to the Taoiseach, the Fine Gael Party and everybody else that we have consistently and profoundly disagreed with Ray Burke and his politics for virtually the 20 years of his service in public life.  That is not to take from either his ability or commitment or how he saw his service to the nation.  That is what politics is about.  There is not unanimity on the issues of the day.  On virtually all the issues, with the exception of Northern Ireland and violence, I have been in profound disagreement with Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in regard to the passports referred to what Mr. Burke said in the House some weeks ago, that he had done nothing wrong and that he was guilty of no wrongdoing.  The problem is that many people, if not a substantial majority in both the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties, believe the rezoning scandals that characterised the past ten years in county Dublin were not wrong and that a gift of £30,000, while being excessive, and its acceptance, to use the Taoiseach's phrase, was imprudent was inherently not wrong.</P>
      <P>We fundamentally disagree with that and the record of Dublin County Council will show on all the contentious rezoning issues in the majority the line-up was Fine Fáil and Fine Gael on the one hand and Labour, Democratic Left and Greens on the other.  One member of the county council was elected in 1991 on behalf of the Labour Party and has subsequently left the Labour Party, largely over issues of rezoning.</P>
      <P>There are people who have mortgages for which they will have to pay for the next 15 or 20 years, the cost of which is contained in the price of the land they had to pay for as part of the purchase price of the house which is a consequence of the rezoning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban chaos in part of Dublin is, in part, related to the ill-co-ordinated development of Dublin which any professional planner in the area will say resulted from the chaotic way in which rezoning came about.  That is the reason I am in the Labour Party and not in the Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael parties.  Notwithstanding personal friendships that build up over time, as is inevitable, the Fianna Fáil and the Fine Gael parties, so far as I have discussed these matters with them, see what they have done as not being wrong and, therefore, acceptance of the gifts, unsolicited or otherwise, as not wrong.  As the opinion polls have shown, the vast majority of the public do not believe there was nothing wrong. That is why the pressure mounted, unfortunately for his sake, on the former Minister, Mr. Burke. That is why the Progressive Democrats, while they were purportedly discussing whether to co-join <Col N="345" /> their Fianna Fáil colleagues in supporting the nomination of Professor Mary McAleese some weeks ago, spent most of their time agonising over this position because of the opprobrium being heaped upon them.</P>
    <P>In the context of the debate we have had just now, for someone who wanted to see the end of civil war politics &mdash; after about 75 years it is time we saw it &mdash; there is a new kind of civil war politics growing up between the two large parties, a civil war of personality politics, a civil war of gutting one another over a consistent period.  We have had exchanges across the floor and walkouts yesterday and then we wonder why the profession of politics is held in such low esteem.  I am simply making an observation, and I refer to the two speeches we have had so far, that we cannot conduct our affairs in the way we have done on the one hand and at the same time expect the public will not look in or listen to or read what the newspapers report and not say that politics is degrading itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to say there are no disagreements. However, the manner in which we deal with them is something we will have to look at unless we want to continue to devalue the political process.  The responsibility for the manner in which this issue has come ultimately to this very unhappy conclusion for the former Minister, Ray Burke, and for his family, rests upon the shoulders of the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  In that respect I agree with the political analysis and conclusions of the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Bruton.  It was obvious since June that the pressure which ultimately brought about this conclusion would mount.  The Taoiseach was sufficiently concerned to conduct a number of examinations but came to the conclusion that because Mr. Burke had done nothing wrong he could proceed with the appointment for which he, Mr. Burke, so earnestly wished and to which the Taoiseach felt he was entitled.  It is precisely because of the Taoiseach's perception of the rezoning process in north County Dublin, shared by other parties in this House, that he failed to see that once it became known, the public pressure would be relentless.  It was a senior Fianna Fáil source, unnamed but clearly quoted in The <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, who said that when the issue of the terms of reference of the original tribunal, now known as the Moriarty tribunal, were being considered, the Minister for Foreign Affairs absented himself from the Cabinet room during that discussion and that this was the first step towards his permanent departure from Cabinet. In attempting to lay blame for the present position of his now endangered minority Government as a result of the departure of Mr. Burke not just from Government but from this House, the Taoiseach should look to his own as much as to this side of the House for those who put pressure on <Col N="346" /> Ray Burke.  When the Tánaiste made it publicly known that she was to have a meeting with the Taoiseach to discuss this issue, the only reason for doing so was to convey solace to her Progressive Democrats supporters.  In so doing she turned the heat on Ray Burke.  If she was concerned, as no doubt she was, she could have sought a meeting with the Taoiseach, but the decision to make that public inevitably contributed to the pressure which Ray Burke ultimately found unbearable. Communicating to the public that having met on the Monday, and having decided to meet again on the Tuesday to consider the future of Mr. Burke &mdash; perhaps the Tánaiste had advance knowledge of the Taoiseach's decision at that time &mdash; put further pressure on Ray Burke and, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, even the strongest shoulders will bow under those circumstances.</P>
      <P>The sad plight of the Burke family now, the reduced support the Taoiseach has in this House as a result of that, and the visibly shaken confidence of the Government backbenchers are all the result of the decision the Taoiseach took in June and which he stood over.  The Tánaiste subsequently moved from that position to seeking public meetings with the Taoiseach on two separate occasions.  It is not appropriate to blame the Opposition parties and say that somehow or other, aided and abetted by the media, they brought things to this pass.  The responsibility for what happened yesterday and today is a responsiblity the Taoiseach must bear, and of which she must take full ownership.</P>
      <P>This country is at a vitally important stage in terms of the talks in Northern Ireland.  Equally, it is at a vitally important stage in respect of preparations for the final stages of the single currency and negotiations on the mid-term review of the Structural Funds and the commencement of the debate on Agenda 2000.  The first 100 days or so of this Administration do not give my party or me any confidence or hope that we are focused on the important policy issues which confront this nation, as distinct from the personality politics which seem to obsess this nation, or are briefed on these issues and know what policy positions to adopt on them.  We had some very sad revelations to that effect during questions to the Minister for Finance earlier today.  I therefore earnestly hope that, in the interests of all, this Administration will now get down to work co-operatively and collectively, that this incident is behind us and that we can address the policy issues which must be given priority and which we as politicians were elected to deal with in the first instance.</P>

      <P>It is part of a uniquely Irish tradition that we always speak well of the dead.  In that regard the House is reflecting what people outside do.  Since Mr. Ray Burke has now resigned from his position in Cabinet and has retired from membership of the House, everybody is speaking well of him.  I agree with what Deputy Ruairí Quinn said about the cult of personality politics.  However, I was here <Col N="347" /> prior to the general election of 1992 when Deputy Quinn's party indulged in the practice he now abhors.  His party made a virtue of it during their whole period in Opposition.  If this marks a turning point for the Labour Party in that they do not intend to go down this road of personality politics any more, I certainly welcome it.  However, their operations in the past do not inspire me with confidence.</P>

      <P>There was a time when the real action in Irish politics took place on the floor of this House.  We did over the years have tribunals to investigate matters of serious public concern. For the greater part of the life of this State, these tribunals were few and far between.  The evidence produced or conclusions reached provided material for political recrimination for years afterwards.</P>
      <P>That position has changed drastically in recent years.  This House has tended to reach for tribunals with nearly the same abandon as Hollywood sheriffs reached for their guns &mdash; and sometimes with too little regard to the costs or likely outcomes.  Our most recent tribunal was, by general consensus, a success.  In essence, it concentrated on a narrow issue, followed a paper trail of financial transactions, questioned those linked with it and formulated clear conclusions.  Other tribunals with wider remits encountered contradictory evidence and came up with findings less conclusive.</P>
      <P>There are long standing rituals in Irish politics which we all understand and in which most of us have at some time participated.  Parties in Opposition must necessarily indulge in some degree of point scoring against a Government of the day. What better way is there of scoring a point than challenging the Government to refer some contentious matter to a tribunal; a Government which refuses to do, expresses doubts about the justification for so doing or worries about the inevitable costs, can be portrayed as &ldquo;having something to hide&rdquo;.  In that case, the Government, or a particular Minister, gets pilloried in editorials and chat shows.  Where it decides to run with a proposed tribunal, Opposition spin doctors can treat the decision not as a willingness to seek after truth but as tantamount to an admission of guilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have seen and heard in recent weeks goes beyond the worst excesses of the ritual I have described.  A campaign has been mounted to skew the terms of reference of a tribunal towards a particular incident &mdash; the facts of which were not disputed by the major parties in this <Col N="348" /> House &mdash; and to have a particular Member specifically named in them.  Once moves were made in that direction the real agenda emerged &mdash; a demand that the person named should stand down or be moved aside from his ministerial office while the tribunal was pursuing its business. The argument advanced was not that the office involved impinges in any way on the alleged activities of concern to the tribunal but that the person involved might be distracted from his ministerial work by the prospect of appearing before a tribunal.</P>
    <P>An unusually high proportion of the membership of this House have within the past decade or so held ministerial office.  During those periods some, to my knowledge, have experienced the immediate pressures of serious illnesses in their immediate families, problems with children or marital breakdown.  All these would be generally accepted as causes of distress and rank as high on the Richter scale of potential distraction as involvement with a tribunal but I have never heard of an Opposition or a Taoiseach regarding them as incapacitating a Minister from carrying out his or her duties effectively.  That talk of distraction was simply a code for the real message from the benches opposite and their media allies &mdash; a demand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should lose his portfolio simply because matters concerning him are the subject of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the parties opposite had strong views on the question of innocence until proven guilty.  I still have those views and I see no reason a politician, a Minister any more than a teenager in north Kildare, should be punished for an offence until the evidence for that offence and his complicity in it has been brought forward, tested and decided in a judicial forum.</P>
    <P>The lives of Governments since l969 have been relatively short.  Ministerial office, particularly a prestigious one like Foreign Affairs, is a recognition of effort and ability over a longer political life and any politician is lucky to get one shot at it; the lifetime of tribunals can be long.  Put simply, what the Opposition was asking was that Mr. Burke should relinquish the office his talents had earned for him, at best a substantial part of the life of this Government, simply because allegations have been made against him.  This is not fair and not good for the health of Irish politics in general.  I am sorry that the campaign of vilification in this House and elsewhere led Mr. Burke to sacrifice his career.  Headhunting has died out in New Guinea, I do not see why it should be revived in this House.</P>
    <P>This House, in its own way, once provided a forum for peace and reconciliation in this State where those who had fought against each other in a bloody civil war and who had seen friends and family killed in the course of that struggle could debate political issues of the day with passion. Despite the backgrounds from which their parties had evolved they were able to meet during the years on the common ground of this House and treat each other with respect.  Not even memories <Col N="349" /> of a civil war could eradicate in their dealings with each other a value shared by most Irish people &mdash; common decency.  It is recognised in my own county; it is, as Ken Maginnis showed, recognised among the Unionist community in Fermanagh.  I would have expected it to be universal in Meath and north Dublin.  What the memory of civil war could not eradicate in the party of Cosgrave and Mulcahy has died in the party of Bruton and Owen in resentment at the loss of office.  Common decency, in its most basic form, involves a suspension of political and personal vendettas at times of bereavement.  That decency was not shown when Mr. Burke was burying his brother.</P>
    <P>Strong views have been expressed in this House in recent weeks on the public interest in having certain questions answered.  I accept that there is a legitimate public interest in the way those of us who have political power &mdash; local or national &mdash; exercise it but it is no longer Governments alone which exercise that power or decide the course of events.  Outside this House there is another power with little defined accountability, the national media, which has played a part in Mr. Burke's decision to resign.  There seems to be a legitimate public interest in getting answers from the media to certain questions.  Did a national newspaper which ran a story on passports on Saturday last have before then an internal memorandum from the Department of Justice which it published on Monday?</P>
    <P>The media has expressed worries about politicians being bought and manipulated by private business.  Cash is not the only currency that corrupts. Has the desire for a scoop, a good story or a naked display of influence stopped them from facing up to the real and serious questions of who and why?  Who and why has financed the attempt by a firm of solicitors in Newry to dig up dirt on politicians?  Who and why has been so forthcoming with documents purloined from one of the most sensitive Departments of State?  To what extent was the readiness of journalists to run with every bit of tittle tattle about Mr. Burke the result of his activities in a previous political incarnation when, as Minister for Communications, he upset personnel in RTÉ?</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke and I did not always see eye to eye on internal Fianna Fáil matters.  He was however a man of ability who dealt with each ministerial post or spokesmanship with competence, courage and commitment and had earned the respect of his colleagues in Dublin, his electorate and the public servants who worked with him.  His departure from the Government and this House involves a loss of talent which neither can afford.</P>
    <P>Politics, it is said, is a cruel trade.  The actions of Deputy Bruton, Deputy Owen and their media allies have brought that cruelty home to us in recent days.  I suspect that the lesson will not be lost on those people of talent my party and the other parties in the House try to recruit into what I still regard as an honourable profession.  Our <Col N="350" /> political life will be the worse for the lesson they have taught us.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> The office of Minister for Foreign Affairs is a crucial one in any Government.  From the foundation of the State it has been regarded as a prestigious and senior position, requiring the attention of a capable and experienced Deputy: somebody with a cool head, sound judgment and capable of giving the energy and commitment required by the job.  Since membership of the European Community in 1973 the demands on the office have increased very significantly, with a whole range of EU commitments adding to the burden of whoever holds the office.</P>
    <P>In recent years the demands on the office have grown even more dramatically with the evolution of the situation in Northern Ireland.  Additional responsibilities were placed on the Minister for Foreign Affairs under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. The Minister is a key player in the Anglo-Irish process and since the opening of all-party talks in June 1996 the jobload has grown yet further, with the situation requiring the considerable attention and the regular attendance of the Minister.</P>
    <P>With the very welcome progress being made in Castle Buildings and the process moving into a much more intensive phase, we need a Minister for Foreign Affairs who can give the talks the undivided attention they require.  David Andrews is undoubtedly a capable and experienced politician: I hope that he gives the job the energy and dynamism that it needs.</P>
    <P>All Members will wish him well in the discharge of his onerous responsibilities.  If I can offer him one piece of advice it would be that if he gives the same display of petulance and illtemper every time he hears something he does not like that he showed in the Dáil yesterday, then he will have a very difficult time as Minister for Foreign Affairs and especially in his role in the Northern talks.</P>
    <P>The appointment of Deputy Andrews arises, of course, from the resignation of the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs, former Deputy Ray Burke, and it is necessary to respond to some of the points made by Government members and some commentators during the past 24 hours.</P>
    <P>Mr. Burke was not driven out of office by the media or an uncaring and insensitive Opposition. He was not &ldquo;hounded to resign his important position, on the basis of innuendo and unproven allegation&rdquo;, as the Taoiseach claimed yesterday. His resignation was the direct result of a serious error of judgment on his part, a lack of confidence in him from some of his own colleagues and by a performance of bungling ineptitude on the part of both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Through their own gross mismanagement, Deputies Ahern and Harney transformed what was a problem for them and Mr. Burke into a crisis for the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us not lose sight of how this controversy began.  Its origins lay in the disclosure that Mr. Burke had received a personal donation of £30,000 in 1989.  I know of no Deputy, sitting or <Col N="352" /> former, other than former Deputy Charles Haughey, who received a personal donation of anything approaching this magnitude.  However, it was not just the size of the donation that was extraordinary but the circumstances in which it was received.  By his own admission it was received from a man Mr. Burke had never met before, Mr. James Gogarty, who asked for no favour, large or trivial, in return for such a donation. Mr. Burke did not know how much money was paid over until after Mr. Gogarty had departed, and apparently he never inquired as to why he was the recipient of such unprecedented largesse from a person he had not met before.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Burke made his personal statement to the Dáil on 10 September I did not believe that he had adequately answered all the questions that needed to be dealt with about the source and circumstances of this donation.  It was not just the Opposition parties that were unconvinced.  A subsequent IMS opinion poll showed that 70 per cent of those polled did not accept Mr. Burke's statement; 14 per cent had no opinion, and just 16 per cent accepted Mr. Burke's version of events.  It was later shown that many of those in the last category were members of Fianna Fáil.  An MRBI poll showed even greater numbers doubting Mr. Burke's version of events.  As an Opposition party we would have been failing in our duty if we did not seek to have the matter further explored.  It is the job of Opposition to question, to challenge and where the response is not satisfactory, to harry a Government.  Nobody knows that better than Mr. Burke and there were few better practitioners of it when he was in Opposition than him, as I know.  It is ironic that some of those who are now criticising the Opposition for &ldquo;hounding Ray Burke&rdquo; into resignation were equally critical of us for not pursuing him strongly enough when he made his Dáil statement on 10 September.</P>
    <P>We sought a reasonable formula to allow the matter to be further explored in a manner which would be fair to all concerned, including Mr. Burke.  Democratic Left tabled an amendment to the terms of reference to the Moriarty tribunal which would have included the Burke donation in the preliminary &lsquo;sifting&rsquo; process of the new tribunal. This would have enabled Mr. Justice Moriarty to make preliminary inquiries into the donation and decide whether it merited further examination.  Under the terms of reference this could have been done in private.  The Taoiseach threw the offer back in our faces.</P>
    <P>The matter effectively rested there until <i>Magill</i> magazine published the text of a letter written by the man who arranged the donation, Mr. Michael Bailey, to the man who made the donation, Mr. James Gogarty, promising that he could procure planning permission and a majority vote at a full council meeting.  Coincidentally, this letter was written within three days of the donation being made to Mr. Burke.  This letter was apparently enough to set the alarm bells ringing and awaken the Progressive Democrats from their power-induced <Col N="353" /> stupor.  Without any warning or consultation with anyone in Opposition, the Taoiseach then went on radio to announce an inquiry into the planning process in north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>There then followed an extraordinary week in which the Government fought tooth and nail to prevent Mr. Burke's donation being referred to explicitly or implicitly in the terms of reference of the new tribunal.  The Whips met to try to agree terms, but the Government seemed to be in a virtual state of paralysis, changing its position virtually on the hour, with neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste willing or able to deal with the matter in a decisive or authoritative manner.  Such was the confusion that Opposition Whips were left to wonder if there was anyone in Government Buildings.</P>
    <P>Last Saturday <i>The Irish Times</i> published a story concerning the sale of 11 passports in 1990 to wealthy Arab bankers which further undermined Mr. Burke's position.  The importance of this story was not the details of the sale of passports in 1990, which had been published previously, but the disclosure that the Taoiseach had had Mr. Burke's involvement in these events investigated on no less than three occasions.  It raised serious questions about the Taoiseach's confidence in Mr. Burke and about the state of the relationship between the two parties in Government.</P>
    <P>Throughout this period, Democratic Left never once called for Ray Burke's resignation from Government.  We expressed serious concern about his ability to function effectively as a Minister against the background of the controversies that were threatening to swamp him.  Again we sought to deal with this situation in a way that would be fair to him.  On 29 September Deputy Rabbitte suggested that rather than requiring the Minister to resign, the Government should temporarily delegate his functions to another member of Cabinet.  Once again the Taoiseach threw the offer back in our faces, refusing to even consider it.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach had been prepared to accept our suggestion in regard to including the Burke donation in the preliminary process of the Moriarty Tribunal or listen to our advice to delegate his functions to another Minister, then Mr. Burke might well still be a member of the Cabinet and a Member of the House.  Instead, the Taoiseach displayed all the old characteristics of dithering and indecision that drive even his greatest admirers to distraction.</P>
    <P>There are very serious questions raised about the political judgment of the Taoiseach.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, was flayed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for what they claimed was his poor political judgment in the appointment of Deputy Michael Lowry to the Cabinet.  Yet at the time he was appointed to Government, there was nothing to suggest that there were unanswered questions in Deputy Lowry's background.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> On the other hand, when the Taoiseach appointed Mr. Burke to the most senior and sensitive portfolio of Foreign Affairs, we now know that he was aware of the controversial circumstances of the £30,000 donation in 1989 and that he had further had Mr. Burke investigated on three separate occasions over the 1990 sale of 11 passports.  What does this say about the Taoiseach's judgment?  Did he not realise that these issues were bound to resurface and inhibit Mr. Burke's ability to do the job?  Was it appallingly poor political judgment, or was he discharging some political debt?</P>
    <P>What of the Tánaiste?  Her undignified gallop within the space of a few weeks from being one of Mr. Burke's greatest defenders to the desperate attempts over the weekend to put clear water between her party and the former Minister represented one of the most spectacular political retreats in recent Irish politics.  Does Deputy Harney stand over her comments on 7 August that she had total faith in the judgment of the Taoiseach on Fianna Fáil members of the Cabinet? Why did the Tánaiste allow her spokesmen to claim over the weekend that she had no knowledge of the investigation carried out by the Taoiseach into the passport affair, when this was not the case?</P>
    <P>Ray Burke did the correct thing in resigning from his position as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I do not understand why he felt compelled to resign from the Dáil and hope that in the fullness of time, he will give us the full story which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste do not seem intent on doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised by the high moral tone adopted by Deputy De Rossa.  I do not need to go into the record of his party when it comes to financial donations of one type or another.  Suffice to say, he is hardly in a strong position to lecture us on ethics and on the appropriate amount for contributions, financial or otherwise.  I was disappointed Deputy De Rossa bolstered his arguments against this side of the House by referring to public opinion polls.  It is no surprise there is public disillusionment with politics.  If we were to take Deputy De Rossa's remarks to their logical conclusion, the country would be run by opinion polls like MRBI and Lansdowne Market Research.</P>
      <P>I entered politics because I believe in the concept of leadership and that politicians are meant to offer leadership and not simply follow opinion polls or dangerously outdated orthodoxies from the Communist era.  We are not a party which follows opinion polls; we lead from the front.  To a certain extent, we have suffered because of that. At times we are prepared to ignore opinion polls rather than act on whim because opinion polls and the media decide something is right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I offer Ray Burke good wishes in his retirement. I deeply regret his decision to leave Government and the Dáil.  It is a poignant reminder of the insecurity and instability which <Col N="355" /> has been introduced into public life because of the welter of allegations routinely traded on the floor of the House.  We must look at how we can reform and advance the case of political reform. The public expect that from us and for us to move forward and offer the leadership which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks on the passports scheme which has been operating for some years.  All Members of the House, including Deputy De Rossa, will agree it is time to scrap it. As Europe unites and as we express deep concern about illegal immigration, it is strange that we are handing out passports to wealthy individuals who owe no allegiance to this country.  It is important the scheme is reviewed by the Government, and I make no secret of my preferences in that regard. The passports for sale scheme should be scrapped.  It is of dubious investment value and if we must stoop that low to get investment, it is quite a commentary on our inward investment agencies which are doing a fabulous job.  It is ridiculous to offer passports because it diminishes and demeans our citizenship when our passports are touted around the world like a convenience that may be easily purchased.</P>
    <P>Ray Burke will be reassessed as the years go by in terms of his contribution as a Minister. Because two public tribunals are in place, which will inquire legitimately into the allegations and controversies which have surrounded Ray Burke, it is better that the House offers the charity of its silence on the passports issue and the donation from Bovale and other building consortia.  When we examine the records of all parties in the House on planning matters, not many of those who served on Dublin County Council in the early 1980s will come up smelling of roses.  It is important to restore the integrity of the planning process in Dublin city and that of the political system which has been brought into disrepute by unsubstantiated allegations being traded on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael with its usual penchant for dirty tricks has been at it again, as in 1990 in relation to the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid.  When it comes to political advantage, Fine Gael is not too shy about pressing that advantage even if the facts get in the way of a good story.  They persecuted people in the past, including Deputy McDaid, who is now gladly a member of Cabinet.  If Fine Gael was a true party, it would apologise to the House for its behaviour in relation to Deputy McDaid when he was put forward for a Cabinet position.  A disgraceful witch-hunt was mounted on that occasion.  It attempted to do the same with Mr. Burke but I am glad it has not succeeded.  Mr. Burke decided of his own volition to retire from politics.  He underlined his independence of his party and of the House by selflessly resigning his Cabinet position and Dáil seat.  It is a mark of the man that he chose to resign his seat.  Despite what those opposite said, that he was one of our Fianna <Col N="356" /> Fáil creatures, he is his own man and he has taken a noble path by resigning his seat rather than continuing as a Member of this House where standards have been falling.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believes it is legitimate to hound everybody, but it should look at its own record.  In recent weeks, while the controversies have been raging around Mr. Burke, there have been controversies in its party.  I defy Deputy Gay Mitchell to offer an explanation to the House why a former member of his party is now about to face charges in the courts on drug money laundering. It is a scandal which his party will have to explain once the court case is over.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael should offer an explanation.  It should also ask its former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, if he was warned at any point of the criminal association of any members. That is an important issue which Fine Gael must address.  Fianna Fáil has been pushed to address and answer almost every insinuation made.  We are not prepared to stand idly by and take such treatment.  I challenge Fine Gael to come up with the answers on that and other associations suggested and alleged with members of the criminal underworld.  It is an important issue it should address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nominees for ministerial positions are all excellent.  Deputy Michael Smith has served before with great dignity.  He took on the issue of drink driving in a courageous way and, to a certain extent, suffered politically as a result.  Deputy Andrews has served as Minister for Foreign Affairs and is an excellent man to deal with that portfolio with the huge challenges of EMU and the peace process facing him.  I wish him well in his appointment.  Deputy Treacy, subject to ratification by Cabinet, will become a Minister of State, a welcome appointment which will tilt the balance internally in our party.  It is good that our leader is rebalancing matters and bringing in people who I presume in the past would have been supporters of his predecessors.  I assure Members opposite that this Government could <Col N="357" /> not be more stable.  This Government intends to run its full term of five years, despite the allegations made about its partners, the Progressive Democrats, who in no way influenced Mr. Ray Burke's decision.  The Progressive Democrats provide an honourable presence within this Government and I believe will continue to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We might have to examine the transcript of this debate to ascertain whether contributors have some information they can offer in relation to underworld figures.  I believe this is a matter to which we may have to revert on another occasion.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Andrews on his transfer to the Department of Foreign Affairs which appointment no doubt will be ratified later this evening bearing in mind the arithmetic of the House.  I also congratulate the outgoing Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Smith, on his promotion to Minister for Defence and Deputy Noel Treacy on his imminent appointment as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and Science, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>I wish Mr. Ray Burke and his family well in private life and thank him for the courtesy he extended me as Opposition spokesman during his short period in office as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>In passing I should say I am not given to making personal charges against anybody, although I am not surprised at some of the people who do make personal charges in this House.  Nonetheless I was criticised in a newspaper on Sunday last, by implication, for having defended a former Fianna Fáil Deputy and county councillor. Although I did not know him that well I served with him as a Member of this House but not on the county council of which I was never a member. I was critical of a newspaper article which asked, after he had died: how was it he had left so much money behind?  Since one cannot libel the dead, had that newspaper something more pointed to say to accuse him, why was it not said? What it did say was disgraceful and I said so on that occasion.  Indeed the newspaper on Sunday last which took my comments out of context might have placed them in context.  The journalist who originally wrote the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> is a very fine one and writes very good articles. But it is right to criticise when it is due.  The article about the late Deputy Séan Walsh, which has been the subject of comment here in the past, was rightly criticised by me.  I make no apologies for having done so.  It was wrong to write in that vein about somebody not in a position to defend themselves.  Therefore, I consider my criticism to have been both fair and reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the background to this whole fiasco in which we now find ourselves the Taoiseach was aware of this rezoning allegation and the Mahfouz passports affair.  Nonetheless he appointed Deputy <Col N="358" /> Ray Burke to the most sensitive Cabinet office at a time when historic negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland were under way.  Indeed, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke was central to the problem which developed thereafter.  Had he been appointed to some other Department such as, for example, Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the timing of the inquiry into the affairs mentioned here might not have affected his departure from Government.  It might even have been possible to have switched him to another Cabinet post.</P>
    <P>I consider it to have been a grave mistake on the part of the Taoiseach to have appointed Deputy Ray Burke to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the time he did and leave him there while this controversy continued.  The Taoiseach investigated both issues, one on several occasions, and then used his judgment to go ahead with his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Apparently he did not tell the Tánaiste about Mr. Burke's role in the passports issue until she inquired about it in July last.  The Tánaiste confidently states that she trusts the Taoiseach.  That is not good enough.  The Taoiseach has shown himself, at best, to be inept and indecisive and, if the Tánaiste trusts his judgment, then hers is even poorer; she cannot have it both ways.  In my view the Tánaiste did the very least her duty required her to do: she asked the Taoiseach the question, knowing what the answer would be, and then trusted him.  I do not trust the Taoiseach's judgment in this matter.  The Tánaiste has found it too convenient to do so.  That is a political charge, a fair and reasonable political charge to make in this House.</P>
    <P>It took the addition of the passports issue to the other allegation to stimulate Deputies, in the shape of Deputy Desmond O'Malley refusing to participate in a radio programme on Saturday last, thereby following the inevitable rather than giving leadership.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have taken the high moral ground in politics.  Yet it took their former leader to force their hand: the Tánaiste acted only under extreme pressure.  Can anybody tell us why we need the Progressive Democrats? Is it simply so that they can all hold office or what relevance do they feel they have to the overall political landscape if they can simply trust the Taoiseach's judgment even when that is shown to be faulty?</P>
    <P>An opportunity existed to allow the Moriarty tribunal to examine in a preliminary way the payment to Mr. Ray Burke.  That was voted down by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Under public pressure they then proposed the establishment of a second tribunal.  Where was the determination to observe even the minimum standards?  The Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil contend it was Fine Gael and the media who hunted Ray Burke out of office.  It was the Taoiseach's dithering, in refusing to either refer the matter of the charges to the Moriarty tribunal or to agree straightforward terms of reference for the planning <Col N="359" /> tribunal, which ensured that this issue remained in the public eye for two weeks.  The Taoiseach was brought reluctantly to agree.  So much for his Ard Fheis speech when he said that Fianna Fáil would let the chips fall where they may.  That certainly has not been the case.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste followed Deputy Desmond O'Malley and, in recent days, expressed concern, which was what led to the political demise of Ray Burke.  The emotional reaction of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Andrews, yesterday in the House was not untypical of the man, to some extent it was understandable, but he should have directed some of his emotions closer to his own benches.</P>
    <P>Why did Mr. Ray Burke resign his seat in Dáil Éireann in addition to his Cabinet position?  Did the Opposition cause that?  The Opposition is not hurt by the resignation of his seat, it hurts the Government.  Why did Mr. Ray Burke do so after 24 years of membership of the Oireachtas and a lifetime membership of Fianna Fáil?  It was meant to hurt Fianna Fáil in particular, not the Opposition; for that reason there is no point in levelling charges against us.  Is this part of a Fianna Fáil internal struggle and, if so, what is the background to it?  It appears that there are cabals within Fianna Fáil who believe they have a God given right to first choice on available office and, if they cannot get it, they do not want anybody else to have it; self-service for some has replaced public service.  The most brilliant, the most devious, the most cunning of them all, the Taoiseach, handled this whole affair with a degree of incompetence and very poor judgment.  He used the skills of his party's Chief Whip to shore up the situation rather than his own and his role was central to the whole fiasco.</P>
    <P>A whole spin was put on this affair.  We in Fine Gael were accused of being too soft on Mr. Ray Burke when we endeavoured to be decent from the Opposition benches, with the innuendo that we had something to hide on the overall rezoning issue.  The Taoiseach even made veiled suggestions about this.  Yesterday he sought to blame the Opposition and the media while exonerating himself; by implication he also exonerated the Leader of the Progressive Democrats and cabals within his own party who clearly wanted Mr. Burke to go judging from what has transpired. Even his announcement twice in the House yesterday had a spin on it when he said he accepted Mr. Burke's resignation &ldquo;on behalf of the Government&rdquo;.  He did no such thing.  He accepted Mr. Burke's resignation as Taoiseach, that is the constitutional position.</P>
    <P>My comments are not personal, they are reasonable and proper political charges to make in a debate of this kind and it is right that an Opposition should raise such public issues.  Public issues were at the centre of what happened.  There are other matters which require an explanation and the former Taoiseach mentioned some of them today.  I <Col N="360" /> wish to share the remainder of my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>

      <P>It was sad to see a former Taoiseach and now Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bruton, descend into the political sewer twice in 24 hours in an attempt to justify the improper and outrageous political behaviour he has displayed since the weekend.  It is unfortunate that we have reached a stage in politics where the basic courtesies are denied a family burying a brother.  What would have been wrong with waiting to make these unmeritorious charges until a dignified end had been afforded a member of a family?</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton came into the House today in his typical over the top fashion to question other people's judgment and descend into the political sewer a second time.  Without any evidence he now contends, having obtained the resignation of one member of the Government, that there are other members of the Government who are <i>prima facie</i> guilty of some wrongdoing because of past political associations.  We have had nothing but innuendo which passes for political debate in this House.  Deputy Bruton is the man who talks about due process, who leads the law and order party.  He is the constitutionalist, the civil libertarian, the person who understands and always invokes proper procedures.</P>
      <P>We had a tribunal of inquiry led by Mr. Justice McCracken which has resulted in the need for a further inquiry, to be chaired by Mr. Justice Moriarty, into issues that arose out of the McCracken tribunal.  All-party agreement was sought and obtained on the terms of reference of the new tribunal.  Subsequently, a political attack, which had been ongoing for over 12 months, was coming to an end.  We had the attack on the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ray Burke, yet no evidence was adduced to suggest he fell short of his obligations in relation to achieving all inclusive talks which began yesterday.  The opposite is the case.  The charges that he could not do his job were unjustified because he was doing it with great distinction, as we heard from the Taoiseach earlier when he quoted the <i>Irish News</i> editorial on the former Minister's political demise.  That was an acknowledgement by those closest to the scene in a divided society where there are serious problems concerning the maintenance of democratic structures.  The former Minister, Deputy Burke, once again acquitted himself with distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The continuous charges and innuendo continued. A letter was produced suggesting a tie in with the former Minister, Deputy Burke.  The fact that he was not a member of a local authority was beside the point.  The matter concerned property in his constituency.  Guilt by geographical association <Col N="361" /> had now become the means by which one nailed a political opponent.  The harassment and innuendo continued despite the fact that those who were making these charges had sat on the Government benches for the previous two and a half years.  They trawled many files and sought any evidence they could obtain.  One of their number, the erstwhile Deputy Lowry, came into this House and told us, with the vociferous support of his front and backbenchers, about cartels in the semi-State sector and corruption at the highest level.  That all came to nothing, a bottle of smoke.  Deputy Bruton talks about smoke but he has been the main architect of political smoke. The behaviour that has passed for political debate in this House emanated from his Administration, his best friend, Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton came into the House today claiming that he respects due process and sought to character assassinate other members of this Administration.  His infamous team of legal eagles in the Four Courts, who regard politics as a game, a showmanship job, can produce speeches that take people's reputations and abuse the privilege of this House.  Deputy Bruton should know that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will not tolerate that type of unsubstantiated charge.  It will be treated with the contempt it deserves.  It will be confronted at every opportunity as Deputy Bruton seeks once again to talk about the culture of corruption.  He talks about me and others who come from a respectable political tradition and suggests that we are unfit for office.</P>
    <P>I challenge Deputy Bruton, the alternative leader of this nation, to come up with the evidence. He should put up or shut up and not come into this House under the guise of statesmanlike behaviour and behave like the type of sewer rat I saw in the House this evening.  That was a contemptible display which was beneath contempt and no self-respecting politician or profession will allow that continue.</P>

      <P>It is amazing that the law and order party is not prepared to respect due process. Serious allegations were made which have caused great concern.  We sought, with the agreement of all sides of the House, to address those issues in the interests of the integrity of everybody in this House and in public life.  We do not seek to shelter anybody but we will not accept that people are guilty.  Nor will we accept the decision by certain Members of this House to inflict political damage on the Government.  We will not accept that type of tactic from Deputy Bruton or any other Deputy.</P>
      <P>I will put my record, and indeed that of the former Minister, Deputy Burke, against that of anybody in this House.  When one has served in Government with some distinction, one should come into this House and have a debate with some measure of standards.  People should not seek to invoke the subterranean effort we witnessed from Deputy Bruton this evening.  I will not accept that nor will any other self-respecting politician.  This Government wants to see confidence restored in public life.</P>
      <P>I have committed myself to full time politics in the interests of serving my constituency and, if given the privilege, my country.  Let us respect the institutions we have established to deal with the evidence which may or may not be adduced.  Let us not regard insinuation as proof or allegation as evidence but rather await the deliberations of the tribunals.  We can then assess the situation and attribute blame or wrongdoing wherever it falls following this calm and objective assessment.  The Deputies opposite should not come into the House and seek to become judge and jury of the Fianna Fáil Party, its traditions and past and present Members without evidence.  Let them go to the tribunal if they have evidence but in the meantime they should watch their back and make sure their own people behave in the way they claim others have not.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The Taoiseach said that Mr. Burke's political career was ended by Deputy Bruton and his likes, not by him.  Mr. Burke ended his political career because of the actions of his great friend the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats.  Those of us who read the newspapers prior to his resignation could read between the lines in terms of what was happening.  It is ironic that the Taoiseach blamed Deputy Bruton for Mr. Burke's resignation given that we were criticised by the media for not going far enough, for failing to land any punches and for not going in for the kill.  The reason we did not do this is that there is a mutual respect between Deputies.  I have a certain amount of respect for Mr. Burke and very much regret that the matter has come to this.  Instead of blaming the Opposition, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats should look into their hearts and consider how they dealt with this issue. Mr. Burke was forced to walk the plank by the Government parties, yet the Taoiseach is not prepared to acknowledge his role in the matter.</P>
    <P>The passports for investment scheme has attracted unfavourable publicity and been much maligned.  A previous speaker said we should scrap it.  Given recent events, this is a natural reaction.  The scheme was initially criticised because ultimate responsibility for issuing passports to foreign investors lay with the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey.  I am sure this was the position in the case involving Mr. Burke as Minister for Justice and the Mahfouz family.  It is strange to say the least that a Taoiseach should hand over passports to a group of Arabs in the Shelbourne Hotel for an investment of £20 million, of which only £17 million has been identified as being invested.  An element of mystery surrounds the remaining £3 million.</P>
    <P>There is also the case involving Deputy Reynolds and the investment by the Masri family in C&amp;D Foods.  The spin put on this case led to criticism of the scheme and a considerable tightening up of the regulations.  A committee, which includes representatives of Forfás and the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Foreign Affairs and Justice, now make the ultimate recommendation to the Minister on the merits of a specific case.</P>
    <P>Before we decide to throw out the baby with the bath water and abandon the scheme it is worth looking at how similar schemes operate in Canada and Australia which have been very successful in attracting mobile investment.  I agree with the Taoiseach that it is worthwhile analysing what has been achieved by these countries.  In Canada, where there are different types of investors, the scheme is not as strict as our scheme under which £1 million must be invested.  The Taoiseach said that in the past Deputies may have made representations on behalf of various companies. Some companies have benefited, expanded and developed under the scheme but, unfortunately, as a result of past cases it has got <Col N="364" /> a bad reputation.  However, if it was underpinned by statutory regulations it could be very effective.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Ministers Andrews and Smith and Minister of State Treacy on their appointments and wish them well in the difficult tasks facing them.  I am genuinely sad for Mr. Burke.  I met him recently and know the toll this matter has taken on him.  I was very shocked at his decision to resign his Dáil seat at this very difficult time for him.  I also wish his daughter a speedy recovery.</P>
      <P>The Dáil has all the hallmarks of a television drama.  However, the tragedy is that it is very real in terms of its effect.  Such matters distract us from our real work of introducing changes and representing our constituents.  Even though we may have to deal with other issues from time to time we must not overlook our responsibilities as public representatives.</P>
      <P>A considerable amount of nervousness is attached to the Northern Ireland situation which Mr. Burke did so much to advance.  While some Deputies would be happy if the Amsterdam Treaty was never debated we must face up to our responsibilities to the electorate and ensure it is debated.  A recent survey shows that Irish companies, particularly multinationals, are the least prepared of their EU counterparts to meet the requirements of EMU.  We have been dragging our heels on issues such as carbon dioxide emissions and energy conservation, to which no reference is made in the Government's housing programme. These matters deserve prudent and urgent consideration.</P>
      <P>My colleague referred yesterday to the STAD group, which has received little attention and been given broken promises.  The Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed, which will make its pre-budget submission tomorrow, has highlighted how the gap between rich and poor is widening.  All this is happening against the backdrop of Mr. Burke's personal misfortune, but it remains a reality for many people.  The problems facing the horticulture industry were referred to in the Private Members' debate.  I wanted to mention them, but perhaps the Minister, Deputy Woods, who is familiar with the industry, might refer to them in his contribution.</P>
      <P>The passports issue must be addressed.  Deputy Finucane said that the scheme had its merits, but internationally we are seen to treat citizenship rights poorly because we are prepared to give them to the highest bidder.  That is not fair to the refugees here and the Refugee Act has not been implemented.  People who do not have money suffer while those who have it are able to buy their way into positions of power.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputies Andrews, Michael Smith and Noel Treacy on their ministerial appointments and wish them every success in their new offices.  They are three excellent and experienced Deputies who will be readily able to take on their new tasks.</P>
      <P>I regret Ray Burke's decision to resign from Government and from this House and I particularly regret the circumstances which led to that. He was subjected to a constant sustained campaign. He was harried, harassed and hunted out of office at the height of his success in the peace process on the day the three stranded talks began and the day he buried his brother Seán.  That is something Members will very much regret in time.  At each step as he tried to explain his position a greater price was demanded of him by members of the Opposition, mainly Fine Gael.  It should be a source of great shame that they did not have the decency to stand down their attacks earlier this week and allow the man to bury his brother in peace.</P>
      <P>Ray Burke was a hard working and experienced Minister with whom I had the pleasure to work in several Administrations.  He played a significant part in the recent commencement of talks in Northern Ireland and his record in the many other ministries he held is equally impressive. While Minister for Justice he constantly challenged and refused to bend to the men of violence. That is not an easy task, but Ray did it with diligence and yet sought peace and a resolution to the problems we face on this island.</P>
      <P>The Dáil has lost an outstanding parliamentarian. In Government and Opposition he contributed to the quality and content of debate not only in this House but also on committees, in particular the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. North Dublin has lost a dedicated public representative who served his constituency with great vigour and distinction for more than 24 years.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said here about the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, and his role.  He fully supported Ray Burke and insisted that he be given the right to natural justice which each one of us is entitled to expect.  As Members of this House we should engage in, and be seen to engage in, the highest standards of public administration and to bring about and enforce the standards of justice and fairness we seek to ensure in other areas.  Today, Deputy Bruton tried to say in his contribution that politics is a separate business, subject to other criteria, that it is not governed by the rules of natural justice and to take from what the Taoiseach had done, but Deputy Bruton is very seriously wrong.  If one follows his line in politics, ultimately no citizen in this State will be safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principles of natural justice apply here as absolutely and as necessarily as they do in every other walk of life.  Politics is the ultimate in public administration.  If we do not believe that, we should stand aside from politics because we will never lead anybody and people will be disillusioned <Col N="366" /> with us.  Everyone who participates in politics must uphold the principle of natural justice. Every individual has a right to a fair hearing and to be given the opportunity to answer any allegations made against him or her.  Ray Burke did not get that opportunity from Deputy Bruton or from certain elements in the media, but the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, honoured the principle of natural justice and gave him the right to due process.  In doing so, the Taoiseach took the criticism that went with it because he is decent and understanding.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach argued consistently in Opposition there is a need for an independent ethics commission to investigate allegations and to address them at such a forum.  The Government said such a commission will be established and we will do our utmost to ensure it is established before Christmas.  The innuendoes must stop or politics will suffer all round.  Unless we stop the innuendoes, untold damage will be done to an open democratic society which must be guided by principles.</P>
    <P>This party is strongly united behind its leader. The Government partners look forward to working together for the good of our people.  I assure the House this is a good Government and that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil are more united and durable than ever before.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Sinn Féin, I wish Deputy Andrews well in taking on his onerous task at this vital juncture in the political development of our country.  The Irish people expect leadership in the peace negotiations.  It must be stressed that this is the responsibility not only of the incoming Minister but of the Government and all Members in conjunction with all parties at the talks table.</P>
      <P>In the short period I have been a Member I have observed in some quarters the very opposite of leadership, particularly in the few opportunities we have had to discuss matters related to the peace process.  I have seen narrow party political point-scoring, most often directed against my party.  I believe, as I am sure the people do, that it is time to put behind us the failures of the past, the failure of partition and particularly partitionist thinking so often evidenced here.  Too often people have looked on in despair as the crisis in the Six Counties and the suffering of the people there was either ignored or treated as a stick with which to beat the political opponents. The peace process has challenged that complacency and challenges us all to live up to the tremendous possibilities for progress which the negotiations, now thankfully commenced, present to our people.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Andrews on his appointment as Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="367" /> and I know he is capable of doing a very good job.  I call on him to give his undivided attention to the peace talks which are in progress.  This is the best opportunity for peace in 70 years and we cannot afford to lose it.  In recent weeks the House has lost the focus necessary to give credence to the talks, to bring everyone on board and to show that we are as interested in and committed to the peace process as everyone else.</P>
      <P>In the last 25 years the Border region suffered from the spillover of violence but this is often ignored or forgotten in this House.  Inward investment has been minimal and the Celtic Tiger has not come to my constituency or the Border region.  While population may be rising in the south and south-east it has declined in the area stretching from Donegal to Louth.  Our young people are attracted to large centres like Dublin, Galway and Cork to get jobs.  We are capable of doing as well as anywhere else in the country but we have not had the chance.  If the peace process fails the consequences are unthinkable &mdash; we will return to the dull and dreary existence of the last 25 years when we lived in fear.</P>
      <P>This country may have difficulty obtaining Objective One status for the next phase of Structural Funds, given the upsurge in the south and south-east.  There is a case for regionalisation so that the Border region can continue to benefit and achieve the same state of development as other parts of the country, whose success I acclaim.  A similar case can be made for the west. These regions must continue to receive the same level of EU financial commitment as in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Much will rest on Deputy Andrews in his new capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, both in negotiating the peace and in seeking the full benefit for the area I represent.  We expect him to deliver and hope he will not be diverted by matters such as those recent events which have diminished the Government's contribution to a development which is important to so many.  We will seek his commitment and will watch him closely.  We hope the House will be regularly briefed about the progress being made, because that is vitally important.  It will show the Northern Ireland authorities, the British Government, the EU and the US that we are totally committed to bringing this process to a finality, that we wish to ensure that both parts of the country can work in harmony and all shades of thinking can live together for the benefit of all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to respond to this debate on behalf of the Government.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Smith, will be elevated to the Cabinet. For the past 14 weeks he and I have worked together in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment where he had special responsibility for commerce, science and technology.  He worked diligently to develop that brief in an <Col N="368" /> imaginative way and I regret that I will lose him from the Department, because he has an expertise in that area which I do not.  However, I am glad he is joining the Cabinet because he has enormous political wisdom and experience.  He will add greatly to the Government over the next few years, especially considering our minority status.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased that the Minister, Deputy Andrews, will now take responsibility for the Department of Foreign Affairs, a position he held previously.  He too has a wealth of political wisdom and experience and comes to the Department at a crucial and momentous time in the history of the island.  The substantive talks which have now begun offer a real opportunity to deliver a lasting political settlement in Northern Ireland and to transform it from a divided society into one where, notwithstanding their differences, Unionist and Nationalist can live together and respect each other with equality of treatment and parity of esteem.  As Lord Alderdice said, if everyone who comes to the table is prepared to pay a price and to compromise, the longest conflict in the history of modern Europe can be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is therefore important that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is able to focus on and devote all his energy to those talks.  In resigning, Mr. Ray Burke had done the right thing, not only from his and his family's viewpoint, but also because the enormous pressure on him and the ongoing controversy which dogged him in the past 14 weeks made it impossible for him to focus as he would wish on the Northern Ireland talks.  I acknowledge the progress he made in that time, particularly in delivering a new IRA ceasefire.  As the Taoiseach and others who were closer to the talks have acknowledged, he was a tough negotiator who demonstrated skills which I had not seen in him before.  I had not worked with him and did not know him well in Opposition but in Government, I saw at first hand his capacity to grasp his brief, the toughness with which he approached the job and the negotiating skills he displayed in that short time.  He was determined to do a good job but the recent controversy made that impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we can close the chapter on the events of recent weeks, which have not been pleasant and have added nothing to the body politic.  Many in our society wish to undermine the State and politicians and we must not contribute to that. The vast majority of people who enter politics, whether at local or national level, come to serve and the vast majority of those who have served in this House, both now and in the past, are honourable, decent people with a sense of justice and fair play.  I respect the Opposition's right to hold the Government of the day to account &mdash; that is the duty of Opposition.  In a parliamentary democracy we need strong, stable Government and a vigilant Opposition &mdash; without such an Opposition, our democracy is undermined and this is what distinguishes parliamentary democracy <Col N="369" /> from other forms of Government.  In a number of recent debates the Opposition has gone beyond policy issues and its right to hold the Government to account.  We have seen an unprecedented attempt to engage in what Deputy Quinn called &ldquo;the politics of personality&rdquo;.  My party and I have been accused of doing this in the past.  When I entered this Government on 26 June, I said I wished to give of my experience and to ensure this was a policy-driven Government which dealt with the issues confronting our country. I am not interested in personalities or in seeking resignations.  The Progressive Democrats did not seek the resignation of Mr. Burke from Government.</P>
    <P>On the passports issue, I was surprised to discover the former Attorney General advised that the passports could not continue to be issued unless the scheme was put on a statutory basis. As the Taoiseach acknowledged, the Government discussed this issue in early September but I had long come to the conclusion that a modern democracy, a republic like ours, should not sell its passports to wealthy people because it brings the Irish passport into disrepute.  Our passport is carried with honour by Irish citizens and we should not continue to sell it to a select few wealthy individuals who are head hunted around the world.  Some 147 people have been issued with those passports and I acknowledge that many Irish jobs have been saved as a result. However, our economy is growing and notwithstanding that good investment opportunities arose from issuing those passports, we can no longer issue them as we did in the past.  The Government will discuss this matter when the Minister for Justice brings forward his report and it is my firm view that we should no longer sell Irish passports.</P>
    <P>We had the McCracken tribunal, which restored my faith in tribunals, and we now have the planning tribunal and the Moriarty tribunal investigating payments made to Deputy Lowry and Mr. Haughey.  All the issues should be dealt with by those tribunals.  The planning tribunal may do a great service to this House and particularly to local politics.  Planning, particularly in County Dublin, has been dogged by controversy for many years.  I served as a member of Dublin County Council and it is not easy for councillors to make decisions on planning.  Lands need to be rezoned and the vast majority of rezoning decisions made were in the interests of the people of County Dublin, not because people wanted money.  Some people want it every way; they want jobs and houses in the county but they do not want to rezone land.  That does not make sense. Land must be rezoned if development, residential or industrial, is to take place.</P>
    <P>Some bad decisions have made rezoning a difficult issue for local politicians.  The new planning tribunal will restore the good name of the vast majority of local politicians.  Perhaps very little will be revealed by the planning tribunal, but even if that is the case it will have been a good <Col N="370" /> day's work because there is so much innuendo and suspicion and so many unfounded rumours. If the tribunal is able to put those rumours to bed a great day's service will have been done for local politicians.</P>
    <P>In many ways this country is at a crossroads. We are about to enter EMU.  We will no longer be able to borrow or spend our way out of recessions or use devaluation to get a competitive advantage.  This is a crucial time for Ireland and we must ensure the economy is competitive to deal with the pressures, particularly in the context of a single currency.  We need a Government that is focused on those issues, a Government that is united and provides stability.  I give an assurance to the House, as I did on 26 June when the Government was formed: I will do everything I can to ensure we have a united Government, a Government that is focused on the issues.</P>
    <P>I trust the Taoiseach.  I should not have to keep saying that and should not have to be asked that question.  If I did not trust him I would not serve in Government with him.  When I became aware on 31 July last of the events reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday I telephoned the Taoiseach the following morning and what he told me has been confirmed to be the case &mdash; I have seen the file.  In so far as the finger should be pointed on that issue &mdash; standards were breached and procedures were not followed &mdash; it should be pointed at others.  Perhaps that will transpire from the Moriarty tribunal.</P>
    <P>What surprises me is that the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, who had that file for so long, did nothing about it.  In January 1995 she could have revoked the passports concerned.  At the time no investment had been made and residency had not been established.  The procedures that were required in the past were not followed and, if she wished, the then Minister could have revoked those passports, but she chose not to do so.  Many investments have been made since and the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, took a personal interest in all those applications.  He worked with the IDA and others on that set of passports. I hope the Moriarty tribunal will get to the bottom of that.</P>
    <P>It is important this House moves on to the real agenda, the Northern Ireland talks, EMU and, notwithstanding the high growth of recent years, the high level of unemployment.  Ireland is unique in having high growth combined with mass unemployment. They are among the challenges that face not only the Government but everybody who serves in this House.  We would do a great service to everyone who serves in politics, the body politic and the public whom we have the honour of serving if we could forget about the unsavoury events of recent times and the division we have engendered on all sides of the House and concentrate on those issues.  Otherwise, we will further undermine parliamentary democracy and will turn more and more people away.</P>
    <P>That is not to say the Opposition should not hold us to account.  I did my best when I was over <Col N="371" /> there.  Tough opposition is good for democracy and for Government, as is freedom of the press, but we must ensure stories that appear one year are not regurgitated a couple of years later as sensational news.  That is not good journalism and it is not fair.  It does not serve democracy and it does nothing for the honourable profession of journalism.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Farmers' Incomes: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Coveney on 8 October l997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, recognising the severe threat to many farmers' incomes this year, arising in particular from the collapse of live exports to both the EU and third countries, the continuing Russian ban on exports of carcass beef from seven Irish counties, the failure to secure payment of national compensation of £17 million to beef producers (£50 slaughter premium) and the disastrous grain harvest especially in the south and south-east of the country, condemns the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government for their inadequate and ineffective stewardship of agriculture since coming into office and calls on them to take immediate and effective action to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, recognising the threat to many farmers' incomes this year, supports the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Government in their efforts, since coming into office, to maintain farmers' incomes, to reintroduce live exports to the EU and third countries; to improve access to the Russian market for carcass beef; to secure the approval of the European Commission for the payment of national compensation to beef producers and to seek ways of assisting grain producers who were seriously affected by recent adverse weather conditions.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach accused this side of the House of hypocrisy during the discussion of the very sad situation whereby Ray Burke has had to leave his ministry during a delicate family situation.  We genuinely give him all our sympathy.  However, it makes me sick to think of the problems endured by our Government, led by Deputy John Bruton with Deputy Yates as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and how we had to listen to Deputy Cowen and subsequently Deputy Walsh, as the then Opposition spokesmen on agriculture, telling us what they would do if they were in Government at the time of the BSE crisis.</P>

      <P>I hope now that the Minister, Deputy Walsh, has the opportunity to reopen the Egyptian and Libyan markets he will do so.  The Libyan market is extremely important for Friesian cattle.  When cattle were left on boats in an Egyptian port, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, tried to get those markets opened.  What has our present Taoiseach or Minister for Foreign Affairs done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> The farm organisations said at that time that if the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, went to those places the markets would immediately be reopened.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that this time last year the former Minister, Deputy Yates, had the markets open in Egypt.  They are not open today. Deputy Browne should talk to the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Taoiseach and get them to deliver on the promises they made.  As far as the cattle business is concerned, the Minister should wake up and follow up on his promises.</P>
      <P>Many winter beef fatteners want to know whether the Minister can deliver the £17 million Irish Government aid to farmers &mdash; £50 per beast. He has failed to get agreement on that.  That is a major scandal as far as many farmers are concerned. The price of beef today is 82p per pound. Thankfully, some farmers in my area can get a further 5p or 6p a pound across the Border.  That raises questions about what is happening.  The country is awash with money; the Government has been handed a good economy.  Why is it not possible to give that money to farmers?</P>
      <P>Where is the installation aid which the present Government guaranteed before the election? Where are the grants for farm buildings?  The Government promised the return of the much needed pollution control and farm buildings grants.  It transferred money from the food industry to pay for the farm buildings which had already been erected.  That will have serious consequences for the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which has the most intense food industry in the country.  I will return to haunt the Minister on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our spokesman on Agriculture did a good job today in raising this matter.  I wish the Minister for Agriculture and Food and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, had time to listen to what we had to say.  They will have to go back to the country on this matter and we will <Col N="376" /> remind them then of all the promises they made and all the accusations they made against our Government.  I assure them that many of those promises, which are on the record of this House, will come back to haunt them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well.  A number of measures need to be taken on the promises outlined by his predecessor as Opposition spokesperson. The live trade needs to be opened.  There is a huge number of small cattle in the country and there is concern they will be worth very little within the next six to eight weeks.</P>
      <P>The Minister informed the House today about the price of cattle by comparison with this time last year.  I listened yesterday to the head of the research unit in Grange telling young farmers who received their certificates that the cost of producing a pound of beef is 84p.  The Minister told the House today that the price received in the factories is also 84p.  This means that everybody is depending on the cheque in the post.</P>
      <P>Why has the Minister not delivered the £17.5 million approved by the previous Government? With the Government coffers awash with substantial funds why has he not obtained approval from the EU to spend this money?  Why is he allowing the EU to diversify the money to the effect that, if it has its way, only approximately £20 per head will be paid, which is no addition to farmers who have lost substantial amounts of money in the beef industry in recent years?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the difficulties encountered by grain farmers regarding the harvest. When I produced grain as a farmer 20 years ago it was the same price per ton as it is today. There is a serious problem here which must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the installation aid promised by the Minister and the extra money he undertook to provide for farm pollution control he should recall that the last time he produced the farm pollution control grants he did not provide enough money for those seeking payments because there was insufficient funding from the EU.  The Minster promised farmers, including the young farmers, that he would deliver on these promises.</P>
      <P>When will the Egyptian and Libyan markets open for live cattle?  When will compensation be paid?  When will the installation aid, promised by the Minister, be introduced?  When will the farm pollution control scheme be introduced?  The Minister must deliver on these because he will be judged on his performance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an event I attended recently the Minister was introduced as &ldquo;the real Minister for Agriculture&rdquo;. I do not like to think he will become the &ldquo;real Minister for Agriculture&rdquo; in the eyes of the many people who support his party, rather that he will be the real Minister for Agriculture and Food from the point of view of doing the job. That is what he is appointed to do and is what <Col N="377" /> the people and the farmers, especially the young farmers, expect.  We are not here to criticise but to point out what the Minister has approved and proposed.  We now want action.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  During the course of the last Dáil the only opportunities we had to debate agricultural issues arose because the Fianna Fáil Party continually tabled motions for Private Members' business.  The previous Government never provided an opportunity during Government time to debate these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will give us the opportunity to debate issues, not just in respect of difficulties facing the Department but also with regard to long-term planning for our farming and agricultural industry, such as the Santer proposals and the Agenda 2000 proposals. I am sure the Minister will take heed of the views of the Members of the House and of the agricultural industry in general when he successfully negotiates the future reforms of the CAP on behalf of the Irish farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>When can we have a debate on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Crawford is an assiduous listener to national and local radio and reader of the national and local newspapers.  I am also sure he is aware the Minister visited Egypt recently following on visits by his senior officials to the senior authorities in Cairo.  I applaud the progress made by him in those negotiations.  He has more work to do.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on obtaining funding from the Minister for Finance to provide a ferry service to enable all classes of livestock to be brought to the Continent.  The predominantly small farmers of Counties Cavan and Monaghan whom I represent are very interested in the weanling trade and the provision of a ferry is of the utmost importance to ensure we have a trade for weanling cattle before the marts.  I am glad that, through his persistent negotiations, the Minister has provided the finance and has a shipping facility practically in place.  I am sure his discussions with the EU Commission and Commissioner will be successful and the new shipping service will be on stream in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crawford mentioned some of the farm investment schemes.  I have often spoken at length, both in the constituencies and in this House, on the importance to the constituency I represent of the control of farm pollution and I <Col N="378" /> have highlighted the difficulties we face in needing to provide additional housing for cattle because of the high rainfall in our part of the country, the drumlin soil and the terrain.  I was glad the Minister provided an additional £28.5 million for this scheme some months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is paying the bills so often left behind by Deputy Crawford's party when in Government.  I am sure the Minister will provide further funding to enable the lifting of the suspension of that scheme, which is of such importance, especially to the smaller farmers because they are not in a position to incur the substantial expenditure needed to provide the proper on-farm pollution prevention facilities.</P>
      <P>I know the farming community is anxious to have the most modern and up to date facilities provided on their farms and to eliminate all possibilities of pollution.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to ensure that this scheme is fully operative as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>This is an important debate and one which, coming into the autumn season, is timely.  Coming from Donegal one is more than aware of the necessity for the live export trade.  It is disturbing that many of our other female politicians &mdash; not especially within this House, but including those candidates in the presidential election &mdash; would not be as supportive of the live export trade. While I appreciate the position taken by many people on this issue there is much misinformation and lack of understanding with regard to farming, especially small farming and the necessity to get a market for our weanlings.</P>
      <P>This time last year we were told that while the bigger farmers were going to take the brunt of the BSE crisis it would filter through to others.  It is now filtering through to the small farmer.  In view of this I must emphasise our welcome for the work done by the Minister.  It has been innovative and I hope the pilot project the Minister will initiate will reach fruition.</P>
      <P>There is much debate about the fact that the country is losing jobs because we export live cattle and not finished products.  Until the lack of competition in the slaughtering trade is dealt with, small farmers will continue to be treated unfairly.  The sum of 80p or 83p a pound being paid at present is not good enough.  People are suffering losses.  I re-emphasise the need to reopen the export trade to Egypt and Libya and to consider other areas, such as the marketing of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> Irish produce.  We have been unable to get across that message as well as we should have, but much of that is the result of the negative attitudes expressed in the House and in the media generally. It was stated that the debate should be positive because comments made in the House are reflected across the world.  We should re-emphasise the fact that Ireland has the best product. Consequently, it should be possible to sell our products all over the world.</P>
    <P>As a Donegal Deputy I am most concerned that the restriction on exports to the Russian market was not removed.  I hope the Minister will vigorously pursue this matter with the Russians.  I am aware that the ban on Wexford cattle was lifted.  In facetious terms, I suppose Deputy Yates would claim credit for that if he was the Minister. However, the Border counties are anxious to ensure that the ban on them is lifted because they rely on the live export trade.  I hope the Minister will again travel to Russia and hold discussions with officials because there is not a huge incidence of BSE in County Donegal.</P>
    <P>There are serious concerns about the Santer proposals and Agenda 2000.  There are many older and part-time farmers in rural areas in particular. They can only live on the land if they receive subsidies and support.  Ireland is a nation of small farmers because larger farmers can, in most instances, look after themselves.  However, small and part-time farmers need support.  I hope that support will continue and that unnecessary restrictions are not placed on the various premia and funds from the EU.  I hope there will be a debate in the House in the next year on the Santer proposals and that Deputies will have an input in terms of what we feel is best for farming in this country.</P>
    <P>Young Members of the House, including myself, encourage young people to go into and remain in farming.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the applications for installation aid.  I hope the applications with Teagasc at present will be met because we are honour bound to pay the installation aid to support young farmers.</P>
    <P>A further point may mean nothing to other Members with the exception of some of my colleagues who have a number of IAWS fish industries in their constituencies.  I attended a meeting recently where several companies received the ISO 9000 award.  However, there is concern that the European Agriculture Commissioner is considering banning fish meat in terms of agri-business. As a Deputy representing Killybegs, where 500 jobs rely on fish industry factories, I hope that proposal will be shelved.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time.  In recognising the serious financial threat to farmers this year, I support the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and the Government in their efforts since coming into office to maintain farmers' incomes, to introduce <Col N="380" /> live exports to the EU and third countries, to improve access to the Russian market for carcase beef, to secure the approval of the European Commission for the payment of national compensation to beef producers and to seek ways of assisting grain producers who were seriously affected by recent adverse weather conditions.</P>
      <P>So far this year the EU has accepted almost 50,000 tonnes of our beef, representing approximately 21 per cent of the EU total.  While it is not in our long-term interest to be dependent on intervention, I am satisfied this is used by the industry only as a last resort.  It is an essential market support measure, principally during our peak disposal period.  However, there are good grounds for believing that the improved market balance in the EU will reduce the need for intervention next year and the beef industry will substantially increase its presence on the EU market, thereby enabling it to put in place what is believed to be the best foundation for further development into the next century.</P>
      <P>With regard to cattle prices, I am aware that while there has been an overall improvement in cattle prices compared to this time last year, prices still remain below those that prevailed before the BSE crisis.  The low prices are due to a combination of factors which are well known by now.  It is fair to state that prices this autumn are better than would have been predicted a few months ago.  In fact, current prices are better than this time last year.</P>
      <P>Egypt was an important market for live cattle but it has been closed to imports from Ireland since the beginning of January 1997.  The Minister, Deputy Walsh, confirmed that a commitment in principle to reopen the market for Irish cattle was communicated on 4 June to his predecessor. However, that agreement in principle was subject to a number of conditions in the first instance.  Therefore, discussions on the conditions for resumption of the trade were essential.  These culminated in the visit of two delegations from the Department of Agriculture and Food in August and I congratulate the Minister on this initiative.  Many of the veterinary requirements for the resumption of trade were agreed and a package of proposals was offered, including assistance for the removal of specified risk material.  This was important in terms of allowing the Egyptian authorities to provide the same type of health guarantees as available to European consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also congratulate the Minister on his recent visit to Cairo where he met the Egyptian Ministers for Agriculture and Trade and Supply.  As a result of these meetings the Egyptian authorities agreed to consider accepting a trial shipment subject to certain conditions.  The proposal for such a shipment is at present being formulated in the Department of Agriculture and Food in conjunction with the live cattle exporters' association for consideration by the Egyptian authorities.  I hope that a properly controlled trial shipment will convince the Egyptian authorities to reopen the market <Col N="381" /> fully to Irish cattle imports as Egypt is now one of our most important markets for frozen beef; exports have increased substantially this year.</P>
    <P>The quantity of frozen beef exported in the first half of this year is estimated at 30,000 tonnes, which is equivalent to almost 100,000 cattle.  This exceeds the total for all of 1996.  Regarding beef, Russia remains our most important market although trade has been subject to restriction since November 1996.  However, I understand that to date 40,000 tonnes have been exported to Russia this year.</P>
    <P>The issue of live exports to the continent is of major concern.  The difficulties faced by exporters are due to the decision of the principal provider of ferry services from Ireland to the Continent to refuse to carry live animals, other than pedigree animals.  It is now accepted that no restrictions should be applied to the export of livestock from Ireland and that any trade which complies with the strict animal welfare conditions applicable in Ireland as well as appropriate EU animal conditions should be allowed to travel unhindered to its intended EU destination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement of Government assistance for the provision of an alternative ferry service.  This is the strongest possible way in which we can show our support for this trade.  I understand that a vessel suitable for the carriage of livestock has been inspected and passed by officials of the Department of Agriculture and Food with independent marine surveyors.  Subject to clearance by the EU Commissioner of the State aid involved, this will clear the way for a resumption of this trade.</P>
    <P>Grain production is very dependent on weather conditions, a risk factor inherent in crop production generally.  Last year was an excellent year with high yields, excellent quality and low moisture levels in contrast to the bad weather conditions in August this year.  This created major difficulties for a number of grain growers.  For this reason I welcome the recent statement by the Minister in which he confirmed he had meetings with representatives of the merchants and lending institutions.  He also had discussions with farm representatives.  In his discussion with the lending institutions he stressed the need for a sympathetic approach on behalf of the banks towards those who might be facing financial difficulties as a result of the poor harvest.  He confirmed the reaction of the banks was positive and was assured they would take a long-term view of the situation of growers who had financial problems and that there would be understanding of their difficulties. Also his discussions with the grain merchants had a positive result.  They offered full co-operation in trying to minimise the loss from the harvest and agreed to provide extended credit facilities. This is welcome.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and the Government.  In a short period the Government has made tremendous progress in dealing with what appeared an impossible situation.  In <Col N="382" /> the next few weeks we can look forward to a positive response with regard to the Russian market and also in relation to the export of live cattle to Egypt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his appointment and wish him every success in his onerous task.  With his vast knowledge and experience of the agriculture industry we are fortunate that Deputy Walsh is the Minister for Agriculture and Food at this time.  He has already made some important decisions in relation to the development of that industry.  I encourage him to continue the work he has started in Egypt to open up that market.  His mission to that country at the end of September was worthwhile and there are positive indications of the prospect of the market being fully opened soon.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity, as had the acting chairperson, when in Cairo at the Interparliamentary Union meeting to discuss with some Egyptian parliamentarians this problem.  We stressed the importance of reopening that market.  Our ambassador, and his officials, have some internal problems which are not related to the status of Irish beef.  In further discussions with the Egyptian authorities it is important the Minister continue to use his influence to canvass those who are embarking on the campaign, especially in the media, in Egypt to try to minimise the imports of live cattle, not only from Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are indications of a general increase in beef consumption here and in Egypt and a drop in production so that the balance in the beef market will mean we will be able to give incentives for the development of our beef industry.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment.  There are some matters that underlie milk quotas.  Sustaining the incomes of small dairy producers in the west, including those in County Clare, is essential to the beef industry.  Since the introduction of milk quotas 1,000 small dairy producers in County Clare have ceased milk production.  This means a further erosion of incomes which are critical in maintaining the number of small family farm holdings.  I wish to emphasise the importance of providing additional support measures in relation to milk quotas to ensure that the incomes of small dairy producers in the west can be protected and sustained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a critical industry as far as the west is concerned.  Agriculture has been and continues to be the backbone of the economy of the western counties.  In any development of the industry in the future it is important to take account of some of the issues which are causing problems such as the restriction on milk quotas and the lack of incentives for introducing new developments such as the anti-pollution measures.  Difficulties have arisen in respect of the installation aid issue.  I suggest the installation aid be directed towards those who need it most in the 13 western counties. I encourage the Minister to continue the <Col N="383" /> good work he is doing and he will have our full support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his reappointment as Minister for Agriculture and Food and wish him every success.  The months of October and November are important for the small farmers in the west, particularly in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim which I represent, with ten, 12, 15 and 20 suckler cow herds. They do not keep their calves for the winter.  The Minister must try desperately hard in the next few weeks to ensure the live export of cattle is allowed to continue.  It will be difficult because a number of people are totally opposed to the live export of cattle.  Some people call those involved the do-gooders.  If we have a good quality ship I am all in favour of animals being well treated while being exported.  We want the best quality ships to prove that our cattle can get to their destination safely.  If we can do that it would be of great benefit to the people in the west and those I represent.</P>
      <P>Farm pollution grants should be restored.  If funding cannot be got from Europe we should get Exchequer funding.  Farmers are not seeking bigger grants, they would be happy to accept half that already received to provide winter housing, slatted houses, and to prevent farm pollution.  For the convenience of keeping and feeding cattle for the winter these farmers would be happy to receive smaller grants.</P>
      <P>A number of farmers depend on cheques in the post in respect of headage, suckler cow grants, beef premium, etc.  Some thanks for this is due to a former Member, the ex-commissioner Ray MacSharry, who negotiated a good deal to allow farmers to receive cheques in the post.  He could see that some day farm incomes would not be as good as they should be.  The former Minister, Deputy Yates, did his best while in office and I am sure Deputy Walsh will do his utmost to reopen the live export market for cattle and thus ensure farmers get a good price for their stock. There will be a serious fall in prices if we cannot export cattle.  For those who are concerned about the export of livestock we must ensure the ships meet the necessary requirements.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Joe Walsh on being appointed Minister for Agriculture and Food.  He has vast experience in this area which he has brought to bear for the benefit of agriculture and the general community when he was previously in that post.  I am sure he will do likewise now.  I also congratulate Deputy Hugh Coveney on being appointed spokesperson for the main Opposition party.  He also has vast knowledge of this area.  I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a direct interest in farmers in that 30 or 40 of them pay me for work I do for them.  This gives me hands-on experience because, although I do not work at ground level, I see the bottom line.  In my area the farming community is <Col N="384" /> engaged in all areas of farming &mdash; milk production, beef, cereals and vegetables.  What I have seen in the past few years would not indicate a decline in farm incomes as the Opposition parties would like us to believe.  Without doubt there have been difficulties in the grain area.  Farmers producing malting barley were particularly badly hit, as were those producing vegetables, due to inclement weather.  The Opposition has been calling for money to look after grain farmers.  The Minister is having the cost of losses estimated by Teagasc and its estimate is not yet to hand.  This motion is, therefore, premature.  However, I suppose the Opposition parties are judging us on their own approach when they would not allow discussion on agriculture, except on a few occasions, over the past two and a half years.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the price of milk in the years ahead especially now that PLCs play such a big role in that area.  Co-operative societies are paying a higher price to milk producers than PLCs.  My fear is that in the years ahead PLCs will be under such pressure from shareholders that profits which were going back to the farming community, and through the farming community to the extended business community, will be reduced.</P>
    <P>On exporting beef, particularly from Cork, a boat in Cork has passed the European directives and has been passed by the Danish Government as being suitable for exporting cattle.  However, the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, signed a directive to the effect that because this boat did not have a 15 second rollover period it could not be allowed to carry cattle.  The European directive says that a ten second rollover period is within the law.  I ask the Minister to look at that.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the IFA has again come to life.  For two and three quarter years we heard nothing from the IFA.  It is back again like the unions.  We know who they were run by, but now that Fianna Fáil is in power the IFA has suddenly risen like the phoenix.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House that I am sharing my time with Deputies Dan Neville, John Browne, Paul McGrath, P.J. Sheehan and Michael Creed, a formidable team indeed.</P>
      <P>I join the previous speakers in wishing the Minister well in his new ministry.  I had the pleasure of meeting him in my constituency and was very glad to see him there.  I also wish Deputy Hugh Coveney well as Opposition spokesman on Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In wishing the Minister well, I also wish he would do something for the hard-pressed farmers. There is no doubt that farmers' incomes are on the decline and cattle prices are falling.  There is no reason for this other than that we simply do not have an export system in place.  It is unacceptable that we cannot get the produce of the primary industry here to the European market. We are a member of the European Union and we are entitled to trade freely in Europe.  If <Col N="385" /> this happened in any other sector of industry there would be uproar; the unions would be outside the House protesting loudly.  Where are the farmers' representatives?  Where is the IFA that we heard so much from over the past two and a half years when we had a Minister who was doing trojan work?  The president of that association has simply gone to ground.  Why are they not supporting back-bench Deputies who are seeking to highlight the fact that we have no shipping facilities in place to get our stock to market?  It is claimed that the Government is putting in place a certain amount of capital.  From correspondence I had from the Minister's own constituency, that is totally unnecessary.  A firm trading under the name of Walsh Warehouses Limited is prepared to make available a ship, <i>The Caroline</i>, suitably licensed by the Danish Government, meeting all the criteria laid down by Europe, to bring cattle to the European market.  It only remains for the Minister to give these people a licence to do the job.  They are not seeking one penny of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have noted in his travels, as I have at the provincial shows, that we have never had a better stock of quality cattle.  One reason for that is that farmers have done their job.  They have upgraded the breeding of their cattle.  Travelling the countryside one will see the quality and standard of cattle.  It is sad to think that those cattle are being given away.  Unforeseeable weather beset the grain producers in the south and south-east, but in Cavan and Monaghan in the west, the weather was favourable for grass growing.  We never had a better year for grass, and cattle never looked as well.  It is sad to think that there is no outlet and that these cattle have to be given away.</P>
    <P>According to my research we do not have an abundance of cattle.  We may have a substantial number of breeding stock, but the stock for sale is down on other years.  The reason for that is that cattle are coming to fruition at an earlier age.  The traditional three to four year old bullock is practically gone.  Beef is now being produced at 24 to 36 months.  Progressive farmers are able to finish their cattle at 24 months so that there is no buildup of older stock.  In Cavan-Monaghan, in Leitrim and in the west generally what we are interested in is the sale of weanling stock.  They must be sold because we do not have the facilities to house them over the winter.  The buyers know that there is pressure on farmers to sell in the next fortnight or three weeks.  Bringing in shipping in a month or six weeks' time when the sales are over is of no use.</P>
    <P>It would be a disaster and would have serious consequences for the confidence of farmers in future to continue the job of upgrading and improving.  I compliment them on the improvements they have made to their farms and farmyards to control pollution under the REP scheme. I implore the Minister to reinstitute the installation aid scheme immediately to attract young men to the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and wish him well.  At a time when everybody is celebrating the success of the Celtic Tiger one of the basic parts of the economy is under extreme stress.  The fall in the price of cattle will have a severe impact on farm incomes this year.  It has been predicted that within the next two weeks the price of cattle will fall to 80p per pound leaving no profit margins.  There is therefore a need to ensure competition and export outlets for our cattle in Europe and third countries.  The Egyptian authorities assured the previous Minister, Deputy Yates, that market would be reopened.  I do not know what has happened in the meantime or the reason for the delay.  Expectations were raised following the Minister's visit to Egypt in the past ten days but it has been reported that possibly 2,000 cattle will be exported.  This will have no impact on the crisis.</P>
      <P>A price of 85p per pound is mind-boggling.  Ten years ago when I was involved in the meat trade the price ranged between £1.05 and £1.10 per pound.  At one stage it was as high as £1.20 per pound.  The Government's lack of urgency in seeking to have live export markets reopened is compounding the crisis.  The Minister's failure to secure the £17 million compensation package promised by his predecessor is appalling.  He should ensure he obtains clearance for the immediate payment of the £50 slaughter premium to ease the position.</P>
      <P>During the August weekend in the middle of a deluge the Minister announced his decision to unilaterally withdraw installation aid.  This sends out the wrong signal to those completing their farm certificate course.  The payment of £5,600, which was seen as a carrot, was designed to cover legal expenses in the transfer of land.  This is an indication that the Government is not interested in attracting young people to the industry.  I urge the Minister to endeavour to save one of our basic industries which guaranteed the survival of the economy over many decades, although it is not as important as it once was.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire. Ta siúl agam go mbeidh gach ádh leis san obair atá roimhe.</P>
      <P>On 15 April this year the following words of wisdom were uttered in the House:</P>
      <P>The single most important thing that the Minister can do is seek to have live export markets reopened.  This requires a political initiative.</P>
      <P>The person who uttered those words must have wonderful ideas.  When the Minister has recognised his own words perhaps he will tell us what he has up his sleeve.  He went on to say at volume 477, column 990 of the Official Report on that day:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers know that even the most rapid computer system in the world will not return prices at marts to their previous levels in the same <Col N="387" /> way as the reopening of the live trade market. If the Minister does nothing else in the coming weeks he should visit the capital cities of those third countries and reopen markets for our live cattle trade.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the Minister visited one of the cities in question but without much success.  I said at the time that he seemed to think the only thing that would open them was a corkscrew.  He should not have been so cynical.  Fianna Fáil on its return to power would reopen markets was the song being sung but the big question was how? The Taoiseach has asked us to take the views of the Egyptians into account.  Why was the same respect not shown for the Egyptians' views when Deputy Yates was Minister?</P>
    <P>I support the demand for a restoration of installation aid.  My heart went out to a young farmer who lost out because the necessary documentation did not come through in time from the Land Registry.  People should have been notified well in advance that it was to be discontinued. The Minister should honour the promises made by his party prior to the election and reinstitute the installation aid scheme to give young farmers a head start in the industry.  What he did was wrong.</P>
    <P>The price of beef is governed by a number of factors.  If the big beef producers do not buy in stores this winter the price of beef will be lower than expected.  The Minister will have to make a major effort to convince them that the price will be as high as he is convinced it should be.</P>
    <P>According to the latest official figures reported on radio this evening the profit margins of corn growers, of which they are many in my constituency, have narrowed to £150 per acre.  As the Minister is aware, they cannot sustain these figures for too long.  I ask him to come to their assistance.  Given the bad weather in the south-east this autumn it comes as no surprise that they are in difficulty.  I ask the Minister to assist those farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister and I emphasise the importance of his role.  I noted the Minister's wry smile when Deputy Browne quoted a speech he made last year.  I was in the Chair this morning when similar remarks of the Minister were referred to. The Minister's comment was that there is a change in emphasis from one side of the House to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is saying that it does not matter what one says in Opposition.  One can say anything to get into Government and then one can do what one likes.  That is a cynical approach, both to the Minister's present position and his previous post of spokesman on agriculture.  The Minister should be ashamed of what he said and he should tell farmers: &ldquo;I made a mistake.  That is not what I meant to say.  I am not as cynical as that and I will do all I can for you.&rdquo;<Col N="388" /> Irish farmers are owed £17 million in compensation to beef farmers on the slaughter premium and compensation on the BSE crisis.  That money was promised by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Yates; it is from the Irish Exchequer.  The approval needed from Europe was in the offing before Deputy Yates left office and it would be cynical of the Minister not to deliver the money owed to farmers.  Those farmers have budgeted for receiving that money and are entitled to it. When one sees how prices have gone, it is clear they must get it.  If the Minister does not deliver, he will be reneging on a strong promise.  Will he do that for political expediency?  I do not think so because he is decent, but he must shape up and deliver the goods for the farmers.</P>
    <P>In relation to installation grant aid, I have spoken to a number of young people, some of whom were on the point of applying and others who had further to go.  The Minister will be aware that getting all the documentation together, getting the land into one's own name and completing the agricultural course is a slow business.  Many farmers had begun the initial procedures and receiving the £5,600 in grant aid was part of their plans.  It was disastrous for them that the Minister cancelled this scheme with the stroke of a pen in August.  It is particularly disappointing when one considers the commitments made by the Minister as spokesman for agriculture to Macra na Feirme in relation to young farmers.  The Minister made promises willy-nilly and failed when the chips were down.  It is no wonder that people become cynical about politicians when that is the case. The attitude of the Minister this morning regarding those promises emphasises that point.</P>
    <P>The final word will go to the Independent Deputies who claim to represent rural communities such as Deputies Healy-Rae, Fox and Blaney. We have heard them speak many times of preserving rural communities.  Tonight they can stand foursquare behind the farmers and vote for Deputy Coveney's motion.  Alternatively, they may throw up their hands and say they do not care what happens to rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the lethargic attitude of the Minister and his Department regarding farmers who have been devastated by the collapse of cattle prices over the past six months.  Stability will not return to the cattle industry unless and until the export of live cattle resumes.  The Minister was very vehement in Opposition and seemed very critical of his predecessor, Deputy Yates.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister has made little or no progress in opening up the live export trade to Russia or the Middle East.  The Minister's election manifesto pledged that on his return to the Department of Agriculture and Food, he would immediately do so, but, four months since then, not one animal has been exported live from Ireland.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister went to Cairo and returned with only a half-hearted promise from the Egyptian authorities that they would agree to consider accepting a trial shipment of 2,500 animals subject to certain conditions.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;consider&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister need only visit Bandon Mart any Monday to see the 2,500 animals to fill that shipload. I will only believe that trial shipload leaves if I see it, and that will probably happen when the cattle season finishes.  It is cold comfort to the beleaguered farmers who are held to ransom by the meat factories, which have no opposition when there are no live exports.  Competition is the life of trade.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a huge market exists in mainland Europe for finished cattle of 600 to 700 kgs?  Why does he not immediately allow reputable Cork and Kilkenny livestock exporters to utilise the services of a ship, the <i>Caroline,</i> which they have chartered and which was engaged in cattle transport, breeding, feeding and slaughtering stock, from this country from 1990 to 1994?  The ship was surveyed by the Danish marine authorities and complies with Danish regulations, which implement the EU directive 91/628/EC.  It should not, therefore, be debarred from loading in Ireland.  The vessel also carries a permit for world-wide trade and transportation of stock.</P>
      <P>The Minister should wake up before it is too late, cut out the red tape and bureaucracy and allow this vessel to ply between Cork and European ports immediately.  Only a few weeks I was with the Minister at the presentation of more than 125 certificates to young students in the Bandon area.  The previous day I attended the presentation of 125 certificates in Clonakilty.  Unfortunately, through no fault of his own, the Minister was unable to attend that presentation, although he was there in spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has debarred 250 qualified young farmers in his constituency from receipt of farm installation grant.  He should let commonsense prevail and look after the young farmers in his <Col N="390" /> constituency and throughout Ireland.  One eighth of the 2,000 young farmers who qualified are from the Minister's constituency of Cork SouthWest. Will the Minister restore the farm installation grant, the only incentive for young farmers today?  The Minister gave that promise during the general election and I ask him to implement it.</P>

      <P>I have rarely seen the level of despair and despondency which has engulfed the farming community.  We are specifically talking about the beef, small dairy and cereal sectors, which faces difficulties because of the bad weather conditions.  I acknowledge the presence in the public gallery of the president of the United Farmers Association.  This sector is largely voiceless and the criticisms expressed recently by a former president of the IFA about how the organisation has lost its way in terms of representing the needs of large sections of the agricultural community are evident by the absence of members of the IFA.  In the past, in times less difficult, large numbers from such organisations attended debates.</P>
      <P>We spend much time wondering why politics and politicians are held in such low esteem.  It has as much to do with the McCracken tribunal report and recent scandals as with promises made and words spoken in this Chamber which are not acted on subsequently.  Many of my colleagues quoted from the Minister's contributions to previous agriculture debates which will come back to haunt him.</P>
      <P>Live exports are critical.  A ship and markets are available yet we are placing a self-imposed exile on ourselves &mdash; a quarantine of our own making &mdash; because the Minister will not sign a regulation to allow that ship to sale.  The ship meets all EU regulations but does not meet Irish ones.  Will the Minister seriously consider the question of live exports?  Markets are available to us which are not as difficult as the Egyptian and other third country markets, and I ask the Minister to respond to that issue.</P>

When Pandora withdrew from our market, it left us without a way to export cattle.  The export market in Europe is now available.  We should also recognise the Minister had the ban lifted from County Wexford.  The former Minister made a promise on 5 June, close to election day on 8 June, yet nothing was done.

      <P>I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on their appointments.  Live exports is the most important issue with which the Minister of State has dealt.  I represent the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim to which the export of weanlings is very important.  I do not understand the reason the problem has remained unsolved for so long.  I agree with the majority of my colleagues who said the cynical comments made by the Minister when he was Opposition spokesman on agriculture sent out the wrong vibes and signals to people who honestly believed the Opposition, when returned to Government, would put procedures in place which would allow for the export of weanlings and live exports to mainland Europe and third countries.  Unfortunately, nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>A number of my Fianna Fáil colleagues in Sligo-Leitrim went around the constituency during the general election saying the control of farmyard pollution grant would be reintroduced. This is an important grant which the Government should reintroduce.  It was a pre-election promise, yet neither the Minister, since coming into office, nor my constituency colleague have suggested reintroducing this grant.  I ask the Minister to ensure the CFP grant is reintroduced as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>The Teagasc centre in Ballinamore, County Leitrim, has been up and running for a number of years but has been under pressure.  I understand a decision was taken at the last meeting of the board of Teasgasc to close the centre.  Will the Minister state that he has made a decision, in principle, not to allow the centre in Ballinamore to close.  A number of jobs are involved and the farming community in that part of the country need research and development.  It would be a retrograde step if the Department and the Minister allowed the Teagasc centre in Ballinamore to close.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate, although we need a more substantive one on this issue which I hope we will have before Christmas.  Looking at the prospects for farmers, the Minister and the Ministers of State face a major challenge.  Agricultural inflation is running at about 5 per cent compared to national inflation of .8 per cent.  Gross incomes <Col N="392" /> this year will probably be down about 10 per cent. We must look at that scenario when we address the problems facing the agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>I remember when the Minister's predecessor assumed office at the end of 1994 we were faced with having to deal with the baggage emanating from the beef tribunal and the festering problem of BSE which did not really manifest itself until 1996.  Despite that, in 1995, we had the highest agricultural incomes in the history of this State which held up in 1996 and which, in real terms, will be repeated this year.  That was achieved by a very active Minister who, whenever a crisis arose, proved his capacity to negotiate in Europe by obtaining approximately £180 million compensation. However, we have not yet received that compensation despite having been informed it was imminent, a reflection on the very casual attitude of the Minister to this problem.  While the months of August and September may not be the busiest in Brussels, the feeling within the farming community generally &mdash; some of whom I am delighted to see represented in the public gallery this evening &mdash; is that this Minister and Government, despite all the commitments outlined by Deputy Coveney in introducing this motion, are totally ignoring the present plight of farmers.</P>
      <P>In March 1996 we experienced the worst ever crisis in agriculture but responded to it.  The Minister's predecessor went out, fought for compensation in Europe, overcame the odds and was very successful but that same urgency does not appear to be present now.  I appeal to the Minister to emulate his predecessor, to go out and fight for the compensation required in the cereal and other sectors.</P>
      <P>While recognising that the Minister has established an expert group to examine the future of the beef industry, no doubt his officials will agree that now more than ever we need a national futuristic plan for the industry.  The Minister's predecessor had justified the overall base for an equality insurance scheme and had taken on the issue of food safety, which meant that the Minister inherited a very good position overall.  More than anything else that vitality and commitment to the agricultural sector is now needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the £17 million compensation due to be paid, I know how slowly the European Union Commission moves on such issues, as I had one such experience with regard to requests for an increased level of Leader funding, about which a proposal was submitted months ago for community and tourism projects.  I learned yesterday, in reply to a parliamentary question that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on the matter.  I assure the Minister that the only way he will obtain such a decision is to go over to Brussels and exert pressure there, which obviously has not been done over the months of August and September.  Those £17 million, of such importance to beef producers between now and Christmas, is there for the sake of negotiation since, as Deputy Coveney pointed out, Commissioner <Col N="393" /> Fischler promised the Minister's predecessor that that commitment would be honoured.</P>
    <P>I envisage major challenges and problems ahead for our agricultural industry which warrant a fuller debate than that just concluding.  I compliment Deputy Coveney on having brought the overall issue of agriculture to the forefront within the short time since his appointment as Opposition spokesman on the subject.</P>
    <P>In previous debates here on agriculture I remember the Fianna Fáil Party, then in Opposition, would have the public gallery full of representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, the ICMSA and others &mdash; while acknowledging the presence here this evening of Mr. Michael O'Callaghan representing the United Farming Organisation in the gallery &mdash; intent on telling farmers what they would do for them.  Indeed they set up a reign of terror throughout rural Ireland, promising farmers what they would do for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>This short debate centred on five or six topics.  First, the overall question of reopening markets for live exports to the European Union where the issue is about shipping and to third countries where the issues are more complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned using a specific ship <i>&ldquo;The Purbeck&ldquo;</i> which, if true, I welcome wholeheartedly.  A ferry is not ideal in the case of the other trade about which we have been speaking, <Col N="394" /> for which purpose I would ask the Minister to consider using the <i>Caroline.</i></P>
    <P>I accept the criticism that Deputy Yates, when Minister, brought in a regulation which renders the task more difficult for his successor but it does not render it impossible.  I hope the Minister will examine the matter on a one or two shipment trial basis and no more which, if possible, would alleviate the position.</P>
    <P>I do not need to refer at length to the early removal of the Russian ban on our imports, something everybody wishes to achieve as quickly as possible.  I ask the Minister to put his shoulder to that endeavour because it has spin-offs in third countries and so on.</P>
    <P>The payment of national compensation to beef producers in the sum of £17 million has led to much comment.  I was concerned to note that the Minister was very strong on platitudes and bureaucratic statements but very weak on specifics in the course of his remarks, since all he had to say about that was that he was hopeful there will be a satisfactory outcome to the issue in the near future.  That is hardly good enough in the month of October for those farmers expecting such payments.  I hope the Minister will take stronger action on that issue.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister's party gave a very strong commitment to the reintroduction of installation aid, it is a political imperative.  Although the Minister explained at Question Time yesterday some of the reasons he sought not to do so, young farmers found those reasons very difficult to accept.  Indeed one of the Minister's own party colleagues said that if he were able to deal with even those applications already submitted, or place a time limit on such grants, it would help because a small number of farmers feel very badly let down in that respect.</P>
    <P>The control of farmyard pollution was also mentioned.  We had all been hopeful that the mid-term review would enable whichever Government was in office to obtain additional funding for that scheme so central to the future of rural life, the preservation of the environment, sustainable farming and so on.  I hope the Minister will be able to procure funding for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed there was so little, in any really specific sense, forthcoming from the Minister in response to some Members' queries, not least those in respect of grain growers.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say he hopes to have a report shortly and that he will then be in a position to make an overall assessment which will give a more precise overview of crop damage. The people whose harvests are devastated will regard that statement as weak.  I hope the Minister will examine some of the suggestions I made this morning with a view to helping grain growers whose incomes have been devastated in the south and south east.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the possibility of having a substantive debate in Government time before Christmas.  I ask the Minister to consider that favourably because many issues cannot be <Col N="395" /> dealt with in detail if Members have only five minutes to contribute.  Perhaps in a month or two from now we can have a debate on agriculture in <Col N="396" /> Government time.  I ask the Minister to give that serious consideration.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - National Task Force Report on Suicide.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, for coming into the House to reply.  I know he has an interest in this area because we discussed this issue previously.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Health and Children to immediately publish the report of the National Task Force on Suicide.  The work of the task force was completed before Easter, but the publication of its report was delayed.  There is an urgent need to introduce suicide prevention programmes.  The Minister has a responsibility to tackle this problem. The publication of the report of the task force, which will herald a public debate on approaches to the problem, is an important first step in dealing with the issue.  The Minister should not delay any longer in dealing with it.</P>
      <P>The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, set up the task force in November 1995.  It produced its interim report in July 1996.  It contained a detailed analysis of existing data relating to suicide, attempted suicide and associated factors.  The former Minister had envisaged that by the end of 1996 the task force would have published its completed work, but this has not happened to date.</P>
      <P>I note from a Minister's reply to a written question I tabled yesterday that there were 378 recorded suicides in 1996, l4 fewer than in l994. However, there is an upward trend in the suicide rate.  There were 327 recorded suicides in l993, 357 in 1994 and 378 last year compared to approximately 60 in the 1960s and 1970s.</P>
      <P>This distressing trend has been evident for more than 20 years and there has been very little serious discussion about it.  Suicide is still part of the hidden Ireland.  Society is not equipped to deal with the issue and cannot shake off the stigma or remove the taboo surrounding it.  That must change.  Irish society must wake up and deal with this serious public health issue.  It must be discussed in a compassionate and informed way. We have a responsibility as a society and a State to respond to those who feel suicidal.  They must know that services are available and where to seek help.  There must be an immediately widely known understanding and compassionate approach to the problem.</P>
      <P>I pay special tribute to the excellent work of the Samaritans and the Friends of the Suicide Bereaved.  However, the State also has a duty.  It has been almost totally lacking in providing services in this area for the community.  It has a duty to be responsive to those who have suicide ideation or those who attempt it.</P>
      <P>There are two approaches to the problem.  The first is to do nothing based on the idea that suicides are rare unpredictable events and that the rate fluctuates independent of service development or human intervention.  That approach is neither human nor scientific.  It is out of step with what has been done in other advanced societies. The alternative is to establish a national policy as has been done in Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany and Britain.  There has been a downturn in the number of suicides in those countries, particularly among the young and this has been attributed to the effectiveness of national programmes.</P>
      <P>The prerequisite to our doing something is the publication of the report of the national task force and it is now almost 12 months since its expected publication.  I ask the Minister to publish the report and allow a public debate on its findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Neville for raising this issue on the Adjournment. I am fully committed to publishing the final report of the National Task Force on Suicide at the earliest possible date.  The report is at an advanced stage of preparation.  My Department is consulting other relevant Departments on the costs of implementing the recommendations of the report.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have seen an increase in the numbers of reported suicides and attempted suicides over the past 20 years.  Between l945 and l995 the number of deaths attributed to suicide in Ireland rose from 71 to 383.  The figure in l995 represented an increase of 8.5 per cent on that of l994.  As the Deputy is aware the issue of suicide is complex and constitutes a serious social and health problem.</P>
      <P>The rise in the suicide rate is not confined to Ireland, it is a global problem on which the World Health Organisation in its Health for All document has recommended action to reverse this rising trend by the year 2000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment for certain groups of people.  The National Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future, expressed concern about the increase in the rate of suicide, especially among our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> In order that help and support might be given to those at risk from suicide it is essential that all factors associated with suicide and suicidal behaviour are clearly identified and understood.  With this in mind a National Task Force on Suicide was established in November l995 with the following terms of reference.  They include: to define numerically and qualitatively the nature of the suicide problem in Ireland; to define and to quantify the problems of attempted suicide and parasuicide in Ireland, including the associated costs involved; to make recommendations on how service providers can most cost effectively address the problems of attempted suicide and parasuicide; to identify the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities; and to formulate, following consultation with all interested parties, a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>The task force comprises individuals from a range of backgrounds, including coroners, the Garda Síochána, nursing, psychiatry, psychology, public health and voluntary organisations, to which should be added GPs.  In its interim report published in l996, the task force addressed its first two terms of reference.  It contained a detailed analysis of statistics relating to suicide and attempted suicide in Ireland and included a preliminary analysis of the factors which might possibly contribute to changes in the incidence of suicide.</P>
    <P>The task force then addressed its other terms of reference and considered, in detail, the numerous submissions received, written and oral, from interested individuals and organisations.  The task force conducted a major consultative process in the formulations of the national prevention strategy. Careful consideration has been given to the views expressed by all interested parties and this material has been of enormous benefit in the preparation of the national strategy.</P>
    <P>There are several questions and theories surrounding the issues of why people are driven to taking or attempting to take their own lives.  The task force in its brief has attempted to unravel from an Irish perspective some of the many factors influencing suicide in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The findings and recommendations of the task force point to a multi-sectoral approach to tackling this complex issue.  It is clear that the implementation of a national prevention strategy is not only confined to the health services.  If we are to be successful in reducing the numbers who commit suicide and the numbers of attempted suicide, we must ensure that there is partnership and a collective approach to tackling the problem.  I am confident that the consultative approach can only heighten the Government's determination to tackle this serious problem.  The final report of the National Task Force on Suicide and, in particular, the national strategy will be a benchmark in responding to this complex and tragic issue.  I assure the Deputy it is the intention to have the report published as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to respond.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter in response to reports from the United Kingdom which point to serious and worrying dangers posed by the use of a shampoo for the treatment of head lice containing Malathion, an active ingredient in it, and an organophosphate.  I raise this issue in an attempt to highlight the concerns, particularly of parents, about these reports.  Malathion, like all organophosphates, is a poisonous and dangerous pesticide, and since children are the main users of these products it is vital that the British reports are studied closely and their implications acted upon.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter on foot of a report on the British television programme &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; last Monday, which referred to a scientific study carried out in the UK indicating that users of these shampoos can absorb between five and ten times what are considered to be safe levels of malathion when used to treat head lice.  I do not have to tell you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, or the Minister, Deputy Moffatt, that organophosphates are toxic and act on the nervous system.  The concerns attaching to them are rather wider than their effects in shampoo &mdash; a number of farmers in the UK have shown symptoms associated with the use of products containing these chemicals.  Three head lice shampoos which are licensed for use and available in Ireland contain organophosphates.</P>
      <P>There are a number of aspects of this matter. A certain level of information is now available on the dangers associated with these products.  Science is developing all the time and it is important that we be up to date with what is happening. There is a risk of improper use of these products by consumers, if an inadequate level of attention is given to the dangers associated with them if they are not used in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions.  Are the Minister's Department and the health promotion agencies conducting research into the implications of the British studies as reported this week?  Do they have a coherent plan to ensure consumers are fully aware of the dangers which may be attached to the use of these products and how they should cope with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that the Minister should respond to the worrying results found this week by British scientists.  Head lice shampoo and malathion are mostly used on a vulnerable section of the community, that is, children.  We must make every effort to research the full implications of the use of organophosphates and thoroughly investigate any hint of harmful effects.  We must also take this opportunity to engage in an active campaign to inform parents of the dangers or overuse or improper use of these products.  In this context I ask the Minister to request the Department's <Col N="401" /> health promotion unit to develop an action programme to inform parents and other users of the safe ways in which these products can be used, any risks which might be attached to their improper use, and the broader question of whether the use of these products should be discontinued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter.  I am aware of recent reports in the media concerning the possible dangers which may arise from the use of certain shampoos which may contain the organophosphate malathion and which are intended for the treatment of infestation by head lice.  The position at present is that a number of such products are available on the market in Ireland.  Because of the nature of the products, they are restricted for sale only through pharmacies.  The products in question have been licensed in Ireland for some years and are the subject of product authorisations in accordance with the requirements of the Medical Preparations (Licensing and Sale) Regulations, 1996. Such authorisations would only have been granted after full assessment by the former National Drugs Advisory Board, including the relative safety of the products.  The products are intended only for extremely limited use to deal with head lice and should not be used on a regular basis.</P>
      <P>Following the media reports, the matter was referred to the Irish Medicines Board which has advised me that, to date, it has received only isolated reports of suspected adverse reactions associated with their use.  Although the board has not received any scientifically validated data which would warrant any regulatory action in relation to the products at this stage, nonetheless, it is seeking clarification of the media reports and has assured me it will take any appropriate action which may be considered necessary in the light of any information or evidence which might become available that would alter the risk-benefit ratio of the treatment.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister for Health and Children and I are most concerned to ensure that all medicinal products should be subject to the most rigorous scrutiny from a public health point of view and to establish, as far as possible, the relative safety of the products in accordance with acceptable risk-benefit ratios.  I stress, however, in relation not only to these products but to all medicines, that such products should only be used as and when absolutely necessary and strictly in accordance with the information provided.  If any symptoms persist or if the users need any further advice, they should always consult their doctor or pharmacist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: In the High Court on Tuesday 30 September Mr. Justice Moriarty ordered the Director of Public Prosecutions not to proceed with a charge of assault against a <Col N="402" /> Kilkenny man pending a judicial review.  The defendant had previously been before the District Court on 2 September, charged with assault contrary to common law.</P>
      <P>In his submission to the District Court the defendant's solicitor applied to have the charge struck out on the grounds that the offence was &ldquo;no longer known to law&rdquo;.  He argued that the offence had been abolished by a section of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997.  This Act was widely acclaimed in that it set down specific and effective measures to deal with the use of syringes in robberies and muggings. However, it also took up a proposal in a 1994 report by the Law Reform Commission which suggested the need for re-codification of the law on assault.  In line with this recommendation, section 28 (1) of the Act abolished the common law offence of assault and battery.  This provision came into effect on 19 August.  The draftspersons apparently relied on the Interpretation Act, 1937, which lays down that the abolition of a statutory offence shall not prejudice outstanding cases under the statute.  The legal point at issue is whether assault and battery is a statutory or, as argued by the accused's solicitor, a common law offence.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter to establish whether, in passing an excellent Act, the Oireachtas unwittingly may have given an implicit amnesty to all persons facing charges of assault and battery at the time the measure came into force.  It seems the DPP cannot now proceed with the hundreds of cases of assault of innocent victims in the current legal and judicial vacuum.  I ask the Minister to state what course of action or redress is available to him.</P>

      <P>The facts giving rise to the subject matter of this debate are briefly as follows. On 2 September 1997 Mr. Michael Mullins was charged before the District Court at Kilkenny with common assault, breach of section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 and breach of section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994.  The solicitor for the accused applied to have the charge of common assault struck out.  The basis of the application was that section 28 of the recently enacted NonFatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 which came into operation on 20 August had abolished the common law offences of assault and battery.  The accused's legal advisers subsequently applied to the High Court which, on 30 September 1997, gave him leave to apply by way of application for judicial review for an injunction restraining the Director of Public Prosecutions from continuing the prosecution of the accused for assault.  The court also ordered that the District Court proceedings in the charge of assault be stayed until the determination of the application for judicial review.</P>
      <P>The case is awaiting a full hearing in the High Court.  The Attorney General and the Director of</P>

The charges against the accused relating to breaches of sections 4 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 have been adjourned indefinitely by the District Court.  I am sure Deputy Higgins and other Deputies will appreciate that, as the matter of the assault charge is now awaiting judicial review in the High Court to determine the issues involved, it would not be proper for me to make any further comment for the moment on the case or the issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  The people of Trim have been requesting a new boys' secondary school for the past 15 years.  As Taoiseach I was delighted, with the co-operation of the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, to get agreement for building a new community school in Trim to cater for a long-term enrolment of 825 pupils. After difficult discussions and examination of possible sites, a site was obtained from the Bishop of Meath at the back of St. Michael's boys school in Trim, formerly known as the Model School.</P>
      <P>On 29 May 1997 advertisements were placed in the <i>European Journal</i> for the appointment of a consultant architect to prepare the design scheme.  To the best of my knowledge, very little has been done since then, and that is why I am raising the matter.  I visited the school during the week and it is in bad condition.  There are five cubicle toilets to cater for 600 boys.  There is only one science room and one woodwork room.  A payment was due to St. Finian's diocesan trust for the purchase of the site, but it was not paid.  There is a sense in Trim that very little is being done in this regard.</P>
      <P>Following news that I was meeting the parents and management of the school, the Minister for the Environment, who had been requested to meet them, agreed to such a meeting.  Perhaps some progress has been made as a result of that meeting.  I understand the Minister issued a circular indicating that something was being done about the design team.  The Minister for Education should say exactly what will be done about completion of the design, which is stage two in the process, and when the project will move to stages three, four and five.  Will the Minister ensure money is provided in the overall allocation for 1998 for the commencement of building at Trim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand planning permission must be obtained before the other stages can commence, and that cannot be done until the design scheme is finalised.  Many difficulties may arise with the design of a school.  The site in question is a restricted one and it is very important the design work is carried out in conformity with the site.  It is important that the old model school on the site is preserved because it has considerable architectural <Col N="404" /> merit and is part of the historical heritage of Trim.  It could be used for some of the administrative facilities of the school.</P>
    <P>The present phase, the design phase which I initiated as Taoiseach, with the aid of the then Minister, should be completed quickly so that the remaining phases will move forward to the point where the school can draw down money from the 1998 Estimates.  There should be no problem with school building funds in the Estimates.  The economy is doing well at present and most people would attribute that primarily to the excellence of education and the quality of graduates from Irish education.  We should recognise that educating young people in squalid conditions, as is the case in Trim, does not give the best start in life.  I hope the Minister will give us good news on this occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for raising the issue of the second level school in Trim.  I would like to provide some background details regarding the proposed new community school in Trim, County Meath.  Approval was given for the provision of a new community school to replace the existing St. Michael's CBS and vocational school in Trim following a detailed feasibility study of the options for second level education in the area.</P>
      <P>Because of the additional costs associated with the St. Michael's site, my Department had no alternative but to examine the possibility of acquiring alternative sites in the area.  However, as there were no suitable sites in the Trim area available for school development, the St. Michael's diocesan school was purchased and a design team appointed to undertake the architectural planning.</P>
      <P>The development plan will involve the refurbishment of some buildings, the rebuilding of existing structures of varying ages, the demolition of unusable buildings and the construction of a large extension.  The approximate gross floor areas will be 5,200 square metres.  The design team has been instructed by my Department to prepare stage two of architectural planning &mdash; the outline sketch scheme &mdash; and this will be submitted within the next six weeks.  I stress that while every effort will be made to expedite the planning of the school, the timing of release to contract for building work will very much depend on the rate of progress for architectural planning up to the point where tenders can be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project at Trim is a major capital investment by the State involving a substantial input of technical and professional expertise.  The technical task involved is made even more complex by the necessity to incorporate some of the existing buildings on the St. Michael's site into the new development.  As a consequence, it is extremely difficult to give a precise timetable for completion of the building at this early stage in the development. However, I fully appreciate the importance of completing work on the new community school at Trim.  The Minister for the Environment has <Col N="405" /> been in touch with me on the issue and this project is receiving high priority.</P>
    <P>It was unfortunate that in advance of the election considerable commitments were given &mdash; I am not saying this is one of the projects on which a commitment was given &mdash; while the exact amount of money to meet those commitments was not available.  That has created difficulties, but in the context of the 1998 Estimates, with which we are dealing at present, the picture will be clearer in terms of the detailed funding allocations to each school project.  This project will receive very high priority because of the reasons <Col N="406" /> outlined by the Deputy.  I agree with his comments that the economy is doing well because of wise decisions made in the past by a previous generation of politicians who invested in education. It continues to be the aim of the Government to invest in education because that is the cornerstone of future economic progress.</P>

      <P>First, an assessment of the likely impact on Government revenue flows, balancing increased VAT and excise receipts from domestic sales against any changes in corporation tax or social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Second, the possible impact on employment for airports and air carriers and for seaports and ferry operators.  Any consequence on &ldquo;out of season&rdquo; winter travel for the ferry operators will also be covered.  Employment in this case means those directly employed by the ports and carriers-ferry operators.  The effect on seasonal employment will also be included.</P>
      <P>Third, the study will include an assessment of the extent to which travel fares may rise if operators are no longer able to cross-subsidise activities from the profits made on duty free sales.  The study will also assess if there are any implications for freight charges.</P>
      <P>The consultants have been requested to state exactly what assumptions they are making in the study on tourism volumes, consumption levels, employment patterns and growth in the numbers of persons travelling.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have no data available to them to indicate the level of sales or the amount of VAT collected in respect of such sales of the above mentioned recording, or indeed, of any individual recording.</P>
      <P>I understand from media reports that the expected sales of the recording are substantial.  In this regard, I can inform the Deputy that for every £100,000 worth of retail sales, approximately £17,350 goes to the Exchequer in VAT receipts.</P>
      <P>As regards the possible assignment of the VAT collected to charitable purposes, there is no provision in VAT law whereby this could be achieved.  Any donation would have to be made through the public expenditure system and the Government has no plans to do so.  However, the State already provides substantial funding to charitable organisations and provides generous relief from direct taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The decision on who will participate in the third stage of economic and monetary union will be made next year, in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 109j of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Council of Ministers, ECOFIN, will assess whether each member state fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency, on the basis of convergence reports from the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute.  On the basis of these reports, ECOFIN, acting by a qualified majority on a recommendation from the Commission will recommend its findings to the Council, meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, who will, after receiving the opinion of the European Parliament, confirm which member states fulfil the conditions.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom has an opt-out from the provisions on economic and monetary union, under a Protocol attached to the Maastricht Treaty.  Under the terms of the Protocol, the UK shall notify the Council whether it intends to move to the third stage before the Council makes the assessment to which I have referred.  Unless the UK notifies the Council that it intends to move to the third stage, it shall be under no obligation to do so.  If the United Kingdom does not move to the third stage, it may change its notification at any time after the beginning of that stage.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether the UK wishes to enter the third stage of economic and monetary union is a matter for the British Government.  The UK Government has not yet said whether it will exercise this opt-out and has never said that it will never join.  It has only said that it will decide closer to the starting date of 1 January 1999.</P>
      <P>Of course, I regularly meet my colleagues, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at the ECOFIN Council, as well as at other international fora.  I take the opportunity of such contacts to keep myself informed of their thinking on a range of issues and of developments in their countries.  However, the decision on participation is firstly a matter for the UK themselves and I would not expect to be told of their intentions before they had made their own decision in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the press report to which the Deputy refers; however, it would not be appropriate <Col N="410" /> for me to comment on press speculation.  As I understand the position, the British Government approach is fundamentally unchanged at this time &mdash; they have kept open the option of joining at the start of the third stage and will decide on whether or not they wish to enter economic and monetary union closer to the time.  Their position, as set out in the Labour Party election manifesto, is that the single currency is a major step of economic integration, which in principle could bring benefits, and they will make their decision &ldquo;on the basis of the economic merits of the case, when the arguments for Britain are clear&rdquo;.  If they take the view that the UK should join the single currency in the life time of the current Westminster parliament, I understand that there is to be a referendum before the final decision is made.</P>
    <P>While I would, of course, welcome a decision by the UK Governemnt to enter economic and monetary union from the outset, my priority remains ensuring that Ireland qualifies for economic and monetary union and will take part in the third stage from the beginning.  When the Maastricht Treaty received the endorsement of the Irish people, it did so without qualification or any provision for Ireland to opt out from the provisions for economic and monetary union. Membership of economic and monetary union, irrespective of what the UK does, will on balance be of benefit for Ireland, according to both the Economic and Social Research Institute and the National Economic and Social Council.  I believe the economic and monetary union will start on time and that Ireland will play its full part from the start.</P>

In response to this review the 1997 budget and Finance Act contained measures to help the providers of private rented accommodation.

      <Col N="412" /> Section 22 of the 1997 Finance Act provides for a capital allowance of 15 per cent of actual expenditure for years one to six and 10 per cent in year seven to be set off against rental income.  Furthermore, the rule regarding the deductibility of accounting and other administrative costs against rental income were clarified in the February edition of <i>Tax Briefing,</i> which is a Revenue Commissioners publication.  It should also be pointed out that there has been a considerable amount of new rented residential property coming on the market in recent years in various urban centres as a result of the urban renewal incentives for such property.</P>

Bookmakers may not open for business before nine o'clock in the morning or after six o'clock in the evening or on Sunday, Christmas Day or Good Friday.  Enforcement of the opening hours restrictions is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with reviewing the present situation in the light of modern sporting practice and I will be speaking to the Minister for Justice in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the repeal or amendment of section 21 of the Betting Act, 1931 would lead to an increased level of betting in registered premises and, in turn, this would enhance the revenue yield from the excise duty on such betting. However a great deal of betting at evenings and/or Sunday meetings is likely to take place on racecourses and such bets are not liable to excise duty.  It is not possible to give a reasonable estimate of the amount of the extra duty yield which would result from the extension of evening and weekend opening hours.</P>

      <P>The Maastricht Treaty lays down the procedure for the appointment of the executive board of the European Central Bank.  The relevant Articles of the Treaty are 109a and 109l, together with Article 50 of Protocol (No. 3) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank.  When the executive board of the ECB is being established, the president, the vice-president and the other members shall be appointed by common accord of the governments of the member states at the level of Heads of State or Government, on a recommendation from the Council and after consulting the European Parliament and the Council of the European Monetary Institute.</P>
      <P>The composition of the executive board is, therefore, a matter in the first instance for the Council of Ministers.  The EMI will of course be consulted at the appropriate time.  The question of the composition of the board is not one for discussion between individual Ministers and the EMI at this time.</P>
      <P>Under the Treaty, the appointment of the board is to take place immediately after 1 July 1998.  The number of members on the executive board is set at six, including the president and vice-president.  However, the number of members on the board may be reduced to a minimum of four, if there are member states which have derogations and are not proceeding to the third stage of economic and monetary union.  The composition of the board therefore cannot be formally considered until the decision on who is to participate in the third stage has been taken around May of next year.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the importance of ensuring that appointments to the executive board are made in a way that ensures its overall competence for its tasks, and at the same time serves the interests of Ireland and the Union as a whole.  I will be keeping this matter under active review in the coming months in that regard.</P>

    <P>Implementation will be undertaken in accordance with the participative approach provided for under Partnership 2000.  I should point out that there has already been considerable consultation with and involvement by staff and their unions in the design and development of the system.  In particular, the views of staff on how performance is and should be managed were sought in a sample survey of staff throughout the Civil Service. In addition, two project groups, representative of staff in all grades and the unions, are working with the consultants on the design of an appropriate system.</P>
    <P>Performance related pay already operates on a limited basis for certain higher grades in the Civil Service.  Following the successful introduction of a performance management system, the extension of performance related pay to other grades will be considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the impression given in some press reports, the recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed general satisfaction with the results of his examination of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>While the Comptroller and Auditor General did identify shortcomings in some aspects of remittance processing and information analysis on the tax debt, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in many instances these shortcomings in long-standing procedures had been identified by Revenue's own internal reviews and that corrective action had already been initiated.  The Commissioners are confident that their ongoing computerisation programme will address these issues.</P>
      <P>On the overall management of the debt, the Comptroller and Auditor General has expressed broad agreement, subject to adequate safeguards, with the new approach being followed by the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Commissioners in regard to the write-off of old uncollectible arrears.</P>
    <P>The bulk of these old arrears are unreliable estimates from the pre-self assessment era.  There is also a substantial element that relates to companies that have ceased trading.  By elminating the need to divert resources to debts that are uncollectible, a more focused approach can be maintained on arrears that are collectible and also on current taxes.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has already been made through actual collection and write-off in appropriate cases.  The total of outstanding taxes has fallen from £3.5 billion in 1989 to £1.69 billion in 1997.  The outstanding debt, much of which is not collectible for the reasons I have mentioned, now represents 15 per cent of annual total taxes collected as against 57 per cent in 1989 and much higher percentages in earlier years.</P>
    <P>I have had discussions with the Revenue Commissioners and fully support their approach to tax collection as set out in their corporate plan for the period 1997 to 1999.  That approach involves promoting voluntary compliance by improving services to taxpayers and simplifying tax administration as much as possible while, on the other hand, taking tough measures as appropriate.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall strategy, Revenue have set themselves the objective of reducing the historical arrears of tax by £1 billion over the period of the plan.</P>

      <P>New arrangements to simplify the rules for employing a domestic employee in the home have already been provided for in this year's Finance Act. Under the new arrangements, which came into effect from 6 June 1997, the PAYE registration threshold is increased from £6 per week to £30 per week in a situation where an individual employs only one domestic employee in his or her home.</P>
      <P>The effect of this is that such an individual will not need to register as an employer for PAYE purposes or to operate the PAYE system in respect of that employee.  The employee remains liable to income tax on his or her earnings from the employer and will have to declare and pay any tax due direct to his/her Inspector of Taxes.</P>
      <P>In addition, while the employee is not liable for PRSI, employers who come within the scope of the scheme are normally required to pay PRSI at a rate of 0.5 per cent of gross pay (Class J) to cover Occupational Injuries Benefits.  The PRSI is paid directly to the Department of Social Welfare in a single annual payment at the end of the tax year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be helpful to go into the details of industrial disputes, such as that in the National Museum.</P>
      <P>As regards the general issue of flexibility in dealing with public service pay issues, I do not have any problem with that in principle but I feel strongly that now and again we have to stand back and look seriously at where we are in relation to public service pay generally and set the application of approaches like that in the broader context.  The present is one such time.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer returns which were released last week have naturally re-opened the debate about the factors underlying our recent economic success and there have been a number of references to the key role played by wage moderation. As far as the public service is concerned, however, it is clear that, while much has been achieved, overall, things have not worked out as intended and considerable pressures still remain in the system.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Exchequer Pay and Pensions Bill: (a) it is expected to increase by nearly 10 per cent in 1997 and at this point in time a further increase of over 6 per cent is projected for 1998; (b) there was an average year-on-year increase in the pay bill of 7.5 per cent over the period 1989 to 1997; and (c) it continues to account for half of all non-capital supply services expenditure and to absorb 13 per cent of this country's GNP notwithstanding the phenomenal GNP growth rates achieved over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these very significant increases in the pay bill, it is important to emphasise that, contrary to the simplistic analysis of some commentators, increases in the pay bill do not equate to salary increases for public servants.  The labour intensive nature of the public service means that an investment of additional resources in developing new services or improving existing services invariably pushes up public service staffing levels and, therefore, the pay bill.  All of us &mdash; interests <Col N="419" /> groups, the media, the social partners and politicians on both sides of this House &mdash; find it all too easy to press for increased expenditure on various deserving causes without thinking about the impact of this expenditure on the pay bill and then, at a later stage, we express shock and horror at the increase in the pay bill to which this expenditure has contributed.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for this factor, however, it is clear that the old bugbear of special increases, more recently in the form of local bargaining deals, continues to haunt us.</P>
    <P>For the past few years, in terms of public service pay, we have been operating under the PCW pay agreement.  This provided for a means of addressing various outstanding public service pay issues but within certain cost limits and through a negotiation process free from industrial action. A great deal of business was done within this process in various areas of the public service and settlements within the PCW cost norm were reached with about two-thirds of public servants. I gladly acknowledge what was achieved by unions and management on that front.  However, the increases secured earlier this year by several high profile groups &mdash; mainly in the health sector &mdash; clearly went way beyond the cost parameters of the PCW agreement, albeit on the basis of certain unique considerations.</P>
    <P>Although the PCW expired in the public service on 30 June 1997 there are still a number of outstanding cases which remain to be resolved.  I want to make it quite clear that any resolution of these cases can only be achieved within the limit of the PCW cost norm as originally established. I stress this point because there seems to be an impression in some quarters that there is open season on that limit.  Let me state quite categorically that the limit will have to hold.  Not holding this limit could pose a far greater threat to Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that there can be no repeat under Partnership 2000 of the cost drift situation which developed under the PCW.  It is absolutely essential that the 2 per cent limit on local bargaining increases, which is explicitly provided for in the Partnership 2000 agreement, is strictly adhered to.  There can be no blurring of the limit, as happened under the PCW.</P>
    <P>I am committed to Partnership 2000 and I intend to make every effort to ensure it is a success. I am committed to delivery of the tax concessions which underpin the pay terms of the Partnership.  However, partnership is a two-way process and there are worrying signs of a pulling back on commitment among some parties to the pay terms.  When Partnership 2000 was being negotiated, the parties concerned were well aware of the challenges posed by managing rapid growth and it is in everybody's interest that we manage our economy in a balanced and responsible way within the overall framework of the Partnership.</P>

      <P>To operate in the IFSC, companies must receive approval from a certification advisory committee which is chaired by my Department, and which also includes representatives of the other relevant regulatory authorities.</P>
      <P>Since 1 July 1997, this certification advisory committeee has approved the establishment of 23 new stand alone, self-managed projects, and 12 agency operations which will be managed on behalf of the promoters by existing IFSC approved companies.

      <P>As the approvals I have referred to involve a number of different types of project or agency, the Deputy will appreciate that the employment associated with each of the approvals differs depending on the type of operation being established.

      <P>The ESRI report was commissioned by my Department in partnership with the European Commission as part of the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework.  The ESRI estimated that the effect of the Structural Fund interventions on employment in the economy would peak at in excess of 30,000 over the latter years of the current spending round, reflecting the temporary impact of expenditure element of the CSF <Col N="422" /> on the level of demand in the economy.  The ESRI estimated that the long-run impact of the CSF would be to raise the level of employment in the economy permanently by about 5,000.  This reflects the effect of the Structural Funds in enhancing the supply capacity of the economy.</P>
      <P>These estimates are based on analysis carried out by the ESRI using the institute's medium-term model of the Irish economy.  It is considered that model based assessments of the impact of the CSF are best equipped to capture the complex interaction of econominc factors affected by investments under the CSF.  However, as is well known economic forecasts &mdash; particularly long-range economic forecasts &mdash; must be treated with caution.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> I am generally satisfied with the number of audits carried out by the Revenue Commissioners under the various tax audit programmes.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Revenue audits are targeted audits.  This means that most cases are chosen for audit following a risk analysis which may suggest the possibility of incorrect returns for any of the taxes.  Selection of cases on this basis has proved to be very successful.  It is also less intrusive on compliant taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The level of audit activity varies from year to year depending on the audit programme undertaken by the Revenue Commissioners.  The scope and extent of the audit programmes, in general, reflects Revenue's professional assessment from year to year of where tax is most at risk and where resources might therefore be devoted to best effect.</P>
    <P>The explanation for the reduction in the number of cases audited and the yield from those audits in 1996 relative to 1995 was provided by the Revenue Commissioners in response to inquiries by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is outlined in his report for 1996.  The most important factor was the change in audit strategy to larger cases and comprehensive audits covering all tax heads.  It should be noted that despite the decline in absolute numbers of audits and resultant yield, the audits actually undertaken in 1996 led to a higher average yield per audit than in 1995.</P>
    <P>The purpose of random audits is to demonstrate that there is a risk of audit for every self-assessing taxpayer.  The results show that the additional yield from random audits was significantly less than what was achieved from targeted audits.  For this reason the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that the main emphasis will continue to be placed on identifying audit cases through the screening process rather than on expanding the random aspect of the programme.</P>
    <P>On this basis, Revenue's targeted approach is the most effective means of collecting unpaid taxes.  The operation of the audit programme is of course kept under review by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The Taxation Policy Group, chaired by Commissioner Monti, met once since 1 July 1997.  A further meeting of the group is scheduled for 20 October.</P>
      <P>The group is not due to produce a report by the end of 1997.  However, the group is examining Commission proposals for a tax package which includes a voluntary code of conduct to counter harmful tax competition and measures to address certain tax-related distortions affecting the Single Market.  The Commission proposals will be discussed at the ECOFIN Council of Ministers meeting on 13 October and the Commission is seeking to have the proposals adopted by the Council before the year end.</P>
      <P>As regards the code of conduct, it is proposed that this would be in the nature of a voluntary political agreement which would not amend or override Community law and which would respect the principle of subsidiarity whereby taxation policy remains the prerogative of the member states.  In the discussions so far, we have sought to ensure that Irish interests are fully safeguarded and I can assure the House that we will continue to take a strong line against any proposals or suggestions which could be damaging to our interests.  I should emphasise that the code of conduct is not aimed at standardising or harmonising corporation tax rates and we would be opposed to any moves in this direction as this would go way beyond the objective of tackling harmful tax competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>Section 43 of the Finance Act, 1968, introduced an exemption from road tax for vehicles adapted or constructed for and used by disabled persons, who in the main would have been confined to wheelchairs.  The scheme was later extended to allow for relief from VAT and excise duty (replaced by Vehicle Registration Tax with effect from 1 January 1993) on the acquisition of a vehicle and from excise on the petrol uses.  Medical certification was by the disabled person's own doctor and required that the person be &ldquo;wholly or almost wholly without the use of each of his (her) legs&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The limited medical criteria applying under the scheme were seen as being excessively restrictive and, in addition, the piecemeal fashion in which the scheme developed gave rise to a number of anomalies and abuses.  Therefore a framework for a new consolidated scheme of reliefs was provided for under section 92 of the Finance Act, 1989.  The regulations, made under that Act, set out criteria for eligibility for the reliefs as well as specifying their scope and various procedures to be complied with in order to qualify for benefit.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the provisions set out in the 1989 scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the <i>Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</i>  Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.  These regulations were drawn up following consultation with the Departments of Health and Children, Environment and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, and Opposition spokespersons for Finance.  The scope of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in the course of the review, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to many additional categories of disabled people.  The review recommended that the existing specific medical criteria should remain largely unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to define precisely in layperson's terms the degree of restricted mobility which would be involved in qualifying under the scheme.  Each claimant is judged by the appropriate certifying physicians on a case-by-case basis <Col N="426" /> in accordance with the strict medical criteria laid down in the regulations.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the operation of the scheme is kept under constant review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at the outset that the examination of the tax affairs of any individual or institution in the State is a matter solely for the Revenue Commissioners. The Minister for Finance does not get involved in such cases for obvious reasons.  This is the position which has been accepted in the House since the foundation of the State.  I understand that my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, on radio recently entirely endorsed that position.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the findings of the Dunnes Stores tribunal of inquiry, the Revenue Commissioners have already made it clear, following the tribunal report, that any action needed to uphold the implementation of the tax code in the light of the information contained in the report is being taken.</P>
      <P>Immediately on publication of the tribunal report, I requested the Revenue Commissioners, in conjunction with my Department, to carry out a review of their existing powers, which are substantial, in the light of the findings of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The last major change in Revenue powers was given effect to in the 1992 Finance Act and included reporting arrangements for domestic institutions in relation to the opening of foreign bank accounts by Irish residents.  Revenue powers were further extended in 1993, and penalties for tax evasion were significantly increased, in conjunction with the introduction of the tax amnesty. As regards access to bank accounts, the Revenue Commissioners are empowered to seek access through the courts, or, in certain circumstances, through the appeal commissioners, to the bank accounts of named individuals resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the existence of these various powers is an important factor in underpinning voluntary compliance with the tax laws by the vast majority of taxpayers.  Where necessary, the powers are formally brought into play by Revenue in support of their investigations.  It is important that the right balance be maintained so that adequate powers are available and their use is targeted mainly on those actually evading tax.  However, if the <Col N="427" /> present review of Revenue powers indicates that additional powers are required and these are shown to be desirable and likely to be effective, they will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole area of off-shore accounts is a difficult one.  The possibility of obtaining information from foreign authorities is severely constrained. The Deputy will be aware that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal call on the tribunal to make whatever recommendations it considers necessary, <i>inter alia</i>, for the protection of the State's tax base from fraud or evasion in the establishment and maintenance of off-shore accounts, and to recommend whatever changes in the tax law should be made to achieve this end.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest forecast for inflation in 1997 is about 1 1/2 per cent.  The 1997 forecast published in the <i>Economic Background to the Budget</i> was 2.2 per cent. It compares with the post-budget forecast of 2.3 per cent from the Central Bank (March 1997) and 1.8 per cent from the ESRI (April 1997).  Forecasts from the major stockbrokers varied from 2.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Ireland is considered to be a textbook example of a small open economy.  Because of this it is reasonable to assume that a major determination of inflation is the interaction of exchange rate changes and international inflation.  The budget time forecast was based on the assumption that the change in the effective exchange rate during the second half of 1996 would feed into domestic prices during 1997 due to the normal lags associated with the translation of exchange rate movements into prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These movements have not been reflected in the consumer price index to date this year.  There are a number of possible explanations for this. Greater competition in retailing is undoubtedly playing a significant role in keeping prices down. This is particularly evident in the clothing and footwear sector, where the influx of UK retailers has helped promote greater price competition. Clothing and footwear prices have fallen by no less than 10 per cent in the year to August last. In addition it is possible that some UK exporters may have cut the price of their exports to offset the increased value of sterling.  Also some importers may have switched to alternative, cheaper sources for their goods, although we <Col N="428" /> must wait on more substantial CSO trade data in order to verify this.</P>
    <P>Our inflation forecasting methodology is kept constantly under review and any necessary adjustment will be made to ensure that the best possible projections are made.</P>

      <P>Last month's informal ECOFIN agreed that, at the same time as the participants in stage 3 of EMU are announced around May next year, there will be a pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states.  These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and, in line with the Treaty on European Union, the actual setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.  As regards the conversion rate of the Irish pound, I will only say that the Irish Government's intention is that Ireland joins EMU at an exchange rate that meets the needs of the economy in the fullest sense of the term, and that between now and decision day we will be keeping the issue under active review. <Col N="429" /></P>

      <P>I am very aware of the concerns of public servant pensioners about their pension increases.  This is recognised in the Government's joint programme &mdash; An Action Programme for the Millennium &mdash; which states that public service pensions will be protected.  Against this background of protecting public sector pensions, I have been considering options for uprating pensions in the particular circumstances of restructuring deals under the PCW provisions and I expect to announce a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The study referred to in the Deputy's question is a very comprehensive analysis from both a macroeconomic and sectoral perspective of the economic implications of EMU membership for Ireland.  As the Deputy will be aware the report concluded that, on balance, membership of EMU, even were the UK not to join, would be beneficial for Ireland.  In arriving at this conclusion the report took fully into account the prospective impact of future economic shocks, including possible <Col N="430" /> turbulence in the sterling-euro exchange rate. On this basis I see no need to revise or update the report.</P>

      <P>In June 1996 the Government set core staffing targets for each Department, which were to be achieved by 1 July 1997.  Some of these targets were subsequently modified by the Government, to make allowance for additional work or transfer of work from one Department to another, giving an overall target of 29,457.5.</P>
      <P>On 1 July 1997, I am pleased to say, the number of civil servants was 28,955, well within the target.</P>
      <P>A number of Departments have been allowed to retain staff for transient tasks on a temporary basis.  Such staff are known as &ldquo;non-core&rdquo; or &ldquo;transient&rdquo;.  The staff who were working on the census in the Central Statistics Office are an example.  These staff must be given up after the work in question has been completed, with the staff concerned being absorbed into fillable vacancies within their own Department or being redeployed into other Departments.</P>
      <P>The staffing levels for each Department at 1 July 1997 against the latest targets are shown in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  The names of the Departments and the Departmental line up in this tabular statement reflect those which were in force on that date.</P>

      <P>Total expenditure on occupational pensions in the public service which excludes the commercial state companies amounted to £608 million in 1996, which was equivalent to 1.6 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>I do not have any direct responsibility in respect of pensions in the private sector (other than in relation to tax matters).  However an ESRI report &ldquo;Occupational and Personal Pension Coverage 1995&rdquo; which was prepared for the Department of Social Welfare and The Pensions Board and published in 1996 estimated that total payments for funded schemes for the year ending 1994 amounted to £461 million, i.e. approximately 1.4 per cent of GNP.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the growth in construction industry activity, particularly in the Dublin area, has generated a very substantial increase in the number of relevant contract tax deduction certificate (C45) repayment claims received by the Revenue office in Dublin dealing with the industry.  It is calculated that the total number of such repayment claims received in 1997 will exceed 30,000 as compared with a figure of 17,600 for 1994.</P>
      <P>This significant increase has unfortunately resulted in a delay of up to six weeks in making repayments of tax to claimants.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners appreciate that such a delay is unacceptable and are addressing the problem by diverting resources to the office in question and by the installation of additional computer equipment.  They are confident that these initiatives will ensure that the delays currently being experienced by subcontractors in securing repayments will be eliminated over the coming months.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a phosphate tax.</P>
      <P>I understand that the main threat to water quality continues to be the enrichment of water beyond natural levels by nutrients &mdash; known as eutrophication.  This eutrophication is related to phosphates from a number of sources, including agricultural.  Agricultural sources, such as slurries, manures, silage effluent and chemical fertilisers are major causes of excess nutrient inputs into soil which then runs off into water.</P>
      <P>When the possibility of introducing a phosphate tax was looked at last year it was decided that it may not necessarily be the best way to try to reduce phosphate pollution.  For example, such a tax would not be subject to EU excise movement or holding controls, but would have to rely on domestic arrangements.  It would also be very difficult to prevent any &ldquo;private purchaser&rdquo; from buying phosphates abroad without having to pay any tax.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate to look at what other measures might be effective in reducing phosphate pollution.</P>

      <P>I met the chairman and the other members of the board of the Revenue Commissioners in my office on 8 July 1997 in order to familiarise myself with taxation issues generally.  I have met the chairman and the other commissioners since then at a number of individual functions.</P>
      <P>I look forward to further meetings and to visiting the offices of the Revenue Commissioners to meet their staff.  I commend my predecessor for the initiative he took in being the first Minister to visit Revenue's offices for discussions.</P>
      <P>I have indicated my very high regard for the changes that the Revenue Commissioners have brought about in the last ten years or more in relation to the administration of the tax system.  I know that the Commissioners in their corporate plan are determined to press ahead with further improvements in this area.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the relationship between the Department and the Revenue Commissioners involves close co-operation in many areas, including forecasting tax revenue, in analysing and considering tax policy changes, in preparing the annual Finance Bill and other fiscal legislation, and in EU discussions on taxation matters.  This relationship, of course, fully respects the independence of the Revenue Commissioners in the discharge of their tax functions.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income tax statistics do not distinguish between the amounts of tax that arise from disability pensions, previously known as invalidity pensions, and from other sources.  The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Informal Council meetings provide an opportunity for Ministers to have a general discussion on issues which will feature on the agendas of future formal Councils.  It is not the practice for such meeting to take decisions.  At the informal meeting of EU Finance Ministers in Luxembourg last month, we discussed a range of issues including economic and monetary union, taxation and the Commission's proposals on the future financing of the Union, having regard to future enlargement of the Union (Agenda 2000).</P>
      <P>The meeting reaffirmed that the EMU project remains firmly on target for the commencement of Stage 3 on 1 January 1999.  We considered the structure and content of the report which the Amsterdam European Council asked that we make to the European Council in Luxembourg next December.  Substantial progress was made in all the areas required to be covered in the report. These include ways of improving the processes of economic co-ordination in Stage 3 of EMU and external aspects of EMU, including the Community's position at international level on EMU issues.</P>
      <P>There was also agreement that, at the same time as the participants in Stage 3 of EMU are announced around May next year, there will be a pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates of the currencies of the participating member states.  These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999 and in line with the Treaty on European Union, the actual setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on that date.</P>
      <P>Our discussions provided valuable guidance and direction for the intensive work of preparation for economic and monetary union being carried out in the member states and in the Community institutions.</P>
      <P>There was a broad discussion on the Commission's proposals for a tax package which includes a code of conduct to tackle harmful tax competition and measures to eliminate certain tax-related distortions affecting the single market. The matter will be discussed again at the meeting of ECOFIN on 13 October.</P>
      <P>In a wide-ranging discussion Ministers gave their initial reaction to the Agenda 2000 package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> The proposals were broadly welcomed as a coherent framework for addressing the challenges facing the Union in the years ahead.  From the viewpoint of structural funding, no detailed discussion of allocations for individual member states took place.  This will not arise for some time yet.  What was discussed was the adequacy of the overall package and the budget limits to meet the challenges ahead, in particular of enlargement.  As instructed by the Amsterdam European Council, the General Affairs Council (Foreign Ministers) will examine the Commission proposals and report to the European Council in December. The ECOFIN Council, Finance Ministers, will give its views on aspects of particular concern to them which will be taken into account in the report to the December summit.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern to Finance Ministers is the overall level of spending envisaged in the proposals and the related issue of financing the EU budget.  In Ireland's case, the level of our continued receipts under Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and CAP are of course the paramount concern and the Government will be seeking to maximise Ireland's receipts in the next round of funding.</P>

      <P>Under the National Lottery Act, 1986, the detailed operation of the national lottery is the responsibility of the licensee, currently An Post National Lottery Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation also provides that the approval of the Minister for Finance is required for games offered by the company and for the company's annual budget.  In this situation, the company is in contact with my Department on a continuing <Col N="437" /> basis to discuss a variety of issues related to the company.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the current licence to operate the national lottery will expire in the year 2000, and in this context I intend to engage in a wide-ranging review of all options in relation to the development of the lottery.</P>

      <P>About 150 or so of the 290 self-managed stand alone projects approved for the International Financial Services Centre are yet to locate within the Custom House Docks Area.  Many of these projects represent small operations approved for the centre. They would also include projects recently approved which have yet to commence trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a requirement of the legislation governing the certification of companies approved for the IFSC that they conduct their trading operations from the docks area.  It is also the case, of course, that the supply of office space in the docks area has historically lagged behind the number of projects approved for the centre.  For example, buildings were not available for occupation at the time the centre was established and, consequently, it was necessary that the legislation and the certificates issued to IFSC companies permit them to trade outside the docks area until suitable space <Col N="438" /> became available there.  This situation has continued to apply up to relatively recently.</P>
    <P>As office accommodation has, over the years, become available in the docks area, my Department, in conjunction with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, has played its part to ensure that such accommodation has been occupied. Office space is currently available in the docks area and more space is due to come on stream shortly.  My Department will, as in the past, seek to ensure that this office space is occupied.</P>

      <P>Details of consultancies for my Department in the period in question are as follows:</P>
      <P>Fitzpatrick Associates, Economic Consultants, were requested to carry out an evaluation of the support structures which provide assistance and advice to pilot projects under the EMPLOYMENT and ADAPT Human Resources Community Initiatives in April 1997 at a cost of £10,890 broken down as follows: European Social Fund, £9,802; Exchequer, £1,088.  An initial payment of £5,445 was made in July 1997 and a final payment will issue when the evaluation has been finalised.</P>
      <P>Michael McNamara was employed to undertake a study of the Trade Marks Section of Patents Office.  The fee for this consultancy was £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fitzpatrick Associates were engaged to carry out a mid-term evaluation of the small business operational programme.  The main purpose of the evaluation is to examine the impact and effectiveness of the principal measures of the operational <Col N="439" /> programme.  The amount paid to Fitzpatrick Associates during the period from 1 April 1997 to 26 June 1997 was £7,986.</P>
    <P>The ESRI was appointed to carry out the annual &ldquo;School Leavers Survey&rdquo; at a cost of £70,800, on 19 June 1997 (half the cost being borne by the Department of Education).</P>
    <P>The survey studies the economic activities of secondary level school leavers one year after leaving school (including all leavers, even those who left before finishing the junior cert).  It studies the wage levels they command at different education levels, those engaged in third level studies, the unemployment situation of school leavers &mdash; and various other aspects of economic activity.  The survey has been carried out on an annual basis since 1980 and gives invaluable data on labour market trends and conditions for second level school leavers, concentrating on those with poor or no qualifications.</P>
    <P>As part of the pilot networks programme referred to in <i>Partnership 2000,</i> the Department engaged Tom Martin and Associates in May 1997 to interview and report on the experiences of a representative sample of existing networking arrangements in Ireland.  Consultancy fees for this study amounted to £9,361.60.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1,179.75 was paid to P. Morrissey, Solicitors, in respect of legal fees during this period.</P>

      <P>A number of measures have already been put in place to promote the awareness, preparation and competitiveness of Irish business during the run-in period to EMU.  These include a special EMU business awareness campaign lead by Forfás; a guide specifically designed for exporters has been published by An Bord Tráchtála earlier this year; and ABT's export development programme in Europe has also been stepped up this year with expenditure of £10 million supporting exporters in continental markets.</P>
      <P>The competitiveness of Irish business is of course a critical issue regardless of EMU.  I have recently asked the National Competitiveness Council to establish how we can realise our fullest potential across a range of critical areas such as human resources, communications, trade, innovation, etc., and to identify what are the best processes to obtain maximum competitive advantage.</P>

      <P>The annual funding allocations for each of the 35 County Enterprise Boards are determined in line with the provisions of the operational programme for local, urban and rural development.  Factors taken into account include size of population, level of unemployment and the quality of the local proposals put forward to enhance self-sustaining enterprise development.</P>
      <P>The approval capacity for direct financial aid to enterprise projects in each of the county enterprise boards in the greater Dublin region in the current year is as follows: Dublin City Enterprise Board, £1,000,000; South Dublin County Enterprise Board, £650,000; Fingal County Enterprise Board, £450,000; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Enterprise Board, £450,000.</P>
      <P>The above figures compare with the average grant approval capacity throughout the county of under £419,000 per board.  The grant approval allocations for each of the Dublin areas in the current year exceeds the level at which their allocations were initially fixed in 1996.</P>
      <P>The equivalent allocations for indirect financial support by county enterprise boards for enterprise promotion and business advice, information, counseling and training programmes in their areas in the current year are as follows: Dublin City Enterprise Board, £200,000; South Dublin County Enterprise Board, £190,000; Fingal County Enterprise Board, £150,000 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Enterprise Board, £180,000.</P>
      <P>The above figures compare with the average allocation for indirect financial support by county enterprise boards of under £129,000 per board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the range of factors taken into account in assessing the enterprise plans and expenditure proposals brought forward by county enterprise boards ensures that an equitable balance is maintained between the circumstances of urban and rural areas.  The funding requirements of all areas are, moreover, kept under continuous review to accommodate variations in performance and in the scheduling of support programmes and projects.</P>

    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report on an economic evaluation of insurance costs referred to the competitive nature of the Irish motor insurance market in terms of numbers of companies per head of population compared with, for example, the UK insurance market.  Deloitte and Touche's own survey of motor insurance premiums as presented in their report indicated that there was no uniform &ldquo;market price&rdquo; for motor insurance due to factors such as differing assessments of claims histories by insurers, strategies towards niche markets, specialisation and segmentation of the market. Their survey showed that the key factors affecting the premium rates applied to the Irish motorist were the individual driver's maturity and safety record.  Within these parameters, motor insurers quoted widely different premiums for similar risks.  This fact has also been borne out by the most recent Automobile Association survey.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of this investment programme, which includes stock and pre-development surveys, instream enhancement, water quality initiatives and an information/education programme, is to address the serious decline in wild brown trout stocks in these lakes.  Over £1 million has been allocated to date under the Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  The Western Regional Fisheries Board is primarily responsible for the implementation of the western lakes development project.</P>
      <P>The proposed stock management strategy was fully informed by the results of a comprehensive stock survey in 1996 which confirmed the need for predator control programmes and was also the subject of an agreement with the Irish and UK pike angling federations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> I can confirm to the Deputy that complaints by various pike angling groups to the EU Commission were subsequently made on the stock management programme.  A detailed response to those complaints has been sent to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The response confirms formally the commitment to full implementation of the agreement reached with the pike angling federations and to arrange for an immediate review of the operation of the stock management strategy to ensure that all necessary systems are in place to ensure its effective implementation.  Pending the outcome of the review the stock management element has been suspended.  A meeting will be held between the Department, the Central Fisheries Board, the Western Regional Fisheries Board and angling interests to ensure optimum communication, transparency and consensus on the operation of the programme.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has noted the actions taken by the Irish authorities and has communicated those to the complainants.  At the <Col N="444" /> Commission's request the stock management component of the programme will be discussed at the next meeting of the Monitoring Committee of the Tourism Operational Programme and it is hoped that any possible outstanding concerns about this component of the vitally important western lakes project will be definitively addressed at that meeting.</P>

      <P>New compensation arrangements apply to brucellosis breakdowns occurring on or after 15 September 1997.  The new arrangements were introduced following detailed discussions with the farming organisations and are designed to encourage farmers to take measures to reduce the risk of introducing the disease into their herds.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for the highest category of grant i.e. category 1, a herdowner with a new brucellosis breakdown after 15 September 1997 must have, <i>inter alia</i>, 60 day post movement tested all eligible animals acquired since his last herd test prior to 15 September 1997 and 30 day post movement tested all eligible animals acquired on or after 15 September 1997.</P>
      <P>If animals bought-in on or after 15 September 1997 pass a post movement test within 30 days of introduction into the buyer's herd but other animals in the herd do not pass that blood test and if the other conditions are met, the herd will still qualify for category 1 rates.  Where any of the bought-in animals themselves fail the blood test, the herd qualifies for the next highest category of grant i.e. category 2.  The new brucellosis grant arrangements are subject to ongoing review.</P>

      <P>The Scheme of Installation Aid (SIA) is operated under EC Regulation 2328/91 as amended.  Under the regulation, eligibility for the SIA is dependent on the applicant setting up as a full-time farmer for the first time having specified skill and competence and having a labour input of at least 1 man work unit (MWU).  The MWU is calculated using a standard number of standard <Col N="450" /> man days for each type of enterprise on the holding for a full production year.  The production year used for the scheme is 1 January to 31 December.</P>
      <P>In the case in question, the deed of transfer was signed in late July 1996 and, therefore, the MWU will be calculated on the basis of the 1997 production year which will be completed on 31 December 1997.  At that stage the form SIA 3 (assessment of labour units), for the period to 31 December 1997, should be completed by the applicant and submitted to my Department's local office.</P>
      <P>Once this is received the file will be finalised and, if everything is in order, payment should issue shortly after that.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including the carer's allowance, are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.  Treating such payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

    <P>In relation to 1996, 1087 claims were in respect of disabled drivers and 588 in respect of disabled passengers and organisations.  The corresponding figures for 1997 (to end August) are 845 and 567.</P>
    <P>As regards the number of persons benefiting from the relief, it should be noted that, since <Col N="453" /> qualifying persons are entitled to acquire a vehicle tax free every two years, the above figures include a significant number of repeat applications; 4,281 persons are at present on file with the Revenue Commissioners as being eligible for relief under the scheme for disabled persons as driver, while 2,026 persons are on file as disabled passengers.</P>
    <P>While, in the time available, it is not possible to give a full breakdown of unsuccessful applicants since 1990, I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that only 20 applications for relief were refused by the Revenue since 1995. However the Revenue Commissioners are not aware of the number of persons who have been refused the necessary primary medical certificate by the local director of community care and medical officer of health because they do not meet the appropriate medical criteria.  Without such certification applications cannot be made for relief.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the workings of the scheme was carried out in 1993 and resulted in the adoption of the &ldquo;<i>Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994</i>&rdquo;.  Six different types of disability are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them.</P>
    <P>The principal issue of concern expressed to me in connection with the reliefs is in relation to their scope.  The qualifying disability criteria set out in the regulations relate essentially to persons who have severe and permanent physical mobility problems.  Requests have been made from time to time for the medical criteria to be relaxed so as to extend the range of qualifying disabilities to include, <i>inter alia</i>, footdrop, rheumatoid arthritis, the visually impaired, stroke, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.  The medical criteria as set out are there to ensure that the reliefs provided under the scheme are targeted at those who are most severely and permanently disabled.  While the criteria are kept under review there are always difficulties in defining the categories of disability in a satisfactory manner without opening up the scheme in too costly a manner.  The cost of relief in 1996 was nearly £8 million compared to £4 million in 1994.</P>

The structure of personal income tax systems vary considerably between countries, with some having significant local income tax rates applied in addition to the state income tax rates.  Comparing personal income tax rates between countries is therefore difficult.</P>

      <P>The yield from capital acquisitions tax was £84 million in 1996 of which over £58 million relates to gift and inheritance tax.  Any significant increase in the capital acquisitions tax thresholds, beyond the annual indexation in accordance with the consumer price index, would adversely affect this yield and run contrary to the tax reform strategy of recent years which has been to maintain as broad a tax base as possible and to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  It is considered that the present capital acquisitions tax thresholds strike a fair balance between the need to ensure a broader distribution of the tax burden and the need to take due account of ability to pay.  However, capital acquisitions tax policy is reviewed on an ongoing basis in the light of the preparation for the annual budget and the Deputy's question will be given full consideration in this context.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works received £265,000 for the property.  Six tenders were submitted.  The delay in advertising the site for sale was due to the fact that in 1992 the Commissioners agreed to dispose of the property to Sligo Corporation who had indicated that it was required for car parking purposes to facilitate the completion of a large urban renewal project which was being undertaken by private developers. When the corporation subsequently indicated it would not be proceeding with its plan, the site was advertised for sale by public tender in November 1995.  A number of bids were received but, on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, all tenders were rejected, as the private developers whom the corporation originally wished to facilitate claimed that they had a binding contract with the corporation and threatened to institute proceedings designed to prevent the Office of Public Works from disposing of the site to any other party.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office sought the advice of counsel in the matter and clearance was received from that office to readvertise the site for sale in May 1997.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The pay proposals developed to date involve an element of restructuring, as provided for under the local bargaining clause of the PCW pay agreement. This applies to nurses and many other groups such as civil servants, clerical and administrative grades in the health boards and local authorities, teachers and gardaí, who have concluded or are concluding agreements under the restructuring option of the PCW.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the agreements emerging do not provide for uniform increases across groups and in many cases even within grades. This complicates the position regarding adjustments to pensions and this question is being considered in respect of all affected groups across the public service.</P>
      <P>Discussions took place between the Department of Finance and the Public Services Committee of ICTU about this matter.  Consideration is still being given to the implications of the restructuring deals for existing pensioners and pensions increase policy across the public service.  When this general policy issue has been resolved my Department will be in a position to clarify the adjustments to be made to retired health service staff, including nurses.</P>

      <P>An allocation of £310,000 (full year cost) was made to the Western Health Board in 1997 for the development of services specifically for persons with autism.  These developments include:</P>
      <P>Six residential-day places at Claregalway;</P>

      <P>Six day places at Pope John Paul II Centre in Ballybane.</P>

In addition to the funding listed above, additional funding of £850,000 was provided for the development of services to persons with a mental handicap, including autism, in the Western Health Board region.  This provided 31 new day places and 45 new residential/respite places.</P>
      <P>Funding of £262,000 was allocated in 1996 which provided additional respite care services for as many as possible of the 114 adults and 66 children with a mental handicap, including autism, on the board's priority residential placement list.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Cowen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board is currently engaged in expanding its drug treatment services to provide treatment to all those who need it and to eliminate waiting lists for treatment.  As part of this process it contracts general practitioners to prescribe methadone in its drug treatment centres or in a number of satellite clinics throughout the city.  In addition, patients who have been stabilised are referred to a general practitioner in their local area for continued methadone treatment.  This methadone is dispensed by a local pharmacist. This prescribing and dispensing is carried out in accordance with the protocol for the prescribing of methadone.  Under this protocol methadone prescribing occurs in a controlled, responsible fashion.  A central treatment list of patients being prescribed methadone has been established and general practitioners are expected to provide details of their patients for inclusion in this list. This is to avoid the risk of double scripting for any patient.</P>
      <P>My Department recognises the needs for control in the area of prescribing of methadone and has written to GPs on a number of occasions, most recently on 26 September 1997, concerning protocols for best practice in the treatment of drug misusers, in particular, where the prescribing of methadone is concerned.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware of the details of the case referred to by the Deputy.  I am arranging, however, to have the matter investigated in consultation with the Eastern Health Board to ensure that the concerns expressed by the Deputy are addressed.</P>

    <P>The Adoption Act, 1991, imposed a statutory duty on health boards to carry out, as soon as <Col N="463" /> practicable, assessments for foreign adoptions.  In carrying out this function, the boards must have regard to the competing demands in other areas of the child care services, particularly in relation to the protection of children from abuse and neglect, which takes priority over all other work. However, that said, I understand that prospective adopters in the Eastern Health Board area are experiencing significant delays in having adoption assessments commenced in comparison with applicants in other boards.  Officials of my Department are currently discussing the matter with the Eastern Health Board with a view to ascertaining the measures, if any, which could be taken in order to alleviate the delay.</P>

      <P>The provision of orthodontic services to eligible children in the Western Health Board area and the maintenance of the waiting list is the statutory responsibility of the health board.  Because of the high cost of providing orthodontic treatment it is important that resources be used to best advantage and for those most severely affected-handicapped. Patients are, therefore, assessed for treatment in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and placed on waiting lists in descending order of severity-handicap.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by the Western Health Board that there is no waiting period for category A patients, which are the cases of greatest need, seeking orthodontic treatement.  The average waiting period for orthodontic treatment in category B is currently 22 months.</P>
      <P>The consultant orthodontist in charge of the orthodontic department in the Western Health Board as well as one other member of the orthodontic staff of the department resigned last year. This put a heavy burden on the department.  The situation was then made more acute by the recent illness of another staff member.  A new consultant orthodontist has now commenced work with the board.  The board has also been successful in the recruitment of another staff member who has commenced work in the orthodontic department. The board hopes, as a result, that a significant impression will be made on the waiting lists.</P>

      <P>Personal assistance services are provided by the Irish Wheelchair Association, funded by the Eastern Health Board and by the Centre for Independent Living through the use of FÁS trainees under the community employment scheme.  The FÁS scheme, which is designed to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, is not perfectly suited to the needs of a personal assistance service for people with disabilities.  However, any change in this scheme would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> The Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for People with Physical and Sensory Disabilities in its report, &ldquo;Towards an Independent Future&rdquo;, which was published last December, set out the requirements for the development, <i>inter alia</i>, of personal assistance services.  On foot of the report, an additional £3.688 million was provided this year, of which £226,000 was allocated to personal assistance services. The further development of the services will be considered in the light of the resources which may be made available to my Department in 1998.</P>
    <P>An advisory group on personal assistance services set up by one of my predecessors explored the option of establishing an independent living fund as a means of funding personal assistance services for people with disabilities but considered that it would be too cumbersome to administer.  I met a delegation representing the Centre for Independent Living on 22 September last and discussed in detail the various issues in relation to personal assistance services.</P>

      <P>At present, access to birth records by adopted persons is restricted under section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952. Where circumstances permit, an adoption agency will do what it can to facilitate contact between adopted persons and birth relatives by mutual voluntary consent provided it is satisfied, through counselling, that both parties are fully cognisant of the considerations and implications involved in such a step.  The increased volume of tracing requests to adoption societies and health boards in recent years is an indication of the strength of feeling and strong desire for information by the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>There is a clear need for legislation on this issue in order to provide a structured, coherent and equitable post-adoption contact system. However, it would be prudent to await clarification of a number of constitutional and other legal issues surrounding the question of access to birth records, heard by the Supreme Court in July, before proceeding with legislation in this very sensitive area of human relationships.  The issues heard by the Supreme Court go to the very heart of post-adoption contact as they deal with the right of a child to know the identity of its birth mother and the right of the birth mother to confidentiality. It is expected that the Supreme Court will deliver its judgment in the case shortly.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the concerns expressed by the construction industry in relation to the prospects for the industry in 1998 due to the excessive amount of demand; the action, if any, he proposes to take to meet the industry's concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15701/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Noel Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Construction Industry Council, which is the principal representative body for the construction industry, has not expressed any concern that there may be excessive construction demand in 1998.  The Construction Industry Council's membership is made up of the Association of Consulting Engineers of Ireland (ACEI), the Building Materials Federation (BMF-IBEC), the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), the Institution of Engineers of Ireland (IEI), the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI) and the Society of Chartered Surveyors (SCS).  In fact, one Construction Industry Council member &mdash; the CIF &mdash; has expressed reservations on the Government's intention to limit increases in public capital programme spending on construction to an average of 5 per cent per annum, in the period up to 1999. Neither have I received any representations on this subject from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).</P>
      <P>The output of the construction industry has grown by 48 per cent over the three-year period 1994-96; and is forecast to grow by at least 8 per cent in 1997.  At present, forecasts of growth for 1998 range from 3 per cent to 8.5 per cent.  While this cumulative growth in construction output is remarkable in Irish and European terms, it follows a period of recession during the 1980s and early 1990s.  The output of the industry only recovered to the peak level of 1981 in 1996; and will exceed it, for the first time, in 1997.</P>
      <P>In the absence of growth in construction investment, economic and social development and job creation would be constrained.  For example, the resulting drop in the supply of new houses would put further upward pressure on house prices.  My Department has recently initiated a consultancy study of the factors giving rise to increased house prices; and how these factors are likely to operate in the future.  While there are recent reports of significant increases in tender prices for general contracting, this follows a period when such prices were highly competitive relative to trends in building costs.  Tender prices for civil engineering projects, e.g. roads and water services, remain competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that there are signs that the remarkable growth in construction activity is beginning to put a strain on capacity &mdash; which, if ignored, could fuel increases in building costs and prices.  For example, there are localised shortages of certain categories of skilled building workers &mdash; notably blocklayers and bricklayers.  The Construction Industry Federation have advertised in British newspapers encouraging migrant Irish <Col N="468" /> building craftspersons to return.  These advertisements have elicited about 3,500 responses which are being matched with vacancies notified by building employers.</P>
    <P>There are reports of emerging shortages of suitably zoned and serviced land for development. My Department intends, with the co-operation of local authorities, to improve data on the availability of zoned and serviced land &mdash; with the objective of ensuring that any emerging scarcity is identified and addressed in good time.</P>
    <P>Overall, my approach is to welcome and accommodate the growth in construction demand by addressing any emerging supply side constraints in partnership with the industry &mdash; rather than seeking to limit the development of the industry in a way that could damage the employment prospects of the 130,000 persons who work in it; and curtail Ireland's capacity for future economic growth, which is partly dependent on improving the quantity and quality of our infrastructure.</P>

      <P>As an approved body under section 6 of the 1992 Act, NABCO provides housing under the voluntary housing capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes operated by the local housing authorities.  In providing housing under these schemes voluntary bodies are subject to the oversight of the housing authority and in relation to funding, in particular, these bodies must ensure that adequate accounting procedures are adopted to monitor capital expenditure and income in respect of the initial development of their housing projects and thereafter maintain a separate current income and expenditure account in respect of ongoing operational costs.  These accounting records are required to be open for inspection by the housing authority.</P>

    <P>NABCO is a non-profit body holding charitable status and registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts and is, therefore, also subject to oversight by relevant regulatory bodies such as the Registrar of Friendly Societies.

      <P>Child benefit is currently payable in respect of all children up to age 16 and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally challenged.  Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate for each child where three or more children are born together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the significant additional costs involved for parents of twins, there is provision for the payment of a £500 grant at the birth of twins and for two further grants of £500 payable when the twins reach the ages of four and 12. Over 1,400 families have benefited from these grants at an annual cost of almost £700,000.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations contained in various reports, including the report of the expert working group on integrating tax and social welfare, the interim report of the Commission on the Family and the ESRI report on poverty in the 1990s, the improvements in child income support introduced this year are designed to benefit low income families and, in particular, larger families. This has been achieved by increasing the higher rate of child benefit, payable in respect of third and subsequent children, by £5 and by increasing the lower rate of child benefit, payable in respect of the first and second child, by £1.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to protecting and enhancing the role of the family in society.  In that context, one of my priorities is the continued development of child benefit as a key support for every child in the state.  The question of introducing specific measures in respect of twins will be examined in the light of overall budgetary priorities.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 130 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the community employment scheme, which is operated by FÁS on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, scheme workers retain entitlement to any secondary benefits they held prior to commencing work under the scheme.  Such secondary benefits could include the normal social welfare benefits of butter vouchers, Christmas bonus and free fuel allowance as well as income-related benefits such as rent allowance or mortgage supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, medical cards and differential rents.</P>
      <P>The entitlement to secondary benefits of those community employment workers who return to the live register when their period of community employment finishes will vary depending on their individual circumstances.  By virtue of having paid class A PRSI contributions, persons returning to the live register after completing community employment may qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit rather than reverting to long-term unemployment assistance.  In the case of persons who qualify or re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year will determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The social welfare secondary benefits I referred to above are not payable with short-term payments such as unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Secondary benefits can, however, be retained if the person transfers from a community employment scheme to a back-to-work allowance scheme or the Jobstart scheme.  As regards the income-related secondary benefits, the position is that, in the normal course, former community employment workers who are solely dependent on a social welfare payment should continue, where appropriate, to receive these benefits.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1996, provided for the extension of class A PRSI to community employment workers.  Class A PRSI provides cover for the full range of benefits and pensions available under the social insurance system including, for example, unemployment benefit, disability benefit, maternity benefit, retirement pension, old age contributory pension, widow's contributory pension, treatment dental and optical benefits and occupational injuries benefit.  The purpose of this measure was to enhance the PRSI status of community employment workers and to put them on a par with other class A workers.</P>

      <P>Since 1 January 1997 the Garda Síochána have received a number of complaints of windows being broken in the school.  A number of arrests were subsequently made.  The area is patrolled by the local community garda as well as by gardaí involved in Operation Dóchas and will continue to receive the appropriate Garda attention.</P>
      <P>I understand that my colleague, Deputy Martin, the Minister for Education and Science, is considering the provision of a security fence around the school.</P>

      <P>I fully understand the anxiety of members of an Garda Síochána regarding the temporary release of the prisoner concerned. However, as in the case of any offender, I cannot say that there would never be circumstances in which a short period of release might be warranted. The reason is that the law provides, even in the case of capital murderers, that temporary release may be granted provided that there are, what the Statute terms, &ldquo;grave reasons of a humanitarian nature&rdquo; to justify it.  I could not, therefore, absolutely exclude short-term release for any prisoner or class of prisoners as that would involve the total denial of a concession built into the law, which would, very likely, be challenged.  However, the concession has been and will continue to be extended sparingly and the legal condition applying to capital murderers, i.e. that there must be &ldquo;grave reasons of a humanitarian nature&rdquo; will be strictly applied.</P>
      <P>I also wish to assure the Deputy that the Garda concerns will be among the matters specifically examined whenever applications for temporary release are made by or on behalf of this prisoner.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to Parliamentary Question No. 151 of 28 June 1995 in response to which the then Minister for Justice stated that she had requested a detailed report from the Garda authorities in the matter and that she would communicate with the Deputy &mdash; who tabled the question &mdash; when the report was to hand.  The Minister subsequently wrote to the Deputy when she had received a Garda report.  The matter was also the subject of parliamentary questions tabled by the Deputy on 2 May 1996 (No. 67) and 19 June 1996 (No. 39). As can be seen from the answers to the various parliamentary questions tabled, the Garda authorities, having investigated the matter, have found no basis for a criminal prosecution.  Further correspondence received since in this matter has been referred to the Garda Síochána where it is receiving appropriate attention.</P>

It is the intention that the mid-term review of the tourism programme itself will be completed at the monitoring committee meeting scheduled for early November next, where the board's request is among the items down for final decision.</P>

      <P>The revised programme for basic preregistration nurse education and training was introduced in October 1994 on a pilot basis by the Western Health Board and National University of Ireland, Galway at the University Hospital Galway.  The programme has since been extended to a number of other colleges of nursing in association with local higher education institutions.  The three year programme leads to a diploma in nursing studies and to registration with An Bord Altranais.  The programmes are being funded by the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Department of Health has been engaged in consultations with a number of third level institutions, including National University of Ireland, Galway, in relation to the development of accessible degree programmes which are open both to nurses who successfully complete the new education and training programme and to nurses who qualify under the traditional model of education and training. These one year degree programmes offer members of the nursing profession an opportunity to obtain a post-registration qualification at degree level.  In the 1996-97 academic year, Dublin City University operated such a one year programme and both Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin are operating programmes in 1997-98.  As these programmes are provided on a part-time, self-financing basis, the question of funding does not arise.</P>
      <P>I understand that the National University of Ireland, Galway is proposing to offer a similar one year degree programme commencing from January 1998 on a full-time basis.  My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Health in relation to this proposed course and I will clarify the position for the Deputy in the light of these discussions.</P>

      <P>The chartered accountancy course in Regional Technical College Sligo is offered in conjunction with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  The course and syllabus are determined by the institute and at the conclusion of the programme students sit an external examination which is set and marked by examiners appointed by the institute.</P>
      <P>I understand from the college authorities in regional technical college Sligo that none of the eight students attending the first year of the chartered accountancy course in the college in 1996-97 passed the examination at the first sitting.  Following the issuing of the examination results by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland the college wrote to all students and advised them of a revision course to be provided by the college prior to the autumn sitting of the examinations. When the autumn examinations were finished, the head of school met the students and advised them that their future options, including transfer to another business course, would be reviewed in the light of their examination results.  Should any of the students transfer to another ESF aided course in the college, they may be eligible for ESF funding in respect of fees and maintenance subject to them meeting the normal criteria for such funding.</P>
      <P>I also understand from the college authorities that examination results achieved by chartered accountancy students at regional technical college Sligo in the past have been consistently good. Because of the abnormally high failure rate this year, the college is conducting an investigation into the examination results and will review all aspects of the course in consultation with the ICAI and the college academic council.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>A total of 23 absconds have taken place from the centres in question during 1997.  Following is a detailed breakdown relating to each centre for each month.  None of the absconders referred to is still at large.  In the case of two boys and two girls, further charges are being pursued as a result of activities they are alleged to have been involved in while at large.  In addition, one of the girls has alleged that she was involved in a potentially serious incident while at large.  The circumstances of this case are currently being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Detailed planning for the construction of a security fence and provision of additional physical security measures at the Oberstown campus is <Col N="485" /> almost complete.  The contract for these works will be awarded by public tender.</P>
    <P>While my Department has prepared provisional estimates of the costs involved in these developments, it would not be appropriate to <Col N="486" /> divulge these costs in advance of going to tender. It is intended to have this project approved as a matter of urgency with a view to commencing construction early in 1998.</P>

      <Quest>the facilities and special arrangements, if any, which have been made available by his Department to deal with the education needs of autistic children; the number of autistic children registered in schools in this country; and the number who are being provided with specially designed educational facilities.</Quest>

      <P>Children with autism have access to a range of educational support services.  The precise nature of the support provided will depend on the severity of the condition in each individual case.</P>
      <P>In some cases, children with mild features of autism are educated in ordinary schools with the support, where necessary, of remedial or resource teachers.  Children wtih more serious needs have traditionally been catered for in a number of special schools including schools for children with mental handicap and schools for children with emotional behavioural disorders.</P>
      <P>In the 1995-96 school year a pilot programme of special education services was established for children with autism.  Under this programme, a number of special classes dedicated specifically to the needs of these children have been established.  The programme involves: the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism, the delivery of specially tailored educational programmes to meet the need of these children; and the delivery of special in-service support to the teachers concerned.</P>
      <P>These special classes are attached to schools located in Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin and Cratloe, Ennis, County Clare.  A further special class was established at St. Brigid's Special School, Dundalk, County Louth in the 1996-97 school year.  Each of the special classes caters for a maximum of six children.  A total of 46 children are currently catered for under the pilot programme.</P>
      <P>My Department's inspectorate is now commencing a review of the operation of the pilot programme and will be consulting with the Irish Society of Autism as part of this process.  The review, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year, will provide a basis for the development of future responses to the educational needs of children with autism.</P>
      <P>My Department does not have details of the total number of autistic children currently participating in the education system.</P>

      <P>The design team for the extension of Scoil Mhuire, Clane, County Kildare, met my Department's technical staff in August 1997 to discuss the project in detail.  My Department is awaiting stage 2, outline sketch scheme, documentation from the design team and once this has been examined and found to be in order, the project will proceed to stage 3 of planning.  While every effort will be made to expedite architectural planning, it is not possible at this point to say when construction will begin.</P>

      <P>The project to replace the accommodation at St. Wolstan's in Celbridge with a new school is a major capital development requiring a very substantial degree of technical and professional input to order to complete the architectural planning process.  The technical work is made much more complex due to the difficult nature of the site at Ballymakeely where it is proposed to locate the new school.  While every effort will be made to expedite the planning process it would not be possible, as the Deputy suggests, to have the project ready to proceed to tender before the end of 1997.</P>
