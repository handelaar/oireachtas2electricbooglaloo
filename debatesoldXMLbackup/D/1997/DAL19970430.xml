      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to a short debate on the mid-term ESRI report next week?  It is an important report which should be <Col N="850" /> debated in the House.  A number of pertinent questions arise from it and I am sure others wish to contribute.</P>

      <P>When will the legislation to establish the hepatitis C compensation tribunal on a statutory basis be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered a question on that yesterday.  I indicated there would be 48 hours of consultation from then and we hoped to have the heads of the Bill finalised either tomorrow or the day after at the latest.  We then hope to make the heads of the Bill available to the Opposition parties and the public.  Drafting of the legislation has already commenced but certain matters have not been finally settled.  I cannot give a precise estimate as to when the Bill will be ready but it is being advanced with the greatest possible speed consistent with maximum consultation with those involved.</P>

      <P>Last autumn, the Taoiseach announced that within two weeks the Court Services Bill would be introduced and put on a statutory basis.  The legislation was to be published before Christmas as a means of trying to build confidence in the courts system, or at the time, to rebuild confidence in the Minister for Justice.  It has not been mentioned for many months.  Will it be published before the general election?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are proceeding rapidly to draft the legislation.  It is not possible to publish an outline of the heads of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be interesting to know how many heads of Bills are before the House. They are meaningless.  This is a new device, only legislation has an effect in law.  Last October the Taoiseach promised that this legislation would be published within two weeks.  He subsequently changed his mind and said that the courts service would be placed on a statutory basis and that the legislation would be published before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party is being somewhat contradictory.  Only six or seven days ago it was demanding the heads of a particular Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about the heads of a Bill as being meaningless but only six or seven days ago his party was baying for the heads of a particular Bill to be made available to <Col N="851" /> it, indicating clearly that at that time it considered the heads of a Bill to be of enormous significance, even to the point of being disorderly in the House in its demand to see them.  The Deputy is now indicating that the heads of a Bill are of no significance.He should make up his mind on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have increased the number of judges dramatically.  When the Deputy's party was in office people had to wait two years to have a civil case heard.  They are now being heard quickly.  The same applies to criminal cases.</P>

      <P>Last October when the Taoiseach promised to introduce this important legislation he did not indicate that the heads would be made available, rather he said that the legislation would be published within two weeks.  He subsequently decided that the courts service would be placed on a statutory basis.  We have not seen the legislation.  The Taoiseach is referring to the Bill dealing with hepatitis, the heads of which we asked to see so that we would know what was being discussed with the various groups involved. That is a different matter.  Will the Government introduce the courts service Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All of the policy decisions have been taken and the heads of the Bill approved.  It <Col N="852" /> is simply a question of proceeding with the drafting to which priority is being given by the Government.  I cannot give the Deputy a precise date but I hope to see the Bill before the House within the next two months.  It is important legislation.This is the first Government since the courts were established 75 years ago to give priority to court reform and to take a policy decision to establish an independent courts service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a way that is acceptable to the Judiciary.  There were difficulties in proceeding immediately because there was a necessity to consult with the Judiciary to ensure the heads of the Bill would be in a form that would be acceptable to those who would have to work under them.  That has now been done.  I expect the Bill to be introduced in the House before the summer recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will but this is an acknowledgement by the Taoiseach that what he announced in the House at the time and the way he proceeded was not in accord with the views expressed by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  He has broken his own promise to introduce legislation in the House.</P>

The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, said last night that he knew what the Taoiseach said in 1992 was incorrect but because he was not speaking to him at the time he did not tell him.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat puzzled by the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Ahern regarding the courts commission.  Since he is so adept at reconciling contradictions, will the Taoiseach advise the House as to how in October last he informed the House that the legislation in question would be introduced within two weeks and now tells us that it will take some time to produce?</P>

We proceeded to deal with the matter in that way.  The policy decisions incorporated in the heads of the Bill approved by the Government are based on the original policy decision to establish an independent courts service which will now be placed on a statutory basis.</P>

Negotiations are ongoing on the basis for this, the terms under which it will take place, etc.  I assure the House that there is very strong support for the principle and practice of employee shareholding in this company.</P>
      <P>I expect the legislation to be introduced at the end of the year.  As I explained to Deputy Ahern yesterday, the legislation provides for a general reform of telecommunications legislation to prepare the industry for the liberalised market.  It does not necessarily specifically deal with the matter to which Deputy Brennan referred which is the subject of ongoing, intensive negotiations to which the Government attaches high priority as to a successful outcome being obtained.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise two matters.  The first relates to promises given by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice at the time of the Dominic Lynch debacle.  In addition to the promise <Col N="857" /> to establish the courts service on a statutory basis a promise was given to set up an independent prisons board.  What is the status of that proposal?Does it have the same status as the proposal on the courts service to which a reference has already been made on the Order of Business, that it is not yet completed?</P>
      <P>The second matter relates to a health issue. After a series of investigations into the improper handling of child welfare cases by the health boards, including the Kilkenny incest case, the west of Ireland farmer case and the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the Government gave a serious commitment to establish a social services inspectorate to deal with such matters in the future.  What is the status of this important inspectorate?</P>

    <P>Provided that, if at any time during the year of assessment the individual was of the age of seventy-five years or upwards, &lsquo;the specified amount&rsquo; means £7,000.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is in relation to exemption of income tax, particularly of elderly people.  It is a constant refrain on the doorsteps, when speaking to the elderly, that they feel they have paid enough tax in the course of their lives, and that the heavy taxation which applies to them is unfair and unduly burdensome.  In this context I want to make a wider point while remaining relevant. Over the past number of years we have increased old age pensions approximately in line with the rate of inflation.  That sounds sensible in one way because they are not declining in absolute value terms, but they are declining in relative terms to wages and earning power at a significant rate.  As public and private sector pay increases in advance of the rate of inflation, the difference between <Col N="861" /> the pension old age pensioners receive and the earning power of those in work is diverging rapidly.</P>
    <P>A new policy is needed in relation to social welfare in particular.  Both the contributory and non-contributory old age pension should be increased well in advance of the rate of inflation. If there is to be a real increase in social welfare expenditure at any given stage, it should be concentrated on those who are senior citizens and not, for instance, on those in receipt of unemployment benefit.  We must ensure that those in receipt of and largely dependent upon pensions are given some measure of the growth in the economy through their pensions and not merely kept idling along with the rate of inflation while wages increase.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister on the radio this morning, following Deputy McCreevy.  I note that such hauteur and <i>gravitas</i> has descended on the Minister that he will no longer engage in a head to head with other Opposition spokespersons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making a point in a good humoured way about the Minister's interview this morning.  In the course of that interview the Minister dealt with the question of public sector pay and he indicated, in agreement with <Col N="862" /> Deputy McCreevy, that a firmer stance could have been taken.  It is well known that the Minister threatened to resign but that the Tánaiste forced him to back down on the issue.  Pensioners do not have a Tánaiste on their side.  The Minister never takes a stance in relation to pensioners or the elderly in our society.  He keeps them ticking over at the rate of inflation and he allows public sector pay to increase, despite his threats to resign.  The result in the long term, however, is that those dependent on pensions are losing out in the Celtic Tiger economy.  The elderly are not getting any share of economic growth and that will cause a crisis in the long term because if public pensions in the form of contributory and non-contributory old age pensions are allowed to lag behind even further, in terms of their relationship to wages, more and more people will be plunged into a crisis when their employment life finishes and they are on pension.</P>
      <P>The objective of this amendment is to relieve the tax burden for more elderly people in particular.That is one way of giving them some share in the economic growth.  If today's ESRI report is true in substance, and allowing for the major caveats the authors of that report put into it, we must ask ourselves if the elderly will be part of this economic boom or will be left behind while the bigger snouts get to the trough through the social partnership negotiations.  We must share the fruits of economic prosperity with the elderly because in large measure it was their working careers that created the circumstances in which younger workers today are enjoying such a comparatively improved economic situation.  We must look to the tax and welfare systems to ensure the elderly get a fair share of economic growth which they are not currently getting but to which they are entitled.  I am not talking about some kind of auction politics, but doing something concrete to give relief to those who are past employment, in terms of their working life, and in their retirement years.  They should receive some benefit from the economic growth generally being experienced by others in the economy, although in different measure for different people.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McDowell's amendment.  On Committee Stage I tabled an amendment to increase the exemption limits for aged persons.  Over the years I have consistently argued that there should be a substantial increase in the exemption limits that apply to people when they reach a certain age.  We had an interesting debate on this topic on Committee Stage ranging outside the normal debates of previous years which concentrated solely on the cost.  I have given some thought to the Minister's line of argument, which was somewhat new to me, that at least in Ireland the position of pensioners <i>vis-à-vis</i> taxation was somewhat different to what it is in other countries, and I accept the Minister has a point.  I said on Committee Stage that I was of the old-fashioned school who believe that people who have worked all of their lives providing for <Col N="863" /> their families and who have paid their dues to society should, when they reach a certain age, be entitled to generous exemption from taxation.</P>
      <P>There is no need to rehearse the arguments I put forward on Committee Stage, but I have a different view from the Minister's as outlined last week.  Exemption limits should be increased dramatically.  The Minister said what the cost of the amendments put forward by me and Deputy McDowell would be, but that would depend on the starting point.  I have no hesitation in saying &mdash; and this line of thinking got me into some difficulty during my time as Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; there is a fundamental difference between a 20 year old single adult and a 70 year old single adult.  I was pilloried by people of the socialist persuasion and their commentators in the media for making that point.  There is a vast difference between a 20 year old single man and a 70 year old single pensioner in receipt of the same rate of unemployment assistance.  The difference is that the 20 year old has his full life ahead of him.  He has the opportunity to work at various jobs, and the fact that he is young gives him all the advantages.This was not a line of thinking that was appreciated by people of what I would loosely term &ldquo;the socialist persuasion&rdquo;.  However, I still believe that and anyone who says there is no difference between those two categories is not living in the same Ireland in which I live.</P>
      <P>I also have the old-fashioned belief that children should look after their parents.  Traditionally one member of a family, usually a daughter, was left at home to look after her parents in old age. That tradition is changing, but it is not necessarily a change for the good.  From the Exchequer view-point it is extremely costly.  The cost of providing health and care services for the aged will be beyond the capability of future Administrations, notwithstanding their good will.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy McDowell's amendment. There should be exemptions for aged persons.  I note what the Minister has done in the budget, but tinkering at the edges is not the proper way to go about it.  The purpose of my amendment on Committee Stage was to increase the exemption limits by a particular amount.  I have since given thought to tackling the matter in another fashion which officials in the Department of Finance might consider in order to have equity in the system for all pensioners.  Not all pensioners are in receipt of a State old age pension.  Many are wealthy people who have provided substantially for their own pensions, and I do not deny what the Minister said last week about that.  As someone who takes on board what other people have to say, although I might not agree with it at the time, I have given further thought to what the Minister said.  It is a point in favour of the current Minister for Finance that he also is willing to take on board ideas put from different perspectives, and I have acknowledged that on many occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way of getting over the problem of ensuring equity for all pensioners would be if, when <Col N="864" /> the person has reached the age of 65 regardless of the source of income, exemptions could apply for amounts up to the equivalent of a State pension plus an adult dependent allowance in the case of a person with an adult dependant.  That would create equity between all taxpayers of that age whether they were in receipt of a State pension only, not in receipt of a State pension or in receipt of a State pension and another pension or pensions.  The Minister will be aware from representations made to him by his constituents that it is confusing for an individual in receipt of a State pension and perhaps a small pension from a former employment, more often than not semi-State employment, to have to comply with complicated tax rules at the end of the year.  What I suggest would be a somewhat novel approach that might be considered by officials in the Department of Finance over the coming months because it would create equity between pensioners whose pensions come from different sources.  It would also get over some of the difficulties outlined last week by the Minister regarding people who have substantial pension income but who do not receive a State pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put forward by Deputy McDowell.  One of the failings of our tax system is that people come into the tax net too soon and pay tax on very low incomes.  That is a general point, and the solution is probably to increase tax allowances although, if we were to do what some people would like, it would cost a fortune.A limited way of tackling the problem is to increase exemption limits.  That has been done successfully and has benefited many people over the years by keeping those on relatively low incomes out of the tax net or, if they are over the exemption limit, charging them at the marginal rate.</P>
      <P>There is a perception among the elderly that they have paid over the years for their pensions and that when they get the benefit it should come tax free.  I am aware of the argument that all income should be taxable.  However, in regard to unemployment benefit and disability benefit, the Department of Finance has rowed back and some of this should be tax free.  My point specifically concerns elderly pensioners who are being charged at the marginal rate.  This year in the budget married couples got an increase in their allowances of £500 and old age pensioner couples got an increase of £400.  That was a total increase of £900 for people paying tax at the full rate. However, for those on the marginal rate, the exemption rates were increased by only £200 and there is much bitterness and disappointment that elderly people, just into the tax net, have been so harshly treated and discriminated against in a year when we were led to expect a bonanza budget from which everybody would gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some reason 24,000 old age pensioners were singled out and treated in a very harsh way, and many of them have a lower tax free allowance this year than previously.  What type of signal does that send out to our elderly?  Surely the <Col N="865" /> hallmark of any society is the way it treats its elderly.What are we achieving from our booming economy other than giving George Lee breakfast every morning when he appears on television? Surely we should pass on some of the benefits to the elderly who worked hard when times were not so good.  I was disappointed at the way our 24,000 old age pensioners were treated in the budget.  While the Minister may claim he is acting on the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, many of our elderly will be worse off as a result of the budget.  They are a vulnerable group, many of whom do not enjoy great health and incur high heating costs and they believe the Government does not care about them.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister stated that age alone should not be a reason for giving higher tax allowances.  This can be achieved by increasing exemption limits or the age allowances, but an increase of £400 is not sufficient.  Many elderly people who were on the marginal rate cannot understand why they have been singled out for harsh treatment in a year when everybody else gained.  People would agree to a 10 per cent tax increase if it were necessary and implemented fairly.  However, in a year when everyone should be a winner, it is unacceptable that 24,000 old age pensioners should be singled out for harsh treatment.A more humane approach should have been adopted to achieve the targets set in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.  I support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am not saying Deputy Ahern did not quote me accurately, I want to amend something I said last week.  On reflection, some consideration should be given to age.  The point I was trying to stress last week was that many elderly people have substantial incomes and people should not be automatically treated differently because they are old.  However, I accept the principle enunciated by Deputy Ahern in that when everything else has been considered, age should be given special consideration.  To that extent, I philosophically agree with the thrust of Deputy McDowell's comments in that compensation for inflation alone is not sufficient.  Many of us have elderly parents.  Notwithstanding their objectively sound position compared with some years ago, they worry excessively about paying tax and their ability to meet their obligations. That is part of the human condition as one gets older and it informs many of the concerns expressed by the elderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our usual benchmark for comparison purposes is the United Kingdom.  In terms of tax and social welfare, under successive Governments this country has treated its elderly better than many other countries.  My mother-in-law, who lives next door to me, frequently compares her position with that of her sister who lives in Bedford in the United Kingdom.  Anyone who is in a position to do so should make similar comparisons.  Pensioners <Col N="866" /> here are treated better than those in the United Kingdom.</P>

I have frequently paid tribute to him for that and his many other achievements for the elderly.  Anyone who travels by train will be aware of the benefits the elderly derive from that provision.  It enables them to make social intercourse with others, which otherwise would not be possible.</P>
      <P>I contradict Deputy McDowell's assertion that benefits for pensioners have marched in tandem with the rate of inflation.  For those in the fortunate position of having public service pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy and I will qualify in that respect.  I will confine my remarks to tax on this matter.  The general exemption limits have increased substantially since 1988.  All parties in the House can share the credit for this increase because it is not exclusive to one period.  The limits for those aged between 65 and 75 years increased by 42 per cent and for those aged 75 years and over they increased by 37 per cent.  The cost of living increase during the comparable period was approximately 26.5 per cent.  Therefore, there is a significant variation in terms of the base increase in the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The argument that the rate of increase for social welfare recipients not in the labour market should be different from those in the labour market is gathering strength.  This is a valid argument considering what is happening in the labour market.I have not yet been able to persuade my colleagues of its validity, but I will continue to make the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The other aspects would then cause me considerable concern.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Ahern's comments, it is my understanding that people are better off as a result of the changes made this year.  The Deputy stated that is not the case for people who moved from marginal relief to full income tax.  That was not the intention and I would be happy to examine the details of specific cases at a later stage.  I submitted a written reply on this matter to the Deputy on 25 March.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the information <Col N="867" /> before me, that would not be the case.  If couples are taxed on the marginal relief system their exemption limit will increase by £200 to £10,400.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <P>Consequently, in this year's budget the number of couples exempted from tax has increased compared with the 1996-7 year, irrespective of whether the couple is being taxed under the normal tax system or the marginal relief system.  As Deputy McDowell has stated frequently, there will always be shifts and changes as people move from one band to another.  We have moved substantially over a number of budgets to address the question of exemption for the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been thrashed out.  I welcome from the Minister a statement that there is in his view &mdash; although he has difficulty in persuading others of it &mdash; an unanswerable case for differentiating between potential and non-potential labour market participants in a welfare payments policy.  It sounds like a right wing view, but it is not.  It is a common sense view.  If we do not fasten in on one point and keep on spending our social welfare resources right across the board, we will compound some problems and not address others.</P>
      <P>Regarding the national pensions initiative, which is coming onstream, there are significant implications if we do not do the right thing by pensioners and by the elderly.  We must deal with the question of pensioners.  Possibly the fairest and best way to address that question would be to say to old aged pensioners that over the lifetime of the next Government &mdash; I do not think this is auction politics &mdash; we will make sure their pensions increases by £4 or £5 per annum so that they will know that is the increase to which they can look forward.  The sense of psychological insecurity to which the Minister referred would be relieved to some extent by that approach.  The sense that their increase always seems residual &mdash; seeing what is left and if the increase will be £2.80 or £2.90 &mdash; would be taken away.  If we started our approach to welfare policy with a significant differentiation between those who are potentially in and those who are potentially out of the employment market and dealt with the elderly as a special case, we would go a good deal down the road towards establishing some sense of social justice and confidence and would give old aged pensioners and those who are largely dependent on State contributory and non-contributory pensions a sense that they are appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that these proposals in the Bill do not apply to non-contributory old age pensioners but apply to contributory old age pensioners who feel they are being left behind in relative terms and are not sharing in the prosperity they managed, through their working lives, to create for <Col N="868" /> this generation.  That is an important point of which we should not lose sight.</P>

    <P>This amendment seeks to set in place in this Bill a framework for radical reform of the taxation system for the next five budgets.  In relation to the personal taxation regime it sets out a plan to effect the rate of tax paid and the standard rate band over five budgets for married and single people.  By setting out in tabular form a series of targets for reform of our taxation system, the amendment puts into sharp focus what would need to be done if we were to achieve a 20 per cent standard rate of tax in five years in the lifetime of the next Government and a 40 per cent top rate of tax during that period.  It also puts in context the question of how much income should be taxed at the standard rate and how much at the upper rate.</P>
    <P>We have had the benefit of a Committee Stage debate on this issue and I do not propose to go over all the matters dealt with there, but I propose to put on record what I recall I was told by the Minister, that the gross cost in today's prices of this set of changes would be £1.326 billion.  The net cost would be less, on my calculations somewhere between £260 and £270 million per annum. We will deal in gross figures because one can engage in trick of the loop economics if one moves too far away from gross costs.  It is worth noting the Partnership 2000 programme guarantees for each of its three years from 1997 to 1999 a £300 million reduction in taxation.  The proposals set out in this amendment are well within the overall parameters of an annual kind set by the Partnership 2000 programme which was thrashed out by the social partners.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread opinion that radical tax reform in the lifetime of one Government is not possible.  It is if the political will is there.  There is a view that the amounts involved are of such an order that it would involve some type of social upheaval or Exchequer disaster to attempt to do that on a consistent basis in the lifetime of one Government.  It is well within our capacity to deliver a major revolution in personal taxation if we have the will to do so.  It is not a matter merely of the desire to do so.  The will to do so carries with it the determination to do it and to make other decisions which would make it possible.</P>
    <P>Since the Committee Stage debate we have had the benefit of the ESRI report today.  I am sure that the men in grey suits in Merrion Street have a slightly jaundiced view of that report and regard the newspaper reportage as a little upbeat for their taste.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Leaving aside the question as to how such an upbeat report came to be published at this convenient time, I want to deal with its substance in so far as it is relevant to this amendment.  It does seem to suggest, as I suspected, that if we keep our economic fundamentals right, if not over ten years certainly over five years, the prospects for employment are very good.  It gives us some grounds to hope for one proposition, that we will see a downturn in unemployment if we keep our fundamentals correct.  It says that as a society, which at present is labouring under an appallingly anti-work, anti-enterprise and anti-participation tax system, we could do a lot better if we reorganised our tax affairs to make it worthwhile for people to work and participate in the economy.</P>
      <P>I understand my witticisms about the Minister's radio interviews were incorrect and that he would have been happy to have a head to head debate with Deputy McCreevy, but the problem was at Deputy McCreevy's end for domestic reasons.  In that context the Minister should bear in mind that what he said this morning on radio about public sector pay is of major importance.  The stance he attempted to take before Christmas was commendable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a tragedy he was overruled and that Billy Attley got his way by sabre rattling down in Killarney.  It was a tragedy that happened, because the wrong impression was created that here was a Government that would give in when put under a bit of pressure.  I accept we are vulnerable walking into an election, and that even those who are soft of centre now could find their positions much hardened if they got a mandate for another five years.</P>
      <P>However, by not setting ourselves real tax targets for reform &mdash; except general figures like £900 million over three years, which means something to some people but very little to many people &mdash; the expectation has been created that the right way to improve living standards is to get big gross pay increases by putting pressure on.</P>
      <P>The Minister is probably in the happy electoral position that he does not have to go out and canvass like I do.  I have been out canvassing and I know that all the voters of Dublin South East consider the Minister a safe shoe in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would encourage them to think like that &mdash; the joys of multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, I was out canvassing last night and met a number of people who were directly or indirectly connected with public sector pay claims at the moment.  I told them I was strictly enjoined by my parliamentary <Col N="872" /> party to give no undertaking to them on public sector pay, in relation to anything over and above the Partnership 2000 programme.  However, given the course of the conversations that followed, I have no doubt but that 80 per cent or 90 per cent of those now beginning to mobilise themselves for claims against the Minister for Finance could be persuaded to take a different point of view if something like this was put before them as a programme of tax reform.</P>
      <P>We must set convincing targets so that a prison officer, occupational therapist or garda thinking of voting in a union ballot for a militant stance on pay will take a different view.  The Government should put before those people a five year tax regime consequent on moderate wage claims within 1 or 2 per cent of the rate of inflation which will transform the situation from one where a worker at or below the average industrial wage pays roughly a third of their wages in tax &mdash; 28 to 33 per cent depending on various things &mdash; to one where workers will pay approximately 15 to 20 per cent tax.  Since the standard rate of tax will be 20 per cent the State will not take more than 20p in the pound and the effective rate will be considerably less than that.</P>
      <P>We must get the social partners to believe in the process of tax reform; not as a £900 million aggregate over three years but as something tangible like a statement on standard tax rates, personal tax allowances and the top rate of tax.  This is where their prospects lie if they go along with wage moderation.  If we could do that, the prospects for this country could be radically transformed and the tax wedge could be significantly reduced in five years time.  The disadvantage of workers south of the Border compared to those north of the Border could be set aside.  The difference between the post tax situation of somebody who works and somebody who is unemployed could be made significantly better and our wage rates and wage costs in the economy could remain remarkably competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> other European states.</P>
      <P>This amendment is practicable.  It can be implemented for less gross cost than even the promises given in Partnership 2000.  It is all the more practicable if one takes on board the fundamentals of what the ESRI is saying, which is that if we keep wages down and keep public expenditure on the straight and narrow, this country is in for a sustained period of economic growth with more employment and a corresponding decline in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For every 10,000 people who leave the dole the State benefits to the extent of £35 million per annum.  If they go into jobs the gross benefit to the State, after tax, is £100 million per annum. We stand on the edge of a major period of opportunity.I have used the term &ldquo;a five year window of opportunity&rdquo; and today the ESRI referred to a 25 year window of opportunity.  We stand on the threshold of a dramatic period of change over the next five years, which could see this country become almost a second Switzerland in terms of <Col N="873" /> its economic strength.  I do not want to be a cuckoo clock fan and I am very wary of international comparisons&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Finland and Denmark are better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends.  This country could be on the verge of a tremendous period of opportunity.  If we increase public spending and give in to public sector pay demands &mdash; including special pay demands like prison officers saying they must have relativity to psychiatric nurses and the latter group claiming relativity with ordinary nurses &mdash; it is the road to economic disaster.  It is not as if the country will fold up in the next five years, but at the end of five years we will be flabby, out of condition and in a poor state to benefit from post-EMU Europe.  If we tell people that if they show moderation in wage demands we can introduce meaningful tax reform I am confident that at the end of the next five years when the next general election comes, whoever is contending for power will have a much healthier economy to argue about.  They will be in a position to do much better things for the deprived in society, the marginalised, the excluded and those who have suffered so much in the past from economic deprivation.</P>
      <P>The next five years will be crucial.  I return to the proposition which I am also stating for Deputy McCreevy's benefit.  Between 1989 and 1992 there was a significant change in our tax regime.  If it had been accompanied, as the Minister has pointed out on radio, by a determination to deal with the tax bands as well, it would have been that much better.  However, nobody under any circumstances proposes undoing what was done at that time.  The key to that was that rates were the subject of a solemn political commitment.If the bands had been the subject of a solemn political commitment different decisions would have been made on public spending as well.</P>
      <P>All parties in the House must take on board the fact that there was considerable foot dragging in the system in general &mdash; I will put it no stronger than that &mdash; about even doing what was done.  It was only the embarrassment of having fixed targets that meant it was achieved.  If the people believe the incoming Government's guarantee that this will be the tax regime and that all decisions will be made in the context of moderation, it will provide an opportunity to consolidate our economic success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, although not by the Minister, that tax reform is a policy by the comfortable for the comfortable.  However, it is not.  I would be happy to see the introduction of tax credits.  The present system of allowances is tilted in favour of the rich.  Rich people buy section 23 apartments, invest in business expansion schemes, put £50,000 per head or £100,000 per couple in special savings accounts, open special investment accounts and take advantage of inner city urban renewal <Col N="874" /> schemes for the purpose of reducing their tax load.</P>
    <P>The people who suffer under the tax regime are the single workers who cannot break free from its vice grip and who do not have the money to put a deposit on a house.  I met one such person last night.  She said she would vote for me this time &mdash; she did not do so the last time &mdash; because she now realised that increasing house prices and crippling personal taxes meant she could not put her foot on the bottom rung of the housing ladder.She was annoyed that some of her colleagues, who made more prudent decisions a few years ago, had already availed of mortgage tax relief, yet she could not get a mortgage.  We must work to ensure that these people do not suffer the burden of crippling taxation.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not written in stone but it shows that the country has the capacity to change the tax system for £0.25 billion per annum over a five year programme of Government.  The last table in the amendment shows that the first £15,000 of taxable income could be taxed at 20 per cent.  If allowances were added to that &mdash; I did not mention increasing them in line with the rate of inflation &mdash; PAYE workers would pay 20 per cent tax on the first £18,000 or £19,000 and the effective rate of tax would be approximately 14 or 15 per cent.  That would be the single most dramatic transformation for workers.  If we could get away from the chaos which happened between 1973 and 1987 when tax went through the roof and establish a situation where a single worker could earn up to £18,000 gross and pay 14 or 15 per cent tax, it would be a dramatic change for whatever parties achieved it and it would improve our employment prospects.  I am not hung up on the 2:1 ratio for married people but if we introduced this tax regime, we would be able to retire from politics knowing we had achieved something.  The House should avail of this opportunity to change the tax system.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for saying on Committee Stage that the arguments made by the Progressive Democrats in relation to low rates of tax on work had won the day.  We now hear the siren voice of CORI which wants each employer to send more than half of every payroll to the Minister for Finance and it will arrange for everyone to get £60 or £70 a week as a basic income.  It also wants a 45 per cent tax rate and a 12 per cent social responsibility tax.  That idea will end in chaos, while ours will end in prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendments on Committee Stage which the Minister also costed.  Most politicians now accept there is a direct link between taxation, public sector pay and Government expenditure, although that may sound boring and old fashioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was unable to get his Cabinet colleagues to accept that the stand he attempted to take during the Partnership 2000 negotiations was the correct one.  I cannot understand why they were not prepared to back him in relation to public <Col N="875" /> sector pay increases.  This morning's ESRI report strengthens the belief that prudence is the way forward.  I fail, therefore, to understand why his Cabinet colleagues could not have seen the benefits of that proposal.</P>
    <P>I said to the Minister on a television programme eight or ten weeks ago that no political party, including the Opposition parties, would be able to stand up to the lobby groups which would emerge in the run up to the general election.  I have been proved correct in that regard.  A number of politicians would have commented on Partnership 2000 but for the general election.</P>

      <P>Those were just pay agreements.The unions had to negotiate new arrangements which were more in line with the concept of partnership.  Despite opposition from numerous politicians at the time, they worked well and the Minister has recognised that.  After a number of agreements were made, people began to forget the chaos which existed before the partnership approach was adopted.  Credit must be given to the Fianna Fáil Government under Mr. Haughey for introducing that proposal and for convincing the trade unions, farmers, employers and others to become involved in the process.  However, it would be naive not to believe that there was another key determinant at that time.  Trade unionists of all persuasions, but particularly the trades union leadership, knew that the country would be ruined financially unless we did something.The country was banjaxed, to use a phrase not often heard in the better parts of Dublin 4. All sides recognised the economic reality.</P>

    <P>In 1987 that reality had borne itself heavily on every group in the country, and particularly the leadership of the trades union and employers.  It was evident to the Government and policy makers also. That led to the situation where there was a trade-off for low wage increases in the hope it might work.  Nobody believed it would work as well as it did.  Of course it was not so difficult to get the second programme under way because the first one had shown itself to be such a great success. The third programme was a little more difficult <Col N="876" /> to agree and by the time we came to the present one people and politicians had forgotten the ruinous state of the economy ten years ago.  The trades union leadership have not necessarily forgotten about it but their constituent organs have, and a number of employers and employers' organisations have also forgotten about it.  It is not popular for politicians or political parties to call for control because everything is going fairly well.</P>
    <P>People agreed to Partnership 2000, which is supposed to be an agreement for a number of years, but I do not see anybody abiding by the spirit and, more importantly, the explicit terms of that agreement.  The ink is not dry on the national agreement and nearly every group in the country is making a special claim.  One of the things about the 1997 agreement of Mr. Haughey's Government when Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance and the subsequent agreement when Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Finance was that public sector pay increases were deferred but it is written in stone that they would be paid eventually.Deputy Bertie Ahern had to pay them when he was Minister for Finance and I, with Deputy Quinn, was a member of that Cabinet which made an all out effort to sort out all the special claims by the end of 1994.  That was achieved and it was one of the reasons expenditure looks a little high in those years, as the Minister and his officials will be aware.  However, nobody is abiding by the spirit or terms of the agreement which has just been signed.</P>
    <P>As the general election approaches every group in the country knows that the three party Government is in a weak position.  If it was a single party Government, it would not be in a much stronger position because I know the exigencies of electoral politics as much as anybody.  This is calamitous and it must be stated now.  I read in yesterday's newspapers that IBEC is protesting at a letter which some unions have sent to their members to the effect that the wage rounds are to be taken as agreed and the extra is to be taken anyway but that they should not even talk about the extra until they get more.</P>
    <P>Every trade union, particularly those in the public sector, is lining up to take on the Government and most of them are getting their way because the election is just around the corner. The nurses' dispute was to have been a special case which was supposed to be ring-fenced. Everybody in this House knew that when that case was given into, everybody else would follow. That is what has happened.  Ten weeks ago I suggested that we should get the general election out of the way because common sense would come to rule again.  I am sure the Minister for Finance and people close to him in his Department are wondering what they will do.</P>
    <P>It does not make much sense to me that everybody who signed an agreement is breaking it willy nilly.  It may not be politically popular to say this aloud but it is the plain truth.  If Deputy McDowell or I make an agreement with somebody, I <Col N="877" /> would expect it to be honoured.  I can understand a person breaking an agreement after a year or two for specially stated reasons, but it would be a peculiar kind of agreement if a party was thinking of breaking it within four weeks for no good reason.  At this stage it looks as if everybody who is tied to the agreement is afraid to state the obvious.  Is this agreement not worth the paper on which it is written?</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is committed to implementing the terms of Partnership 2000 and Deputy McDowell's party is also committed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We seem to be the only people who are committed to it.  We now have a national partnership agreement in nominal terms but it is a free for all in reality.  We might as well face up to these unvarnished truths because we should be clear about where we are going.</P>
      <P>This morning's ESRI report gives a fair assessment of the reasons for the recent economic growth, it takes a long-term perspective on why this has come about, and how we are reaping the benefit of the demographic dividend.  It also outlines the things which were done in the medium term to bring this about and emphasises heavily that fiscal prudence and wage moderation arising from the partnerships were the medium term factors which helped to achieve the present good state of the economy.  The report further states that these are key determinants to that end if we are to enjoy the expectations and rates of growth which the ESRI is predicting until 2010.</P>
      <P>The report comes down heavily on the danger of rising expectations.  Having addressed the difficulties of the past ten years, there would always be a danger that rising expectations would be fuelled.  Whatever about people standing on soap-boxes fuelling expectations and trades union leaders trying to encourage constituent members to get the best deal from the employers, I find it sickening that the Government is afraid to stand up and speak the truth just because there is an election around the corner.  I would be more inclined to believe Ministers if they said that we cannot go on like this.  The Minister for Finance must have a pain in his head from shouting at his Cabinet that unless they get the general election out of the way in the near future, they will ruin some of the recent great developments in the economy.  If somebody does not stand up to say what everybody knows to be the truth because he or she is afraid of antagonising a few voters, the expectations laid out in the ESRI report will be at naught before the year 2000, not to mention 2010.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's amendment is achievable over a period of time.  I tabled similar amendments on Committee Stage and the Minister outlined the costs involved.  One must remember that the Minister has committed himself in Partnership <Col N="878" /> 2000 to at least £900 million in PAYE concessions and £100 million on the employer-corporation tax side.  The total cost of Deputy McDowell's amendment comes to £1,325 million over the period, which is not much more.  There was a time when these things were not feasible but the ESRI report states that if we conduct ourselves reasonably, we will be able to achieve a great deal.</P>
    <P>The Government has been responsible for running the economy for the past three years and, if increases in spending during that period had been limited to inflation plus 2 per cent, an additional £1.5 billion would have been available for further expenditure.  Action could have been taken in the areas of tax concessions, crime, social welfare, etc., as a result.  However, due to internal political pressure, it was decided to increase gross public spending by over 20 per cent during a period when cumulative inflation did not exceed 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since the age of 18 I have read books by many economic commentators.  It is not my opinion that one should alter one's initial view on economic matters after 20 years.  However, things change and one must adapt to the prevailing circumstances.I can find no theoretician or exponent of the dismal art of economics who states that expenditure should be increased by almost four times the rate of inflation in a time of economic growth.  If the mandarins in the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the NESC, etc., can provide a document which states that this is a proven theory for the operation of any type of economy, I will bow to the their greater knowledge.  I have issued this challenge on previous occasions but, to date, no one has taken it up because such a theory does not exist.  If it did, it would not work and would cause deprivation.</P>
    <P>During the past two years, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McDowell and myself have had many discussions about economic and monetary union in this House and at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which were not adequately reported.  The Minister is aware of my views on fluctuations in the exchange rate <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Irish punt, which lost 1p against sterling in early trading this morning.  That is a major fluctuation.For the past year I have stated that this type of volatility will become increasingly prevalent in the run up to EMU.  The Minister knows my views and has taken some of them on board. We have discussed this matter in a friendly way because we do not wish to see the economy damaged.With the advent of EMU, it is probable that Ireland will reach the average EU income and will receive smaller amounts of EU funding. However, public expenditure is being increased at an extraordinary rate and expectations are being raised, as stated in the document published by the ESRI this morning.  I place the blame for the raising of such expectations at the Government's door.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> Responsibility for defending Government economic policy and informing the public of the hard facts does not rest solely with the Minister for Finance; it also lies with the other members of the Government.  I suspect the Minister for Finance has given up during the past months and decided to remain silent until after the general election.  However, someone will have to dampen expectations in this regard.  As stated earlier, if spending could have been limited to inflation plus 2 per cent during the past two years there would be adequate finance available to fund the programme suggested by Deputy McDowell in one year.  The tax bands could have been reduced to 20 per cent and 40 per cent with no difficulty. This could have been achieved in a three year period.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy McDowell.  I suspect that the Minister for Finance does not need to be convinced in respect of the arguments I made in that regard.  However, it is time that he and his Cabinet colleagues expressed those arguments.  I doubt that this will happen because we are in the run up to an election and the silence on this issue has been deafening.  It is time that people woke up to reality.  Not only is it the responsibility of the Minister for Finance to express such arguments but employers and trade union leaders must also do so.  However, some trade union leaders have been cowed.  In a recent competition for the leadership of one of the unions an unknown person won a gigantic slice of the vote.  This illustrates that the unions are not in tune with the expectations of their members in the lead up to Partnership 2000.  It is time that someone called a halt and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and trade union leaders to speak out.</P>

      <P>I will try to respond as briefly as possible to the points made because I presume the House wishes to deal with other amendments. The present difficulties in respect of public sector pay relate to the existing PCW agreement which has yet to expire within the public service.  Partnership 2000 came into effect on 1 January for the private sector.  However, in so far as it applies to the public service, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> does not expire until the end of June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have consistently stated that a deal is a deal and people have signed on for pay increases, including the 3 per cent special restructuring provision over the three years of the agreement.This has been expanded, on a <i>pro rata</i><Col N="880" /> basis, to 5.5 per cent over an extended period where genuine restructuring took place.  People were given additional money to facilitate such restructuring.  Regrettably, there appears to be a tendency by some groups to revert to making comparisons with other groups with which they had been traditionally linked.  The thrust of the provisions to end special pay awards, to which agreement was reached in principle, was to remove those historical links which no longer bore any relevance to people's work.</P>
      <P>There is a greater issue at stake to which I will refer in light of Fianna Fáil's involvement. Broadly speaking, during his term of office as Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds initiated the strategic management initiative which is designed to address the fact that work practices at all levels in the public service must be modernised and dramatically changed, if only for the sanity of those working within the system.  Working in the public service can be extraordinarily frustrating for some people.  I worked as a junior architect for three years in Dublin Corporation and I have direct experience of the sense of bureaucracy, restraint and limitation people encounter.  I am aware that this continues in many instances within the current hierarchical system, which bears no relation to people's educational qualifications or, in contrast to the position that existed between five and 15 years ago, the access, <i>via</i> technology, they have to information.  That must be addressed and changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of the discontent which manifests itself as public service pay claims is a representation of people's discontent with being unable to carry out their work in a satisfactory manner.  The SMI is attempting to address this issue.  Developments in this regard include the introduction of performance-related pay whereby people will be rewarded for additional and special work on the basis of an agreed system of benchmarking and comparison.  The three pillars of the national understanding &mdash; this extends to other issues with which I will later deal in respect of the recent vote in SIPTU &mdash; involve pay moderation and low wage increases in return for real reductions in income tax and the establishment of industrial peace to enhance the competitive position of the economy and bring about a low interest, low inflation regime, which, in turn, would lead to employment creation.  On present performance that model formulated by different parties has delivered, when gauged by any comparative yardstick.That was because people were committed to the concept of endeavouring to create additional employment.  In the late 1980s and early 1990s that was a critical objective.  As we move further into that innovative area, having achieved more and more, to the extent that we are beginning to see labour market shortages in some areas and have a kind of institutional loss of memory to which Deputy McCreevy referred, people have forgotten just how difficult were the 1980s.  I will never forget them, having been in Government at the time when every option available <Col N="881" /> appeared worse than the next, when, with the exception of lone voices like that of Deputy McCreevy, there was collective amnesia and intellectual anarchy on the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <P>We can make reductions in income tax over the next two to three years, certainly within the context of Partnership 2000, provided all of its conditions and terms of partnership are adhered to. People cannot cherry-pick when it comes to the terms of Partnership 2000.  That message, which I have been articulating fairly frequently, has to be heard by a wider audience, in which respect I support and welcome the comments of Deputies McCreevy and Michael McDowell.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy did not describe the entire picture when he spoke about public expenditure. On the overall increase in public service pay, to which different Governments signed up, if one takes it that in round figures, the running of this country costs approximately £13,000 billion, £3,000 billion of which is expended for central fund purposes, effectively paying the mortgage and a few other related functions, there remains a balance of £10,000 billion for the provision of all of the public services, £5.25 billion being expended on salaries for a larger number of people and the balance on such things as <i>per capita</i> payments for young people at school, supplies and services for hospitals, grants to the IDA and other commitments that do not represent a salary element.  Therefore, any increase in the public service pay bill has an impact on that proportion of the total expenditure.  In addition to that kind of spread, we have had a number of additional extras in recent years which we had no option but to pay, such as the equal treatment payments amounting to approximately £260 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they are reckoned to be an increase in public expenditure which I financed in a very innovative, clever manner.  I insisted on doing it in the manner I did, but it manifested itself in the Book of Estimated as increased expenditure.</P>
      <P>We had to pay a fine of approximately £80 million to the European Union in respect of irregularities in the administration of our agricultural supports system, in which Deputy McCreevy's party had more than a passing interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On top of that there was the additional cost of compensatory payments for incidents of BSE, the costs associated with hepatitis C and the emerging costs with regard to deafness among some Army personnel, all of which were economic shocks, in some respects, of a kind much more severe than some about which people are worried in moving toward economic and monetary union.  Furthermore, we have abolished third level fees, a measure of which I am <Col N="882" /> very proud and which I consider was the right thing to do.  The real cost was much less than the increase of approximately £60 million which appeared in the Book of Estimates because a very innovative and cleverly informed group of people increasingly abused the benefits of tax covenants to obtain substantial relief for their children's educational expenditure.  From memory, a sum of approximately £42 million of tax foregone was lost on covenants entered into, principally for educational fees, from a base figure some five to seven years previously of approximately £5 million to £6 million.  Those are approximate figures only and should be taken to illustrate orders of magnitude only.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we closed off another more innovative form of the same kind of loophole, the direct scholarship scheme, along with the abolition of third level fees, leaving us in a position similar to that of every other member state of the European Union in regard to university fees, representing another increase in public expenditure.</P>
      <P>I have not even begun to address the incessant demands from all sides of the House and the public at large for improved provision for child care following the unbelievable revelations of child abuse which have appalled everybody of sound and reasonable mind, not to mention extra resources for the Garda and our Prisons Service.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the criticism that our expenditure has been massive and excessive &mdash; there are cogent reasons for it &mdash; but that is not to say we should lose the run of ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There always will be those demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The litany of increased expenditure I have read out is without precedent in recent times in terms of demands and we have dealt with them in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell's proposal that over a period of time we should lay out a schedule of tax reduction has a very clear attraction but, as he correctly said, it is conditional on other components also being nailed down.  Any attempt to enter into that kind of commitment in legislative form without specific legislative caps on expenditure in other areas would leave us open to the risk of not being able to implement the law.  Deputy McDowell was quite open in respect of this &mdash; that is not to say there is a particular way in which one could signal such a policy, announce it over a period of three to four years and give it legislative effect in one year, although undoubtedly that has a certain attraction.</P>
      <P>I accept the view, articulated by practically all of the parties, that reduction in personal income tax is a desirable objective in itself, that it complements the understanding of social partnership and addresses issues of low pay and the interface between the labour market and low pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last point made by Deputy McCreevy in regard to the trade unions and social partnership <Col N="883" /> social partnership is about much more than just pay deals, it is about mutual recognition. Employers have done remarkably well out of social partnership, a view I enunciated at my party's conference and at a number of selection conventions including one I attended in Killarney recently, where a hotel had been closed down by a new owner who refused to recognise existing undertakings and contracts of engagement as a going concern, the property having been bought as a going concern.  From their point of view one only has to look at the profits of many companies and the overall performance of our economy. They ignore at their peril the right of workers to organise themselves in trade unions and to request trade unions to negotiate on their behalf. They cannot have it both ways, they cannot have national moderation, national pay restraint and national responsibility delivered by the leadership of the trade unions at one level while, at the same time, local individual employers engage in a kind of two-way free ride bet.  This leads to a scenario at national level, fuelled by social partnership and social responsibility and moderation which is urged by everybody while, at local level, individual employers refuse to recognise workers who want to be represented by a trade union.</P>
    <P>What was expressed in part in that SIPTU vote was the frustration of many members in the private sector that their substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the Irish economy, envied by many other countries around the world, is not being recognised with the fundamental courtesy of representation by a trade union which would discuss matters of mutual concern.  Nobody could say the Irish trade union movement, in the broadest sense, has not been responsible in economic terms.  The partnership will be at risk if employers organisations at national level do not recognise they have an obligation to communicate to their members that they would not have been able to negotiate the agreements if there were not trade unions with whom to negotiate.  The trade unions will not be able to negotiate at national level unless they have support at local level from their members.  If trade unions can negotiate at national level, in time, they will be able to deliver on the commitments entered into if they have support throughout the country.  That is a significant component of the developments we have seen recently.</P>
    <P>All participants to the partnership have to recognise that an ongoing commitment to the deepening of the partnership at local level is essential if we are to achieve the prospects set out in the ESRI report.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment as the Deputy will no doubt be aware because of the changes we have already made.  I have nothing further to add.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a far-reaching debate but it has not been irrelevant because all the prospects for radical tax reform in the lifetime of the next Government depend on political <Col N="884" /> choices and the strength of the backbone of politicians in the short term and the medium term.  I fully agree with what Deputy McCreevy has said about the Partnership 2000 programme &mdash; it is being torn up.  It is amazing that he and I are the only two people in politics who seem to be absolutely committed to it.  Everybody else has become the flexible friend, the political access card, the person who is willing to back down in the face of a demand.</P>
      <P>I know from talking to workers involved in the current ongoing disputes that they see a society in which a number of people are doing very well and see themselves as excluded from that society. They have grasped the notion that this is a Government which will give in if they put in the boot.  When the prison officers come on the horizon the Minister will see what they have in mind. The Minister said there is pressure for increased resources to be spent on the prison services.  I suggest there is not; there is pressure for more prison space.  Ireland should be the only country in the western world which has more prison warders than prisoners.  It should not cost twice as much to keep a prisoner in an Irish jail as it does in an English jail.  We should not have prison warders here who, although they have the highest manning ratios, also have colossal overtime ratios, some of whom the Comptroller and Auditor General has noted are earning up to £45,000 in overtime in a year on top of a salary based on a manning level which is not equalled anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>It is about time it was made clear they are not a special case and that any link they think they have with the psychiatric nurses cannot possibly justify setting the Partnership 2000 programme aside in their case.  It cannot be done.  I ask prison officers to compare the figures at the top left hand corner and the bottom right hand corner of their pay slips and support a party, a programme and a Government which will make those two figures come closer together.  They should not think they can push the Government into forever increasing the difference between the figures at the top left hand corner and the bottom right hand corner on their pay slips because, in the last analysis, that is the road to ruin.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the trade union movement has played a valuable role during the lifetime of these social partnership agreements.  I accept that. Where in the private sector has there been the pressure we have experienced recently in the public sector and what is the difference?  The perception is that the public sector employer viz. Government and through Government the taxpayer and the voter is a soft touch or a pushover in present circumstances.  The Minister used some language which was reasonably tough but the bottom line message was fairly muted and none of his colleagues say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period 1987-89 when I sat more or less where I am now and Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance I put forward various proposals to which he said the answer was &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The word <Col N="885" />&ldquo;no&rdquo; appeared in the political vocabulary at that time when the first of the national partnerships was in existence.  It does not seem now to be in the political vocabulary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have been that unkind to him.  There is much rhetoric about what happened between 1989-92 but as the Minister well knows there was some deferment between 1987 and 1989.  I am not complaining about that. The bottom line was that the foundations for economic recovery were set in that period.  The Minister said this is a three-legged stool &mdash; wage moderation, tax reform and industrial peace &mdash; and if there is not industrial peace and wage moderation there will be no tax reform.</P>
      <P>I start from a different perspective.  The Government should say there will be tax reform and whatever decision has to follow will follow and anybody who does not understand that is getting it fundamentally wrong.  The word should be &ldquo;no&rdquo; to excessive pay demands.  If that was the message, it would register in the minds of ordinary trade unionists and they would not vote for &ldquo;a nobody&rdquo; to challenge for the leadership and pass resolutions antagonistic to social solidarity. They would get the message and accept it and the Minister would create a new consensus for radical tax reform.</P>
      <P>We are coming to a crunch.  One of the problems with the ESRI report this morning is that it suggests there will not be a crunch point.  People in some of our leading financial institutions say if things go on as they are, the 1998 budget will not be a happy one.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some of the unpredictable events such as the equality payments, the beef fines, the hepatitis C and the Army deafness claims.  About 18 months to two years ago I asked whether the Government proposed to establish a compensation tribunal for the Army deafness claim and said it would cost £0.25 billion if it was not set up.  That evening I recall reading a comment to the effect that I had exaggerated the issue but the Government had it in hand.</P>

      <P>As I understand it £100 million is going into the hands of solicitors because of failure to face up to a situation that had arisen.  That should have been dealt with by a Defence Forces tribunal and should have involved the payment of a phased sum.  It should never have emerged as damages, individual claims and huge legal fees.  I do not care what legal person is offended by what I am saying.  It is <Col N="886" /> outrageous that £100 million will go into lawyers' pockets, arising out of that mess.  It is even more outrageous that the Government was not told two years ago of this horrendous mess and that it should act decisively to defuse the situation.  It is more outrageous that the Minister and his colleagues who have presided for the past three years while this has built up will not have to come up with the £350 million.  Somebody else will have to foot the bill.  I am sure the next claim of this nature is on the way as well.  We must get serious about civil litigation.  I was glad to read in today's newspaper that the State has realised it is not a soft touch in pay negotiations and in litigation. Taxpayers' money is at stake.</P>
      <P>In regard to social partnership and solidarity, the greatest poverty fighter is a job.  Those who pursue public pay claims, the effect of which is to run up employment taxes, mean that remuneration for their jobs is more important than the prospect of other people having any type of job. There is a great deal of discussion on whether low paid jobs are acceptable.  There is justice in the proposition that people should be paid a fair wage.  However, the Minister only has to walk around Sandymount, Ranelagh or Donnybrook to see the advertisements for people to take up employment in businesses in our constituency.  I do not understand how those advertisements can be seen at a time when 262,000 people are unemployed.</P>
      <P>There is something systematically wrong when business owners are trying to take people on while other people are compensated by the State on a weekly basis because they cannot find work. These jobs do not require a degree or other qualification; they are to be found in pubs, stores, takeaways, etc.  There must be a way to reconcile the demand of the employment market for workers in that area.  Certain people say that increasing wage rates is the way around that problem but it is not because the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance are the biggest competitors for any small businesses in terms of filling jobs.</P>
      <P>Last year's fuss about the dole queue and the removal of 20,000 fraudulent claimants has died down.  We do not hear about it, for political reasons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come for a rigorous approach to resolve the difference between labour force surveys and unemployment pay-outs.  It requires effort, political courage and honesty.  The Minister should not constantly use euphemisms. Candy floss terminology is used to disguise what is needed.  A rigorous approach is required to work out whether people are unemployed because of economic considerations or the <Col N="887" /> absence of jobs.  As long as euphemisms are used to describe what we are doing because we are afraid of being politically incorrect, we will not do well.</P>
    <P>This amendment sets out the framework for tax reform.  Doubtless there are other amendments that could have achieved the same result but until ordinary Joe Soaps understand the Government has an agenda and is committed to it, they will say the only thing they can do for themselves that is certain to work is to make pay demands and back the militants in their unions who demand more.  As long as the Government is vague, they will go for the definite option.  People are sensible; they go for certainties rather than vaguenesses.The Minister asked if the amendment was made to the Bill what would happen in year two if there was a setback and revenues did not reach expectation.  The Minister for Finance of the day would have to state in the budget speech that he or she will live up to targets, raise other taxes, widen the tax base or abandon them if necessary. If the bottom line were that the Minister faced the choice of amending the Finance Bill to the disadvantage of the taxpayer, there would be at least some pressure on him to achieve a target. That is why I favour fixing targets.</P>
    <P>We are entering the era of multi-annual budgeting, why not enter the era of multi-annual tax reform?  Why should a Minister for Finance not come into the House red faced and apologise for another deafness claim and say he or she cannot meet the targets and will have to change the amount of money at which the standard rate is available?  I prefer to see that constraint on a Minister.  If I was Minister for Finance, I would prefer to have that pressure on me so that I could sit at the Cabinet table and say to my colleagues that if they expected me to amend the Finance Bill and abandon targets, the answer was no.  Tax reform is the ultimate political residual.  One first decides on spending and makes concession to the Billy Attleys and others who queue up on the horizon.  Then one takes account of what is left <Col N="888" /> for tax reform.  Workers who do not have the economic strength to flex their muscles and get what they want are shortchanged.  I feel sorry for them.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a business owner in the south east who employs sheet metal workers and he referred to the special pay claims of recent months.  He said that his workers do not have incremental pay scales or a structured career path with advancement from being a sheet metal worker to a supervisor and so forth.  They realise this is their job for the rest of their lives.  There are no commissions for sheet metal workers to say one can become a super worker if one spends five years on the job and obtains a qualification.  He said he dealt with ordinary people who were stuck in these jobs.</P>
    <P>When it came to telling them that they had to pay 54 per cent tax on their marginal earnings to Ministers De Rossa and Quinn and they would have to continue to do so because concessions were made in Dublin to those who had more political leverage than them, they were disgusted.  I do not blame them.  They could go on strike and ruin that company.It could lose orders, etc., if they received significant increases in their wage claims.  They were disgusted that the newspapers in Dublin stated there should be concessions on special claims but not to worry about Joe Soap doing a hard day's work.  They have no commission, PR agencies, spin doctors or pickets outside the door. They could not take the day off to picket outside Leinster House because the firm would collapse. They are the real heroes in all of this, the people who are short-changed by a system which does not protect their rights.  They are entitled to tax reform and a Government which says public sector pay, public expenditure and increases in public spending come second to it.  If we had a Government which started from that position, we would transform this country.  The word &ldquo;no&rdquo; must return to the political vocabulary before any of this can be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.  &mdash;The Revenue Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time make regulations for the purpose of exempting persons resident within the State from liability to taxation and levies in respect of earnings from employment in Northern Ireland to such extent as, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is reasonably necessary to create equal treatment as between such persons and other persons resident in the State and liable to taxation and levies on similar incomes earned in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of cross-Border workers and their taxation treatment is one of elementary social justice.People who live in Donegal, Ravensdale and <Col N="891" /> Scotstown and who work in, say, Derry, Newry and Forkhill, respectively, are in a very invidious position.  Every day they go to work in Northern Ireland, sit at the factory bench with their workmates who reside in Northern Ireland and do the same hours as them.  They come home in the evening to their wife and family or husband and family, as the case may be, and face at the end of the week or end of the year a tax treatment which is radically different.  Why is there such a huge difference between the tax treatment of a worker who resides in Northern Ireland and a worker who resides in the Republic?</P>
    <P>This matter would have been dealt with to a great extent if the last amendment in my name had been accepted.  If taxation rates and taxation regimes South and North of the Border more or less approximated then there would be fewer arguments about cross-Border workers. However, they do not, and this amendment is based on the proposition that as long as they do not, something must be done for those unfortunate enough to work in the North and reside in the South, and pay taxes in the South on their northern earnings.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to this issue.  The Minister conceded that not merely are higher tax rates applicable in the Republic, there are lower gross wage rates available in Northern Ireland.  The Minister somewhat glibly announced that this was as a result of 18 years of Thatcherism in Northern Ireland, and perhaps there is some substance in that.  I agree with the Minister, and I am glad Britain will have a Prime Minister who favours privatisation, a low rate of tax on workers, who will not increase tax above 40 per cent and who is committed to policies which the Irish Labour Party label as Thatcherite when they come out of my mouth.  I am glad New Labour in England &mdash; or any party with the term &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; in its title &mdash; is in the business of winning elections and getting a majority by adopting centre ground policies.I recommend the same course of action for the Minister when he becomes Leader of the Labour Party.  Perhaps he will be able to transform that party into one which believes in low tax on workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to talk about workers' tax rates in Northern Ireland and in the South, the result of the Minister and his colleagues being in office for 15 of the last 25 years.  Workers in Northern Ireland are taxed more heavily on lower earnings for similar work in the Republic.  In other words, if they lived in the Republic they would be given more in gross wages out of which they would have to pay the severe anti-work taxes which apply here.  This is a group of people who are being sorely tried by present laws.  As Deputy Keaveney said on Committee Stage, many of them have either given up their work in Northern Ireland or given up residing in the Republic and gone across the Border to be nearer their jobs. That is the only way they can get justice.  It is a sad day when Irish workers either have to give up work, north or south of the Border, because of the crippling burden, of taxation, or migrate to Northern Ireland to avoid the Republic's tax impositions on their northern earnings.</P>
      <P>The proposal in my amendment is to allow a flexible regime in which the Revenue Commissioners can introduce, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, regulations for the equalisation of the tax burden.  Deputy McCreevy's amendment takes a different approach but they are both aimed at achieving the same result, that the crippling burden of southern tax rates on northern earnings must be addressed in the short term.  It is not good enough to say to a young man or woman trying to raise a family in the Republic, who is fortunate enough to find work in Northern Ireland, that they must wait until someone like myself and my colleagues produce a fairer tax regime in the Republic.  They are entitled to some relief now from the effects of the tax and earnings cliff which exists between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  This regime does not apply to everybody.  Because of double taxation agreements some public sector workers in Northern Ireland are exempt from the effect of this regime. That is equally unfair because if people are to pay southern Irish tax on their earnings, it should not matter whether they are employed by the Northern Ireland state or in a Northern Ireland factory. That is another injustice.</P>
      <P>I know other Deputies want to speak on this amendment.  This is a basic question of justice to which this State must address itself.  The issue has been around long enough for us to come to some basic conclusions about it.  Doing nothing on the grounds of alleged difficulty is not an adequate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies from Border counties want to contribute to this debate. I moved a similar amendment to my amendment No. 4 on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, 1995, the Finance Bill, 1996, and on Committee Stage of this Bill last week.  As other Deputies will attest, this is a vexed question in areas along the Border.  There is a very active cross-Border workers' group which has been protesting about this issue for some time.  It has lobbied successfully <Col N="893" /> and proven to be a considerable political force, but it is not sufficient reason to change tax law simply because one group protests more loudly than another.  There must be a certain amount of consistency.  If I oppose unjustified lobbying by groups regarding wage increases, it is equally fair that one group should not get an advantage over another in regard to tax increases, except when it is justified on equity grounds. There is an inequity regarding the taxation of cross-Border workers.</P>
      <P>Since I became Opposition spokesperson on Finance I have read a great deal of material on this matter.  Part of my education came about as a result of the Donegal North East by-election when I had the pleasurable experience of being seconded to the county for the duration of the campaign, as against being in the constituency of Dublin West.  Deputy Keaveney was the successful candidate in that election.  During that campaign.I met a number of cross-Border workers informally on the doorsteps and in more formal settings.  To be truthful, I gave as good as I got at some of the meetings with them and did not concede to all their demands.</P>
      <P>Arising from what I learned during that by-election, I carried out some study of the matter. In fairness to the Minister for Finance, in the 1995 budget he said he would set up a cross-party interdepartmental group to examine this matter. That group subsequently reported.  The Department of Finance forgot to send me a copy of the report &mdash; that is not a criticism of the Department &mdash; but a copy became available to me.  I read the document with some interest and came to the conclusion that some relief measures need to be implemented in that regard.</P>
      <P>My amendment proposes to incorporate in the Finance Act, 1997 a principle we first enunciated in the Finance Act, 1994.  As the Minister will be aware, as he was a member of the Cabinet at that time, we brought into law a principle which recognised the <i>de facto</i> position of workers who spend long periods of time outside the jurisdiction working for their companies.  I supported that idea because, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, I met many of those companies during trade missions abroad.  Many of those workers spend the best part of a year outside the State working for those companies, even though they are based in Ireland.  The Finance Act, 1994, incorporated the principle of recognising time such workers spent in and out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the cross-Border workers' group, I said on Committee Stage, and I repeat now, that I do not want to incorporate a further anomaly into tax law in the context of two workers, one of whom works in the North and the other in the South, both of whom live side by side in the South and enjoy the same range of social services or lack of them, as the case may be.  This would result in more serious anomalies and create uproar among workers in the Republic.  My amendment will not alleviate all the problems of <Col N="894" /> cross-Border workers but calculations we have done indicate that it could relieve hardship for 75 per cent or 80 per cent of the people so affected and would recognise the principle brought into the 1994 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>There are many Border Deputies who wish to contribute and I will allow them to make their own case.  This amendment has been carefully worded.  It is a repeat of an amendment previously put forward and its purpose is to incorporate in cross-Border workers' taxation the principle already established in the 1994 Finance Act for workers who spend a considerable amount of time abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies McDowell and McCreevy have outlined in some detail the inequity that exists for people affected by cross-Border taxation measures.  I thank the Minister for the meetings he afforded us as Members of the Oireachtas for the Border constituencies at which we had worthwhile discussions.  At each of those meetings I outlined the serious difficulties faced by huge numbers of people living in west Cavan who travel to Fermanagh to take up gainful employment &mdash; were it not for the initiative and enterprise of some business people in County Fermanagh many people in west Cavan would have had to emigrate further afield in search of employment.</P>
      <P>It is inequitable that people who are bringing in large sums of disposable income to this State should be penalised as they are under the present system.  This needs to be addressed if substantial numbers of the people in question, particularly those in the younger age group, are not to leave their home county and set up home in County Fermanagh where the taxation system is more favourable.  A sparsely populated area cannot afford to lose people who are in gainful employment and bringing disposable income into that county.  The loss of population has effects in many other areas, resulting in the closure of schools, post offices and other rural services.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to put in place, as quickly as possible, a system which will not penalise those people who take the initiative to seek employment elsewhere and who bring back disposable income to their native area.</P>

      <P>The debate on amendment No. 3 affords representatives from the Border counties an opportunity to articulate the constituency pressures they are under in relation to this matter.We have a sizeable proportion of people who work in the North and live here, and that is replicated in all the counties along the Border.  Deputy Smith's point is relevant.  Under the present taxation arrangements the attraction of living in the North is obvious, but we should not be in the business of making it attractive for people to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> A number of questions are relevant to the debate and the Minister might deal with them in his response.  One of them relates to the number of people who live in the Border counties and work in the North and who are directly affected by this provision.  It would be interesting to look at the catagories and the numbers of people.  I know quite a number of people in the education sector who live here and teach in the North, and it would be helpful if the Minister could give an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of administering the double taxation arrangement because the laws of diminishing returns might become relevant in this case.</P>
    <P>A factor that has not been referred to in the context of this debate is the question of people in low-paid employment.  People employed in the North are generally on a lower salary scale than people in similar employment here.  At the forum in Dublin Castle that point was borne out in a study by Dr. John Bradley of the ESRI on comparative cost competitiveness North and South. That report graphically illustrates that the level of wages in the North is much lower than here. Consequently it is much more profitable to operate, say, a service company in Newry than it would be to operate a similar company in Dundalk and this, in the main, is because of the level of payment to employees.</P>
    <P>My last point refers to eligibility for family income supplement.  Under the bilateral arrangement covering this area, if somebody in low-paid employment in the North fell below the threshold for family income supplement, would our Department of Social Welfare be obliged to make a payment to him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney" hpid="Cecilia Keaveney Cecilia Keaveney">

      <P>I support the amendments. This issue was raised on the Finance Bill last year and at that stage we decided that, prior to the introduction of this year's Finance Bill, we would gather the Border Deputies together and discuss the issue so that this year we would be able to come up with a new solution.  It was the beginning of March before we did that, but I am glad we had a meeting because it afforded us an opportunity for a useful exchange of views.</P>
      <P>Last night there was a meeting of the cross-Border workers in Letterkenny of which all Deputies were informed.  The meeting centred around one issue, the lack of progress in a year despite the highlighting of the matter last year.  I was unable to attend the meeting due to the situation here in terms of legislation but I am aware there is a strong perception that nothing has happened since this time last year.  Feelings are strong because the moratorium has ended and people are facing reality.  The Minister made progress last year in certain directions.  While this has been of some help, there is a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister mentioned that these amendments make a special case of <Col N="896" /> cross-Border workers.  However, the fact that levies and health contributions have been removed has made a special case of them as it is, and they are entitled to be treated as a special case when one looks at their situation.  The question is to what extent they should be treated as a special case because, obviously, we do not want to create further anomalies.  However, we want to address their situation which is serious.</P>
    <P>If the tax systems in both parts of the country were the same the problem would not be as great. However, the bottom line is the difference in wages.  Somebody working in the North may be paid £12,500 but would be paid £18,000 in Donegal for the same job.  Wages are not the same and people are further penalised because of the extra tax.</P>

      <P>Cattle producers are most affected by the position in regard to export refunds.  I raised the matter with the President. There is significant disagreement between Ireland and the Commission about the way in which the digression of refunds is calculated.  We believe the periods used for the calculation and the duration of the concession should be shorter because there are a number of unused concessions in regard to export refunds which could be used by Ireland, the principal country in the EU which exports to third country markets.  Under-used or unused facilities for refunds that lie dormant are a matter of concern to the Government and the meat and farming communities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the problem regarding export refunds is not of recent origin. It originated in the world trade deal negotiated by a previous European Commissioner and, in so far as Ireland is concerned, by a previous Government.It is important that we operate that agreement in such a way as to minimise the current substantial difficulties.  I am pleased the Commission agreed last week, following my meeting with the President, to accept all Irish offers for intervention.  This will allow some easement in the marketplace.  I am also pleased the Government has since been able to announce subsidies which will be paid on cattle slaughtered between 1 April and 10 June.  This will also help ease the position for producers.  However, I do not under-estimate the extent of the long-term difficulties the Irish cattle industry must face as it adjusts to a more open world trading market.</P>

I did not discuss this matter in detail with the President in the course of his visit to Ireland which was primarily of a ceremonial and social nature.  We discussed the position regarding the cattle trade and the financial perspectives post 1999 were touched on.  In the course of our primarily social conversations, we discussed the prospects for the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and the Amsterdam summit.  Those were basically the topics we were able to cover in the time available to us.  I did not discuss a whole range of issues with the President.

      <P>Even if he was at the top table, I am sure the Taoiseach had an opportunity to discuss the single currency.  As a former Minister for Finance, I have a great interest in currency matters.  It is obvious the Irish pound is facing difficult times.  What difficulties does President Santer perceive for the single currency?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that there may be speculative attacks against the Irish pound?  The Central Bank has obviously decided the inflationary pressures that made it support the Irish pound in recent weeks have disappeared or it is trying to move the pound to a new floor.  What is the Government's view in this regard?  The pound fell sharply today against sterling and while that may be good for some people others will be very concerned about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The national anti-poverty strategy, Sharing in Progress, which I launched last week with the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, is a policy document that reflects the Government's commitment to addressing, in a co-ordinated way, the issues of poverty, social exclusion and unemployment.  This commitment arose from the UN Social Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen and was confirmed in Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>The development of this strategy has been an inclusive process involving widespread consultation and participation with the voluntary and community sector, the social partners, the users of services and people affected by poverty.  The strategy addresses the five key themes which are central to tackling poverty and social exclusion. They are education, unemployment, income adequacy, disadvantaged urban areas and rural poverty.  In each case the strategy sets out a series of targets to be pursued and the policy actions which will be taken to achieve these targets.</P>
      <P>Social exclusion is a pervasive phenomenon.  As our society and economy progress, there is every reason to believe that unless effective interventions are made the gap between the haves and the have-nots and the skilled and the unskilled will widen.  The effects of poverty and social exclusion are felt not only by the poor, but by society as a whole.  This is not just in the case of crime and drug taking, but in a range of other negative phenomena associated with disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The adoption of this strategy takes place at a time when we have increasing jobs, rising living standards and improved services.  This situation has developed because of the consistent approach this Government has taken to the management of our public finances and the economy.  There will be no departure from the sound economic policies which the Government has pursued to achieve this success.</P>
      <P>Against this background we must ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably.This strategy is not simply about targeting increased resources.  It is about ensuring that Government Departments and agencies work together to maximise the effectiveness of the resources and programmes which are devoted to tackling poverty.  It is a strategy to refocus resources at those who are excluded and put in place an institutional framework which aims to tackle the gaps and inequalities in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach acknowledge there are still serious problems of social exclusion?  While we have had major economic successes over the past decade or so, 250,0000 people are unemployed, 20,000 school leavers drop out of the education system each year, 10,000 second level students, despite their best efforts, cannot find places in universities and a large number of communities are totally excluded.  According to this report 15 per cent of our population are living in persistent poverty. <Col N="900" /> Will the Taoiseach outline if the Government will seriously address the issues of marginalisation and exclusion?  He was correct in saying it is a feature of rural and urban areas.  Many people have not gained in the past few years.  While there is much talk of the increase in the number of hitech jobs and jobs in the chemical industry, the marginalised and excluded do not benefit from them.  Fewer people in many communities in this and other cities, are participating in third level education than ten years ago.  We are not making progress with those communities.  Addressing these issues is a matter of policy for all Members. These problems will not be solved overnight and we need to direct policies at those communities. Many people are prepared to talk about our great economy, but there is not much good news in writing about hardship, social exclusion and marginalisation.People do not tend to follow that type of story; there are always other stories to follow.  The Taoiseach might not wish to mention the proposals to address this problem.  I do not want to hear a litany of what people are doing. We need to address these issues in a constructive way, which we should all try to do as we approach a general election and a new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the issue of poverty should be at the top of the political agenda.  That is why one of the proposals is that a Cabinet sub-committee will be established which I will chair and which will deal with this issue on a basis that includes the work of all Government Departments.  This issue should not be dealt with at the margins of Government or political activity; it should be at the centre of political activity.  It is important that there should be specific and measurable targets against which the performance of the Government can be measured &mdash; that it can be obvious from the figures used whether the Government and society are achieving their declared targets.</P>
      <P>For that purpose we have set specific targets in regard to the factors that cause poverty.  For instance, we have set ourselves a target of ensuring that no child leaves school before he or she has completed the junior certificate and that the proportion of children leaving school without completing the leaving certificate should be halved from the current 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  Furthermore, we are setting ourselves the target of halving the rate of unemployment.  It is the single most important cause of poverty.  It causes poverty not only in income terms but, probably more importantly, in terms of shutting out people from the normal contacts associated with work which give them the capacity to have a fulfilling social life and to find out about job opportunities.  When someone is locked into long-term unemployment, it is extremely difficult to break out of that cycle not only solely for income reasons, but because he or she is shut out of the information network, the basis on which people can reach employment opportunities and a fuller life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume a Dáil committee will address this issue; a committee should address it. The Taoiseach was correct in saying that when a person is long-term unemployed he or she faces many difficulties.  Every survey, including this one, has found that the cycle of poverty starts at a very young age.  The number one priority of any proposals should be to address the problem through the education system beginning at pre-school.That is where the cycle of deprivation, crime and poverty starts in society.  Any examination or study of this problem reveals that we should address the problem through the education system.  This situation will not be easily changed in my lifetime or that of the Taoiseach, but if we deal with it through the education system by giving people opportunities, we could address the problem over a given number of years.  To do that the necessary resources must be provided for education.</P>
      <P>Since we joined the European Community in 1973 we have spent hundreds of millions of pounds under European Social Funds in periods when the Taoiseach and I were Ministers, but we have not moved one iota to assist the marginalised communities of this State to address the difficulties of long-term unemployment and social exclusion.  While people in some communities are better off than they were in 1973, many in others are worse off.  We need to address the issue in a way that will make a difference through the education system.  The Taoiseach should provide whatever resources and efforts are necessary to address this problem through the education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the problem of poverty starts at school and at pre-school.  That is why under the local area partnerships, which are being assisted by my Department, specific provision is being made for pre-school education for families who might otherwise be in comparatively difficult circumstances.  I had an opportunity recently to visit a pre-school in the James Connolly Centre in the south inner city, which is providing for that. I also visited another recently in Clonmel where the pre-school facility is being specifically targeted at families who might otherwise be at risk.  That provides an opportunity, to the mother usually, to take some work which gives her an opportunity to have a fuller life and be able to do her job as a parent better too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we should set ourselves targets for education at primary level. There are, unfortunately, still some children who fall behind at primary school and the extent to which they have fallen behind only becomes apparent when they enter secondary school and are in a more competitive, measured and structured educational system.  We need not introduce the same degree of structure into primary education but we need to monitor progress in primary education, particularly in respect of children who are at risk.  In the target areas where there is a concentration of poverty &mdash; I am thinking <Col N="902" /> particularly of urban areas &mdash; as part of the work the Minister for Education is sponsoring for schools in disadvantaged areas, for instance, home-school liaison teachers have been appointed.  These teachers liaise with families as it is recognised that children frequently fall behind at school not because of what happens at school but because of what is, or is not, happening at home.  It is very important that there should be a special link between the comparatively easily identified families at risk and the school through a home-school liaison teacher. That is being done on a much increased scale.  A large number of measures are being put in place to deal with this issue on a systematic basis, dealing with all the factors from birth to the end of life, which contribute to people finding themselves in positions of poverty or social exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When this group is set up, it would be helpful if the Taoiseach would give just one instruction to all the State agencies telling them to leave their agency brief at home and try to deal with the problem on the ground.  For 20 years I have been watching how good schemes do not work.  If the Taoiseach issued such an instruction at the outset it would be immensely helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that instruction has been issued in the form of the strategic management initiative.  The national anti-poverty strategy is part of the strategic management initiative, which is a system whereby all Government Departments are required to manage the way they use their time and the financial and other resources available to them in accordance with objectives they have set for themselves. In the national anti-poverty strategy, as announced, the targets we have set to eliminate poverty are central to the strategic management structure of all Government Departments.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee dealing with poverty I will ensure this instruction is respected by means of direction from the highest level in Government, namely the Taoiseach, to every level of Government on an ongoing basis.  It is not a question simply of issuing an instruction, it is also a question of presiding over the system and ensuring the instruction is complied with daily.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to our strong economic growth and to the need to spread it around.  Some 600,000 people pay the low rate of income tax and with a 14 per cent increase in tax revenues for the first quarter all the Minister for Finance was able to do in the recent budget was take a penny of the low rate of tax.  Some 30,000 people on the average industrial wage of about £15,000 are paying that kind of money.  It is all very well to talk about spreading economic growth around, but when 600,000 people pay the low rate of tax and receive a 1p tax cut at a time of unprecedented growth, does <Col N="903" /> that not suggest the benefits of growth is not being shared with ordinary workers?</P>

      <P>The vast majority of people in the poverty trap have a waiver and do not pay service charges.  I will take up the point about the anti-poverty strategy in an area I represent.  Politicians have often highlighted poverty in places of high unemployment like Knocknaheeny and Churchfield.  There was an opportunity recently for the Government to break the cycle but, unfortunately, it was missed as these areas did not qualify for that scheme.  When we questioned the Minister for Education here on the matter we were advised the Minister had no responsibility for deciding who would qualify for the breaking the cycle initiative.  It is all very fine to talk about reports and strategies but here was an opportunity for the Department, the Government and the Minister to respond to local needs, yet we were told the Minister had no responsibility.</P>

Many of the parents of children who attend St. Theresa's school in Balbriggan are unemployed, but work voluntarily to raise funds for the school.

      <P>I note the Deputy's points about Balbriggan and I will take them into account.  The main mechanism is to establish local partnership companies and arrangements to deal with poverty on the basis of initiatives taken by the people concerned and in consultation with them.  It is important for voluntary organisations to come together in Balbriggan and in every other area where there is a problem to see what can be done.  As far as my Department is concerned, I will be happy to arrange for the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to meet any group from Balbriggan which wants to discuss this matter.  I am conscious that these problems in Balbriggan are not new in that they have not occurred in the past two and a half years.  I will be in touch with the Deputy, <Col N="906" /> Deputy Seán Ryan and the Minister for Justice about this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The islands committee of Galway County Council prepared a list of priority projects to improve access services to the islands.  The priority list included a feasibility study on necessary improvement works to Cleggan Pier, County Galway, and a feasibility study in respect of dredging necessary to improve access to the harbour on Inishbofin Island.</P>
      <P>Both these projects were recommended by the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee and I approved grants of £20,000 towards the cost of each project.  The overall object of both projects is to identify and cost the works required to improve access and safety at Cleggan Pier and Inishbofin harbour.  I have not yet received the studies.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to proceed with the work as soon as he receives these studies?  Could he clarify if the funding of such marine works is the responsibility of the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of the Marine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I was appointed Minister of State I have endeavoured to treat all the islands equally by providing additional access to them.  I have assisted in funding the Bear Island project at Pontoon Pier, which is a joint venture between the Department of the Taoiseach, Cork County Council and the community of Bear Island.  This year I approved a project worth £328,000 on another non-Gaeltacht island, Whiddy Island, which is a joint venture between Cork County Council, the Department of the Taoiseach and the petroleum company that is using the island's services.  This clearly illustrates that my Department is endeavouring to provide the non-Gaeltacht islands, which have been neglected since the foundation of the State, with additional access requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new pier was built on Inishbofin Island some time ago.  However, the islanders suffered as a <Col N="907" /> result of an overrun when the Deputy's party was in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The then Minister for Finance, who is now the Leader of Fianna Fáil, had responsibility for the Office of Public Works and he decided that the pier did not need lights or a crane.  Galway County Council, of which Deputy Ó Cuív is a member, has refused to lay the water at the new pier.  If the islands committee of Galway County Council send these proposals to my Department for processing, I will endeavour to improve access services on Inishbof in Island and the other 21 islands.</P>

      <P>The interdepartmental report, which was commissioned by Deputy Andrews and which I successfully completed, recommended that additional money should be put aside for access services.  If the problems on Inishbofin Island relate to access and a proposal is sent by Galway County Council to the interdepartmental committee, the money will be provided. Funds were allocated to the Bear Island project because Cork County Council was prepared to put its money where its mouth was.  Donegal County Council was also prepared to do so. However, Galway County Council is reticent about investing in the offshore islands.  The councillors do not seem to want to take the initiative.</P>

      <P>I refer the Minister to a reply I received yesterday from the Minister for the Marine in relation to Cleggan harbour.  He seems to think he is responsible for the harbour, as does the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  It seems that the Minister for the Marine and the Taoiseach are not aware that the other is looking after this matter.  Which authoritative body will make the decision to provide funding for the development of Cleggan Pier and the dredging of Inishbofin harbour?</P>

      <P>Galway County Council does not have enough money for water schemes, roads, sewerage schemes, etc., so it is unable to provide matching finance for the islands.  As the Minister is aware, finance for county councils is decided by central government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I admire Deputy Ó Cuív for developing the successful co-op initiative in Connemara.He realises more than anyone that private funds must be invested.  I do not know why Galway County Council cannot increase the rates to provide additional funds to help the islands.  This would improve the tourism and fishing industries, about which Deputy Ó Cuív is concerned.When I talk about access, I talk about human access, not the access fishermen want to develop which is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine.  There is a problem at the pier at Cleggan, County Galway, because of the growth in tourism to Inishbofin.  There are huge numbers of people arriving at Cleggan pier and it is dangerous because the ferryboat is having difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>We asked that a feasibility study be undertaken with a view to improving the position for the ferryboat and the people using it at Cleggan pier and Inishbofin.  That is my responsibility. The fishing industry side of it is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine and I am sure Deputy Ó Cuív can distinguish between the two. There is no need to confuse the people of Inishbofin or Cleggan about where the responsibility lies.</P>
      <P>If the Galway county manager and the county councillors adjoining Inis Bofin and the Aran Islands make definite proposals for which they are prepared to provide council money, I will match it.  How is it that Donegal County Council and Cork County Council can provide funds? Why are the councillors afraid to accept their responsibilities?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked for a certain contribution to finance any of the proposals Galway County Council has put to us.  I have never defined the rate, that is, whether it was to be matching funds, for example, as long as the county council makes a sacrifice but Galway County Council is not prepared to make a sacrifice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as road improvements on the islands are concerned, there is an application from Donegal <Col N="909" /> County Council for road improvements and the Minister for the Environment has given additional money to all of the county councils which have offshore islands.  Donegal County Council is prepared to invest its money in order that the Government would provide money for Aranmore Island and Tory Island.  Last week I was on Tory Island and announced a road grant of £42,000.  The sum of £100,000 is being provided for Aranmore Island.</P>
    <P>Substantial money will go to Inishbofin if Galway County Council is prepared to provide some of the investment but it is not prepared to do so. It is difficult to deal with a county council which is not prepared to make some sacrifice.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on his prompt response to the plans for the islands submitted by Donegal County Council.  I assure the House and the Minister that the Celtic tiger has been spotted on every island off County Donegal because more money has gone into County Donegal in the past two years than in the previous 50.  If there are further submissions from Coiste na nOileáin of Donegal County Council in respect of the two remaining islands, Gola Island and Inishbofin, County Donegal, will the Minister look favourably on them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The multi-party negotiations, which were adjourned on 5 March, are scheduled to resume in Belfast on 3 June.  On several occasions the Government has made clear its disappointment at the slow pace of progress so far, and we will <Col N="910" /> seek to ensure that, following their resumption, the negotiations are pursued with a keener sense of purpose.  It is essential that the work of the opening plenary session is completed quickly and we move on to substantive negotiations in the three strands.  It remains our view that the decommissioning issue, which remains the chief obstacle in the way of this objective, can only be resolved on the basis of the implementation of the Report of the International Body in all its aspects.</P>
      <P>It is vital that after the British general election all parties with a serious interest in peace and reconciliation, whatever their differing views on constitutional or other matters, rededicate themselves to working with each other and with the two Governments to make the negotiations succeed for the good of all the people in both communities in Northern Ireland and in the interest of the relationships between the peoples of these islands.  The negotiating framework has been carefully constructed and has many substantial assets, including international goodwill and the involvement of authoritative and skilled independent chairmen.  Balanced safeguards protecting the interests of all parties and the people they represent are in place.  Failure to take this opportunity for dialogue and agreement would further damage the credibility of the whole concept of democratic politics in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the political climate in which the negotiations take place will have an important influence on their chances of success.  The impact of the parades issue on community relations in general, and on the standing of political leadership in particular, provide further reasons for all involved to ensure that parades are not allowed to become, once again, an object of confrontation and a source of disorder and lawlessness.  By the same token, progress in the negotiations could make a contribution to the relaxation of the tensions surrounding parades.  However, the single most important factor in the equation would be the restoration of a completely peaceful environment free of all paramilitary violence which would contribute immensely to building confidence in the political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's preference has always been for a fully inclusive process of negotiations; inclusive, that is, of all parties committed to advancing their objectives by peaceful and democratic means alone.  We want Sinn Féin to take its place as an equal participant at the negotiations but this cannot happen until there is a complete and unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire. Moreover, the longer it takes until there is such a restoration, the harder it will be for the republican movement to convince even people of goodwill of its credibility and durability.  Violent or disruptive actions by the IRA, whether in Northern Ireland or in Britain, are totally counter-productive and reprehensible.  They serve only to put further gratuitous obstacles in the way of Sinn Féin being able to present the views of its supporters at the negotiating table.  Furthermore, we will not allow the self-imposed absence of any <Col N="911" /> party to stand in the way of the energetic pursuit of the fullest measure of progress achievable in dialogue between the Governments and the parties at the table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste speaks of a keener sense of purpose being the driving force when the talks resume on 3 June having been suspended on 5 March.  Surely his credibility in this matter would be far greater if there was no delay in calling a general election.  If the decision of the Irish people at the ballot box was out of the way as in the UK, the talks could commence with clear direction on 3 June because there is no hope at present of a serious resumption of talks.  Is it not a fact that there may not be a serious resumption of these talks until the autumn because there is no clear political direction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I can be fairly direct with Deputy Burke.  As the Deputy will be aware, the date of the election has not been fixed; that is the constitutional prerogative of the Taoiseach.  On the question of the resumption of talks, I believe strongly there will be a serious resumption of these talks on 3 June and it is our intention to be there at the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Tánaiste in condemning IRA violence and in particular its recent disruptive behaviour during the course of the British general election campaign, and the bombings in the UK.  Would the Government be concerned to ensure that the rules of participation in the talks are applied equitably to republicans and loyalists?There appears to be a disposition at present to require more than just a lasting ceasefire from the IRA.  On the one hand serious breaches of the Mitchell principles have been overlooked to date, the latest of these, the threat to prison officers, from the loyalist side.  While I have no desire to see any party with a serious commitment to democracy being excluded from the talks, surely both Governments must be seen to be making an effort to be more even handed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to state that even handedness is necessary in respect of republicans and loyalists.  It is important that there be a clear, unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire. However, as I stated on many occasions, it is not a question of a ceasefire, we want an end to violence and the threat of violence.  Deputy Burke has made many forthright remarks during his career about his views on IRA and loyalist violence.We are <i>ad idem</i> on that issue and will continue to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely important to get away from the culture of violence.  Everyone understands the historical background and baggage accompanying this issue but it is important that we try to break down the mistrust that exists when the talks resume.  Deputy Burke has attended the talks and is aware of the atmosphere prevalent at the negotiating <Col N="912" /> table.  We have a long way to go to break down mistrust among constitutional politicians in Northern Ireland and those on the island as a whole.  We have a long journey to make together.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I answered questions tabled by Deputy Burke I informed him that there are suspicious minds on all sides.  The first major test for both Governments and the parties in respect of the talks process is to gain a clear understanding that we all want to work together and that no one wants to take advantage of predicaments or situations.  Trying to instil that sense of confidence into the talks will take a great deal of work.  I hope this can be achieved.  I do not believe it was achieved in 1991-92 and it was not achieved in the period up to 5 March.  However, the first requirement is that we must be able to sit across the table from each other, politician to politician &mdash; with no vested interests being represented or games being played &mdash; and state that we want to work out a settlement which respects the diversity on this island and allows us to work together in a peaceful way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke has been very forceful in opinions he expressed in recent days on radio programmes and elsewhere.  Every time there is an atrocity or a threatened atrocity it becomes more difficult for those of us who advocate inclusive talks because further barriers and distrust are created.  I hope we can return to the talks on 3 June in a spirit of confidence with which, for historical reasons, we must all deal.  Leadership must also be shown.  There are divisions in the loyalist, Unionist and Nationalist communities.  We must do our best to heal those divisions and work together to achieve reconciliation between the parties in Northern Ireland, on the island as a whole, and between both Governments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's acknowledgement that all Members are committed to opposing violence, the threat of violence and the behaviour of the IRA because Fine Gael seemed to question that commitment from Members on this side of the House.  The Tánaiste correctly represented my position, and that of my party leader, on this issue.</P>
      <P>I agree that this issue involves leadership.  This will be required when the talks resume on 3 June. It is vitally important that the people will have decided, one way or the other, at a general election on the make-up of the next Government so that a serious leadership role can be taken from 3 June onward rather than having to wait until after the marching season.  Can the Tánaiste give any reassurance that &ldquo;Drumcree III&rdquo; can be avoided?  Is a compromise possible?  Will the Orange Order be required to forego marching down the Garvaghy Road or will the march be forced through?  Does the Tánaiste agree that either outcome would have serious consequences which no Member wants to see?  It is vitally important that clear direction be given from 3 June onward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share the Tánaiste's view on an unequivocal <Col N="913" /> ceasefire and the halting of targeting and rearming.  An unequivocal ceasefire must be put in place so that everyone can attend the talks. Clear leadership at those talks should be provided by a Government with a clear mandate, not by an Administration embroiled in a campaign to seek such a mandate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>For obvious reasons, I do not wish to be dragged into a discussion on the date of the election.  I understand that the Government's mandate can run until January and we will approach the negotiations in that light.</P>
      <P>I cannot deal with Deputy Burke's question about Drumcree at present because of the rules relating to priority questions but Question No. 12 concerns parades and I will provide detailed information when we reach it.  It is vital that an accommodation be found in respect of parades. The process of local dialogue and compromise advocated by the Government is vital and the recommendations of the North report should be enacted into legislation as quickly as possible.  I hope the Parades Commission will meet with success and I believe that the correct route has been taken.  However, compromise and discussion at local level will ultimately bring about the methodology we are seeking.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the policy of military neutrality.  In the Government's White Paper on Foreign Policy there is a clear and unequivocal statement that the Government will not be proposing that Ireland should seek membership of the Western European Union or NATO or the assumption of their mutual defence guarantees.  The White Paper also makes clear that the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Irelands participation in a common defence policy would be put to the people in a referendum.  This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people decide otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish neutrality should not be a pretext for minimalism or isolationism, or for standing aside from the major international security challenges that have arisen since the end of the Cold War. Our neutrality is not incompatible with international efforts to enhance peacekeeping and co-operative security in support of the United Nations or the OSCE.  I do not believe that there is any Member who on reflection would advocate that we marginalise ourselves from developments in peacekeeping and crisis management which, <Col N="914" /> far from threatening our foreign policy traditions, flow from a recognition that traditional military approaches to security, based on Cold War concepts of hostile and mutually exclusive camps, are inadequate.</P>
    <P>Partnership for Peace is a regional co-operative security initiative anchored in the principles of the UN Charter and the OSCE.  It has now attracted the participation of almost all members of the OSCE and is a practical expression of the co-operative approach to European security advocated by the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The White Paper states that the Government will explore further the benefits that Ireland might derive from participation in PfP and that a decision on participation will only be taken by the Government in light of consultations, including with the relevant Committees of the Oireachtas, and subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I had useful consultations with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs in April last.  Subsequently, and as I reported previously to the Dáil, officials of my Department and the Department of Defence had consultations with NATO on 20 June last year to explore further the benefits which Ireland could derive from Partnership for Peace.  Those consultations were entirely satisfactory and confirmed our understanding that each participating state can determine the terms and scope of its contribution; that participation would have no implications for our policy of military neutrality; and that Partnership for Peace has proven itself to be a key forum for peacekeeping co-operation involving almost all of the major peacekeeping countries.  The NATO side also expressed appreciation of Ireland's peacekeeping role and achievements.  Ireland would have much to gain and indeed to offer in this crucial area through participation in PfP.</P>
    <P>I wish to confirm to the House that a decision to participate in PfP would be subject to a motion on the terms and scope of any participation by Ireland being approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is neither a basis nor a need for a referendum on participation in PfP, which imposes no Treaty obligations of any sort, no mutual defence commitments and which has no implications for our policy of military neutrality.</P>

      <P>Members on this side of the House share the view that Ireland has a role to play, and has done so since the early 1960s, in respect of its participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Can the Tánaiste inform the House whether his own determination, which he has just reiterated, to force Ireland into the NATO-led Partnership for Peace represents Government policy or is merely his personal objective?  Can he inform the House how the Government intends to reconcile the fundamentally conflicting policies within its members in regard to Irish membership of Partnership for Peace, as expressed by him as Leader of the Labour Party, and by the Minister <Col N="915" /> for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, as Leader of Democratic Left, when he addressed his party conference on Saturday last and stated in no uncertain terms that Democratic Left believes Ireland ought not to join NATO, the Western European Union or Partnership for Peace, that his party position is that only under United Nations auspices should Ireland commit her military forces in the cause of peacekeeping?  I believe we should also make our forces available to the European Union and not exclusively to the United Nations.</P>
      <P>How can the Tánaiste reconcile his view on membership of Partnership for Peace with the clear statement of the Minister for Social Welfare that it is his party's view Ireland should not join NATO, the Western European Union or Partnership for Peace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it very clear to Deputy Burke that I am not forcing Ireland to do anything.  If Ireland makes a decision, it will be a democratic one by the elected Members of this House, which is as it should be.  There is no question of any Minister of the day forcing anybody to do anything.</P>
      <P>In relation to the policy position, the Government has made its position quite clear in the White Paper on Foreign Policy that we will keep this matter under active consideration.  I am confident that the considerations in favour of Irish participation in Partnership for Peace will become increasingly apparent.</P>
      <P>I have explained to Deputy Burke on at least five former occasions what is entailed in Partnership for Peace.  While I do not want to misrepresent him, Deputy Burke seems to think we are talking about a military alliance whereas we are talking about a regional co-operative security initiative anchored in the principles of the United Nations and the OSCE.  If the Deputy has any fundamental problems with that, he certainly has not conveyed them to me or to many others in recent years.</P>
      <P>We can take pride in our efforts in peacekeeping since we undertook United Nations missions, a pride shared by our partners in Europe and on an even wider basis.  I want that to continue.  It is very important that we have access to co-operative security initiatives, like Partnership for Peace, to ensure that our military &mdash; whom we will be mandating to go on missions &mdash; have the operational capacity to undertake those missions with the maximum security and experience available. That can be done within the context of the Partnership for Peace.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious plight of hundreds of thousands of refugees in eastern Zaire who are now starving and who have no protection whatsoever; and his views on whether it is appropriate that Ireland should continue to assist the present regime in Rwanda which is clearly in league with the Kabila rebels in Zaire who have been described by an EU official as engaging in genocide.[11673/97]</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The plight of refugees and displaced persons in eastern Zaire is a matter of grave concern.  Reports in recent days of attacks and killings in the Kisangani region and elsewhere are particularly worrying.  I am extremely concerned also that it is proving difficult to provide food aid and other emergency assistance to those at risk in eastern Zaire.  The Government unequivocally condemns any murders or other human rights abuses which may be taking place and deplores the disregard for the suffering of non-combatants shown by the parties to the conflict in Zaire.</P>
      <P>We have expressed these concerns to the governments in the region who may have influence on the rebel alliance.  Since last weekend the EU Troika and Special Envoy Ajello have made demarches to the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda to express the Union's concerns about the humanitarian situation.  Mr Ajello has had meetings with President Museveni of Uganda and Mr Kabila.  We have been in touch also with the US State Department about these concerns in advance of Ambassador Richardson's visit to the region.</P>
      <P>The full facts of the situation in the Kisangani area remain unclear.  They must be investigated fully and those found responsible for any atrocities brought to justice.  An initial investigation has been carried out by a tripartite commission led by the UNHCR, which visited refugee camps in the area on Thursday last, 24 April.  This identified the following priorities for further action to relocate refugees, to resume assistance when access is possible and to continue with the repatriation of refugees.</P>
      <P>A team of UN human rights monitors is being deployed in the Kisangani region in the coming days.  Ireland has agreed to provide IR£25,000 in support of this mission, aimed at preventing further human rights abuses.  I should mention that the Irish NGO, Concern, which has been working continuously in the Great Lakes region for the past three years, has been authorised to begin operations in the Kisangani area.  Concern will provide care for unaccompanied children.</P>
      <P>The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata, said on Monday night that the fears which had been expressed at the end of last week that mass killings had taken place in several camps cannot be substantiated.  Nonetheless, a large number of refugees, perhaps as many as 100,000 in the area south of Kisangani, remain in a precarious condition.  Many of those in the bush are in danger of death from starvation or sickness unless humanitarian aid can reach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following meetings with the leader of the rebel coalition, Mr Kabila, the UNHCR succeeded in obtaining his commitment to co-operate in the repatriation of remaining Rwandan refugees from eastern Zaire.  The EU Troika and the Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region, Mr Ajello, participated <Col N="918" /> in the meeting with Mr Kabila.  At a news conference following this meeting, Mr Kabila said that he attached two conditions to the agreed repatriation &mdash; first, that it be conducted by air and second that it be completed within 60 days from 1 May.</P>
    <P>We welcome the important opportunity to resolve the refugee crisis offered by this agreement.Full advantage must be taken of this opportunity.Nevertheless, the time frame for the repatriation presents enormous logistical difficulties.Flexibility must be shown by the rebel side regarding their 60-day deadline.  Mrs Ogata has stressed the importance of continued international pressure in this regard.  The Irish Government has added its voice to that of European partners and others to ensure a successful outcome.  Further pressure must be exerted also to ensure access to humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>I have just returned from this week's EU General Affairs Council in Luxembourg which discussed the current situation in Zaire.  In our conclusions on the Great Lakes region, the Council has called inter alia for the fulfilment of undertakings given by Mr. Kabila in relation to immediate access for the humanitarian agencies in Zaire as well as for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a peaceful and negotiated settlement.  We have also expressed our deep concern at continuing reports of massive human rights violations and urged the UN to investigate them as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As well as addressing immediate humanitarian concerns, initiatives by the EU and others have underscored the need for an early and negotiated settlement to the current conflict in Zaire.  The five-point peace plan of Joint UN-OAU Special Representative Sahnoun, adopted by the Security Council in Resolution 1097, continues to provide the optimum framework for such a settlement. Both President Mobutu and Mr Kabila have accepted this plan.  They agreed in Pretoria earlier this month on points of convergence which include a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. The Government and our EU partners have been fully engaged in the intense international efforts to resolve the current crisis in eastern Zaire.  We strongly support the Sahnoun plan and urge the conflicting parties to adhere to their public positions by bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities and negotiations.  We urge the parties to reinvigorate the progress which had been made towards talks, whether under President Mandela's initiative or an alternative framework.  In this regard we welcome the current US mission to the Great Lakes region being led by Ambassador Richardson.</P>
    <P>Irish aid to the Great Lakes has been as part of the concerted international effort to bring about peace, stability and reconciliation in the region. Our effort has been ongoing for three years. Since 1994, Irish aid has given almost IR£12.5 million in emergency and rehabilitation aid to the region.  Deputies will be aware of the Governments balanced approach in providing this aid <Col N="919" /> from reports to Dáil Éireann as well as from the briefings which have been given to the Joint Committee for Foreign Affairs and the sub-Committee on Development Co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley has asked for my views on whether it is appropriate for Ireland to assist the Rwandan Government.  It is important to be clear about the issues at stake here.  Since the appalling genocide in 1994, when almost 1 million people were brutally killed, the Government has contributed to international efforts to rebuild civil society in Rwanda.  This is a difficult and daunting task, to say the least.  It has to be pursued in the aftermath of a murderous civil war, which has left a legacy of distrust, disorganisation and administrative chaos for the authorities in Rwanda to cope with.  It is against this background that Irish and other international assistance is delivered.  In our case, just over IR£2 million of our assistance has been channelled through Government of Rwanda programmes.  This money has been specifically targeted to support primary health care, the training of magistrates, the resettlement of refugees and the rehabilitation of genocide survivors, together with support for women's groups. I am satisfied from checks that we have carried out that Irish assistance is being used correctly and effectively.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that our assistance to Rwandan Government rehabilitation programmes has been criticised in some quarters.  However, the Deputy will be aware that a number of important organisations which have been working on the ground in the region for the past three years, including Trócaire and Concern, have expressed their strong support for the Governments approach.</P>
    <P>A further IR£4.8 million has been disbursed, again since 1994, through Irish NGOs operating in Rwanda and through international organisations.Apart from providing shelter to genocide survivors and returning refugees from Zaire and Tanzania, a particular area of activity has been the improvement of prison conditions.  Ireland has provided support through the UN system for refugee resettlement and for human rights monitoring by the UN Centre for Human Rights. Assistance has been provided also to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</P>
    <P>In the Great Lakes region as a whole, 52 per cent of Irish emergency and rehabilitation aid for 1996 was given through NGOs.  It is likely that a similar percentage of aid for the region will be disbursed through NGOs in 1997.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the assistance given, the Government has remained in dialogue with the Rwandan authorities both bilaterally and as part of international efforts to encourage them in rebuilding the justice system and in respecting the human and political rights of all segments of society.  Despite serious difficulties, significant progress has been made in passing legislation on genocide through Parliament and in starting the process of trials for those accused of perpetrating genocide in 1994.  As has been pointed out on <Col N="920" /> numerous occasions, unless those responsible for killings on all sides are brought to justice, there is little hope of breaking the cycle of murder and revenge with impunity which has characterised the region for decades.</P>
    <P>It is important that such assistance be given to enable the situation in Rwanda to improve further so that, for example, the continuing influx of refugees does not act as a destabilising influence or give rise to human rights abuses.  We can take heart from the fact that the massive return of around a million refugees to Rwanda before Christmas took place in a peaceful manner.  The international community has a responsibility to work with all parties, including the Government of Rwanda, to build on the peaceful nature of this return and ensure that the returnees are fully integrated in Rwandan society.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the description of the situation in Rwanda, particularly in Kigali, by an Irish Loreto nun who returned within the past few days and who has been speaking about the awful atmosphere of fear in Rwanda among the Hutu people, particularly among those who were repatriated from Zaire some months ago and who are now very apprehensive for their lives?  In view of the recent statements of Rwandan Ministers that they consider it legitimate to use donor aid to pursue a war against the Hutus, will he ensure that no further Irish public money is given to the Rwandan Government who have this attitude and instead that it is given directly to Irish and other NGOs in the area to enable them to give what relief they can to the unfortunate people?  Is he aware of a report in today's issue of <i>The Times</i> quoting from a confidential report to the UN and an aid agency which was compiled yesterday, to the effect that in eastern Zaire the Rwandan Army is engaged with the Kabila rebels in killing large numbers of Hutu refugees, of whom it was estimated recently there are 400,000, but in respect of whom it is not now known how many are alive because many thousands have been killed in recent days and weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the remarks made by the Irish sister who spent a fortnight in the region and has returned.  It is fair to acknowledge the work done by our President and the Minister of State in this region over many years in terms <Col N="921" /> of ensuring Irish aid is delivered on the ground in the most effective way possible.  When I went into the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1993 one of the first things I said to the officials was that particular care should be taken in regard to the spending of Irish public funds on development aid in projects in the Great Lakes region and in Africa generally.  That is a responsibility we have and we must account for it.  The Minister of State has been particularly active in the African region. We are doing everything possible to ensure our aid reaches the people we target in terms of rebuilding civil society, health projects, women's groups, resettlement of refugees, rehabilitation of genocide survivors.  We take every step possible to ensure that happens.  Of course we do not want to see any Irish development aid money being spent on arms.  We take every precaution that is not done.  We have received strong recommendations from Concern and Trócaire, agencies who have worked in this region and have vast experience, to continue and increase our efforts because of the role we have been playing in helping the Rwandans at home and as refugees in neighbouring countries.  We would wish to continue that.</P>
      <P>We had our discussion on Zaire yesterday at the General Affairs Council.  The Deputy will appreciate, looking at the international press this morning, that the situation in Zaire is unpredictable.Ambassador Richardson is in the region seeking commitments from both Mr. Kabila and President Mobutu to ensure there is a peaceful hand over.  The prospects are not great in relation to Mr. Kabila forming a Government that has widespread acceptance.  It behoves us in the European Union, the US and the UN to do everything possible to put an end to the conflict and through the international conference which we have been seeking in the region with the neighbouring countries and the United Nations and other agencies, including the Organisation of African Unity, to bring about a peaceful resolution of this complicated problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the UNHCR report of yesterday, as referred to in <i>The Times</i> today, states:</P>
      <P>The existence of military operations against refugees was confirmed by military personnel during the mission.  The commanding military officers in the area were reported to be either Banyamulenge or from the Rwandan Army.  It has been alleged that orders to eliminate all refugees emanate from Rwanda and that the commanders described as highly trained and efficient are sent there to accomplish this task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister comment on that?  Apparently they are accomplishing it very well because thousands, if not tens of thousands, of these unfortunate refugees have died in recent weeks.  Some of the people concerned seem to regard this as the final solution of the Hutu problem.  Is he aware that Rwandan officers when asked to justify why they were killing male babies said these people <Col N="922" /> would grow up into fighters and it was better that they should now die?  In view of these awful circumstances and the terrible suffering of these unfortunate people, will he take steps to intervene to bring this to an end, to give some military protection to people who are totally unprotected in eastern Zaire and to stop the Rwandan Government pursuing them to death as it is doing now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy fully appreciates the complexities of the horrific situation on the ground which we have dealt with here on many occasions.  The President and the Minister of State have visited the region in Ireland's interest. This matter is being handled at the highest levels in the United Nations by Ambassador Richardson, on behalf of the United States Government, who is in the region at present trying to bring about a peaceful hand over of authority in a situation where there are no guarantees in relation to the acceptability of Mr. Kabila's regime.  We want to ensure that further killings are not inflicted on the refugees and we have worked tirelessly in relation to their repatriation.  The priorities are to relocate the refugees, which is not as simple a matter as the Deputy may think for the agencies involved, resume assistance when access is possible and then continue their repatriation.  We will do everything we can with the assistance and guidance of the UN.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to military protection.  We have discussed military intervention on a number of occasions in the House.  The Canadians offered to do so but the situation changed rather dramatically and that was not considered necessary.Ireland is prepared, in the context of its EU obligations, to consider any options put forward. There are also huge risks because of the serious difficulties in locating refugees.</P>

      <P>If they are relocated within Zaire, they will be killed by the Kabila forces.  If they are relocated back to Rwanda they will be killed by the Tutsi regime because those who have already relocated there are in fear of their lives and many of them have been killed.  The description given by the Irish sister bears that out as does the UN report published yesterday.  Is it better to protect these people rather than trying to relocate them yet again?  Many of them have been wandering around the forests of eastern <Col N="923" /> Zaire for seven months with young children and babies.</P>

The Deputy must understand it can be assumed there are armed elements among the refugees possibly ex-Interhamwe, people who were involved in the 1994 genocide.  They may well not wish to be found or repatriated to &mdash; more than likely &mdash; prison sentences in Rwanda. That makes it more complicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On 31 March 1997, Ireland was owed approximately £11 million by the United Nations.  This sum derives exclusively from costs relating to our participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  The main components of the total arrears owing are £4.4 million for troop costs, arising largely from the contribution of an Irish battalion to UNIFIL, and £5 million for death and disability payments.  In 1996 the UN made repayments of £5.2 million to Ireland in respect of arrears owing for peace keeping operations.  This year, £1.4 million has been reimbursed to Ireland for troop contribution costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> The delay on the part of the UN in making full reimbursement to Ireland and to other troop contributing states of costs arising from their contribution to peacekeeping operations is a matter of serious concern.  It is due to the serious financial crisis the UN has experienced in recent years which has been largely caused by the non-payment of arrears and assessed contributions to the UN budget by certain major member states. Consequently the UN system has experienced an ongoing cash flow difficulty which has resulted, <i>inter alia,</i> in the delay of full payment of peacekeeping costs to troop contributing states.</P>
    <P>Ireland and other troop contributors have consistently made clear to the UN Secretary-General and the Secretariat that priority should be given to the full reimbursement of sums owing as soon as possible.  I conveyed these views to the former Secretary-General during a bilateral meeting in New York last September.  Our permanent mission to the UN in New York also makes regular representations to the UN to give priority to this matter.  While we appreciate the serious financial difficulties within the UN system, nonetheless there is a clear obligation on the part of the UN to make full and early reimbursement of peacekeeping costs.</P>
    <P>The matter of peacekeeping arrears is one of several negative consequences of the current serious financial crisis within the United Nations. This crisis is a matter of grave concern since it threatens the ability of the UN to discharge effectively its on going responsibilities in peacekeeping and economic and social development programmes.It underlines the need for a reform of UN funding, to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with its partners in the EU, has been to the fore in seeking the necessary agreement on such a reform.  The EU put forward a set of proposals in January 1996 for a new scale of assessment of contributions by member states to the UN budget.  We actively sought support for these proposals through a continuous process of demarches, consultation and negotiation with other UN member states, including such key contributors as the US.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the EU proposal is that member state contributions to the UN budget should be assessed on a basis which is clear, simple and transparent and grounded on their capacity to pay.  Its principal recommendations are that assessment would be on a base figure of GNP averaged over three years to give a fair reflection of economic strength.  The current minimum contribution of 0.01 per cent of the budget, which has proved difficult for many poorer developing countries, would be removed. The maximum single contribution level of 25 per cent, applicable only to the US, would be maintained, as also would the 15 per cent surcharge on peacekeeping assessments applicable to the permanent members of the Security Council.  This reflects their responsibility in regard to decisions on international peace and security.  The EU reform proposal also recommends a system of <Col N="925" /> incentives for early payment and penalties for late payment of assessed contributions.  If the EU proposal on UN funding was accepted 120 of the 185 member states, mostly poorer developing countries, would pay less than at present with the bulk of increases falling to developed countries.</P>
    <P>Another area where the UN is in need of agreement on reform is in its institutions.  Ireland and the EU have been active in seeking the type of structural reform which would ensure a more effective and revitalised UN system better able to meet the challenges of the coming millennium. There is a need for review of the operation of major organs, such as the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council to see how they can be made more responsive to the tasks facing the UN.  We have argued that within the overall UN system, including the Secretariat, there should be a thorough review of present functions and programmes to ensure they have a more effective impact within available resources, particularly in such areas as economic and social development.</P>
    <P>During its Presidency of the EU, Ireland took the initiative in establishing a common EU position on necessary reforms, both structural and operational, in the economic and social development activities of the UN system.  In December 1996 the EU put forward a set of proposals for consideration by member states and the Secretary-General which recommended a more active and coherent policy and priority setting role in this area by the Economic and Social Council, the body charged with overall responsibility for UN activities in this sector.  In addition, structural changes in the secretariat, involving amalgamation of departments dealing with this area under a single Under-Secretary General, are proposed, as well as a better co-ordination in the field of the various assistance and development programmes of UN agencies and bodies in developing countries under a single UN representative.</P>
    <P>Progress to date on reform issues has not been at the pace required.  There are different perceptions among member states on what changes are required in any major reform of the UN.  The financial crisis within the UN and the unresolved problem of the payment of substantive arrears, particularly by the US, has proved a clear obstacle in convincing all states, and in particular the developing countries, that reform is necessary, not as a cost cutting exercise but to make the United Nations a more vital and effective instrument of peace and development and thus restore confidence in its multilateral role.</P>
    <P>The new Secretary-General, supported by the EU and others, has sought to give fresh political impetus to the process and indicated that he intends to elaborate an overall package of reform measures for presentation to the General Assembly in the summer.  Present indications are that as regards strengthening the development role of the UN, several of the proposals which the Secretary-General is likely to recommend will <Col N="926" /> accord fully with the approach outlined in the EU position.</P>
    <P>Ireland and her partners in the EU will lend full support and encouragement to the Secretary-General in his efforts to promote agreement on an overall reform package.  At the same time we continue to lobby support and agreement among the member states of the United Nations for the proposals of the Union on UN funding and reform of the UN in the economic and social areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that we are owed £11 million for peacekeeping work undertaken on behalf of the United Nations. While I welcome the fact that we received a payment last year and a small payment this year, we should continue to undertake peacekeeping work on behalf of the United Nations even though it is going through a difficult period financially and has not paid us the money we are due.  We should continue to strive to secure repayment of these funds.  To put the matter in context, will the Minister indicate the amounts of money owed on the United Nations' current and peacekeeping accounts?</P>

We have a proud record in this regard in meeting our international obligations.  I have raised the matter with the President of the United States.  As the Deputy is aware, there is a serious dispute in Washington in relation to the functions of and paying for the United Nations.  We would like to see the system of contribution reformed. A number of large countries are in serious negation of their obligations and they should make efforts to pay up.  The President stated that they wished to do this over a number of years and were seeking to obtain the agreement of Congress.I agree with the Deputy that, despite the difficulties this causes for us in budgetary planning, we should continue to meet our international obligations through the United Nations.</P>

      <P>The reason I asked the question was to indicate the threat to the world posed by the fact that the United Nations is in such a precarious financial position and the United States is refusing to pay despite the best efforts of Pressident Clinton to get Congress to agree.  I encourage the Minister to use our offices in Washington and our contacts there and in the European Union to encourage the Americans to pay what is a legitimate debt to the United Nations which is of vital importance so far as peacekeeping is concerned; it is not a question of choice.  While I acknowledge the European Union has been paying its share, rather than being complacent, it should drive the process of reform forward and embarrass the United States, if necessary, into paying its share.  The European Union must lead the way on this issue.  Will the Minister outline the circumstances in which the Government has failed to establish a UN interdepartmental liaison group and to publish a yearly report on issues raised at the United Nations and Ireland's voting record, as promised in the White Paper?</P>

He will be presenting his views on the possibilities for reform to the General Assembly. The members of the Security Council and the General Assembly will have to agree to these. There are different interests and priorities in a variety of countries.  On the Interdepartmental committee on peacekeeping, contact has been made between my Department and the other Departments concerned.  Arrangements are in hand to establish the committee as soon as possible.As the Deputy is aware, it will consider issues relating to Ireland's involvement in peacekeeping operations and provide a formal framework for informal regular contacts between the Departments involved.  It is intended to produce the report on Ireland's voting record at the United Nations following the completion of the work of the 51st Session in September.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to be concerned about the political and human rights situation in Kenya.  In its statement to the 53rd Session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva earlier this month the Union expressed these concerns in terms of the need for the Kenyan Government to take steps without delay to improve the administration of justice, amend legislation which could impede the <Col N="928" /> holding of free and fair elections and create a political climate which would allow the various political parties to function more freely.  While welcoming the undertakings for constitutional reform given by the Kenyan authorities, the Government and our European partners now wish to see concrete action taken on these matters.In the perspective of the general election to take place in Kenya later this year, we will continue our efforts in support of an inclusive democratic process in that country with full regard for human rights and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concerns about the process of democratisation and human rights in Kenya have been made more acute by the tragic killing of the Irish Franciscan missionary, Brother Larry Timmons, during an armed robbery at his compound in Lare in the early hours of 22 January.  Before his death, Brother Timmons had been active in highlighting injustices in the issuing of identity cards for use during the forthcoming elections.  As the House will be aware from my Adjournment statement on this matter of 29 January, a member of the local administrative police has been charged with the murder of Brother Timmons and the Kenyan authorities have promised a full investigation into the incident.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, discussed the matter directly with the Kenyan Foreign Minister, Mr. Stephen Musyoka, in Nairobi on 6 February.  The Government has also raised it with its EU partners and is continuing to monitor it closely through our Honorary Consul in Nairobi.</P>
      <P>The Government is also concerned at reports of harassment in Kenya of church personnel working at local level in the justice and human rights areas.  In particular, we are concerned by the recent statement of the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission in Nairobi which highlighted a series of disturbing incidents.  We are investigating these reports through the Irish Honorary Consul in Nairobi.  It is the Government's earnest hope that any current difficulties can be overcome in a constructive manner and that the important contribution being made by Irish missionary and humanitarian workers in the field can continue as heretofore in a spirit of full co-operation with the Kenyan authorities.</P>
      <P>In view of these developments, I am writing to the Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs outlining the Government's concerns about the reports of harassment of church personnel, including particularly the case of the late Brother Timmons.  The Government will continue to do everything possible, both bilaterally and in co-operation with our EU partners, to increase pressure on the Kenyan authorities to intensify the democratic process with full observance of human rights.</P>

      <P>On the forthcoming elections, we agreed earlier this month to allocate £64,000 to NGO projects which support the process of free and fair elections in Kenya.  A sum of £40,000 has been granted to a Trocaire project which will provide community training in election monitoring, human rights and other related issues.  The remaining £24,000 has been granted to a civic education programme in democratisation and human rights in the region.  Under the Government's bilateral aid programme, the co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations provides grants for small to medium sized projects which meet basic needs in the sectors of health, education, water sanitation, income generation, rural development and urban community development.</P>
      <P>An administrative police officer has been charged with the murder of Brother Timmons. We have been assured by the authorities that there will be a full investigation into the incident. I hope to get an early response to my communications with the Foreign Minister.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Foreign Policy, &ldquo;Challenges and Opportunities Abroad&rdquo;, made clear that the Government regarded human rights as a central part of Ireland's foreign policy. Chapter 8 of the White Paper signalled a number of initiatives being taken by the Government in <Col N="930" /> the human rights area, including the establishment of a human rights unit in my Department for the first time.</P>
      <P>A number of important other initiatives were also outlined in Chapter 8 of the White Paper. First, recognising that greater co-ordination was needed between Government Departments on human rights issues, it indicated that a new standing interdepartmental committee was being established to consider all aspects of Ireland's international human rights obligations.  Second, the White Paper acknowledged the increasing role and importance of non-governmental organisations in the formulation of Ireland's foreign policy.  Accordingly, it indicated the level of contact between the Department and NGOs on the human rights aspects of foreign policy had become so intensive that it had been decided to establish a formal framework for a regular exchange of views between the Department and representatives of the NGO community and a new joint standing committee representing the Department, NGOs and experts in the human rights field was, therefore, being established.</P>
      <P>Following completion of the Presidency of the EU, which was particularly active in the human rights area, preparations for the establishment of these two committees were intensified.  The Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights, which had its first meeting on 18 February last, has already begun implementation of a full programme of work.  I am certain it will contribute significantly to improving interdepartmental co-ordination on human rights issues.</P>
      <P>Work on establishing the standing committee involving NGOs and human rights experts has almost been completed.  Detailed research has been undertaken on how other countries approach this issue in order to determine the model most suited to the Irish situation.  Informal consultations on the matter have taken place with a number of NGOs.  I attach considerable importance to this committee and this is reflected in the level of preparation which is being made for its establishment.  It is intended that this committee will be instituted very shortly.  I look forward to the vital contribution which it can make to the formulation of the human rights aspects of Ireland's foreign policy.  I am confident that its work will enhance considerably the role Ireland can play internationally in this critical area.</P>

Fianna Fáil has been primarily in the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs since the foundation of the State and I do not think it crossed its mind to set up such a unit.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P>In page 15, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4. &mdash; The Revenue Commissioners may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from time to time make regulations for the purpose of exempting persons resident within the State from liability to taxation and levies in respect of earnings from employment in Northern Ireland to such extent as, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, is reasonably necessary to create equal treatment as between such persons and other persons resident in the State and liable to taxation and levies on similar incomes earned in the State.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I referred to the strong feelings in County Donegal about the lack of progress in this matter since this time last year.  I stress the human aspect.  Places like Inishowen have not benefited from the economic boom or the Celtic tiger. When jobs are not being created in their areas people must take up employment in Derry which is the natural hinterland to parts of County Donegal.I do not understand why these people should be penalised for securing employment for themselves.Even if they were able to secure similar employment in County Donegal or other Border counties the wages would be much lower.  People are moving out of these areas.  As I said on Committee Stage last week, I know of two families who have moved away.  They were not employed in the area, so the loss is not felt in that respect, but their children went to the local schools and they bought their groceries in the local shops. When a family moves away from an area it can result in the loss of a teacher in the local school, particularly in small rural areas such as the one from which I come.  Two or three children leaving a school could result in the loss of a teacher in subsequent years.  Services generally are declining in certain areas as a result of people moving away.  We do not want that situation further exacerbated by this problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that the movement of people out of rural areas and into towns was a national trend.  That is not the case in areas such as the constituency I represent.  People enjoy living in these areas.  They have many natural amenities which people will be aware of if they visited our area during the by-election.  Unfortunately, work is not available and people will move away to find it.  They are now being penalised for doing that.</P>
      <P>If we addressed this problem through these amendments, we would also address the wider human issue.  Teachers would be kept on in schools in rural areas, shops would remain open and services would continue to be available. People want to work.  This problem must be urgently addressed.  We do not want to see further anomalies.  There is little point in resolving one problem if we are creating another.  Nor do we want to penalise people because of where they live and because they want to work.  That has repercussions for everybody in these areas. An equitable tax system would solve many of the existing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify the position in regard to Article 18.  If a group of people were previously covered by that bilateral agreement, how can they no longer be covered if a change has not been made to it?  I realise there was a change in their status as far as Northern Ireland was concerned, particularly in regard to teachers, health care workers, civil servants, etc., but if they were previously covered by a bilateral agreement, can that be changed without being changed on both sides?  People are waiting for clarification on this matter.  If people were previously covered by <Col N="934" /> Article 18, they should continue to be covered because there has not been any update in that bilateral agreement.  Any decision we reach today or at any other time would have to be ratified by both Governments.</P>
    <P>Issues like this annoy the people in the area I represent.  They want to see progress being made. I acknowledge the levies were changed last year and that a special case was made for cross-Border workers.  That provides us with an opportunity to examine these amendments and address this problem.  If we resolve it we will be helping many other people in terms of the economic benefits that will arise.  If we do not resolve it, however, areas will be depopulated.  I do not want to engage in scaremongering but if a number of families leave an area every week, it will have major implications down the line.  I support the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy McCreevy's amendment.  The Minister has met Deputies from the Border counties on a number of occasions to try to resolve this issue, which is of concern to them.  Irrespective of which side of the Border a person lives or works on, this State benefits.  A person who works on this side of the Border and lives on the northern side pays tax at the southern rate.  The State obviously benefits from that.  If a person lives in the Republic and works in the North, this State benefits also because tax is assessed on the domestic tax rate.  However, no rebate is given to people living in the North but working here.  Tax harmony on both sides of the Border is the answer to this problem but in the meantime the issue should be addressed.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate if this issue has been addressed in a European context?  There are 15 member states in the European Union with a number of frontiers dividing various countries.  Is there harmony on the different frontiers in terms of the way this issue is dealt with?  If not, this matter should be raised at European level with a view to finding a solution that will ensure workers on both sides of a frontier are treated alike.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I ask the Chair to allow me some latitude to raise the issue of borders across the sea and the question of seafarers' tax. The Minister might give his views on this when replying as concerns have been expressed to him already by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in relation to the Irish Ferries' workers.  As the Minister is aware, recommendations were made some time ago by the steering committee set up to examine the question of seafarers' tax.  Those recommendations have been taken on board by the Minister for the Marine.  I understand the Minister for Finance is sympathetic to this issue but he has not implemented the recommendations of the steering committee in this Finance Bill.  The committee made certain recommendations which would be of major benefit to Irish seafarers, particularly the workers in Irish Ferries.  The Minister is aware of the withdrawal <Col N="935" /> of Irish Ferries' ships from the Continent for six months earlier this year.  They are back on the route but there is a possibility that they will be removed again in September.  That will have serious effects on the workers in Rosslare and in other parts of the country.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the recommendations of the steering committee and the suggestions put to him by Irish Ferries and SIPTU in December concerning a number of changes that would copperfasten the jobs of Irish seafarers and not allow them be taken over completely by Third World workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but both parties have approached the same issue from different angles from a legislative drafting point of view.  There is a basic principle here and, to answer Deputy O'Hanlon, the principle is applied in virtually all of the other member states where people are taxed on the basis of their residence.  There is a certain logic in that because where one lives is where one partakes of the services which that revenue funds.  Deputy Browne raised a matter of which I am acutely aware, the very difficult and competitive position with regard to carriers on the Irish Sea.  I am looking at that in the context of other ways in which help can be provided to them because the principle of residence is as germane to seafarers as it is to cross-Border workers. I could be partisan and politically acerbic and say that in all the years during which Fianna Fáil was in office it never addressed this issue and that its conversion in Opposition to finding a solution is wonderful.  However, I will not make that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press it home.  I recognise that Border Deputies &mdash; particularly Deputy Keaveney from the point of view of the campaign, where she lives and her previous work experience &mdash; are uniquely positioned to articulate this concern.  As Deputy McDowell observed earlier, this problem has been exacerbated by two factors, much lower personal rates of income tax in the United Kingdom combined with a lower salary, and that was further aggravated when the Irish pound was trading at £1.04p against sterling. The situation has changed somewhat in the last <Col N="936" /> few days and again today.  Those three pressures are new relative to when Fianna Fáil Ministers were in office.  I accept that the matter has become worse than it was in previous years.</P>
      <P>What the House is asking me to do is to deal with a perceived inequity &mdash; I do not necessarily accept that it is an inequity although the aggrieved parties feel they are being unequally treated &mdash; with the creation of another inequity, that is by providing for different rates of income tax as between people who earn their income outside the State and those who earn their income in the State.  A new inequity would be open to challenge in our courts, and we have a litigious, well-informed and well-represented citizenry who are not slow to go to court and who could argue their case clearly.  Because of our Constitution and the experience of the Murphy judgment, which has been cited on a number of occasions, one would have to conclude that a breach of principle in respect of one category of worker which would establish in law a legislative inequality treatment would have to be extended to every other category that made a similar case.  I am simply not in a position to solve the problem in the manner suggested, although I recognise the difficulties.</P>
      <P>There are other difficulties that compound the problem.  Rural depopulation affects parts of the country that have no cross-Border complications. One cannot change geography &mdash; Inishowen will always be closer to Derry than to Letterkenny. The question is what can we do.  It is to be hoped that if the movement towards the reduction of income tax narrows the margins over time &mdash; and we can debate the speed at which that will happen &mdash; that will address the matter in some way. Second, we have addressed it somewhat in the margins in the context of the levy.  Deputy Kirk asked me about the numbers and categories of people living in the Republic and working in the North.  I am not sure that the figures could be compiled in a manner that would be administratively simple, but I have some information which I will give in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kirk's first question was about eligibility for family income supplement.  The advice I have received since the matter was raised is that a person who has an income level such that he or she qualifies for family income supplement in the Republic should, in principle, qualify for family income supplement, even if the income is earned outside the Republic.  The individual case should be looked at.  The regulations seem complex but, to give evidence of my good faith, if there is ambiguity and the regulations are crafted in such a way that it is not possible to administer the family income supplement to people whose income is derived from employment outside the State I will undertake here and now to change the regulations to deal with that.  That would be one way of addressing the problem because if someone is low-paid, he is low-paid, irrespective of who pays him, and he is an Irish citizen paying Irish tax and <Col N="937" /> should be entitled to the same benefits as others in his situation.</P>
    <P>There are no definite figures available as to the number of Irish residents who work in Northern Ireland.  The PAYE limit was extended in 1991 to cross-Border workers paying PAYE in the United Kingdom and it was estimated that around 1,000 workers would benefit.  Anecdotal evidence would suggest that this figure would have increased since then due specifically to the expansion of employment opportunities, particularly in Derry, but the total number remains small.  The Cross-Border Workers' Association claims that its numbers may be as high as 15,000, and this estimate is based on the observations of members of the Cross-Border Workers' Association standing at Border crossings and counting the number of occupants in the cars crossing the Border from the Republic to the North.  If polling were carried out on that basis we would have a pretty hairy estimate of the electoral support for our various parties.  I do not know what their tax contribution is, but the Deputy will probably get a more prompt reply if he tables a written question.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to address is one made by Deputy O'Hanlon that the State is winning both ways in that people who live in Newry and work in Dundalk get credit for the tax they pay in the UK where they are registered for tax because they live in Newry, but pay more tax here than they would have to pay in the UK.  Therefore, to a certain extent we do win.  As somebody who grew up in a family that comes from both sides of the Border, I have noted that there is an extraordinary silence when the tide comes in on one's own side.  Deputies Kirk and O'Hanlon would be aware of this.  Since the age of three and a half, I travelled on a regular basis to Warrenpoint and was introduced to the vagaries of regulated markets and the opportunities on either side of a tariff barrier from a very early age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not but I saw other people doing it.  I had great pleasure in being the courier of cigars for my late grandfather, the price being much cheaper in the Republic &mdash; they were available in the Republic but not in Warrenpoint in 1950, 1951 and 1952.  The Border Deputies know better than anybody else in the House about that.</P>
      <P>The principle in question is fundamental, and I say this not from a lack of sympathy.  We cannot breach the principle because we do not know where it would end.  In regard to the family income supplement, I am prepared to address it if that is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last question posed by Deputy Keaveney related to article 18 and the bilateral nature of the double taxation agreement.  Obviously the agreement itself can be altered only with the agreement of both sides because it is, in effect, a <Col N="938" /> contract.  However, the interpretation domestically can vary from time to time, and if the status of a particular worker who previously was deemed to be a Government worker and now for reasons of internal policy in the United Kingdom is no longer deemed to be a Government worker but one employed by a parastatal organisation, he forfeits any benefit of that agreement.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy McDowell's query, the reason for the differentiation goes back to an OECD regulation under which, if Governments were paying public employees' salaries they ensured they and nobody else got the tax revenue.It was not a question of a bias between public and private which, if I understood him correctly, was the way the Deputy interpreted the matter.  The then Government was trying to maximise its tax revenue and was not going to pay the salary of one of its nationals merely to have the tax collected by another country.  That is why the conventions exist.  The discussions which are taking place may address the question of the status of teachers and other public employees in Northern Ireland, but it is primarily a matter for the UK authorities to revise or otherwise alter their interpretation of the employment status of those people so they can qualify for the exemption. While I understand the sentiments behind the amendments, for the reason I have outlined I cannot accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Recent unemployment figures and reports reveal that, despite the allocation of Structural Funds and other sources of funding to the Border region, it is one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country.  When we re-examine the disbursement of Structural Funds in 1999, if they are available, if the entire island is not treated as an Objective One area at least Border areas will be included.  Recent employment figures show that there is long-term unemployment in Louth and Donegal.  The greatest amount of lobbying Oireachtas Members on this matter was from cross-Border workers in Donegal and Louth.  Workers in those areas find it necessary to cross the Border to get work.  For that reason, we believe a special case should be made for them.</P>
      <P>Approximately two years ago Fianna Fáil sought advice from tax experts on this matter and they submitted helpful proposals.  Prior to the Minister's reply, I was going to ask if he was still examining the position.  I thought it might have been possible to put in place a moratorium in respect of those who will face substantial tax bills if this provision is passed.  In view of the Minister's comments, perhaps some type of facility could be provided for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals we have put forward are water-tight.We have them checked every time we discuss a Finance Bill in the House.  They will stand the test of time and will include approximately 80 per cent of those affected.  Paragraph (a)(i) deals with the problem of cross-Border workers who are absent from the State for five consecutive <Col N="939" /> days, the normal working week.  Those people would, therefore, not meet the requirement in the existing legislation of being abroad for at least 14 consecutive days.  The proposed amendment would reduce qualifying periods of absence to at least five consecutive days.  Paragraph (a)(ii) would remove from the original legislation the rule that a person must be regarded as being abroad for one day only if he is abroad at midnight on that day.  Few cross-Border workers would be out of the State overnight.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this proposal would replace that rule with one which would regard cross-Border workers as being out of the State for a day when they are out of the State for a period of eight hours in a day.  The average full-time worker working in Northern Ireland would be absent from the State for a period of eight hours in a day.  Paragraph (b) of our amendment deals with the exclusion from the relief of periods of absence from the State where a person is working in the UK.  This exclusion is included in the existing legislation by providing that it does not apply to employment which is subject to the provisions of Part III of the Sixth Schedule of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Such employment relates to the UK. The proposed amendment states that this exclusion does not apply to employment located in Northern Ireland.  The exclusion would continue to apply to an employment located in Great Britain.  The amendment is confined to Northern Ireland employment, since this is the aspect about which complaints have been received.  A wider amendment which would include Great Britain would involve a great deal of cost.</P>
    <P>This amendment would result in Northern Ireland employment income being exempted from Irish tax for an Irish resident working in Northern Ireland.  The arguments put forward by the Minister over many years do not stand up.  I accept he has people advising him on this matter and that in other circumstances he might support the amendment.  I am not want whinging about this matter.  Figures are available to prove that workers in Border areas are being disadvantaged and, therefore, special attention should be given to them.  We will probably have to wait for another day for this to happen.  However, if in the next couple of weeks we move from this side of the House to the Government side &mdash; the Minister can quote me on this &mdash; the amendment will get favourable consideration in next year's Finance Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not think I would ever hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy make the pledge given by Deputy Ahern. I am gratified because for many years I have been <Col N="940" /> trying to persuade Fianna Fáil that the problem is national rather than international in that it refers to people on both sides of the Irish Border. I have made many approaches on this matter to Fianna Fáil Ministers.  I have argued that anyone who travels daily to work in Northern Ireland should be exempt from this provision.  I am pleased Fianna Fáil has pledged that if it is returned to Government it will take up what I have been preaching to it for many years.  The Minister is more amenable to change on this issue than any other person, including members of my party.  This provision came into being in 1976.  I was unaware of it until I was in Opposition.  I argued that it was partition in the strictest sense. What we call partition is symbolised by a Union Jack, red telephone boxes in the North, the Tricolour and green telephone boxes in the South and the fact that the police wear different uniforms on both sides of the Border.  But real partition occurred when the Government in the South said to people living in the Republic that if they went to work in Northern Ireland and brought their wages into the Republic they would be subject to double taxation.  The message was that if people wanted to avoid double taxation they should live in the area in which they work.</P>
    <P>I made a proposal to the Minister and we have covered a good deal of ground on this issue. When we start dictating where people should live through the laws we enact in this Parliament, we are being partitionist.  That is against everything in which the main parties in this House believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly the largest party.  I am also against partition.  I am very much in favour of harmonising the economies of both parts of Ireland.  In this regard cross-Border workers have identified one of the matters which cuts across and contradicts all the policies of the major parties.The issue is much broader than cross-Border workers.  It is how do we approach the solution to the Irish problem.  I argue that if we cannot unite Ireland economically, there is no possibility of uniting it politically.  We have the ability to influence the economies of both parts of Ireland.  That may involve talking to whoever will be elected in Britain tomorrow about how we can contribute to harmonising the economies of the North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The laws are discriminatory and unconstitutional; they are partitionist and wrong.  I wonder why a case has not been brought to the Supreme Court.  I am aware the Minister subscribes to many of the thoughts I expressed.  I appeal to him to reconsider the concept of the North-South relationship.  There is a broader dimension to what we are talking about than cross-Border workers.  That issue is only the tip of the iceberg.  We are talking about harmonising the economics of the North and the South and doing everything in our power to eliminate the <Col N="941" /> economic border that exists.  When that is eliminated everything else will come into play.</P>
    <P>I grew up 100 yards from the Border.  Many of the people who lived in Lifford went to work in Strabane and many of the people from Strabane went to work in Donegal.  In those years their employers deducted their taxes at the rate that applied where they worked and that was the end of the matter.  Then a person had a bright idea that we must stop the abuse caused by somebody working on one side of an international border and living on the other side of it, thereby gaining a some economic benefit.  That may have been a problem for the financiers of different nations, but it not the core issue in the debate on cross-Border taxation before the House.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border taxation is wrong and the theorists in the Department of Finance here and in Britain believe if there is a change in the status of a cross-Border worker we will lose the tax which that worker's income generates when it is imported into the Republic.  However, there is a neutralising position in this regard.  If that person decides to live in Northern Ireland, we will lose the economic benefit of the wages that person imports from across the Border and his or her family spend in the Republic.  It is a case of which is the shortest or longest way around the egg.  It is a catch 22 situation.  We could start to cheesepare in this regard, but there is no easy solution. We are blocking the resolution of this problem because our perception of it is blinkered.  I argue the problem is much broader.  It challenges the concept of where Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats stand on economic unity on the island of Ireland. Unless we can come to terms with that and find a solution to it, we should stop talking about Irish unity because it will never happen.  If we cannot unite Ireland economically, there is no hope of uniting it politically.  It will never happen &mdash; it is a million years away.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to see the issue as involving more than a few dozen people from my immediate area going to work in Northern Ireland and having to pay double taxation.  This issue which cross-Border workers rightly challenge, is also challenging the principle of the basis of political belief enunciated by the Fianna Fáil Party since its foundation, Irish unity.  It also challenges the thinking of the Fine Gael Party that believes in a united Ireland, the Labour Party that wants the unity of the Irish people by consent, the Progressive Democrats and everyone else.  Anyone who disputes that does not understand what I am talking about.</P>
    <P>To address the difficulty of cross-Border workers, as I said to many Ministers of different parties privately in the corridors of this House, in their offices or during debate in this Chamber, this provision should be confined to people who must travel on a daily basis to work in Northern Ireland.  If we broaden the issue, we will be in a bigger arena.  I want to achieve that by having every party on the island of Ireland, North and <Col N="942" /> South, and every party in Great Britain to sit down in open forum in a neutral venue to discuss economic co-operation between Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>Two hundred years ago Henry Grattan identified four basic positions, to unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter, one of which was political separation from London.  We did not want to be governed by Westminster.  That applied to southern Catholics as much as it did to northern Protestants.In latter years, they called for the reconstitution of Stormont, another way of saying that they do not want to be governed by Westminster. The other positions were economic union, free trade and stability of currency.  They are as valid a basis for an economic and political settlement between Westminster and Dáil Éireann as they were 200 years ago.  If we examine this closer, those four basic positions are the reasons the Irish and British people agreed to join the European Community.  If we are to settle the Northern issue, we should consider the economic dimension rather than the political barriers that separate us, a matter about which we could argue until the cows come home.</P>
    <P>Whatever Government will be in office after the general election, it should sit down with the British Government.  It is time for the new British Government to sit down with the Irish Government and include every party in both parliaments, from the Unionists and Nationalists in the North to all the parties in Dáil Éireann, as well as the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists and all the parties in Britain.  The peoples of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic are in this together.  Governments on their own have never found a solution to the Irish problem.  May be it is time for parliaments to find a solution.</P>
    <P>While I have broadened the debate, I pay tribute to the courage and stamina of cross-Border workers in following through on what they feel is a wrong they want to have corrected.  I see it more as a challenge to the fundamental beliefs of all political parties in this House.  Where do we stand on economic co-operation between North and South?  This is the beginning, it is the tip of the iceberg.  The Minister might have another look at it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy representing the Border areas also, I reiterate the concerns of cross-Border workers.  Part of the economic problem in the Border areas has been caused by the necessity for my constituents and others in those areas to travel to Northern Ireland to seek employment.  That is a reflection of what has happened over the last number of years due to the lack of investment in Border areas.  Towns such as Beleek, Enniskillen, Derry and Strabane have provided employment for people who live close by in remote areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter goes beyond the decision by the British Government to recategorise workers who heretofore were exempt from cross-Border taxation. <Col N="943" /> It relates in particular to health workers and teachers, for whom trusts were set up.</P>
    <P>I heard what Deputy McDowell said and I suppose there would be no problem if all our taxes were the same.  Since the take home pay of many who live in the Republic and work in factories in Northern Ireland is less than people who work in the Republic, they feel aggrieved about the imposition of an Irish tax on their pay.  We can respect the view that if they live in Donegal or other parts of the Republic &mdash; years ago they used to refer to the Free State &mdash; they benefit from taxation via education, the roads, etc. However, when one is asked in November to pay £4,000 or £5,000 in tax it is very difficult to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the solutions would be to look at a system such as PAYE.  People are aggrieved that they must pay tax here, in particular because of the economic necessity to go to Northern Ireland to find a job.  I represent remote areas such as Pettigoe and Lettercran, where people go to Lough Derg.  All that is there is bog and mountain.But for the access to Lisnaskea, the Beleek pottery and Enniskillen, they would have no employment.  If we are committed to ensuring that people remain in these remote areas, an interim solution must be found until the taxation system between the Republic and Northern Ireland is the same.</P>
    <P>I realise the Minister is doing his best to address the matter and, in fairness, he has met us on a number of occasions and set up committees to deal with the matter.  However, the loss to the Exchequer is negligible.  The Minister should look again at the amendments which would give much relief to people many of whom are badly paid, particularly factory workers.  They resent the fact that they must also pay tax on this side of the Border as they do not see any visible return for it.  The return is there but they do not see it.  The Minister should reconsider this and accept the amendments to deal with this as an interim measure until such time as we have taxation parity and then there would be no problem.</P>

      <P>This year we are talking about something really serious.  Listening to the debate it struck me that the Minister's position is fundamentally wrong.  I say this not because I am contemptuous of his position but because there is an error at the heart of it.  We are dealing with a distortion caused by two separate taxation systems.The distortion is also caused by the fact that some people who reside in one area where residence is the tax criterion, must work in another <Col N="944" /> market in which tax and employment remuneration are intimately connected.  They are being taxed at a higher level in the Republic on incomes which are lower in Northern Ireland precisely, but not entirely, because of the differing tax regimes.</P>
      <P>I listened to what Deputy Harte said about economic unity but I take what he said with a grain of salt.  Although it was sincerely meant, he and his colleagues voted down an amendment in my name earlier which would have achieved the tax unity he was talking about.  As a parliamentarian, one does not have to go to Mr. Grattan for a solution on tax equality North and South. Henry Grattan did not have to deal with a border. I gave the solution this morning yet Deputy Harte voted against it.  That is the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they talk about nobody else but Henry Grattan in the Deputy's constituency.  In my constituency, however, we are concerned with what is happening now. Cross-Border workers want something done.  I am confident the next Government will introduce income tax rates which, roughly speaking, will be the same as those in Northern Ireland so there will be no distortion.  It will take five years to do so, however, and it cannot be done in a big bang overnight.  I wish it could be but it cannot.</P>
      <P>We must deal with realities.  The reality is that for a number of years there will be a category of workers that is taxed heavily on low incomes which are earned in Northern Ireland because they reside in the Republic.  It is not beyond the wit of the Revenue Commissioners to devise a scheme to give some relief.  The Minister said people could end up in the Supreme Court arguing about this and that, but a measure which was designed to achieve equity between people doing similar jobs on different sides of the Border, and which gave relief to those earning in Northern Ireland and residing in the Republic, would not fall foul of the Supreme Court or any equality provisions in the Constitution, if it were carefully drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a matter reflected genuine inequality, inequity and injustice in society it would be regarded by the Supreme Court or any other court as an area in which the Legislature was competent to take some remedial action.  It is within the capacity of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to provide relief.  The Minister could accept Deputy McCreevy's amendment and set out in the Finance Bill the mechanism for such relief or he could do what I have suggested and give the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the <Col N="945" /> Minister for Finance, the capacity to make regulations to relieve the heavy burden of tax on people in these circumstances.  No court would invalidate such a measure for which there is no bureaucratic appetite.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border workers must vote for parties which will equate the tax systems in the North and South. Any cross-Border worker who votes for the rainbow coalition has only himself or herself to blame.  They should vote for parties willing to make a concession on a regulatory or statutory basis to reflect the injustice being done to them.  The Minister has had this issue on his plate for a number of years so he could have made some concession or indicated this morning that he would equate Irish and UK tax rates. However, he is not offering us any hope in the short or long-term.</P>
    <P>If the Minister comes across an injustice, anomaly or a distortion, he should not take a principled stance on it.  The remedy for anomalies and distortions is by necessity an <i>ad hoc</i> sticking plaster one.  This country has every reason &mdash; not only in relation to the plight of cross-Border workers &mdash; to achieve tax rates in the Republic which are as attractive as those in Northern Ireland.  The people paying the Republic's tax rates on Northern Ireland earnings are entitled to some relief.  If <Col N="946" /> they were more vocal and the willpower was there, their plight would be relieved.</P>
    <P>I saw figures the other day on the size of the various political constituencies in Ireland &mdash; the farming lobby, the pensioners lobby, etc.  The country is segmented by occupational and genuine interest groups.  When farmers galloped in Killarney, the world took fright.  However, I do not expect pensioners to gallop at the same speed.  It seems the louder the bark, the more the political system responds.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border workers have a case which should be met; they should not be confronted by a bland statement of principle.  One does not resort to principle when dealing with an anomaly and a distortion, but to a pragmatic <i>ad hoc</i> sticking plaster remedy until there is time to deal with the basic cause of the injustice.</P>

    <P>(9)  Section 198 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1980) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended, in subsection (1)(a), by the insertion of the following additional subparagraph:</P>

    <P>During the past two years the Government has introduced the free fees scheme for undergraduate university education and tax relief for private college courses and part-time third level courses.  However, the Government is also conscious of the need to promote greater participation in courses to upgrade skills generally, particularly those of a technical nature.  Arising out of this the Ministers for Education and Enterprise and Employment recently launched a Government action plan on skills.</P>
    <P>Skilled young people are a key determinant of our competitive advantage.  The Government is determined to ensure that there will be a significant supply of suitably qualified young people to fill vacancies in the future.  As an incentive in this area, amendment No. 6 proposes tax relief for fees paid by individuals for training courses in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.The training courses, which can be up to two years' duration, will be approved by FÁS. Tax relief, which will be based on the standard rate, will be given on fees up to £1,000 subject to a <i>de minimus</i> of £250.  To qualify for such relief, an individual will have to obtain a certificate of competence on completion of the course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and have no difficulty with it.  Will the courses be run by An Foras, which means FÁS, and what procedures will people have to undergo to have a course approved?  The Minister is aware that there has been much debate in the past about a variety of activities in which FÁS engages.  When I served in Government I had my own ideas with regard to what changes could be made in FÁS, <Col N="952" /> particularly in the areas of manpower, training, etc.  I believe that some of those changes, which a number of my predecessors in a Cabinet might have advocated, could have found favour in the Department of Finance.  I recently read an article which stated that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment had notified FÁS of a number of changes.  The issue of FÁS will be debated on another occasion but it would be foolish not to acknowledge that, over a long period, there have been differences of opinion about certain activities in which that body is engaged.</P>
      <P>Politicians may have expressed views about this issue but any who assumed office in a Department with responsibility for FÁS quickly changed such views and became supportive of the <i>status quo.</i></P>

      <P>When these people left the Department in question they appeared to revert to their original opinion that changes should be made.  I do not wish to enter a debate on whether changes should be made in FÁS.  However, if FÁS is to make the sole decision on approving courses, it would be preferable that the Minister for Finance should have a role to play.  In my experience &mdash; I do not state this in an accusatory fashion &mdash; FÁS likes to control many of these matters.  I suggest that it should not be the sole organisation responsible for determining approved courses and, perhaps, the Minister for Finance or some other body could play a role in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised a related matter, which will be addressed in a different context.  I am a supporter of FÁS as I was of AnCo, the Manpower Service and the YEA.  FÁS will have the capability to provide the certification process. Certain codes of practice will be set out by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in consultation with the Minister for Education where necessary, for example, in respect of language training.  Courses will be certified by FÁS because it is the training authority.  We are discussing existing workers financing improvement in their skills in order to enhance their job opportunities or prospects to obtain promotion and advancement within employment.  There is no other appropriate body to provide such certification.</P>
      <P>Given the lateness with which the amendment was circulated, I appreciate the Deputy's co-operation and graciousness in that regard, the impression could have been obtained, from a first reading of the text, that the courses would be exclusively run by FÁS.  That is not the case.  FÁS will be the certification body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also supportive of the training aspect of FÁS.  This morning's ESRI report laid heavy emphasis on education and training as one of the reasons for the great <Col N="953" /> improvement in the economy.  Cursory articles and comments on the report did not highlight the fact that education is one of the major determinants of the major growth rate in the economy. Training also played a very important part in this regard.</P>
      <P>My criticism of FÁS is that it is too large a conglomerate and there are too many aspects to it.  I agree that FÁS is the training authority but the national manpower aspect of that body should have been delegated to another Department many years ago.  There should be a greater relationship between the Department of Social Welfare and the section of FÁS which deals with placement.  They should work in tandem, training being the responsibility of FÁS, as the training authority, with a greater interlink between State agencies, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners.  As the Minister will be aware, there had been that interlink between them even in small rural towns.  I do not want to be critical of FÁS or its training but its structuring could have been organised somewhat differently.</P>
      <P>When there will be a lesser amount of European Union funding coming our way, on which FÁS is very dependent, I should like to see a lean, fit and able organisation in place able to handle the new goals and targets set when the inevitable occurs.  I do not want to give the impression of being anti-FÁS &mdash; I am not &mdash; and anybody who will have read the ESRI summary and executive report this morning will acknowledge that training and education have been a major component of our economic breakthrough.</P>
      <P>That being said, I support the relief provided by this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy McCreevy.  Amendments Nos. 10a, 10b, 10c, 10d, 10e, 47 and amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 47 form an alternative composite proposal.  With the agreement of the House I suggest they be discussed together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 40, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;21.&mdash;For the purposes of Chapter IV (Urban Renewal Reliefs) of Part I of the Finance Act, 1994 the Minister shall in accordance with section 39 of that Act, by order, direct that Gallanstown, Dublin 10 be a designated area.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The Minister's composite amendments render mine extant, his relating not alone to the Gallanstown area but extending the concept of designation to a wide range of activities.  While the principle of designation is not new to this House, the political connotations that appear to follow these schemes have a familiar ring to them.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the seaside resort renewal scheme comprised of some 17 areas.  I read in the press the past two Sundays of the intention to designate Connacht/Knock International Airport, yet we read in this morning's papers that seven regional airports are to be so designated in addition to eligible adjacent areas.</P>
    <P>As an economic principle I have no difficulty in giving taxation relief to encourage an entrepreneur or individual to incur some expenditure he or she would not necessarily incur if that taxation relief did not exist but I doubt that much thought was given to this morning's announcement.  This Government will never be accused of lacking in public relations resources.  Since it came into office, almost daily we hear the heads of Bills announced as legislation.  As anyone who has ever served in Government will know, it was never the custom to announce heads of Bills as promised legislation.  Yet when this Government passes the heads of a Bill, it announces the fact by way of a press release.  We have witnessed press releases on everything from chicken coops to football pitches, to seaside resort towns' renewal etc.</P>

      <P>I find it amazing that this announcement was not made after the Cabinet meeting of yesterday, giving the impression that it came into the public arena this morning.  After that Cabinet meeting, a number of Deputies must have been informed because they announced the airports in respect of their constituencies.  It becomes obvious from a reading of today's paper that, when the idea about Knock International Airport was mooted other Ministers, Ministers of Sate and Deputies were of the strong opinion that their respective areas should also be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whereas the designation of the Gallanstown area would have been appropriately done by way of an amendment on Report Stage, it was not signalled on Committee Stage that we would have such a major piece of amending legislation.  Right up to last weekend I know the Minister for Finance had no intention of designating all of these regional airports and probably put up considerable <Col N="955" /> resistance to the proposal &mdash; politics appear to have intervened.</P>
    <P>While the politics of running a three-party Government must be difficult at the best of times, in order to comply with the provisions of these amendments, all regional airports must satisfy the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Coveney, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade, Deputy O'Sullivan &mdash; the Tánaiste could not be excluded in regard to Farranfore Airport &mdash; and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, pushing the designation of Knock International Airport because of the difficult political position in that constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think these types of decisions should be taken in this manner.  It is impossible to oppose the inclusion of any of these areas because all could advance a justifiable case for their inclusion.  The same case could be made in regard to seaside resort towns' renewals, some of which clearly should have been omitted from that scheme.  I surmise that, had the Minister for Finance had his way, he would not have included them either but political exigencies came into play.</P>

      <P>Will any Member of any party in this House say that a given number of acres adjoining any of these areas should not be included or so designated?My party was the originator of the concept of tax designation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party was to the forefront in pushing the idea; the urban renewal scheme was introduced which has proved to be very successful, led to much development, resuscitated the inner city, the redevelopment of the Temple <Col N="956" /> Bar area, the International Financial Services Centre and so on.  I have no difficulty with the principle but the Minister's officials will tell him, if he does not know already, that if the whole country is to be designated for one purpose or another, it will not benefit anybody.  When my party was in Government considerable pressure was brought to bear on many occasions in relation to the urban renewal scheme.  Following the designation of certain towns, the question of other towns being designated was raised.  It takes political courage to say we will see how it works out in town A or B before moving any further. Given the various aspects of designating urban areas, airports and enterprises, soon it will be like the GSN telephone service in that the only special areas will be those not designated.  That is against the whole idea of designation.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage the Minister said studies had been carried out on designating areas for special tax status which have shown there has been a movement of resources from one place to another.  If we do not have an overall cohesive plan for such designation there will be pockets of the country where there will be no investment. Why would an entrepreneur build a factory or a warehouse in one area when he can do so in another county and get special tax treatment, thus displacing investment?</P>
      <P>An excellent case could be made for designating the area at Knock Airport.  I know the area well and declare a professional interest as my company has a practice not far from there.  Long before I became a Member, I proposed that the west should be a designation area for special tax status for 25 years.  Had that been done it would have been interesting to see how it would have worked.  There is a need for certain parts of the country to be designated for tax purposes.  So far as the area around Knock Airport is concerned, there is not much industry or business but the airport has done very well.  I was one of those who had grave doubts about Knock International Airport, which I expressed both inside and outside the House, and went against the wishes of my party at the time but I have been proved wrong. It has worked well and has brought much business to the area.</P>
      <P>In regard to all the other areas, if we are going to displace investment by designating every area, the Minister for Finance does not need me to tell him there will be great anomalies.  We now have tax designation for enterprises, airports, towns and seaside resorts.  This means adjacent towns are starved of investment.  I can think of one town in the west which was designated under the seaside resort renewal scheme.  It was a boom town. All the designation succeeded in doing was to drive the price of accommodation in that town skywards.  Many people made a profit.  Nearby towns are starved of investment.  County Mayo is one of the few counties outside of County Kildare that I know very well.  I spent four months of the four years from 1970-4 ensconced in a town in the west.  It is deserving of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> Had this proposal been thought out or given detailed consideration, the Minister for Finance would have announced it some considerable time ago.  The idea of Knock Airport was being pushed by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny and I have no problem with that. When it became clear that airport would receive special attention, all the other politicians and Ministers had to be in on the act.  The Minister must have allowed them to do so, otherwise he would be in political trouble.  If he said he would designate only two places, the other five would ask why their areas were not designated.  To highlight the politicisation of this idea in advance of a general election, the leader of Democratic Left could not be left out.  As Dublin International Airport is in his area, the Finglas enterprise area has to be designated.  I do not know whether the whole of his constituency is now designated.</P>
    <P>Post the general election, other Deputies in all parties will want commitments from their spokespersons that their town or area will be designated for tax purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had that already, it has been rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what will happen in the next partnership negotiations in the event of a coalition Government.  If Deputy De Rossa, leading six Members into a Government, got special tax status for his constituency, Deputy Sargent with his three Deputies would feel obliged to get the same for some part of his constituency.This is not the way to do business.  I know the Minister for Finance quite well and despite his political protestations he knows I am right about these matters.  He is in a position in advance of a general election where there is nothing he can do.  It is not always politically popular to speak like this but it is necessary to so do.</P>
      <P>I cannot recall any report in the past number of years which recommended that areas around all regional airports should be designated for special tax, nor can I remember any media coverage of any such report.  The next issue would then be for areas around the smaller airports to be so designated.</P>
      <P>I recall being in Government when the whole debate on airports took place.  It was stated that if grant aid was provided for some of the regional airports it would take business away from Dublin airport.  This was a live issue at the time.  There were representations and reports asking if the State, through the taxpayer, was expected to fund all these airports.  Now we have gone a considerable step further and designate areas around all the regional airports.  I do not believe these proposals have been well thought out.  They are politically motivated and that is not the correct way to do business.  I say this in the full knowledge that every Deputy will support each of those places, including a few others which should be so designated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> It is impossible, as I have said many times in the past few months, to stand up to pressure groups in the run up to an election.  We are making mistakes hand over fist in a wide variety of areas of public policy.  At least all that will happen will be that tax will be foregone.  This is not a streamlined, coherent or impressive approach and I, for one, am not impressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I respect Deputy McCreevy's analysis of how this might have come about, I refute what he said on a number of issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not receive representations from Deputy De Rossa at any stage on this matter and there was no trade off in Cabinet terms on different areas.  I received representations from promoters of Gallanstown and from people in Finglas who brought to my attention the fact that these sites were adjacent to areas of high unemployment and that no development was being carried out in the area.  Deputy Ahern will testify to that.  Notwithstanding the economic activity in the greater Dublin area, they simply would have been passed by.  We know from the area based partnership approach to unemployment that unless factories are nearby there are difficulties for a variety of complex reasons.  That is why I responded to those areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to the airports, Deputy Kenny made a good case for Knock.  In light of previous experience with seaside resorts, I took the decision to fund regional airports.  The State has invested taxpayers' money as well as European funds. Exchequer capital grants to Donegal, Sligo, Knock, Galway, Kerry and Waterford airports totalled £15.58 million in addition to £10 million in European Regional Development Fund grants and Exchequer marketing grants of £2.6 million. A further £1.6 million was budgeted for 1997 to 1999 and an additional £2 million is available which the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications proposes to allocate in respect of residual infrastructural works.</P>
      <P>Following the Gulf War and other downturns in international trade with which the Deputy will be familiar the airports were not trading comfortably and, in some cases decidedly uncomfortably.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enterprise zone measure. It is not urban designation in the form with which people are familiar.  That has distorted private sector residential investment in a number of towns.  There are three benefits &mdash; double rent relief, ten years phased rates relief and a 100 per cent capital allowance, 50 per cent of which is available in the first year.  It was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995, by Deputy Bertie Ahern at my request when I was Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Enterprise zones were locations <Col N="959" /> into which IDA type companies wanted to go but which did not have facilities.  We introduced them in two locations in Dublin, three locations in Cork and one in Galway.  The East Point Industrial Office Park, East Wall Road, Dublin, is the only area to have taken off.  I suspect Deputy Ahern is more familiar with this than Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy may not necessarily be familiar with East Point.  I urge him if he has time &mdash; he will have plenty over the next four years &mdash; to pay a leisurely visit to it because it is there exclusively as a result of the enterprise zone tax facilities.  The measure is being extended to the airports because it makes sense to reinforce such investment by way of a tax incentive.</P>
      <P>The IDA found that there was a dearth of available industrial space for inward investors. The last available big area was taken up by Seagate in Clonmel.  Factories are not available for investors.  Forfás, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment have to sign these companies off as 10 per cent companies.  This will generate capital investment from the private sector which otherwise would not go there as can be seen at East Point.  It will provide facilities in parts of the country which would otherwise not get them and the overall payback to the economy will be highly positive. That is why it has been done.</P>
      <P>I refute Deputy McCreevy's suggestion that this is similar to throwing snuff around at a wake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>The Minister is more accessible <Col N="960" /> to her than me, but we embarrassed the three colours of the rainbow into it.  I am glad the Minister admitted he gave promoters a considerable amount of time and I thank him.  He also said that he did not receive representations from his Cabinet colleague so that narrows the field to two.</P>
      <P>This is politics based on the latest opinion poll but I welcome the proposals because the present system is not fair.  While parts of Dublin may be doing well, one sees major infrastructural projects, such as the convention centre, going to Dublin 4 rather than Gallanstown or Finglas.  The new measures are valuable in providing a boost to certain areas, irrespective of whether they happen at election time.  Amendment No. 47 concerns Finglas.  It seems to have been a last minute decision.  However, Finglas has received nothing over the past few years as there is not available land.  I spoke to people employed by estate agencies whose job it is to show the representatives of multinational companies around and they will not bring them near some sites because the general surroundings are such that they would go straight back to the airport.  The current system is not perfect and does not provide a balance.  Such measures, whether they are unfair or lead to anomalies, are necessary.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister more information on Finglas? What has been approved?  Is it subject to the same terms as East Point or will it involve warehousing or manufacturing?  Has he received a submission on this?  Will there be a single factory or a number of units?  Is this the initial stage of the process?  Does the Minister have a document with all the answers?  Even allowing for the inherent dangers, I welcome this provision as it will help to spread the benefits of the economic boom to all areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this provision under which regional airports will be granted special tax status to facilitate the development of new enterprise zones.  I appreciate fully the importance of Knock Airport in this development.  It is important to emphasise, however, that all other regional airports, including Sligo Airport in the heart of my constituency, will benefit.  The new tax status will be as important to Sligo Airport, in terms of its prosperity and future development, as to Knock Airport.  Sligo town has the necessary infrastructural facilities, including a successful third level college.  It is my guess that each of the regional airports will be developed along separate lines.  It is my hope they will not be excessively competitive and seek to enter the same niche market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned that up to 2,000 jobs <Col N="961" /> may be created over a number of years at Knock Airport which has had a head start but others have been quick to enter the jetstream.  Sligo Airport Authority, a progressive body, will be quick to benefit from this status which it has been seeking for some time.  To this end, it recently met the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes.  It is very fortunate that there is 100 acres of land in public ownership situated nearby which I am sure it will acquire for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There is another important dimension.  This provision fits in perfectly with the policy of the IDA on the attraction of industry to the regions, particularly the west and north west.  There is a need to create jobs throughout the country, not just in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, with the co-operation of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I made what I thought was my last speech in Dáil Eireann in which I called on the relevant Minister to preserve the post office in my native parish.  Thankfully, it has been readvertised.  I am grateful for the opportunity to make another speech and to thank the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Dukes, and the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, for providing these valuable incentives with which I am delighted.  As a result, Sligo Airport should prove to be one of the great success stories.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment.  This is tremendous news for the regional airports, particularly Donegal Airport situated in Carrickfin 200 miles from Dublin.  I can see the terminal building from my home in Gweedore across the inlet.  It is a significant announcement for the west.  In spite of all its difficulties, Donegal Airport has been operating successfully.  The scheduled Dublin flight, which it secured only last August, has proved to be a tremendous success. The number of passengers passing through the airport has increased by 130 per cent in the past two to three years.</P>
      <P>This provision, however, adds a new dimension.It will result in the attraction of many investors to that part of Donegal where there is a lack of adequate infrastructure and which is not served by a railway line.  It will trigger massive investment and job creation.  The benefits of the economic boom &mdash; the economic Renaissance as it was described this morning &mdash; will be felt in every part of the country.</P>
      <P>I am glad high-tech industries will be established which will provide employment for our young graduates with certificates, diplomas and degrees from Letterkenny and Sligo Regional Technical Colleges.  Instead of having to travel to the Ruhr Valley in Germany or Silicon Valley in California they will be able to remain at home and take up employment in high-tech industries in Donegal, Sligo, Galway, Mayo and Kerry.  I thank the Minister and all involved in the designation of Donegal Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> I understand Ross Perot has expressed an interest in Knock Airport which has had a head start due to the efforts of the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny.  I am sure, however, that other international investors will be attracted to County Donegal to avail of the incentives provided to create jobs.  Candidates in the forthcoming general election have accused the Government of ignoring the west.  This is yet another indication &mdash; following the establishment of the Western Development Commission &mdash; of the importance it attaches to its development. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, outlined the amounts provided for the islands off our west coast.</P>

In 1992, my party colleague, Deputy Michael Ahern, had talks with the Perot family to encourage them to take part in such a venture.  I am mindful, however, of what Deputy McCreevy said which should be borne in mind.  It was not all good news for each of the traditional seaside resorts designated.  However, it has not been of benefit in every area.  It is important to target certain airports so that we do not overdo it.

      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on introducing this measure.  I was not surprised at the points made by Deputies McCreevy and Moffatt as last Tuesday on local radio a Fianna Fáil Deputy criticised the Government and said his party intended, on return to Government, to introduce tax initiatives for regional airports.  Similar comments were made by members of that party some weeks ago in regard to the deflector system.  I am beginning to wonder if that party has inside information on proposed legislation as it makes announcements on its proposals a few days before legislation is introduced in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the introduction of the seaside resort scheme, Westport was the only town in county <Col N="963" /> Mayo which had no designation of any kind. While the scheme has driven up the price of property, Westport is one of the few towns where it has worked.  Prior to the introduction of the scheme Westport did not have a proper hotel.  By the end of this year's summer season it will have three top class hotels and a leisure centre.  I ask Deputies McCreevy and Moffatt to stop making negative comments about Westport.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government it did not look after Westport.</P>
    <P>I welcome the seaside resort scheme and this new measure as they are not aimed at private interests.  On previous occasions when announcements were made about the designation of certain parts of County Mayo some people made millions of pounds by buying property in advance of the introduction of the scheme.  This will not happen under the seaside resort scheme or this scheme which are aimed at ordinary citizens and at increasing investment in the county.</P>

I welcome the decision by Ross Perot to open an office in Castlebar as it will bring welcome money to the west.  For many years all there was in County Mayo and the part of Sligo I represent was emigration.  There should not be a problem in securing 100 acres at Sligo Airport as the county council owns land in the area.  This new measure will be of great benefit to Sligo Airport and Strandhill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.

The Minister, Deputy Quinn, discussed with me the introduction of the social employment scheme as it was then called.  This was one of the best schemes ever introduced as it gave people the dignity to take up work.  I hope this measure will give people the dignity to take up work at Knock and Sligo Airports and will create jobs in the west.  County Mayo and my part of County Sligo suffered a high level of emigration for many years.  Thanks is due to the late Monsignor Horan and the then Fianna Fáil Government for building Knock Airport which hopefully will benefit from this measure in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputies McGinley and Nealon and the news on RTÉ 1, it <Col N="966" /> is obvious that the election will be called earlier than we thought; I would not be surprised if it were called tomorrow.  The Deputies opposite are using debates in the House to practice what they will say outside Church gates during the election campaign.  However, this does not affect Members on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement in principle but I wish to remind him that he introduced a similar measure for 13 seaside resorts three years ago.  The purpose of that was to upgrade the infrastructure of certain types of accommodation in tourist towns.  Those incentives were generous but they were only taken up in some instances.  Deputy Ring referred to Westport where the incentives were very attractive. People responded to those initiatives but in less than 12 months, the Minister took away a substantial portion of that tax relief.  He gave tax relief for a six month period which that city previously enjoyed for many years.</P>
      <P>The tax relief originally provided for the Custom House docks development has been left untouched.  The Minister recently introduced the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill in the House, and his Department published a leaflet in respect of the docklands development which referred to the massive growth in Dublin, where one-third of the population lives and where there are many advantages for people in business to avail of the economic activities taking place in Dublin.  In the debate on the Docklands Development Authority Bill, the Minister said tax incentives would have to be sufficiently attractive to encourage people to invest.  If the Minister lived in Connacht or Munster, he would view the growth of Dublin in a totally different way.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make the tax incentives very attractive in Connacht so as to generate the type of investment he wants as a result of this or any other fiscal provision.  If those incentives result in increased development, the Minister should not remove them after six months or change some of the provisions simply because the Revenue Commissioners do not want people to avail of them to reduce their income tax liability.</P>
      <P>There are problems with the seaside renewal scheme.  The Minister should give people in small towns one year to avail of the relief and if they do not, that is their hard luck.  If 15 per cent of a development is completed within the year, there should be a carry over relief.  If the relief is made available to small towns for a long period, it causes house prices to increase.  A young married couple in Westport cannot afford to buy a house, yet barristers, solicitors, consultant doctors and others can purchase a second holiday home there because they have the wherewithal to pay an additional £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief in respect of Knock Airport and hope it will be available for many years to come.  I also welcome the fact that tax relief has been made available to other regional <Col N="967" /> airports.  Perhaps there is a Ross Perot III lying in wait in Donegal Airport and a Ross Perot IV lying in wait in Tralee Airport.  Ross Perot's approach to Minister Kenny was the spur for the provision of the tax relief incentive.</P>
    <P>There is a promise of 2,000 jobs and perhaps thousands more over the next few years, but what is the position on the ground?  The Minister has presided over a rising economic tide from which we are now benefiting, as a result of conditions laid down over the past decade.  The jobs secured at the time of the changeover of Government, which were signalled by Kieran McGowan, were the results of the efforts of his people abroad in trying to attract industry.  That does not happen overnight.  Many hours of negotiation must take place to convince foreign companies to invest in Ireland.  In 1996, the Minister created 53 new jobs in the west, and 17,000 new jobs in Dublin.  Many of the jobs created in Dublin &mdash; the Minister will recognise this when he does a house to house canvass, if that is what he does in his constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>A large number of the Minister's constituents are from my county.  They had no choice but to go to Dublin where jobs were being created.  How is it possible to create 2,000 new jobs at Knock Airport over the next three years when Deputies Nealon and McGinley referred to high tech jobs?  We will not turn out that number of young people in Mayo or the surrounding counties of Roscommon and Sligo, which can also benefit from this relief, in the next two years &mdash; perhaps 100 or 200 people will be available. People may come back from Dublin but if they do, the question of housing, water supplies, etc. will be raised.</P>
      <P>I accept the Government has been generous in giving this support, but I do not believe Ross Perot will create 2,000 jobs.  If they are created, they should not be labelled high tech.  I understand this will be a freight forwarding centre.  That means there will probably be only a handful of high tech jobs and a substantial number of blue collar jobs.  Those jobs will be welcome but they will not be a panacea for the rest of the country. They will be another arrow in the Minister's bow. The fruits of economic prosperity must be spread not only to Knock Airport and the surrounding areas, the Black Triangle, but to other parts of Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and all parts of Connacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of my constituency will not be carried away by this.  There will not be a massive swing to Government Deputies when they do house to house canvassing.  I welcome the creation of jobs outside Dublin because the growth in Dublin is now causing severe problems, as is the population decline in rural Ireland.  I am <Col N="968" /> pleased the two main political parties recognise the need to stabilise the population from which many benefits will flow.</P>
    <P>I hope Ross Perot delivers the number of jobs anticipated, but I have some doubts in that regard.  I accept my party promised that jobs would be created in a biscuit factory many years ago, just before a general election campaign. Those jobs were never realised, although the candidate was elected.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their comments.</P>
      <P>In the course of his comments about seaside resorts, Deputy McCreevy said that the Government was under relentless pressure and had caved in to it.  Originally, seven seaside resorts were included under the scheme.  Subsequently that number was increased to 15.  Since then we have received representations from an additional 69, and every one has been refused.  We also received representations for extensions to the existing areas and for the inclusion of certain towns in the urban renewal scheme, which is similar to the seaside resorts scheme.  For the reasons Deputy McCreevy articulated we have refused.  Therefore, while his analysis is correct, his criticism is ill-founded, because we have done what I believe he would have done.</P>
      <P>In regard to Athlone, I am not accepting the amendment.  However, the project in question is not at risk.  Planning permission can be applied for, and it is up to the local authority to make the case for the inclusion of that area in future.</P>

      <P>(ii)  is let to an approved institution on <i>bona fide</i> commercial terms for such consideration as might be expected to be paid in a letting of the building or structure which was negotiated on an arm's length basis,</P>
      <P>but does not include any part of a building or structure in use as, or as part of, a dwelling-house;</P>

    <P>(4)  No allowance shall be made under subsection (2) unless, prior to the commencement of construction of a qualifying premises, the Minister for Finance certifies that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an approved institution has procured or otherwise secured a sum of money, none of which has been met directly or indirectly by the State, which sum is not less than one-half of the qualifying expenditure to be incurred on the qualifying premises, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such sum is to be used solely by the approved institution for the following purposes:</P>
    <P>(i)  paying interest on money borrowed for the purpose of funding the construction of the qualifying premises, and</P>

    <P>(iii) purchasing the qualifying premises following the termination of the letting referred to in subparagraph (ii).</P>
    <P>(5)  Notwithstanding section 265 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, no balancing charge shall be made in relation to a qualifying premises by reason of any of the events specified in the said section 265 (1) which occurs more than 7 years after the qualifying premises were first used.</P>
    <P>(6)  This section shall come into operation on the 1st day of July, 1997.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Investment in Dublin: Motion.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Seamus Brennan on 29 April 1997:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its general neglect of the Dublin area and calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P>&mdash;invest further in transport and road infrastructure, bring forward an effective management plan, and urgently complete the Ring Road, link routes and by-passes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide for the proper physical and environmental planning of the area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;order a special study of the underground option for LUAS in the city centre and proceed with the lines to Sandyford, Tallaght and Ballymun without further delay;</P>
    <P>&mdash; introduce measures to tackle Dublin's high unemployment rate and the public housing shortage;</P>
    <P>&mdash;invest further in the health and education services in the city and county;</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide extra Gardaí resources to combat Dublin's drug abuse and crime generally;</P>
    <P>&mdash;instruct the IDA and other State agencies to attract more industrial, tourist and service projects for Dublin and</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduce measures to effectively tackle Dublin's traffic gridlock and to deal with the taxi, late night and other public transport issues.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the achievements of the Government in promoting the social and economic development of the Dublin region and, in particular,</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes that the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999, provides for investment in excess of £600 million in transport infrastructure in Dublin;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes that water and sewerage schemes for the greater Dublin area, with a final estimated cost of more than £400 million, were included in the Department of the Environment's water and sewerage services capital works programmes for 1997;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes the very significant positive impacts which Dublin has experienced under the urban renewal schemes particularly in Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area which is now to be subsumed into the regeneration initiative for the much wider dockland area;</P>
    <P>&mdash;supports the Government commitment to construct the core light rail system to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative and welcomes the practical initiatives which have been taken to implement that commitment as quickly as possible;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes the significant range of measures which are now in place to tackle long-term unemployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the progress made in meeting social <Col N="975" /> housing needs in the Dublin area and welcomes the Government's recent commitment to the comprehensive redevelopment and regeneration of the Ballymun estate;</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the Government for the sustained and wide ranging improvements in the health and personal social services implemented in Dublin;</P>
    <P>&mdash;commends the Government for the significant increase in education services in Dublin city and county;</P>
    <P>&mdash;welcomes the implementation of the recommendations of the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on measures to reduce demand for drugs and supports the Government in its policy to deal with the drugs and crime problem not only in relation to the deployment of Garda resources on the ground in Dublin, but also in the action it has taken on a broader front to combat the drugs menace;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes the excellent job creation record of the relevant State agencies in the Dublin area with the creation of over 6,000 new jobs in 1996 and overall employment in the year to April 1996 increasing by a record 26,200;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes that the average annual rate of jobs growth in the Dublin region for April 1994-96, at 5.2% was well ahead of the jobs growth rate nationally;</P>
    <P>&mdash; acknowledges the success of the Government's overall tourism policy and its positive impact on the Dublin region;</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes the provision made for culture institutions, venues and activities;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the success to date of Operation Freeflow and the commitment of all of the agencies involved to repeat that success under the second phase of the operation which was launched last month and</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes the recent initiatives by the Dublin local authorities to address the public demand for more taxis.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In its excellent document, Dublin 2000, Our City a thriving City, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce began by stating that Dublin in 1995 faces many difficulties &mdash; more than 90,000 people are unemployed, it is a congested city chocked by traffic and it has a serious and growing crime problem.  The chamber projects itself forward to 2010 and imagines Dublin alive with tourists, full of high quality jobs, a safe and secure city for young and old with traffic <Col N="976" /> flowing freely and Dublin playing international host to a year round calendar of exciting sporting, cultural and conference events.</P>
      <P>At present our capital city is caught between that reality and vision.  We are on our way to achieving that vision, but we have a good deal to plan and achieve in the period ahead.  There are still 90,000 people unemployed.  The city is still choked with traffic and the crime problem awaits firm handling.Unfortunately, this Government's term of office will be remembered as the period when decisions were deferred and Minister in the three rainbow parties passed the parcel with key projects, such as light rail, the conference centre, Dublin Port tunnel, the national science park and the major twin social evils of crime and unemployment.The presence of this Government has hardly created a ripple on the surface of life. What is good was completed or planned before its arrival and the next phase of developments will be planned and implemented when it is gone.</P>
      <P>I am glad I have had the opportunity down through the years to be involved in many of the key issues which are the source of debate on this Fianna Fáil motion tonight.  We have considered the type of issues all Members of this House would like to see addressed.  We believe the city needs a new charter with the objective of giving Dubliners the maximum say in the way their city is run and maximum participation in charting a bright future for it.</P>

      <P>I suppose the Deputy will claim credit for projects such as the IFSC and Temple Bar and the pedestrianisation of the city.  The Deputy nearly ruined the city council not to mention the rest of the city.</P>
      <P>In each area of the city and its suburbs we have a network of communities who identify with their particular locality, choose to live there and play a role in developing the community and preserving the valuable heritage that is there.  There is a constant flow of activity in aspects of local life, the environment, employment, traffic, tourism and education.  It is our party's view that we will implement a new method of financial support for local authorities to be paid for by a dedicated fund of public finance and on the basis of that assured income local authorities will be able to plan for the long term and concentrate on providing quality services in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the issues addressed last night include the crime problem, the drugs crisis in the city, the provision of quality housing and education, including access to third level education, which is <Col N="977" /> becoming a major problem.  Last night figures were given indicating a major shortage of places. It is good that people want to avail of third level education, but the shortage of college places must be addressed.  There is also a need for guidance and the provision of employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed, an issue the Taoiseach and I addressed at Question Time today. Citizens with disabilities should be given equal access and opportunities.  The enhancing of Dublin's environment and the preservation of its heritage is a key issue that should be given proper resources.  Dublin citizens should be assured they will have access to cultural institutions, the Dublin transport system should be integrated and local communities should have an equal partnership role with Dublin Corporation.  That is a broad outline of the type of proposals we would introduce.  We would work to ensure that Dublin Corporation would work with local communities in an agreed and integrated way.</P>
    <P>Local development plans have been drawn up in many areas throughout the city and county. Some time ago I attended a conference, South Dublin 2012, with the Chamber of Commerce at which it launched a comprehensive and costed plan to successfully tackle the challenges of unemployment, disadvantage and underdevelopment in west and south Dublin.  I highlighted in the speech I made on that occasion that the history of Tallaght is an example of how major projects can be delivered by hard graft for local communities.Tallaght today has an regional technical college, the Square, Tallaght Hospital, South Dublin County Council buildings and a library. The M50 has been completed and those projects have been great developments.  As Deputy Broughan will readily admit they were planned and delivered by Fianna Fáil over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few infiltrators in the organisations who are causing trouble.  There are still many difficulties in some areas such as Cherry, Orchard, St. Catherine's and Swords, in Finglas and Ringsend.  In many other sectors of the city local enterprise boards continue to work with business groups and they are successfully banding together to deal with individual cases.</P>
      <P>Dublin is a popular tourist destination at present.  Direct flights to Dublin have played a part in this success.  In spite of the many new accommodation plans provided over the past five years there is severe pressure on places almost on an all year round basis.  There are some worrying signs that we may be attracting particular tourist-client groups who concentrate on heavy drinking and can easily become involved in aggregated crimes or worse.  This is not yet a major problem but more complaints are being made by residents and businesses and the gardaí highlighted at a recent conference that it is something we should deal with before it gets out of hand.  I do not subscribe to the view expressed by some people that the problem has got out of hand.  We must be wise and deal with the problem effectively.</P>
      <P>To exploit fully the current and future potential of the city we need easy access to and from places of work and business, shopping and leisure facilities, cultural, education and Government buildings and quality integrated links between air, sea, rail and road transport.</P>
      <P>The quality of life of Dublin in the city centre and the suburbs must, in all these cases, be enhanced by any new developments and concerns must be accommodated.  While there was a brief respite during Operation Freeflow, we have once again returned to gridlock, even at off peak times with various bottlenecks of long lines of traffic idling away and causing major delays.  The appointment of a director of traffic will be of some assistance, but more structural developments are needed to deal with the problem. Every major report, including the latest ESRI mid-term one, highlighted the real dangers of congestion if not checked and that it will choke off not only the quality of life but the life blood of commercial life in the city.</P>
      <P>It is vital that we proceed as quickly as possible with the completion of the ringroad around the city and determine an agreed route for the port tunnel.  We will also put on the table plans for a port access tunnel from Heuston Station to be funded by private sector funds, a project in which I was actively involved when I was Minister for Finance.  I believe that project is realistic and the Minister who is present may be still dealing with it.  It makes commercial sense and I know the people involved are prepared to move it forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proud of the role we have played in planning <Col N="979" /> and ensuring funding for the series of by-passes and new roads including the N1 and the M50, but there are still major bottlenecks, particularly at the airport and at the Firhouse end of the M50.  They must be addressed urgently.  If we are to avoid the difficulties we faced previously. We must increase the capacity and services of the DART as well as suburban rail with the opening of former stations and extending links to the city centre.  As a matter of major priority, we need a rapid rail link to Dublin Airport where carparking facilities are already at a maximum.  Further major growth is forecast for the airport which handles ten million passengers annually.  As I do not see how we can continue to extend the car-parking facilities at the airport we must find alternatives.</P>
    <P>LUAS must be proceeded with as a matter of priority.  The lack of driving space on our city centre streets, the prospect of disfiguring the city centre with tram wires, and the unacceptable nightmare of ripping up those core city streets, has convinced us we should fully explore the underground option.  The Government was to look at this but it seems to be refusing to order an independent study of the costs of putting Luas underground.  Nobody can do it until we actually see the costings.  Has the Minister finished his own examination?  I welcomed his statement a few months ago, after he took office, that he would examine it.  While nobody can give a commitment without seeing the costings, I think it is worth doing.  If we can find an alternative we should do so because otherwise it will create major chaos.  I am in favour of the principle of light rail but we must find a satisfactory way of dealing with the core issues.  I do not see how Dawson Street and St. Stephen's Green can each lose one traffic lane.  It would not be practical. This city badly needs the proposals of the chambers of commerce, including Tallaght and Finglas, and the Harp project, as well as urban renewal. We should clearly deal with them.</P>
    <P>On several occasions I raised the issue of tax designation, which has brought great investment to Dublin.  I raised with the Minister responsible the fact that in a review of that tax designation we should set out clear guidelines on future policy in relation to private accommodation and rented dwellings.  It is becoming clearer that the number of home owners in private apartments is severely declining.  I hope we will not revert to low quality accommodation.  I raised this issue at the start of the scheme in 1987 and have continually raised it since.  As Minister for Finance I moved to increase accommodation.  This is a major issue for the city that should be addressed in the short-term.We will have our own proposals to make on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion seems to be going in two directions at once when it speaks about Luas.  Deputy Brennan and his colleagues want a special study of the underground option. That will delay CIE's formal application for a light railway order and thereby impede progress on the project.  At the same time they want the project implemented without delay.  They cannot have it both ways &mdash; either they want further studies or they want action.  They should get off the fence and say clearly which side of that argument they want to come down on.</P>
      <P>Let me ask the Fianna Fáil Members a precise question, bearing in mind that CIE is now ready to submit a formal application for an on-street light rail line from Tallaght to Dundrum through the city centre.  Does Fianna Fáil want CIE to proceed with that application, or does it want CIE to defer its application and delay the project until this special study of the underground option is completed?  Those are clear choices and I would like to hear from Fianna Fáil Members which one they want.  Do they want action now or more studies?</P>
      <P>Let me be clear about one thing; it is not an option for CIE to make its formal application for an on-street light rail system while a special study of the underground alternative is going on in parallel.When the formal application process has begun, there is a clear statutory procedure which must be followed.  It involves publication and display of the application, a period for making objections and a mandatory public inquiry, following which I will have to make a decision on CIE's application.</P>
      <P>That application, like one for a motorway scheme or a compulsory purchase order, has to be clear and specific.  CIE does not have the luxury of walking on both sides of the street at the same time, as Fianna Fáil is trying to do in this motion.  It is the typical gobadán trying to be on both strands at the same time.  CIE has to make clear a choice as to the routing of the proposed light rail line, including whether to construct it on-street or underground, and to defend that choice before a public inquiry and in the face of any objections from interested parties.  CIE cannot leave a gap in the middle of its application to be filled with the remainder of the project at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an earlier point in the debate on the light rail system, Deputy Brennan suggested that the light rail routes should be built as far as the canals, leaving aside the city centre sections for further study.  I would like to know if that option is still being proposed by Fianna Fáil.  That approach would also delay CIE's application for a light rail order on the Tallaght-Dundrum line. The application now proposed by CIE would have to be withdrawn and recast to exclude the <Col N="981" /> entire city centre section.  It would also require substantial revision of the environmental impact statement.</P>
    <P>An equally unacceptable alternative for CIE would be to delay indefinitely making the application until the underground review was completed.An application in respect of a tram network linking the suburbs to the canal ring, without any definite plans as to how to link those lines to each other or to the city centre, is not a very bright idea, even by Fianna Fáil's usual standards.  It is typical of the very disjointed and literally disconnected thinking that we have come to expect from that party.</P>

      <P>At that time I said that the CIE project team should be given the time and space required to complete its consideration of the issues raised during the consultation process &mdash; we have a very long consultation process &mdash; and to decide the detailed shape and form of its formal application for a light railway order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate that the statutory approval process in the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1956, provides the appropriate forum for all issues in relation to the light rail project to be considered. The Act provides for full and effective public involvement in the statutory decision making process.Individuals and organisations will be able to make written objections to the formal CIE proposals.A mandatory public inquiry will then be held which will provide an adequate opportunity for open, independent, robust and objective scrutiny of the CIE proposals, during which people <Col N="982" /> will be able to make oral submissions on matters of concern to them.</P>
    <P>Before I make a decision on CIE's application for the necessary powers, I will be obliged to take account of the inspector's report on the public inquiry and of any written submissions made to me.  I still believe that this is the best and most proper way of dealing with differing viewpoints, including the underground option for the city centre, which has been suggested by a number of commentators.  Those who feel that an underground is the best option will have an adequate opportunity, before an independent inspector, to explain why and to challenge CIE on its approach.</P>

      <P>That, of course, is an option that so far it seems will not be available to Fianna Fáil because it has not yet made up its mind about this.  It is appropriate to remind the House that there has never been a more painstaking, detailed or time-consuming public consultation process in relation to any major infrastructure proposal than there has been for the LRT.</P>
      <P>This Government has worked assiduously to ensure the phased implementation of the core light rail line to Tallaght, Ballymun and Cabinteely, as recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  Last October we secured the agreement of the European Commissioner for Regional Affairs to go ahead with the Tallaght to Dundrum line and at the same time committed ourselves to get on with the planning of the Ballymun line with the objective of bringing it to construction not later than the completion of Tallaght-Dundrum.The planning work for Ballymun will also include consideration of an extension to Dublin Airport.  I hope to be in a position shortly to make a further announcement which will provide tangible evidence of this Government's determination to implement the light rail system.</P>

      <P>I was astonished to hear Deputy Bertie Ahern make the most extraordinary and baseless assertion that this Government has been inactive.  Unlike Fianna Fáil, this Government has taken concrete measures to improve public transport in Dublin.  Deputy Ahern has shown yet again how out of touch he is with what is happening in the city.  Perhaps the reason is that he has had an over dose of public &ldquo;posterised&rdquo; dreaming about an unknown and unspecified future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on record some of the major initiatives taken by this Government.  European Union Cohesion Fund assistance has been obtained for the extension of the DART to Greystones and Malahide.  Iarnród Éireann is proceding to implement these projects and the company hopes to be in a position to start the necessary <Col N="983" /> electrification works later this year.  The new service to Greystones will come into operation by the end of 1998 and the Malahide service will be operational the following year.  That may not be important to Deputy Bertie Ahern because he rarely goes anywhere near Malahide or Greystones, but the people living in those areas will appreciate its value.</P>
    <P>European Union Structural Fund assistance has been approved for extra DART rolling stock which will be delivered next year.  Approval has been given for new stations at Fairview, Barrow Street, Drumcondra and Kilcock.  Fairview station will open shortly, Kilbarrack station will be refurbished, Dún Laoghaire station will be improved and upgrading work is under way in other stations.  Exchequer grant assistance has been provided for the upgrading of public address and passenger information systems on the DART network.</P>
    <P>Substantial progress is being made in the quality bus corridor programme.  Four of those are now in operation.  I officially opened the Lucan corridor in February and our objective is to have all the radial corridors in place by the end of next year.  These measures are being supported by action on the traffic management front.  Operation Freeflow was launched successfully at Christmas and has now been extended.  A director of traffic has been appointed for the first time. The director will be working with the CIE project team to put in place an effective traffic management regime for the light rail project.  I am within my rights and the limits of decency to ask Deputy Ahern to withdraw his baseless assertion which indicates how out of touch he is with these issues.</P>

      <P>Public transport is winning back market share despite intense competition from the private car.  Last year the DART and suburban rail network carried over 88,000 passengers per day compared with less than 62,000 passengers ten years earlier.  The introduction of quality but corridors has led to a growth of up to 25 per cent in the number of bus passengers on those routes.</P>

      <P>I always regarded Fianna Fáil as the party with the brass neck.  However, it has surpassed itself with this motion.  This debate comes one week after a Fianna Fáil motion on farm incomes which proposed a major compensation package as the solution to the difficulties facing farmers.  There is no doubt that Dublin needs additional investment, although it has received substantially more in recent years than it did under Fianna Fáil.  It is only beginning to catch up on many fronts.  How does this additional spending square with the fiscal rectitude advocated by Deputy McCreevy in his recent interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> or Deputy Bertie Ahern's commitment to keep the national debt under £39 million, which rules out borrowing for any purpose?  The answer is it does not.</P>
      <P>I have noticed a number of things about the new Fianna Fáil, the party which is not sullied by financial scandals and which has managed to make an art form of speaking out of both sides of its mouth.  The problem is that Fianna Fáil is allergic to choice.  People can choose between Deputy Bertie Ahern, the fixer and conciliator, or Deputy Bertie Ahern and Fianna Fáil, the party and leader who are afraid to upset anyone lest their flaky coalition falls apart.  Listening to the recent Ard-Fheis speech by Deputy Ahern, I felt a sense of <i>déjá vu</i> because it conjured up images of helicopters dropping manifestos from the sky.  It seemed like 1977 all over again.  No wonder the party is upset about the clear choice facing the electorate at the next election.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has been bad for Dublin because of its need to kow-tow to vested rural interests. Fianna Fáil had many opportunities to deliver in Dublin but failed miserably, particularly on the north side.  Within the past decade, north side Dubliners from the Fianna Fáil Party were Taoiseach, Minister for Finance, Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Justice.  However, the rate of delivery to their constituencies was abysmal and would not have been tolerated in any other county.  There were two Fianna Fáil Deputies in my constituency from time immemorial until 1992.  The election of only one Fianna Fáil Deputy in 1992 proved to be the exception to the long written rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exceptions seem to be good for the people of Dublin North-West because Labour has delivered for my constituents.  It was a Labour Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who yesterday proposed tax designation status for the new Finglas technology <Col N="985" /> campus.  This will bring a large number of much needed jobs to an area which, under Fianna Fáil, became an unemployment blackspot. Another Labour Minister, Deputy Howlin, recently approved a £180 million redevelopment project for Ballymun, which was deprived of a chance to develop.  It has now been given a new lease of life.  Fianna Fáil's record in education was one of neglect.  The Holy Spirit schools in Ballymun, now fully refurbished, were in need of repair but Fianna Fáil failed to deliver.  A new building has been provided for St. Aidan's school in Whitehall, which had previously operated for over 25 years in substandard prefabricated accommodation.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion is a joke.  Fianna Fáil has become a party without cause, belief or convictions.It is a hollow shell of its former glory and has no business in government.  The Fianna Fáil legacy for the Dublin area has been badly planned urban sprawls and contented developers. We do not intend to allow them to forget that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion is a joke.  Deputy Noel Ahern used try to work out why his party was so fundamentally anti-Dublin and the conclusion he came to was that many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who represented the area were not from the Dublin region.  Whatever the reason, the record is clear.</P>
      <P>I can speak at first hand as leader of the Labour Party group on Dublin City Council over the past six years.  On a range of issues, Fianna Fáil has badly neglected and intensively denied Dublin its just deserts and necessities.  Basic water and sewerage services are inadequate and Dublin is probably the only capital city whose water supply is not assured.  This is the result of years of neglect by Fianna Fáil Administrations.  Dublin Bay, the city's greatest natural amenity is in a filthy condition because of years of neglect.  I commend the Minister Deputy Howlin for starting the water conservation and sewerage programmes to repair these deficiencies at long last.</P>
      <P>On housing, Fianna Fáil Administrations, including the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition, reduced the level of local authority house building to a trickle in Dublin and a combination of bad planning and lack of planning across the northern fringes of the city resulted in greedy rezoners and their Fianna Fáil lackeys on Dublin County Council producing awful environments which lack resources and services.  Similarly, the proposals we heard tonight and last night for public transport are ironic and funny in the context of Fianna Fáil's record over the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the provision of youth and sports facilities it is ironic that, like me, the Fianna Fáil Leader likes to put on a blue jersey and parade in Croke Park, but when it came to diverting resources to Dublin GAA and sports clubs, that man was nowhere to be found and Dublin's sports clubs must exist on a pittance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Across a range of areas, Fianna Fáil performance <Col N="986" /> has been poor.  This Government is trying to deal with the position whereby more than 70 per cent of crime is committed in Dublin, while only one third of Garda forces are deployed here.  This developed under all those Fianna Fáil Administrations.</P>
    <P>In the past 30 years two prominent northsiders, former Taoiseach Mr. Haughey and Deputy Ahern, have been in charge of Fianna Fáil.  They have represented Dublin constituencies, such as Dublin Central, which has suffered from great deprivation, crime and vandalism.  After 20 years in this House, the record of the Fianna Fáil Leader is very poor indeed and that is something on which Dubliners will reflect deeply in the forthcoming election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my Labour Party colleagues, I find it hard to take Fianna Fáil seriously.  I hope the electorate realises Fianna Fáil is in Opposition and it would be a disaster in Government.</P>
      <P>I could not believe my eyes on reading the Private Members' Motion presented to this House.  I do not know if people go through a dramatic experience when they leave Government and go into Opposition but it required a brass neck to present that motion to the House.  When we inherited Government this city was in chaos. There was a drugs epidemic of unknown proportions, crime was at an all time high and unemployment in the city was of record proportions.  A two-tier society had been created and so many double standards had been created in public life that the Government was ultimately toppled from power.  We continue to see the scandals unfold at Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>Having been born and reared in Dublin I find it hard to restrain myself knowing the type of city I have inherited as a politician in Government. The day these political parties put aside their differences as independent political entities and formed this Rainbow Coalition could not have come a day too soon.  They came together and resolved to a great extent in two and half years many of the underlying problems inherited from Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I note with some amusement that Fianna Fáil's motion calls on the Government to &ldquo;provide for the proper physical and environmental planning of the area&rdquo;.  That will come as news to the Democratic Left chairperson, Councillor Catherine Murphy, who has been battling a Fianna Fáil led rezoning campaign in north County Kildare which takes no account of available services, infrastructure or demographic trends.  Fianna Fáil has an outrageous record on rezoning which not only destroyed parts of the city but enhanced the coffers of Fianna Fáil or individual members of Fianna Fáil, and it is a tragedy to think that such rezoning continues to this extent in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, Dublin suffers from many problems and the Minister has addressed some of them, such as transport and planning.  The most serious <Col N="987" /> problem confronting the capital city is the crisis of long-term unemployment.  Long-term unemployment is geographically clustered and it is concentrated in urban Ireland.  It has been concentrated by Fianna Fáil in what are now knows as marginalised communities.  They have marginalised people and alienated them from the mainstream of society.  They have created ghettos and have the gall to come in here and criticise this Government.</P>
    <P>One should look at the Dublin's south innercity and the northside of Cork and see the sprawling estates which were created under Fianna Fáil Administrations on the physical and social edges of these cities.  These estates are often described as working class but many of the people in them have never worked.  It is in these communities that we find children leaving school without qualifications and hope.  It is in these communities of urban Ireland that we find families revaged by drug abuse and mothers trying desperately to stave off the moneylenders.  The desperation of large sections of urban Ireland did not arise overnight.It is a desperation which developed under successive Fianna Fáil Administrations.  The tragedy of the £5,000 incentive to working class people to surrender their local authority houses to move into private housing estates leaving behind ghettos is one of the most criminal political decisions ever taken by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>

      <P>This Government does not have all the answers and neither does Democratic Left but we have made a brave start.  We know 100,000 jobs have been created in the lifetime of this Government and that the live register is at its lowest level since 1991.  In Dublin 6,000 new jobs were created in 1996 and the average annual rate of growth in jobs in Dublin from April 1994 to April 1996 was 5.2 per cent, which was well ahead of the national rate.  We also know that an extra £14 million is being invested in measures to combat the drugs crisis and in the establishment of local drugs task forces in recognition that the drugs problem must be tackled in partnership with local communities.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that long-term unemployment is the key political issue to be addressed by whichever political formation results from the election because the jobs being created at present are by-passing the long-term unemployed.  I remind my fellow parliamentarians that last weekend, at Democratic Left's annual delegate conference, I put forward a motion calling for radical State intervention to create real jobs which will pay real wages in the State and community sectors.</P>

      <P>As Members are aware, that <Col N="988" /> motion was adopted by the conference and it is the only realistic way to break the vicious cycle of long-term unemployment, low educational attainment and social disintegration inherited after Fianna Fáil's period in office.  Long-term unemployment is at the top of Democratic Left's political agenda and we intend to ensure that it is placed at the top of the next Government's political agenda.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Fianna Fáil motion refers to the Dublin which is participating in the current economic boom or the Dublin which finds itself marginalised on the sidelines.  However, I know the Dublin I represent.  The people I represent would be hardest hit by the policies that would be pursued by a Fianna Fáil Progressive Democrat coalition.  I warn the electorate that it will suffer most under Deputy Harney's philosophy of &ldquo;self-help or no help&rdquo;.  It will suffer most when Fianna Fáil reverts to type and places the interests of large farmers above those of PAYE workers and the unemployed.  I forewarn my constituents that under no circumstances should they be tempted to support a Government of that complexion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refute the allegations made by Deputy Broughan.  As far as Deputy Ahern is concerned, he participated in some of the most important and valuable developments in Dublin, particularly on the northside of the city, while in office.  These included: the International Financial Services Centre; the renewal of the northside; the partnerships established throughout the city; the support given to voluntary organisations including those representing people with disabilities which protested outside the House earlier today &mdash; such organisations have been left to reflect on the support they enjoyed while Fianna Fáil was in office which they have not received since my party entered Opposition &mdash; and the refurbishment of Darndale and inner city areas.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputy Byrne that his party has been in Government for the introduction of three budgets at a time when increased finance has been available for use in Dublin.  The Government has made very bad use of such additional resources.  The Deputy referred to long-term unemployment as his party's principle priority.  It is correct that this should be the case.  In addition to crime, long-term unemployment is one of the major problems we face.  However, the rainbow coalition has failed totally in its efforts to tackle poverty and disadvantage, particularly in Dublin. A great many reports have been produced but the Government has failed to deliver results on the ground.  It has had three budgets, effectively three years in financial terms, in which to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Huge housing estates in Dublin are riven with <Col N="989" /> the problems of drug abuse, crime, poverty, unemployment and educational disadvantage. The Labour Force Survey illustrates that where the head of a household is unemployed the risk of poverty is very high &mdash; an estimated 59 per cent.  Long-term unemployment and unemployment in general must be principal targets.  Where the head of a household is employed, the risk of poverty is as low as 3 per cent.  The survey also shows that 63 per cent of unemployed people are long-term unemployed.  Therefore, any Government worthy of support must make tackling long-term unemployment a top priority.  Nowhere in the country is this more important than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployed people was decreasing steadily under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  We were on target for an average rate of 266,000 people on the live register for 1995.  However, something went seriously wrong when the rainbow coalition came to power in late December 1994.  Although the numbers of those at work continue to rise, the number of people out of work rose to 277,000 in 1995.  That figure represents the average number of people paid unemployment benefit or assistance by the Department of Social Welfare in each week of the year.  This means that an average of 11,000 additional people were unemployed during each week in 1995 and it represents a substantial excess over the trend that was in place when Fianna Fáil handed over the reins of power to the rainbow coalition.  That figure further disimproved to 279,000 people unemployed, on average, during every week in 1996.  This is the rainbow coalition's record and it is a bad one.</P>
    <P>We can and must do better.  More than 66 per cent of the long-term unemployed are males and 77 per cent of those unemployed and aged between 40 and 54 years are long-term unemployed.In addition, approximately 50 per cent of those who are long-term unemployed did not proceed beyond primary school level in formal education.Therefore, one of our major problems is the high number of men with educational disadvantage who are approaching middle age, are long-term unemployed and are concentrated in disadvantaged communities.  This is a major problem in Dublin and my party has plans to tackle it. The current Administration does not appear to have any ideas in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal with the transport aspect of this excellent motion, which I was honoured to sign with my colleagues from the Dublin constituencies.  I am concerned about the totally inadequate rail service which my constituents from Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush, Lusk, Donabate, Malahide and Portmarnock are forced to use when travelling to and from work, college and school.  A survey I carried out on the trains used on the route showed that they are totally over-crowded, the service is inadequate, the timetable is unsuitable and the passengers are concerned for their safety.  Approximately 96 per cent of the <Col N="990" /> people questioned referred to overcrowding on these trains.</P>
      <P>We are determined to seek the provision of a greater number of carriages and trains at peak times, later trains from the city in the evenings, a Sunday train service, later trains on Saturday evenings, a proper PA system on trains and platforms, better access for the disabled, properly enforced smoking bans and improved station facilities, such as public telephones, security in car parks, proper toilet facilities, automated ticket machines and better lighting.  These are fundamental provisions to which paying customers should be entitled when travelling to and from work.  At present, the transport provided is more akin to cattle trucks than to a commuter train service.People should not be asked to endure that kind of service in this day and age.  These trains are unsafe and action is required.</P>
      <P>I want to press strongly for a rail or DART connection to Dublin Airport.  At present, many concrete car parks are being put in place which is ludicrous.  A proper rail connection to allow for the increasing numbers of passengers using Dublin Airport is needed.</P>
      <P>My final point relates to the unbelievable and unacceptable delays experienced by motorists on the section of the main Dublin to Belfast road which leads from Swords into the city.  Each morning people spend 15 to 20 minutes making a journey which would normally take only one to two minutes.  It makes no sense from an economic point of view.  The degree of frustration experienced morning and evening is totally unacceptable.  Will the Minister do something about it immediately?</P>

      <P>The Government amendment, a mere summary of all the good things that happened in Dublin in recent years &mdash; including some projects kept going but none initiated by this Government &mdash; is a joke.</P>
      <P>I had been listening to another channel upstairs and switched over only to hear the usual twisted garbage produced by my constituency colleague, Deputy Shortall, as she recited a list of local issues she claimed had been tackled by this Government.  For example, she spoke about St. Aidan's School.  The Minister came and cut the tape, as typically Government Ministers arrived in their Mercedes to cut tapes or put the final touch to decisions undertaken by previous Governments when my party was in power.  It is galling to listen to Deputy Shortall claim credit for projects in which her party had no hand, act or part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She spoke also about the comprehensive school and Holy Spirit schools in Ballymun where work was approved a couple of years ago when Fianna Fáil was in power.  The repair of the leaking roof of the comprehensive school, having been approved in 1994 under the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, was not completed in that year because of some contract problem.  It was omitted from the approved list in 1995, only to be <Col N="991" /> reinstated within the past nine months.  It is sickening to listen to such nonsense.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Shortall was feeling flush at the announcement today of one piece of good news in Dublin North-West, by way of amendment of the Finance Bill, of a site to be designated in Finglas.  While I welcome that proposal, it represents the politics of the latest opinion poll that such projects are pulled out of the bag. Nothing occurred in that constituency over the past two and a half years.  I hope the experience has helped Deputy Shortall to grow up, to realise that real life is about jobs rather than speaking a load of nonsense.  I hope the experience of having consulted developers and promoters in recent months has not contaminated her in any way and that she will withstand the test in the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>Dublin has done well in recent years but I must emphasise that that boom and its benefits have not been spread evenly around the city.  When this Government came into power early in 1995 there was a proposal to locate a huge science and technology park in Abbotstown College, just beyond Finglas in my constituency.  It was recommended by consultants appointed by the European Union, before any politician touched the file.  We thought we were very fortunate in Dublin North-West to have had one of our public representatives appointed Minister for Social Welfare, that at the very least he would hold the position and ensure that that science and technology park was located in Abbotstown College since Finglas was such an employment black spot. That science and technology park was not swiped by a Fine Gael or Labour Minister but by the Minister for Social Welfare's own three-quarters Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who diverted it to Dublin South-West.  One of the steering committee's recommendations on the location of a regional technical college emphasised that Finglas was the area of greatest unemployment in the city and most in need of an regional technical college. It appears the Government's attitude to the people of Finglas was that they might as well remain unemployed and that in the long-term Blanchardstown would be more in need.</P>
    <P>Dublin North-West has received nothing.  We read many of these flashy announcements of good news but the benefits of the boom have not been spread evenly.  It is sickening to hear Members claim credit for things that happened some five to ten years ago while not attempting to address the real problems and issues. Undoubtedly there is wealth and growth in the economy but it is not being spread evenly.  Huge suburbs have been totally excluded.  Even when it comes to large infrastructural projects, such as the proposed convention centre, one is forced to ask where this great socialist Government, with two so-called socialist parties, proposes to locate that centre.  None other than in Ballsbridge rather than in any needy suburb.  The Government pays much lip service to social concern, yet whenever <Col N="992" /> it takes a big decision in regard to something that would really change people's lives in a particular area, they favour Ballsbridge in Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>No progress has been made on major infrastructural projects such as the convention centre, the Dublin port tunnel and the ring road. Another Minister opened the northern section of the ring road in December last, copper-fastening something decided some five to seven years ago while anything at planning stage remains static. The port tunnel is bogged down, as are the southern cross route and the convention centre.</P>
    <P>At local authority level all I witness are representatives of the three different colours of this rainbow coalition Government talking against one another, afraid to take a decision, going round in circles, adopting the attitude of &ldquo;let this chalice pass from me&rdquo;.  They should call the general election and get on with it.  Some of them would not take a decision in a thousand years. They are afraid to bite the bullet and run with all objectors.  While that may be all right for some mindless Opposition party, when in Government one cannot adopt that attitude.</P>

      <P>Another issue left in abeyance was the proposed Luas line to Ballymun, but the Government decided to implement the two lines on the south side of the city.  However, the prospect of a north side line now being mooted.  I am most disappointed that no progress has been made on any of these planned infrastructural developments.Those that have progressed were approved by previous Governments.  I fail to understand how the Government could table this amendment.</P>

      <P>As a Dublin Deputy I welcome this opportunity to focus on and relate my remarks to the state of the capital and its quality of life, in particular those aspects of the motion pertaining to transport infrastructure, roads etc.</P>
      <P>Dublin is a fantastic city in which to live.  It is the envy of many other cities, with beautiful natural characteristics, a magnificent sweeping bay and in close proximity to the mountains.  The many thousands who have the good fortune to live here are happy and fortunate.</P>
      <P>Representing Dublin South, it has been my experience that this &ldquo;feel good factor&rdquo;, this delight in being a resident of our great capital city, is being severely diminished by two factors, first, the high level of crime and, second, the chronic traffic chaos its citizens daily experience as they go about their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now probably at the worst possible stage.  There has been too much development in <Col N="993" /> Dublin's suburbs which has been not properly integrated or progressed in tandem with the requisite infrastructure.  This follows many wrong decisions taken on land rezoning for housing development in the county some ten years or so ago, certainly in my constituency.  Planning in the Dublin area and in the suburbs has failed.  The failure to interface proper planning and development with roads planning means thousands of commuters who have to come into the city either to study or work are faced with chronic traffic problems daily, which severely diminishes their quality of life.  People in my constituency of Dublin South have become politicised by the bad state of traffic management in their areas.  The failure to complete the Southern Cross has meant chronic levels of traffic have built up on the routes leading off that part of the C ring which is completed, causing maximum delays for thousands of my constituents on a daily basis.  The most frequent representations to me concern traffic volumes in the constituency, bad traffic management and the non-enforcement of the traffic regulations in built-up residential areas. We have reached a crisis.  For that reason the Progressive Democrats Party has always welcomed and supported the Luas project which is only one part of the alleviation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we supported the Luas project.  This is the sort of anti-intellectual argument we get from the Labour Party.  Anybody who raises legitimate concerns about the project is accused of not supporting it.  That is a dishonest argument from a Minister of State &mdash; with whom I represent the constituency &mdash; who knows full well that all of us in this House want a properly functioning Luas system and the best value for taxpayers' money.  It is deeply dishonest for a Minister to imply that if a Deputy challenges certain aspects of the project he is speaking against the project.  That is part of democratic debate.  It is disingenuous and disappointing for a Minister to make that type of flippant remark.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has consistently called for the provision of a rapid rail transit service for Dublin.  I was a member of the Dublin Transportation Initiative at local authority level. There was some involvement by local councillors in the DTI but it was a cod because the main decisions were made by the technical and steering committees of that body.  It was a cosmetic exercise to have councillors involved in a so-called consultation process, given that none of the representations or concerns voiced affected the Minister's final decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to get the best system in relation to Luas and one capable of doing the job for which it is designed given that up to £250 million of public money is going into this project.  A number of questions will have to be raised about the Luas proposal as it stands.  Why will there not be <Col N="994" /> an interchange with the DART to provide an integrated rapid transit system for the whole city? Why will there not be an extension to the airport, even though it is planned to build the line to within a couple of miles of it?  Why will there not be a segregated track on most of the route?  Luas trams &mdash; like the buses &mdash; will have to negotiate the city traffic.</P>
    <P>Why is the southern terminus not being extended to Sandyford Industrial Estate, given the generally recognised unsuitability of having the terminus in Dundrum village which is snarled up with traffic?  Dundrum is the worst place in which to have the terminus.  It would make ultimate sense to extend it to Sandyford where there is more room for parking and it would serve the Sandyford Industrial Estate where thousands of people work.  Why will the Tallaght line take a circuitous route through the thinly populated Naas road area?  Why will the special reservation from Tallaght to Harold's Cross not be used to provide a shorter and faster route through a much more densely populated area?  Why was it decided to bring the line through the Red Cow roundabout at the junction of the M7 and the M50 and what will it cost?  Why was the contract awarded to a State company, without a tendering process?  Why was the contract for the largest rail project in the history of the State awarded to CIE's bus subsidiary and not to its rail subsidiary? These are all reasonable questions which deserve reasonable answers.  The last question is particularly interesting.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus has been charged with charged with responsibility for the construction of a massive rail project but Dublin Bus is a bus company, not a rail company or a construction management company.  To the best of my knowledge it has no experience in dealing with large scale building projects.  Who decided that Dublin Bus was the best company to manage the Luas project?  Dublin Bus finds it hard enough to cope with the relatively simple task of running a quality bus service in the city. How will it cope with the complexities of managing a huge construction project which will involve digging up miles of city streets?</P>
    <P>The whole Luas project has been fraught with controversy since it was first mooted.  Any criticism of the scheme as presented by the former Minister, Deputy Lowry and his PR team was treated as the equivalent of heresy and people were denounced in almost hysterical terms over the airwaves for having the temerity to question the Government's proposals.  That is hardly the way to treat or to go about analysing a major public spending project in a modern democracy.</P>
    <P>We all want to see an improvement in public transport in Dublin.  It is in the public interest. We all want cars off the city streets so why demonise people who raise valid concerns about the detailed planning of the project?  The whole process will be subject to a public inquiry.  I hope that will be a better forum for those people who wish to make legitimate criticisms or counter proposals to the Government's project.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="995" /> I regret the quality of debate on the project was marked by the type of comment made by the Minister of State.  If one raises a criticism or takes issue with any part of the Government's proposals one is accused of not supporting the project.It is disingenuous, dishonest and anti-intellectual.That has marked the debate on Luas, on which there should be a full and legitimate debate.  It is a major infrastructural project and is possibly the biggest infrastructural project which will be carried out here over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>There has been much legitimate argument about the so-called underground option.  My party has requested the financial feasibility of this option be investigated by independent consultants.The former Minister, Deputy Lowry, would not allow this and neither will his successor, Deputy Dukes.  I find this hard to understand particularly since the former leader of Fine Gael has made some valid criticisms and proposals in relation to the underground option between the canals.  It is not a matter of ideology.  It is not as if we have underground and overground politicians. What we have is two competing suggestions as to how the proposed system should go through the city centre area.  There is <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the underground option may be no more expensive to build than the on-street alternative. There is strong evidence that it may be cheaper to operate and compelling evidence that it would be much faster in terms of journey time.</P>
    <P>What has the Government to lose by commissioning independent consultants to investigate these two options given the degree of legitimate concerns raised about the chaos that will ensure by digging up city streets rather than having an underground service between the canals?  The Government spent £4 million on consultants to tell us to which bidders it should sell a stake in Telecom Éireann even though there was only one bidder.  It can surely afford a much smaller consultancy fee for this major project.</P>
    <P>Forfás produced a major report on the Irish economy last year specifically highlighting the need to encourage private sector provision of public infrastructure, particularly in the area of transport.  It is common practice in other countries.In Britain, the new Severn bridge was opened a few months ago at a cost of £300 million and the British Government did not have to provide a penny for that project.  Closer to home, the East Link and West Link bridges have been a success and an example of how private money can be used to provide public facilities.  No effort is being made by the Government to attract private finance for Luas.  There are private sector companies operating in the international market which would welcome the opportunity to bid for a project such as Luas.  It is a pity the Government is so lacking in innovation and imagination when it comes to the funding of major capital projects and has been unwilling to engage in a full debate on this project which is of major significance <Col N="996" /> and involves millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>I have been a public representative for 18 years in Dublin and the biggest issue I have had to deal with has been the indiscriminate rezoning of lands around Dublin led by the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly in the foothills of the Dublin mountains to which Deputy O'Donnell referred.  At the same time, there were 160 acres of derelict land in downtown Dublin owned by people waiting for office block prices while others could not find homes, particularly in the city centre.  Over the past three or four years, there has been a revitalisation of Dublin city centre.  It has been led by imaginative proposals which have targeted tax breaks.  In the absence of tax breaks, nothing happened.People were waiting for the rezoning to extend to other areas but, as soon as certain areas were targeted, people began to erect housing downtown and the population increased in Dublin city centre.  My sister acted as a census enumerator in that area and additional enumerators had to be employed because the revitalisation of the city centre had moved ahead at such a pace.</P>
      <P>We can be proud of the city centre.  It is no longer pock marked by derelict sites which resulted from the diversion of housing development to the city fringes where people received ten fold increases in land values through indiscriminate rezoning.  Dublin is a vibrant and attractive city attracting jobs and investment.  Over the past three years, 19,000 extra jobs have been created here.  Recently a firm decided to locate in Dublin rather than in Edinburgh because it was a more attractive city not only in terms of its workforce but the firm needed to attract foreign graduates with minority languages and Dublin was regarded as the more attractive city in which to live.</P>
      <P>When I was appointed, I was given responsibility for allocating EU Structural Funds.  I allocated £600 million towards road and transport investment and £34 million towards traffic management in Dublin.  I agree we need to invest significantly in public transport to break gridlock in the city and to ensure people can switch from commuting by private car to public transport. Quality public transport is needed to attract people to leave their cars at home.  In the previous round of Structural Funds there was virtually nil investment in public transport and I am proud to have been able to allocate funding towards the Luas project.  I confidently look forward to travelling into town from my home in Sandyford in a short couple of months.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies raised the delays in relation to the building of the southern cross route.  These were due to a High Court challenge by the Whitechurch Parish and associated <Col N="997" /> residents and a Supreme Court challenge by a garage in Sandyford.  The case did not leave the courts until 13 December 1996.  No public body was responsible for any hold up.</P>
      <P>In education, £50 million has been allocated for investment in expanding the number of third level places in the greater Dublin area and there has been increased funding for primary and second level schools.  Education policy under Deputy Bhreathnach has had a particular focus on breaking the cycle of disadvantage.  Twenty five city schools have been designated under the breaking the cycle initiative.  I recently spoke to a teacher who teaches senior infants in an inner city school.  She told me that in that area, which is one of Dublin's worst blackspots, the children were doing first class reading and were a year ahead because of the extra help provided under the initiative.</P>
      <P>Education is the key to breaking the cycle because if we ensure children and young people receive an education we can provide them with a much better start in life and ensure they do not become tomorrow's long-term unemployed.  The number of students leaving school before they reached the junior certificate stage when Deputy Bhreathnach entered office was 5,000.  This has been halved as a result of specific investment in breaking the cycle of disadvantage.  One hundred and sixty-one schools in the greater Dublin area are designated as disadvantaged.  They now have a better pupil-teacher ratio and receive more resources.</P>
      <P>In 1991, I was secretary of the national campaign for the homeless and many years ago was involved with the Dublin housing action committee.Under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government of the time the housing programme had been all but abandoned &mdash; 231 local authority house were provided that year.  That was increased to 1,351 houses in 1996 and the housing lists are reducing.  I am delighted that £180 million will be invested in the Ballymun high rise apartments which were one of the worst examples of social engineering perpetuated by Kevin Boland in 1966.</P>
      <P>In Structural Funds programmes we have directed resources towards unemployment blackspots through the local development programme. We introduced the local employment service and have added unemployment blackspots in south Dublin to the previous partnership areas.  There is an assault on the root causes of disadvantage in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>Dublin is my city.  I have great respect and regard for its history, people, environment and ambience and it is a privilege to live here.  One aspect of the city that should be praised is its public parks.  They are a credit to the people who look after them.  Merrion Square contains one of the finest public parks in the world.  I have not seen anything better and it is a magnificent tribute to those who look after it.  It is a flagship for all other public parks in the city <Col N="998" /> and county of Dublin.  I pay tribute to the people in the various local authorities who look after these parks.</P>
      <P>I understand that attack is the best form of defence but what the opening paragraphs of the Minister of State's speech have to do with the motion is a mystery.  Parts of Dublin are neglected.This was evident in the Dublin West by-election won by Fianna Fáil when the Labour Party was effectively wiped out.  Great emphasis is placed on the Celtic tiger but there is a cycle of poverty and deprivation and if we fail to break it, it will be to the detriment of our democracy.</P>
      <P>There was a certain radicalism when the people properly &mdash; I say that advisedly &mdash; rose up in their communities against the drug barons and the use of drugs in the city centre.  One could not but have sympathy for them.  There is an economic boom thanks to the efforts of successive Governments but we should not be complacent.  If we fail to keep in contact with communities in certain parts of the city and the county that are afflicted by enormous social problems which need to be dealt with urgently and which lack community centres, a proper bus service, adequate infrastructural facilities and so on, we will sow the seeds of discontent for the future.  We neglect them at our peril.</P>
      <P>I support the Garda Síochána in its strong efforts to deal with the drugs problem which extends to the prosperous borough of Dún Laoghaire which I have represented for many years.  There is a lack of local authority housing, including social housing, in the constituency.  I have to explain to constituents on a weekly basis at my clinics that they should not expect to receive a house for at least a year.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has boasted that £35 million is being spent in urging commuters to use public transport to break the gridlock in the arteries into the centre of the city.  There is no evidence, however, that it is working.  If the Minister of State wishes to boast, she should do so where no one can hear her.  Those of us who encounter long delays on a daily basis are outraged at the lack of activity.</P>

      <P>I love the city of Dublin in which I was born and reared.  It is my town.  It is a wonderful place for a variety of reasons.  Its people are special and famous for their hospitality.  That is the reason so many people visit it, not to mention the fun that they have during the day and at night having visited places of importance.  The same cannot be said of other cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion highlights the problems that we believe exist in the city of Dublin.  There are the huge problems of drugs and crime and the related problems of poverty and social exclusion.  I welcome the Breaking the Cycle programme introduced in 25 schools by the Minister for Education.It is a good idea in principle but we are only scratching at the surface.  As so many people were appalled at the scale of the problem, following the Dublin West by-election Fianna Fáil <Col N="999" /> established a committee to consider it.  It has had discussions with people from all strands of society and will publish a document shortly.  The only reason it has not been published before now is that so many people wish to make submissions to it.  The problem is not being tackled with urgency. It is a matter for each Member of the House to ensure the necessary resources are made available.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago we were told by many economic commentators that the country was in dire economic straits.  The position has changed completely.In the next ten years I hope we will tackle the problems of poverty and social exclusion with the same energy and effort that we tackled our economic problems.  We must solve them.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown a lack of imagination in its amendment to the motion.  The operational programme for transport is funded from the Structural Funds negotiated by Deputy Reynolds.  Many commentators said at the time that he was talking nonsense when he said he would receive the money he was seeking.  Water and sewerage schemes are funded from the same source.  The urban renewal schemes which have had a significant impact, particularly in Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area, were Fianna Fáil initiatives introduced by Mr. Haughey.  Fianna Fáil can also claim credit for the light rail system.  The significant range of measures now in place to tackle long-term unemployment is funded from the ESF negotiated by Padraig Flynn.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, with the statement that progress has been made in meeting social housing needs in the Dublin area and welcome the Government's commitment to the comprehensive development and regeneration of the Ballymun <Col N="1000" /> estate.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority Bill is also welcome.</P>
    <P>The amendment commends the Government for the sustained and wide-ranging improvements in the health and personal social services implemented in Dublin but I see no evidence of this.  I constantly receive complaints about the long queues.  The workers out on strike are extremely annoyed at the way they are being treated.  Much of the work on the Tallaght hospital project was done by Fianna Fáil.  The amendment also commends the Government for the significant increase in education services in Dublin city and county but Tallaght Regional Technical College and Dublin City University were Fianna Fáil initiatives.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown a lack of imagination in tackling the problems of drugs, social exclusion, poverty and deprivation.  All of the Deputies for the constituency of Dublin South East were recently asked by the Jesuits to speak at a conference on social deprivation which was attended by people from the inner city.  The problem is now so serious that if we fail to provide the necessary resources we will be very sorry in the time to come.  We must treat all the children of the nation equally.  As the father of three children, I get embarrassed when I think of the future facing these people.  The most important way of tackling this problem is through education.  While the breaking the cycle initiative was a fantastic idea it is not extensive enough.  A school principal in one of these areas told me that only 8 per cent of her pupils have a normal family life.  This gives an indication of the extent of the problem with which we have to deal.  If we do not tackle this problem we will be sorry in the coming years. This challenge must be met by the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 22, after &ldquo;1997&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a tenant purchase house still being paid for or under effective control&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am asking in this amendment that the provision be extended to include tenant purchase houses as well as tenant houses.  If the provision is confined to tenant houses, the Bill may not be as effective. I know of several estates where more than half the houses are tenant houses.  I am aware also of a particular tenant purchase house which, in the eyes of the local people, is the source of a great deal of anti-social behaviour.  The teenagers living in these estates are very mobile and it is difficult to know which house they are living in.  I fear that some may pretend to be living with their friend up the road in a tenant purchase house and the local authority will be unable to do anything about the matter.  The excluding order procedure should apply also to tenant purchase houses.  It is not as if such a house becomes a private house like any other private house when it is first bought by the tenant, with the local authority having no control.  Permission must be sought from the local authority for the sale of such a house even years after it was originally bought out by the tenant.  In that context, and for this Bill to be effective, it is essential that this section be amended to provide for the application of the excluding order procedure to tenant purchase houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept these amendments which would have the effect of applying the excluding order procedure to persons who purchased their houses under a tenant purchase scheme.  A tenant purchaser owns his or her house.  The advice of the Attorney General is that any proposal to extend the measures in the Bill to owner occupiers beyond the extent allowed for in sections 14 and 16 raises legal and, possibly, constitutional issues that are quite different from the issues that arise when a local authority owns the house.</P>
      <P>Under section 14 local authorities will be empowered to refuse applications for tenant purchase and, in certain circumstances, applications to resell a tenant purchase house in cases of anti-social behaviour.  This will address Deputy Ahern's concern.  From now on local authorities should have a means of refusing to sell a house where the local authority is aware of anti-social behaviour.</P>
      <P>The application of the excluding order procedure generally to existing tenant purchase houses is simply not feasible.  Apart from these legal, and possibly constitutional, difficulties to which I have referred, there are also serious practical objections.  First, it could have the effect of extending the scope of the excluding order provisions to a very large number of additional houses, many of which were purchased a long time ago.  It would be wrong to expect local authorities to exercise control in relation to anti-social behaviour in the case of these houses.  That would be totally outside the scope of their housing management functions which is the context in which the measures under the Bill are formulated and will operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern's amendment attempts to deal with the problem of drug pushers moving not only into tenant purchase houses but into private houses.  I know of one estate where six drug dealers have moved into private houses, some of which were purchased by the Corporation for the people concerned; that is a separate problem about which the local authorities are increasingly concerned.  Having established residence in a community, drug pushers may not immediately push drugs in that area but will do so in an adjacent community.  This practice is fairly extensive now because of the crackdown on anti-social behaviour in certain areas by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are driven out, but that does not necessarily mean they are driven from the city centre to the suburbs.  In my experience it means being driven from one estate to the next.  They are moving down the road, staying clean, so to speak, and appearing at least semi-respectable in the area where they now live, but at the same time they are pushing drugs in their old community.We may rejoice in the fact that they have been evicted in the first instance, but they move only a small distance away and work from there. <Col N="1004" /> Deputy Ahern wants to extend the powers of the corporation, and that is something communities want because they are worried and at times desperate, about this issue and what could happen to their children.</P>
    <P>A tenant purchase house is still under the effective control of the local authority.  We welcome the provisions in the Bill which will be helpful.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in the context of the powers that can be exerted in this area. However, it is something we have to address.  It may mean that more time and consideration need to be given to this issue, but it remains an important issue not only in respect of tenant purchase houses where the local authorities still have some control but also in respect of private houses and corporation houses that have been sold on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern is trying to stop the plague of drug abuse and the sale of drugs and stop people hiding in communities and distributing drugs.  He is concerned that when they are identified, they should be got out by legal means because there are many who would try to get them out by other means.  Most Deputies have attended mass meetings of residents and concerned parents, where the control exercised by the Garda Síochána was very slight, the situation became exceptionally difficult and people were in no mood to hear about law and order, even though we had to maintain law and order and do our utmost to support the Garda in the circumstances.  There is a danger that if we do not find solutions people will take the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister of State has witnessed mass marches at first hand or has experienced the frightening and threatening atmosphere that results.  When one experiences that, one sees how passionate people are about drug abusers, dealers and suppliers.  In most cases we are talking about the middle men, those pushing drugs from a house within an estate.  We must find a way to deal with this problem.  I am familiar with a new estate into which six drug pushers have moved from an adjoining local authority estate.  While we are delighted they have moved out of the local authority estate, they will continue to supply their drugs to that estate from a convenient location nearby.  Because of the general layout of housing in local authority schemes rented, tenant purchase and private houses will be built side by side and we must prevent drugs spreading from one to the other.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Ahern she should at least recognise it was tabled as a result of experience. While the measures in the Bill are worthwhile and supported by all parties in the House, much more needs to be done.  Will the Minister consider these practical points?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I am not clear as to the purpose of this amendment.  Perhaps I did not understand the points made by Deputy Woods because I represent a different <Col N="1005" /> type of constituency.  I understand a march took place some months ago in his constituency, but I doubt if he supported it.  Residents of a private estate were protesting about a house the corporation had purchased for a decent family who got priority on medical grounds.  The family had just moved into the house.  If I am correct in stating that a Member of the House participated in that march, he should be ashamed of himself.</P>
      <P>Drug dealers are buying houses in private housing estates with their ill-gotten gains, but there is no provision in this Bill to deal with such people.  Those in private housing estates want to vet local authority tenants who move into their estates, but they do not want to vet those who produce £80,000 or more in cash to purchase a house.  Fortunately, legislation dealing with the seizure of assets will deal with such people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods may be referring to the fact that when the corporation evict an individual or family involved in drug dealing, the health board supplies them with a house, frequently in a private estate, and subsidises the rent.  Unless the Bill has been watered down &mdash; I am not a member of the committee dealing with it &mdash; it will deal effectively with that difficulty.  I agree with Deputy Woods that this is a problem throughout the city.</P>
      <P>Tenant purchasers usually get approval to purchase a house only because they have an income. Drug dealers do not have incomes which the corporation would recognise.  The type of drug dealers with which I am familiar would not have an ordinary worker's income and, therefore, the question of them purchasing their houses would not arise.  Corporation tenants who buy their houses should not be treated differently from others who buy houses.  If Deputies Woods and Ahern want to introduce draconian measures whereby people can be thrown out of their houses irrespective of where they live, it is beyond the scope of this Bill.  There may be a background to this amendment about which I am not familiar, but I have a good deal of experience of the type of difficulties to which the two Deputies referred and they are adequately covered by the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that Members are clear about the purpose of the Bill.  It improves the powers of local authorities in cases of anti-social behaviour.  The Deputy may not have examined the Bill adequately.  We are not talking about a comprehensive strategy to deal with all forms of drug dealing.  The Government is dealing with that much wider strategy in different forms of legislation.  This Bill focuses on local authorities which have responsibility for local authority housing, irrespective of whether it is in private estates.  Under section 3 persons who live outside a local authority estate can be excluded from the estate if they engage in anti-social behaviour.  An excluding order can prohibit the respondent, for the period during which the order is in force, from entering or being in the vicinity of that house or any other specified house or <Col N="1006" /> being in, or in the vicinity of, any specified housing estate.  That provision deals effectively with the concerns raised by Deputy Woods.  We must ensure the legislation is workable, legal and constitutional.I am familiar enough with this problem to convince the Deputy this is the correct procedure and his amendment is not acceptable or workable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted my amendment.  In tabling it I sought to address a problem in this area.  The problem does not relate to houses being bought by local authorities in private estates.  That is a different issue.  Approval for that measure was given in 1991 under a Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment and that basic strategy was developed since then.  We have had arguments and discussions in other places about the price local authorities should pay for private houses. The price to be paid for such houses should be controlled.  At another forum I voted that the maximum price to be paid for such private houses should be £65,000, but I know Deputy Gregory would like local authorities to buy such houses at £150,000 or £200,000, and maybe he has a point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gregory understands this problem, although it would not arise in inner city flat complexes because a tenant cannot buy out an inner city flat.  I am talking about housing estates, whether in Finglas, Cherry Orchard, Coburg Place in Sheriff Street, Gallanstown or another such area in which there is anti-social behaviour. We all know such behaviour is not confined to local authority tenants.  In many cases and, in one with which I am familiar, the source of the main problem in an estate is a tenant purchase household.The parents in that household got approval to purchase their house under the sale scheme. However, that scheme does not make tenant purchasers good citizens overnight.</P>
      <P>I accept the Bill will provide that in future, local authorities can refuse to allow a tenant to buy his or her house.  Approval for house purchase may be given to parents who appear reasonable tenants when their oldest child is ten or 14, but in four years' time when that youth is 18 he or she could turn out to be the terror of the estate and we will be powerless to deal with him or her.  I accept what the Minister said, but I have some doubts about it.  I cannot understand why we cannot deal with the problem.  If the tenant purchasers to whom I referred were to sell their house in five, ten or 15 years' time, they would have to seek approval from the local authority to do so.  I cannot understand how a local authority has control over the sale of a house, but has none over anti-social behaviour that occurs in it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 36, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;aged over 14 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I support the provision dealing with excluding orders, but it does not state an age limit.  We are handing over control on this area to a judge in court.  We would probably criticise a judge if, following the passing of this Bill, he were to issue an excluding order against a 15 year old or decide not to issue one against an 18 year old.  Regardless of where we decide to set the limit some people will disagree with it.  We will fail in our duty if we do not give the courts an indication of what we consider an appropriate or minimum age, otherwise we will pass the Bill with this broad provision which can be widely interpreted. I accept people will have different views on this. I do not recommend that we evict 12 year olds, 14 year olds or 18 year olds, although youths aged 12 upwards can be the terrors of some estates, but by not setting an age limit we are not giving a guideline to the courts.  We should include a minimum age to provide that, say, a 14 year old or a 16 year old should only be evicted in exceptional circumstances.  The legislation allows a judge discretion to evict a five year old.  We are failing in our responsibility if we do not indicate our thinking on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised Deputy Ahern retabled these amendments having acknowledged on Committee Stage that he did not know what the appropriate age limit might be.  This is a matter best left for the courts to decide whether it is appropriate to use the excluding order procedure in particular circumstances, including the age of the respondent.  The court would have regard to the need for appropriate support to be given in the case of a young person.  I do not consider it appropriate that persons aged 14 or under should be the subject of excluding orders.  However, if this were inserted in the Bill, it would signal that it would be acceptable to exclude 15 year olds and that is not a message I want to convey.  The inclusion of an age limit would not be the correct approach.  There is a danger that if too high a limit were set it would undermine the effectiveness of the measure and if it were set too low it would put some young people unnecessarily at risk.</P>

      <P>This is an important point.  I wish to refer to a point raised by Deputy Gregory.  The marches to which I referred were major events and involved lighting torches on houses.  That occurred in a large estate, the name of which I do not wish to mention.  It was a serious situation. People behaved in an orderly way, even though the situation was menacing.  It was not in any way related to the march mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to tell us more about that march?  Does he want to tell us about the person involved and if that person was a member of his party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know a great deal about it.  I was told about people being involved in it, but that is hearsay.  We should stick to the facts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern's amendment provides for the inclusion in the Bill of persons aged over 14 years. He tabled his amendment because he wanted to raise this point and have it discussed.  I thank him for tabling it on Report Stage because some Members may not be Members of the committee dealing with the Committee Stage debate and if some of these issues are not discussed in the Chamber most Members will not hear or know of them.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue.  Often drug pushers use 14 year olds to 18 year olds to do their work for them.  Members may have read a recent article in a newspaper which reported that youths in Cork can earn up to £200 a day passing drugs to other children at school.  That is something I am familiar with because we have has the same problem in my constituency where young people are being used to pass on drugs.  They get huge profit margins to do the work.  When I heard of the case in Cork recently it rang bells with me immediately.</P>
      <P>I was involved in a case of a family being evicted by the corporation.  People in the block of flats were very much in favour of that, although they were concerned that some of the children were in the ten to 12 age group.  Two older boys, in the 16 to 18 age group, were involved, not other family members, yet the whole family was evicted.  That is one problem that arises.  The smaller children were attending school and the gardaí and the teachers were helping them. Everybody was trying to help the family and the mother was trying to establish roots in the district.However, the two older boys went to England after the eviction, and one of them has since got into a great deal of difficulty there. When it came to excluding them, the whole family had to be evicted.  The tenancy went, yet the small children were not involved in drugs and everybody, including the gardaí, knew that.</P>
      <P>The question raised by Deputy Ahern is, where does it stop?  How do the authorities decide in such a case, which arises often enough, where parents are not involved but a son or daughter may be?  In those circumstances how does one deal with the exclusion?  It should not be open to a local authority to exclude young children.  There must be other ways of dealing with their case.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, we are leaving it to the courts to decide and that may be the only real solution.  This legislation will help when a problem arises but, as happened in the case I referred to the entire family was evicted, including small children.  They are in greater difficulty than before, although they were not causing any trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> Deputy Ahern's amendment seeks to ensure that children under a certain age are not evicted from accommodation.  Those are the problems that go with introducing an exclusion order mechanism.Once it is known to exist, however, it is a help because people are more likely to take action against offenders.  I appreciate what Deputy Ahern is trying to do.  He does not have any fixation about the age level.  Different age levels are recognised in law, for example, the ages of 7, 11, 14 and 16 are recognised as levels of comprehension whereby the capacity to do wrong is less the younger one is.  There must be a point at which one can say there is little capacity to know what one is doing, for example, below a level of 14 years or below the minimum school leaving age of 15.  We must find some other way of dealing with children under 15.  At present, we leave it to the courts to decide from the age of seven upwards.</P>
    <P>In many respects the courts are used to dealing with cases like this.  As Members of the House we must have a view and must be able to say that if the child being used to pass on drugs is under 12, there must be another remedy for dealing with such cases.  It is a matter for the Minister of State and her advisers to set the age, along with the Attorney General who deals with difficult legal questions and would have a view on this.</P>
    <P>The simplistic view of leaving it up to the courts is not comforting.  When one sees what is happening to small children it is particularly upsetting, especially when they are innocent.  In addition, when the parents are innocent there is a difficult problem.</P>
    <P>The legislation covers cases where an exclusion can be made against an individual, which is a big step forward.  How young should those individuals be?  There must be an age level below which we must find some other way of resolving the problem.  That is what Deputy Ahern is trying to do in these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed.  I had thought that Deputy Woods would throw some light on the march to which I referred.  It is a serious matter involving an unfortunate family.  It is difficult to get a medical priority on Dublin Corporation's housing list.  One has to have a serious medical problem within the family.  For a family to get a medical priority, be given a house and then for a Member of the Dáil to march with others against totally innocent decent people in such unfortunate circumstances, is an absolute disgrace.</P>
      <P>I do not have the full details of the incident but as Deputy Woods seemed to indicate that he did, I thought he might say so.  I emphasise that Deputy Woods is not in any way involved in this. The marches he referred to, and in which he was involved, were community ones against drug dealers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to give the impression I am supporting the Minister of State on everything but, on this occasion at least, I support her.  The exclusion order is a welcome and necessary <Col N="1010" /> initiative.  It is progressive in the sense that one can ensure that where an individual is drug dealing, beating up the neighbours or doing other acts of a major anti-social nature, the corporation or other local authorities can move against that individual and not against the innocent members of the family.  That is a major step forward which I welcome.</P>
    <P>As regards the age issue, I am not sure how a limit could be set.  Deputy Ahern is saying they must be over 14 years.  However, in the unlikely or unusual circumstances that it was a 14 years old, perhaps the local authority could bring that young person to the attention of the court which, in turn, could bring in the health board or another agency to deal with the problem.  This measure would facilitate action to help the young individual and his family.  That is why it is right to leave it to the discretion of the court.  I have seen cases in my own constituency where parents have pleaded with the court not to release their child who has stolen cars and mugged people but to put him into care or a detention centre.  I am sure that was not the Minister's intention but it would help the local authority and the parents to bring a problem to the court's attention.  The court does not have to grant the excluding order, but through the probation service or the health board arrangements could be made to deal with the problem.  I agree with the Minister on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of an exclusion order.  Those of us who work with local authorities are aware of the damage caused by members of some families in housing estates or flat complexes.  It is of enormous benefit if drug pushers are removed from an area.</P>
      <P>I understand why Deputy Ahern is anxious to apply the full rigour of the law at an early age. Most people become addicted to drugs, particularly hard drugs, during their teenage years.  The drug barons target young people who then become drug pushers.  We must look at the implications of excluding people over 14 years of age from their homes.  If they are engaged in anti-social behaviour, this could aggravate it.  The Children Bill ensures that parents take responsibility for the crimes committed by their children. Representations were made by Threshold about young homeless people and people at risk.</P>
      <P>We should leave this issue to the discretion of the courts and other State agencies.  The younger the respondent before the courts, the more State services must be brought into play.  Parental responsibility and home school liaison services are important in these circumstances.  The probation service has responsibilities within the legal framework in relation to young people.  We should leave this section as it is and allow the courts and other State agencies to intervene.</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) the person has refused to participate at pre-tenancy training courses.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to give the local authority additional reasons for refusing a letting by having pre-tenancy training courses or probationary periods.A number of local authorities has insisted that all prospective tenants must do a training course to make them aware of their responsibilities and to introduce them to their neighbours in new estates.  However, if a solicitor takes a case to court, he will win it because local authorities do not have the right to refuse a tenancy on these grounds.  If we are committed to estate management, there should be pre-tenancy training courses and a probationary period, if required. Local authorities believe this should be given legislative effect because it is already happening on a widespread scale.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to support this amendment.  It would be useful to introduce pre-tenancy training courses.  Some housing co-ops, for example, such as NADCO, insist on pre-tenancy training courses.  As a result, tenants work together to keep the blocks of apartments in which they live in good condition.  I have often argued at Dublin City Council, that Dublin Corporation should follow in the footsteps of groups like those housing co-operatives and introduce these courses.  I know the Minister will tell us that there is nothing to stop Dublin Corporation doing that but the fact that it would be in the Bill would be extremely helpful.</P>
      <P>I have argued with Dublin Corporation on numerous occasions about the matter addressed in amendment No. 6.  The idea of a period of probationary tenancy is essential for good estate management because, in many instances, the local authority may not be confident that the person to whom it is giving a flat or house will be suited to that particular dwelling and will live in it like any decent person or family.  The idea of a period of probationary tenancy is necessary and it would be a useful initiative.</P>
      <P>I commend Deputy Ahern for suggesting both of these ideas and trying to have them written into legislation because anybody who has served on a local authority knows that unless such initiatives are written into legislation it is a most laborious, energy draining exercise to have them implemented through a local authority.  I support both amendments wholeheartedly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>If the Minister can do something about this, she should because paragraph (a), which refers to &ldquo;the interest of good estate management&rdquo;, <Col N="1012" /> presumes that tenants have at least had the opportunity of pre-tenancy training.  One cannot impose a responsibility in relation to good estate management unless people have an opportunity to avail of a training course.  We are blue in the face trying to get Dublin Corporation to introduce pre-tenancy training.  If there were such a provision in the Bill, it would ensure that all local authorities would have regular courses for all tenants in new estates in particular.  If it is possible to incorporate such a provision in the Bill at this late stage, I would advise the Minister to do so.  If not, local authorities should be informed that this is what we expect under section 14.</P>

      <P>This is a good amendment which ought to be incorporated in law.  Week after week people come to my clinics wanting to be transferred not because there is anything wrong with their houses or flats but because their neighbours are subjecting them to a reign of terror and they can no longer live in such an environment.  There has been a breakdown of the old system of clearly communicated and observed letting agreements. If this amendment were incorporated into law, it would state in law what ought to be done and it would be made clear to people that if they received a house from a local authority, they would not only have to treat the house in a certain way but they would have to live in a certain kind of culture with their neighbours.  A number of tenants must be schooled in what that culture entails in modern times.  Local authorities will state that they do not have the manpower to do this.  I support the amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.  We can develop it later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>One of my top priorities since appointment as Minister for the Environment in December 1994 has been the reform of local government.  My background is in local government.  I believe in local government and I know its potential.  I see it as an important focus of local inspiration and development.  I believe that local authorities are best positioned to identify and respond to local needs and priorities and to deliver local services to the community.</P>
      <P>This Government also recognises the fundamental role which the local government sector has to play in aiding economic growth and in promoting social well-being and cohesion in society. As public representatives, we are all aware of the extent to which local government touches the day-to-day life of so many people.  It is a fact that the local government sector has expanded significantly in recent years.  It is now big business, having annual expenditure of £2 billion pounds and a staff of 30,000.  But is it operating as efficiently and effectively as possible?  Is it meeting the demands of its consumers?</P>
      <P>While I believe in the strength and potential of the local government sector, I am equally aware of the problems and challenges which that sector has faced over the years.  If effective action is not taken immediately to tackle the difficulties facing local authorities, the problems will continue and, in fact, multiply, resulting in serious consequences for the future of the local government system.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the specifics of the Bill, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the significant strides which the local government sector has already taken to make itself more efficient and customer oriented.  Local government councillors, management and staff are working extremely hard to provide the public with the services they expect.  However, we now need to build upon this hard work if local government is to meet the challenges of the next millennium.  As I see it, local government has not been empowered in the past to develop to its full potential. However, this is now being tackled once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last December, the Government launched a major new programme entitled <i>Better Local Government &mdash; A Programme for Change</i>.  This document sets down a series of policy decisions for the reform of local government.  It is the single <Col N="1014" /> most important local government reform measure in a long time.  Its objective is to build a new local government which is stronger, sharper, more powerful and independent.</P>
    <P>Central to this strategy is the provision of a proper system of funding for local authorities.  If local authorities do not have the financial resources to meet the needs of their consumers, then all other reform initiatives, such as the enhancement of local democracy and the widening of participation, would be no more than a meaningless with list.  Local government will not have any real meaning unless there is a direct financial relationship between a local authority and its electorate.  An effective local government, capable of meeting the needs of its customers into the next century, must be provided with the financial wherewithal to do the job we set it.  This is exactly what the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997 will achieve and I am proud to present it to the House.</P>
    <P>The financial difficulties which local authorities have been facing in recent years are clearly evident.The level and quality of services provided by the authorities have been pared back to the bone and, in some cases, services have had to be discontinued.  The decline in the authorities' fortunes is the result of a number of factors.  First, their funding base has become too narrow, particularly since the abolition of domestic rates in 1978.  As a result, there is a little buoyancy.  This problem has been compounded by the fact that the authorities have been continually conferred with new functions, by successive Governments, without sufficient allowance being made for the additional pressure such functions place on their financial resources.  Local authorities were also overly dependent on decisions of central Government for financial resources, never being sure exactly how much rate support grant they would receive from year to year.  This could not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised that immediate and direct action was required.  In the programme, A Government of Renewal, we gave a commitment to commission a professional study on local government funding to see how we could introduce &ldquo;a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding&rdquo;.  I engaged KPMG Management Consulting in 1995 to carry out this work, the focus of which was to set the agenda for change. The study involved extensive consultation with officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and representatives of local authorities. The consultants carried out an in-depth analysis of local authorities' existing and future funding requirements.  They evaluated the capacity of the existing system to meet these requirements.  A wide range of funding options was examined by the consultants, including a local property tax, a local income tax, a local sales tax, a poll tax, a system based on government grants, a system based on charges for services and a system based on assigning some existing taxation to local authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> All of the options examined contained certain advantages and disadvantages.  The conclusion was drawn that there is no obviously correct way to fund local government.  As Minister for the Environment, I was responsible for weighing up the pros and cons of the various options presented and, having regard to existing and future requirements, recommending the most suitable one to Government.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the new arrangements announced in Better Local Government and spelt out in the legislation before the House will provide local authorities with their own viable source of finance to enable them to effectively carry out the range of functions demanded by consumers in a 21st century society.  The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill, 1997, provides for a new system of funding for local authorities under which the power to levy domestic water and sewerage charges is being abolished, the rate support grant is being terminated and the income from these two sources is being replaced by assigning the proceeds of motor tax to local authorities, which will yield a more buoyant and larger amount of finance than the two abolished incomes.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill provides for the introduction of important initiatives to ensure that the best possible use is made of the resources provided to local authorities and that a greater priority will be assigned to efficiency, effectiveness and economy.</P>
    <P>Only a visitor from another planet could escape knowing how contentious the issue of service charges has been during the past decade.  It has bedevilled all efforts to reform local government. With this Bill I am tackling this problem, once and for all.  Section 12 will remove the power of local authorities to levy charges for the supply of water for domestic purposes and for the disposal of domestic sewage, with retrospective effect from 1 January 1997.  In this context, a domestic supply of water means a supply for ordinary household purposes to a dwelling house or to a group water scheme.  It does not mean a supply for commercial, agricultural, industrial or other purposes.  However, lodgings or &ldquo;digs&rdquo; will continue to be regarded as domestic.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record my belief that the concept of charging for services is essentially a good thing.  Charges can encourage efficient use of resources, promote conservation and be linked to environmental policy.  However, a problem arises where the charge has no relation whatsoever to the amount of the service used.  This has been the case in respect of charges for domestic water and sewerage services.  The amount paid for a service should depend on the amount of the service actually used.  This happens with other public utilities such as gas, telephones, etc.  Charges for domestic water and sewerage facilities, on the other hand, were predominantly flat rate charges unrelated to usage.  This flat charge practice created serious inequities in the system.  For <Col N="1016" /> example, it is simply not fair that an individual living in a small one, or two-bedroomed house should have to pay the same amount as a family or a number of people living in a large five or six-bedroomed house.  As charges for domestic water and sewerage services are therefore, in effect, taxes, it was the Government's view that they should be consolidated into general taxation. Under the new arrangements, no household, urban or rural, connected to a public water supply may be levied with a charge for a domestic water supply, with effect from 1 January last.  Any charges levied before that date remain valid and, in fairness to all those who have already paid, I expect local authorities to pursue outstanding amounts with vigour and deal with all outstanding accounts due.  This represents income that is legally collectable.</P>
    <P>Charges will remain for commercial water and sewerage services as users can be charged according to the amount of the service which they actually use.  Refuse charges will also remain as they can be readily related to usage.  A number of local authorities operate a tag system under which a charge per bag is levied.  Refuse charges are also an important tool in upholding the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle which is an integral part of our waste management policy.</P>
    <P>The rate support grant which my Department pays to local authorities is also being terminated with effect from 1 January this year.  However, as an interim arrangement, this grant will continue to be paid until the Bill is enacted.  The income from the rate support grant and domestic water and sewerage charges is being replaced by the assignment, under section 3, of the full proceeds of motor tax revenue to local authorities.  This will give the authorities full and sole ownership of the entire proceeds of a single tax.  It is a unique development which will ring fence a buoyant source of income for the benefit of local government.As a result, a direct financial relationship is being established between the authorities and their electorate.  I wish to make one point perfectly clear.  These proposals do not involve any new taxation but a change of arrangements in relation to an existing tax which, instead of being transferred to the Department of Finance, will be collected by local authorities.</P>
    <P>There are a number of basic reasons for using motor tax to fund local government.  Motor tax is an extremely buoyant source of income.  KPMG identified a lack of buoyancy as one of the main weaknesses of the existing system.  However, the proof is that between 1991 and 1995 the vehicle fleet increased by 14 per cent.  In addition, 1996 was a bumper year for car sales and early indications are that 1997 will be just as good.  This is simply an effect of Ireland's buoyant economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will return to the measure before the House.  Based on the 1996 Estimates, the income from motor tax for that year exceeded the combined income from domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant by approximately £12 million.  I am sure Deputies will agree it is only fair that local authorities should be able to share in the current economic boom, given that it is they who provide vehicle owners with essential road and traffic services.</P>
      <P>The second reason for using motor tax income for this purpose is that it is a practical proposal, relatively simple to operate and another criterion set out in the KPMG report.  Local authorities are already collecting the tax on behalf of the Exchequer, providing them not only with their own buoyant and locally-collected source of income but one which will be independent and fully protected by legislation, giving them great confidence and ability to plan and develop their services with the kind of financial stability they have sought for years.</P>
      <P>One of the central and most innovative aspects of the new funding arrangements is the establishment of an equalisation system.  Over the past 20 years local authorities were allocated an annual rate support grant on the basis of across-the-board incremental increases on their previous year's allocation irrespective of the relative needs and resources of each authority, something with which I am sure all parties in the House agree, irrespective of the efficiency and effectiveness of the local authority concerned.  While in general all local authorities share the same pool of functions, each has a different pool of resources and a different range of expenditure requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of motor tax collected by different local authorities will vary from the income levels generated by the existing funding system of domestic water and sewerage charges and the rate support grant.  In some cases, the differences in amounts may be quite significant, as some authorities have more vehicles registered and licensed with them than others, and not all local authorities collect motor tax.  All these factors make it clear that a mechanism must be put in place to provide for a transfer of resources so that each <Col N="1018" /> and every local authority will benefit from the changes.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for the establishment of a fund, to be known as the equalisation fund, which will be used to effect a transfer of resources. Section 5 specifies the manner in which the equalisation fund will be financed.  Local authorities will be required to pay into the fund 20 per cent of the amount of tax collected on cars and motorcycles in addition to all other motor taxes, driver licences fees and other miscellaneous fees and duties.  The retention rate of 80 per cent of motor tax income from cars and motorcycles was the optimum proportion to follow the guiding principle that local authorities should retain the maximum amounts possible of motor tax income collected by them.  At the same time, I had to be conscious of the need to make sufficient resources available to the equalisation fund to make good the rate support grant and income from domestic water and sewerage charges fore-gone by all local authorities and to share equally the buoyancy built into this new system.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the purposes for which moneys may be paid out of the equalisation fund. These purposes may include contributions towards the expenditure of local authorities in performing their functions generally, payments in respect of any expenses incurred in promoting the delivery of quality and efficient local authority services and in respect of expenses incurred in connection with the collection of motor tax.  In 1997 the resources of the fund will be disbursed among local authorities, in the first instance, to replace the income lost through the abolition of service charges and the rate support grant, the balance to be allocated as equitably as possible having regard to the needs and resources of each local authority.  I reiterate that no local authority will lose out under the new system; in fact all local authorities will benefit.  The size of the motor tax pool and its inbuilt buoyancy will be the guarantor of that.  Section 6 also provides for the establishment of a committee, which may include local authority officials, to advise the Minister on payments to local authorities from the fund.</P>
    <P>Initially the fund will be managed and controlled by the Minister for the Environment.  As I indicated in replying to parliamentary questions, I see this as a short-term measure.  In effect motor tax is now local authority money and, as such, local authorities should have a major say in how it is disbursed.  To achieve this objective, section 7 provides for the establishment, by order, of a council, to be known as the Local Government (Equalisation) Council to manage the fund and decide allocation of payments from it, in addition to any other functions which may be allocated to this new council.  It is my intention that the proposed Equalisation Council be established some time next year.  This year we will allocate the money simply on the basis of ensuring that everybody is a winner but, in future, I want a mechanism, separate from the Departments of the Environment and Finance, whereby local authority <Col N="1019" /> officials, representatives of the General Council of County Councils and municipal authorities and management, make decisions about payments from the equalisation fund in accordance with need and merit and fund good initiatives within the overall local government system.</P>
    <P>It is important for both the concept and practice of local democracy that local authorities should have a measure of discretion over their funding system to enable them to apply the income generated directly to the improvement of local facilities, such as the roads system.  The ability to vary the rate of local tax, therefore, is essential if local authorities are to be empowered to respond to local circumstances, if they are to have real power to govern locally and, ultimately, be judged by the electorate on their stewardship. As a result, while the national rates of motor tax will continue to be set centrally, section 9 provides motor tax authorities with the power, from next year, to increase the national rates of taxation on cars and motorcycles by up to 6 per cent, subject to a maximum of 3 per cent next year. This 6 per cent is the limit to the increase above the national rate.  In essence, it will be possible for local authorities to increase the rate by 3 per cent next year and the following year but, thereafter, no more unless the base national rate is moved by central government.  This section also provides for consultation between county councils and urban district councils and between individual local authorities, where one collects on behalf of another on foot of an agreement, in relation to the extent of any variation in rates. The addition of a local variation element strikes a balance between the need to give a measure of autonomy to local authorities and the requirement not to impose any significant new forms of taxation.</P>
    <P>Because motor tax authorities operate at county or city level only, there is a need to ensure that all local authorities enjoy the benefits of the new funding system and that the tax retained by the motor tax authorities &mdash; that is, tax not paid into the equalisation fund &mdash; is shared on an equitable basis among the boroughs, urban district councils and towns in their functional areas. Similarly, arrangements need to be put in place to ensure an equitable sharing where one county or city authority collects on behalf of another. These requirements are met in section 10 which provides for sharing retained motor tax between all authorities and empowers the Minister for the Environment, or as the case may be, the equalisation council, when established, to give directions to the motor tax authorities on how the tax should be shared.  Thus, all authorities will have a legal right to their fair share of the proceeds. There will be a legal onus on motor tax authorities to apportion the income as lawfully directed.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 local authorities will be permitted to deduct, in accordance with a relevant direction, the expenses incurred by them in collecting <Col N="1020" /> motor tax before paying residual sums into the equalisation fund and sharing the moneys collected among other local authorities.</P>
    <P>The issue of local government funding is but one of a number of reform measures contained in &ldquo;Better Local Government&rdquo;.  Part of this strategy involves encouraging local authorities to improve the manner in which they operate.  In particular, I want local authorities to have greater regard to the important principles of efficiency, effectiveness and economy, each and every day, in all their activities.</P>
    <P>While it is essential that local government is provided with the resources it needs to do its job properly, it must also be seen to make the best use of those resources on a sound, business-like basis.  Therefore, this Bill has a second major objective, which is putting in place a series of measures designed to ensure that local government realises the best return from this proposed new funding system.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a whole new emphasis on effective use of resources; in particular, the value-for-money unit established in my Department in 1993 has undertaken a number of studies.  Section 14 formally establishes the unit within my Department on a legal basis and provides for its role and functions.  In keeping with the spirit of openness inherent in &ldquo;Better Local Government&rdquo;, the unit will be required to publish full details of the results of its work.  Section 15 provides that, in addition to the normal regulatory audits, from now on local authorities will be subject to value-for-money audits similar to those currently being carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>The unit will undertake more comprehensive and in-depth analyses of a wider range of local authority activities than heretofore which will assist local authorities in using resources optimally in the delivery of their services and improving the manner in which they are managed generally.</P>
    <P>Section 17 aims to address a serious anomaly in existing legislation which has continued since 1993 and which, in spite of an amendment in 1995 and action in the courts, has not been successfully rectified.  I refer to section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, under which liability for licensing and payment of motor tax arises from the date of registration of a vehicle in the State.  A number of clear anomalous cases have arisen, where the vehicle was never on the road, yet the individual concerned, through no fault of theirs, paid arrears in addition to the cost of a tax disc.  The amendment proposed in this Bill will ensure that motor tax is payable only when the vehicle is first used in a public place provided the individual, on or before the application for a road disc, produces evidence that the vehicle was not so used.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important one, well-thought out and comprehensive in its impact and intent.  It will provide local authorities with a proper source of finance to enable them to properly undertake the range of functions for which they are responsible, <Col N="1021" /> and it will require them to make the best use possible of the new resource being made available to them.  Resources and accountability go hand in hand if the taxpayer is to be confident the best return is being obtained from taxes.  As a result of these measures, local authorities are being provided with a solid financial basis to enable them realise their true potential and meet the requirements of their customers as we approach the new millennium.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>With regard to a question I raised on the Order of Business on 22 October 1996, regarding the classification of the film <i>Michael Collins</i> it has recently been brought to my attention that the question I asked might be construed as casting aspersions on the professional integrity of the film censor, Mr. Sheamus Smith and his office.  I did not intend to cast any such aspersion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone to great lengths to explain the significance and importance of this Bill.  It is significant, not for the reasons the Minister has outlined, but because it represents a new low in policymaking and politics and because it is not underlined by any basic ideological or philosophical outlook.  It is merely to enable the taxpayer to underwrite the cost of one Labour seat in Dublin in the next general election.  At £60 million it is an expensive seat.  For mere mortals like ourselves it is not just expensive, the price is astronomical.  However, for the Labour Party no price is too high for the privilege of having one more Labour Deputy in the House following the next general election.</P>

      <P>Within weeks, members of group water schemes let the Minister know exactly how they felt about this matter.  At the end of January he made a second attempt to resolve the problem with group water schemes but failed.  On the third more recent attempt he managed to placate the members of group water schemes.  While the federation of group water schemes has accepted the latest offer, it is clear what the Minister did and the way he approached the problem left a sour taste in the mouths of <Col N="1022" /> people in rural Ireland and one they will not easily forget.</P>
      <P>In playing to a specific electorate the Government showed how completely out of touch it is with the ordinary people and the contempt in which it holds certain sections of the population. The silver lining in this cloud showed the electorate the danger of allowing left dominated Governments remain in place for a full five year period.  It showed also the danger of allowing two parties, who represent a minority of the electorate, into a position where they control and dominate the Government.</P>
      <P>In the past Fianna Fáil has been pejoratively described as a catch-all party.  It is a broad based party which draws its support from right across the community, from all creeds and classes and all social strata.  It would not have put itself or allowed anybody else to put it in a position where, by pandering to one section of the community, it deliberately treated another section unjustly.  That is what happened in this case and the people know it.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to convey the impression that this package was carefully thought out but nothing could be further from the truth.  I have already outlined the debacle he caused with group water schemes in rural areas which shows this proposal was not fully thought out.  When I asked the Minister a month after he made his initial announcement, the basis on which he decided on the 80 per cent retention of motor taxation in each local authority area, he could not answer me.  There was no carefully thought out reason for an 80 per cent to 20 per cent divide. When I asked a question about the basis on which the equalisation money would be distributed there was no definitive answer.</P>

    <P>If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Act into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything <Col N="1023" /> which appears to him or her to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of removing that difficulty, for bringing that provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Act or any other enactment so far as may be necessary or expedient for the purposes aforesaid but no regulations may be made under this subsection.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister serious?  Does he expect the House to give him <i>carte blanche</i> to change not only this Bill but other Acts of the Oireachtas because he has not thought out his proposals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister requests us to give him a period of two years during which he can get this right.  He must be joking.  The people will not give him two years and we will not support that section of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Bill and the Minister's announcement before Christmas will be costly.  Motorists are already paying for his action by meeting the extra costs imposed on diesel and petrol in the budget. Motorists will pay £40 million extra to the Exchequer this year.  Next year, if the Minister is still in office, motorists will undoubtedly pay at least another £8 million in road tax and even more in petrol and diesel increases. There is no escaping the fact that the Government in their half baked approach to this issue and in the solution put forward by the Minister to the problem he created will leave the taxpayer open to a potential liability of over £300 million in subvention payments and grants over the next decade.</P>
      <P>The Minister put forward his proposal to use motor taxation as the source of funding for local authorities as a radical and innovative step which he claimed would put local government on a sound financial footing and allow for buoyancy of revenue.  I do not agree.  We have a basic objection to the principle which the Minister is trying to enshrine in legislation.  It is wrong in principle to ask any sector of the public to finance the provision of general local government services for the entire community.  Local government should not be towed behind the family car as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal will be a major cause of dissension in years to come.  Motorists paying road tax will demand and expect decent roads on which to travel.  If they do not get them, they will use the road tax to vent their anger.  It is clear this <Col N="1024" /> method of raising revenue to fund local authorities is discriminatory and inequitable.  For instance, a family of five with no car utilising many local authority services will contribute nothing to local government under this method of funding.  A couple living in the country who need two cars but utilise fewer services will pay a substantial amount of money to local authorities. Is it fair that car owners should subsidise non car owners?</P>
    <P>In addition, the Bill will allow the Minister to vary the amounts of money paid into the equalisation fund.  He or she, therefore, retains control of the amounts of money available to local authorities under section 5.  Despite declarations of freedom and buoyancy, the central Government stranglehold continues.  The proposals contained in the Bill will not resolve the crisis in local government.  They do not address the basic weakness in local government financing which is the complete lack of discretion for local authorities in deciding on their spending priorities.  That goes to the heart of the malaise in local government. It means that there is no incentive for members to ensure value for money is obtained by and for the taxpayer.  Local people cannot decide on their spending priorities and local government, which should address local needs and aspirations, very often is seen as unresponsive and uncaring.</P>
    <P>What is proposed is simply a handy shift of an administrative nature &mdash; the rates support grant and water charges are replaced by motor taxation.The Minister referred to the financial benefit for local authorities this year because of the increase in the number of cars on the road.  If the Minister is using the figures set out in the 1996 Estimates, it appears that they will benefit substantially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if the figures for output at the end of 1996 or the estimates drawn up by local authorities to provide basic services for the beginning of 1997 are examined, they will not. The evidence so far indicates that they are suffering serious financial difficulties.  A number of local authorities have suffered an income loss of up to 50 per cent in the first three or four months of this year because the Minister's grant has not compensated them.</P>
      <P>I pointed out to the Minister during Question Time that most local authorities collected up to 65 per cent of their water charges in the first three or four months of the year by means of incentives.They are now being penalised.  Recently, he sent out a questionnaire to them inquiring about their financial position at the end of the first quarter.  I have seen the questionnaire and it is a classic example of &ldquo;if you ask the right questions, you will get the right answers&rdquo;.  I am sure he will be able to tell me how wonderfully well the local authorities are doing.</P>

      <P>The cash flow of a number of local authorities has dried up.  They are operating on overdraft or are dipping into capital moneys to stave off financial disaster.  This was not addressed in the questionnaire.  We are cooperating with the passage of the Bill because of this problem which has been created for local government.  Local authorities should not suffer because of the folly of the Government and if the Bill is not enacted, though it is badly flawed, they will suffer.</P>
      <P>The greatest con job is addressed in the explanatory memorandum, not in the Bill.  The Minister announced in December that he proposes to allow local authorities to levy charges for projects not funded under existing funding arrangements.  The reason this proposal is not contained in the Bill is that we are too close to a general election.  This is a fancy way of telling us that he intends to allow local authorities to resume levying charges following a general election or early in 1998.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the Minister was afraid to include this proposal in the Bill but that it is his intention, if returned to office, to come into the House in January 1998 with a Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill to allow local authorities to once more levy charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken in conjunction with sections 3 and 9 of the Bill which give the Minister power to control the amounts of motor taxation retained, it is clear what will happen in years to come.  In future when a Minister needs money he or she will reduce the amounts of motor taxation retained and tell local authorities to raise finance by way of local charges.  No one should be under any illusions, this proposal allows for their reintroduction.  In 1983, when Minister for Local Government, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, amended the Act introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1978 which allowed for the introduction of a rate support grant and placed an onus on local authorities to raise finance by way <Col N="1026" /> of local charges.  That is what the Minister proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy said the proposal was not contained in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of important differences.  Charges will not be levied on those availing of water and sewerage services only but on all households, perhaps on each person in a household.  From the way it is described in the explanatory memorandum, it sounds very much like a community charge.  It is known in the United Kingdom as a poll tax.  I warn the electorate that that is at the back of the proposed changes.  That is the depth of his commitment to abolishing charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is painful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of local authority financing which must be addressed and is totally ignored in the Bill is the abuse of local government by central Government Departments.This takes the form of imposing legal obligations on local government through laws or regulations without providing the necessary finance to enable local authorities to carry out particular functions.  The biggest offenders are the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; Justice; Social Welfare and Education.</P>
      <P>Local Government should be seen and used occasionally as an arm of central Government.  It should not be used, however, as a means of avoiding the full costs of the policies of central Government.All services provided by local government for central Government on an agency basis should be fully paid for by the relevant Departments promptly.  Reductions in rent and other charges granted on grounds of social hardship by local authorities should be reimbursed fully by the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The one aspect of the Bill which I welcome unreservedly is the introduction of value for money audits.  I hope the Minister intends to ensure they are published and made available to the public.  It is vital this is done as the public has a right to know how well or badly its money is spent in comparison to other local authorities. There is nothing wrong with the principle of publishing a league table showing how efficient various local authorities are.  It is only when this is done that we will begin to get value for money.  I hope audits will be conducted independently and provide all the facts and figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On local government reform about which the Minister has spoken much during the past few years, the document Better Local Government &mdash; the purple book as the Minister refers to it &mdash; is useful as a basis for significantly advancing the cause of local government.  The Bill should give a clear indication that central Government is at last relinquishing its stranglehold on local government.Sadly, it fails to do so.  Local Government <Col N="1027" /> and local democracy are not advanced one whit by the Bill.  It is a wasted opportunity.  Local government and local democracy will benefit significantly, however, within a few months following the return of Fianna Fáil to Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The history of the funding of local authorities has been a sad one riven by political cynicism.  We have before us, on the eve of the 1997 general election, badly thought out legislation.It is a blatant example of &ldquo;vote now, pay later&rdquo; politics.</P>
      <P>I support the principle that taxes paid locally should be retained locally.  That principle gives the Bill some merit.  My party and I have long advocated that motor taxation should be retained locally and spent at local level.  It was always our intention, however, that a proportion of these moneys would go directly towards improving road quality and road safety.  We felt that was the least that should be done to ensure an element of fair play for motorists.</P>
      <P>Irish motorists are the most highly taxed and poorly served motorists in Europe.  They pay in excess of £2 billion annually for the privilege of driving on some of Europe's worst roads.  I refer in particular to county roads.  Bord Fáilte's research shows that poor road surfaces and sign-posting are key areas when holiday makers express dissatisfaction with their holiday in Ireland.  American tourists, many of whom choose not to revisit Ireland, make a point of highlighting their dissatisfaction with the poor quality of our roads, directional signs and road safety signs.  If these are bad for tourists they are equally bad for us.</P>
      <P>More than 450 people are killed on the roads every year.  This ought to be a cause of serious national concern, yet the Government has taken no effective action to tackle the problem.  It has been established that the upgrading of road safety mechanisms and the effective enforcement of speed limits bring about a major reduction in the death toll on roads.  For example, it has been demonstrated in Britain that a significant upgrading of road markings and signs results in a dramatic reduction in the number of road accidents and deaths.</P>
      <P>My party has argued for some time that a percentage of the money collected by way of road tax ought to be spent on the rigorous enforcement of speed limits and the upgrading of road safety measures.  A reduction in the number of accidents would lead to a consequent reduction in insurance costs for motorists.  The most important aspect in all this is the human cost in terms of lives lost and the grief suffered by families as a result of the slaughter on roads.  While one cannot quantify this, it cannot be ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in one of today's newspapers that the NRA estimates that outstanding and unpaid road tax amounts to £7.4 million.  It would pay the Government to deploy a full time Garda squad on the enforcement of speed limits, the promotion <Col N="1028" /> of road safety and the apprehension of motorists who have not paid their tax.  This is the least we should do.  A percentage of the funding collected by way of road tax ought to be used for this very good and essential purpose.  The Minister referred to the cost of services.  If a percentage of the money collected by way of road tax was used to improve road safety and road surfaces this would support the principle enunciated by the Minister but which he does not seem to want to put into practice.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the legislation for motorists are very real.  The cost of road tax is set to increase by 3 per cent next year and by 6 per cent thereafter.  However, the consequences for the environment could be much more serious.  The Minister referred to buoyancy in the coming years.  Clearly his plan is for more cars, more traffic, more congestion, more gridlock and more pollution.  This is a reckless position for a politician charged with responsibility for environmental protection.  Last week the Minister published a fine document on sustainable development. However, the gap between the proposals in that report and the action proposed in the Bill is very wide.</P>

      <P>The decision to give all households treated water in unlimited quantities free of charge for all time is an act of gross environmental vandalism.  Water is an expensive and priceless resource which needs to be valued, protected and conserved into the next generation.  It costs large sums of money to abstract raw water, treat it, pipe it and deliver it to all households.  It also costs money to treat the waste water which exists from households after use.  These costs are set to increase substantially in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> EU directives are already compelling us to clean up our act.  We cannot continue to run raw sewage into our rivers, lakes, bays and harbours. We will be required by Europe to put in place a number of expensive waste water treatment plants.  These plants cost much money.  The energy and expert labour costs are high and the chemicals are expensive.  Ireland needs substantial EU funding in the coming years to enable it to meet these costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's action on water charges has put further EU funding at grave risk.  The entire thrust of European environmental policy for water management is clear.  The EU favours charges for water in order to conserve supplies. The decision by the Irish Government last December to abolish water charges sets Ireland on a totally different course from the rest of the EU and puts us in direct conflict with the thrust of European policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Water is a scarce resource.  The conservation of water ought to be the cornerstone of Government policy, particularly the policy as enunciated by the Department of the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Economic growth and industrial expansion mean the demand for water will grow rapidly in the years immediately ahead.  In the greater Dublin area, there is a real danger that demand could outstrip supply unless conservation measures are taken.  The water problem in Dublin is now very serious.  Forty per cent of Dublin's supply is lost before it reaches the taps due to leaking pipes.  Supply problems mean that householders in Dublin county and Kildare are now experiencing severe loss of pressure in their water supplies.  Could anybody argue that in such circumstances water should be made available free of charge in unlimited quantities to every household?</P>
      <P>The Government's decision to abolish water charges is an act of gross irresponsibility in both environmental and economic terms.  The expert advice available to the Minister for the Environment is that water cannot be supplied free.  The decision to abolish water charges will be a costly exercise for taxpayers in the years ahead.  Statements by the Minister for the Environment indicate that over the next ten years the cost will be approximately £1 billion.  This includes the special measures for those on rural water schemes.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Tánaiste, did not command public support because it was unfair on several grounds and aroused widespread public resentment.The charges were not related to the amount of water consumed, so they had no conservation or environmental effect.  The level of charge differed greatly from one county to another.  Families living on different sides of the same road paid a different rate.  Some local authorities decided not to levy any charge, specifically Dublin.  The system put in place by another Labour Minister was grossly unfair, badly thought out and in need of radical reform.</P>
      <P>The correct course of action for this Minister would have been to replace the outgoing charges with a system that was fair and based on conservation principles.  The idea of paying for water out of car tax is totally unsustainable.  European Union environmental policy will push this country inevitably towards the introduction of water metering over the next ten years.  Accordingly, instead of abolishing water charges, this Minister should have begun to prepare this country for a new system to enable it to implement an EU directive on water policy between the years 2001 and 2010.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats favour metered usage, with each home fitted with water meters; making a basic water allowance for each household which would be free of charge; a rate of tariff on usage above that basic allowance; and a waiver system for those not in a position to pay. This kind of charging system would be designed to encourage conservation and discourage wasteful usage.  It would also have to be made transparently clear that moneys raised from water charges should be used exclusively to fund the running costs of the system and to pay for improvements in quality and customer service. The Progressive Democrats do not favour a reintroduction of the old, discredited service charge system.</P>

      <P>Meters are already installed in houses that are 100 per cent funded by the Minister's Department in public estates in Bray, Longford town and elsewhere.  A programme of metering local authority houses is well under way under the direction of this rainbow coalition Government.That cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of installing a water meter in a new house is approximately £50.  We estimate that the overall cost of metering all households connected <Col N="1032" /> to the main supply, approximately 750,000, could cost approximately £75 million over ten years.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to water quality. Expert evidence is now available which confirms that the quality of Ireland's drinking water is deteriorating.  Last summer, the public water supply in Roundstone was found to be contaminated and had to be taken out of commission for a number of weeks.  Roundstone is a key tourist resort. At the same time, the town of Nenagh had its water supply disrupted due to industrial pollution.The most recent study carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency indicated that almost 30 per cent of Irish rivers are either slightly or moderately polluted.  Approximately 50 miles of waterway is seriously polluted and this is only the thin end of the wedge.  Matters are set to worsen unless Ireland decides to adopt the EU draft directive on water policy.  Signing up to that directive could mean we will continue to qualify for further significant allocations of EU funding to enable us to finance improvements in our water quality and in our water and sewerage infrastructure in the next ten years.  It must be recognised that it is in Ireland's interest, in environmental and economic terms, to adopt the terms of the EU draft directive on water policy.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are committed to a systematic policy of water management and conservation.We owe it to the next generation to pass on clean water for drinking, recreational and amenity purposes and history will condemn us if we are too politically cowardly to take the necessary steps now to ensure that happens.</P>
      <P>There are a number of elements in this Bill that my party and I will seek to amend significantly on Committee Stage.  However, there is a section to which I can give my total support.  That is the one that requires local authorities to institute a value-for-money audit system.  Local authorities have been allowed to run down for many years.  The net result has been that the public estimation of local authorities and the standard and quality of the services they give is not always high.  It is important, in the context of even this feeble attempt to put some funding in place for local authorities, that we should seek to put in place value-for-money audits which would be independently verified.  We have a critical public, and they need to be reassured they are getting value for money.  As well as being critical, the public are fair-minded and are prepared to pay if it can be demonstrated that they get value in return for the money they have paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of local government services has gone down in recent times.  In my city the quality of the footpaths of the city streets, has gone down.  The level of cleansing and sweeping is not as good as it ought to be, and there is no money to properly service existing litter bins or to provide <Col N="1033" /> new ones.  This has put local authorities in the position where they do not stand high in the public estimation.  It is important, therefore, to put a number of fundamental changes in place as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>One of the first things local authorities have to do is to change their culture in regard to customer services.  Central Government Departments are often more accessible than some departments in local authorities and that should not be the case. Local government should be close to its people, responsive to their needs and its service should be customer friendly.  Every local authority should be required to adopt some kind of quality make or an ISO 9002 in respect of all its operations.Wexford County Council has adopted that practice in respect of one element of its operations, and that is to its credit.  If it can be done in Wexford, it can be done elsewhere.  If that were done the general public would be willing to pay more for local services, particularly if the charge was related to the cost and value of the service. The quality of the local services we get very much determine our quality of life.  If our streets are clean and fresh, if our parks are well tended, if our library shelves are stocked, if there is a good public lighting system and the footpaths we walk on are safe and in good repair, we live in a good environment and the quality of our life is good. If the situation happens to be the opposite, as it so often is, we are living in a poor environment and are sour about paying because we see no great return for what we pay.  I support the section of the Bill wherein it is sought to address these matters.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I support the principle of taxes raised locally being spent locally.  I also support the principle of putting in place a dedicated sum, clearly defined and ring-fenced, to enable local authorities to fund their functions.  However, there are a number of elements of this Bill that I find fundamentally unacceptable and which I will seek to change by way of amendment on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, about the political expediency of the manner in which the Minister dealt with the abolition of water charges.  As Deputy Dempsey said, this was an effort by the Labour Party to try to reduce the number of seats they will lose in the next election.  It is fair to ask whether water charges would have been abolished if there had not been a by-election in Dublin West.  The answer is very definitely &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  On 19 December, in a knee-jerk reaction and without prior consultation with the European Commission, the Minister made a very badly thought out decision.  It surprised me to be told in answer to a question that neither the Minister nor his officials had consulted the European Commission before he took this decision.</P>

      <P>In a statement regarding a major overhaul of local government and its financing, the Minister announced the abolition of water charges and did not refer to the 150,000 households that depend on group water schemes for their supply.  The only desirable effect of the decision and the manner in which the Minister made it was that it created the National Federation on Group Water Schemes.  This is advantageous because the Minister and the two left-wing parties in Government do not appreciate the contribution of rural communities in providing water for themselves and in making a major contribution to the economic and social life of rural Ireland.  In future the federation, in partnership with the Government and the local authorities will have a worthwhile contribution to make in upgrading group water schemes and improving the quality of water and bringing it up to European Union standard.</P>
      <P>The Minister met the federation but, although on two occasions he tried to dig himself out of the hole he had created for himself, he still did not satisfy the federation on at least one point. That was in relation to the question of leaving the responsibility for administering group water schemes with the Department of the Environment in Ballina.  There is no more user friendly section in any Department than the small water and sewerage schemes section of the Department in Ballina.  Although I favour devolution to local authorities, I agree with the federation that the administration of this service should be left in Ballina.  The four officials who administer the scheme there do an excellent job.  My information from my constituents who are involved in group water schemes is that they are extremely happy with the service provided.  On the question of giving that responsibility to the local authorities I would ask the Minister to consult the local authorities to find out whether they want that task? Has he provided funding for the local authorities to carry it out?  The Minister may mention the £10 million being provided, but he should know that £15 million would not solve the problem of either of the two counties in my constituency, not to mention the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but it was the Minister who introduced these changes.  Not alone do the local authorities not have funding, they will not have the staff.  How are they to staff this operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Federation of Group Water Schemes has two legitimate concerns about the administration of its schemes being handed over to the local authorities.  One is that local authorities will be in a position to charge farmers whatever they like for a supply of water.  Farmers who receive their water supply through group water schemes could have their rates doubled, trebled or quadrupled to provide funding for <Col N="1035" /> local authorities for other purposes.  The Minister introduced controls in respect of car tax, but failed to introduce any in respect of what local authorities may charge farmers in a group water scheme for the supply of water.  The leader of the other left wing party dominating this Government, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, has made it known on many occasions that he does not like the farmers.  He suggested on one occasion that they wanted a free water supply, when nothing could be further from the truth.  On another occasion he suggested on national radio that farmers were &ldquo;rolling in it&rdquo;.  He does not care what local authorities charge farmers for water.</P>
    <P>Those involved in group water schemes are concerned that local authorities will be in a position to limit the amount of water used.  We spoke on many occasions about the serious consequences of the Minister's decision.  He made two attempts to get out of the difficulty, but the rural community is still not satisfied.  In keeping with the left wing philosophy, the Tánaiste spoke for an hour recently on national television without referring to agriculture and even though people in rural areas were not pleased, they were not surprised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey referred to section 2 and I am pleased he read it into the record.  That section gives the Minister power to drive a coach and four through the legislation.  While I do not agree with its inclusion in the Bill, I compliment those who decided it should be included.  I do not know if it was a colleague in Cabinet or an official who noted the way the Minister handled his decision to abolish water charges and decided he would need the power of such a section to correct the errors he would make.</P>

      <P>The use of car tax by local authorities to subsidise water and sewerage charges is like a three card trick.  The Minister stated that local government will not have real meaning unless there is a direct financial relationship between a local authority and its electorate.  He went on to state the financial difficulties local authorities have faced in recent years are evident. What has the Minister done to improve the financial position of local authorities?</P>

      <P>While the Minister may have clarified the position in regard to the power local authorities will have to raise the motor tax rate, there was a great deal of ambiguity in his statement of 19 December.  He stated that in 1997 domestic water and service charges would be abolished, motor tax would be assigned to local authorities, with no increase in motor tax rates, and the rate support grant would be phased out.  He also stated that in 1998 local authorities will have discretion to vary the national motor tax rate by not more than 3 per cent and in 1999 and subsequent years they will have discretion to vary it by not more than 6 per cent.  Many people perceived that to mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Quill's remarks, the Minister talked about the tax burden when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government.From 1989 to 1992 the high rate of income tax decreased from 52p to 48p and the lower rate decreased from 35p to 28p.  In the three budgets the Minister's colleague introduced on behalf of a Government dominated by two left wing parties, the lower rate of income tax was reduced by one penny.  The Minister should compare the two three year periods.  There were reductions of 4p and 7p in the higher and lower rates, respectively, in a three year period when we were in Government compared with a reduction of one penny in the three years the Government has been in <Col N="1037" /> power.  The Minister failed to mention that the tax burden has increased during this Government's term in office.</P>
    <P>The Minister might elaborate on the section of the Bill which gives discretion to local authorities to raise a local development contribution.  Will he state if that will be a reserve function of councillors or whether, as a Labour predecessor of his did, he will give the authority to a county manager overriding the power of local authority members?  Who will have the discretion in that regard?  Will he elaborate on where he considers this local authority funding will be raised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  It is appropriate that the Government is abolishing them, although it does not seem to know what it is doing, given that this is the second Bill it introduced on this matter in the past two and a half years.  All the talk of a cohesive Government that knows what it is doing does not seem to hold true in this case.  This decision was prompted by the Dublin West by-election.  Labour Party people seemed to be terrified by Councillor Joe Higgins. I have not attended Labour Party back room meetings, but when I talked to any of the Minister's colleagues I found them to be irrational about that man.  It is obviously worth the £60 million, which Deputy Dempsey said this measure will cost, for the Minister not to see the ghost of that man lurking around this House.</P>
      <P>I am a member of Dublin Corporation which abolished water charges in 1986 when Deputy Bertie Ahern was our group leader.  Water charges have not been in place in that local authority area for 11 years and this measure will not make Government Deputies, who are members of Dublin Corporation, popular.  My constituents in Dublin North West will have to pay an additional amount in car tax next year which they have not had to pay for the past 11 years.  I am sure in a few weeks' time when we will be knocking on doors the people will be thanking Deputies Shortall and Flaherty and the Minister, Deputy De Rossa for the new charge the Minister has imposed to save himself from the ghost of Councillor Higgins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but local authorities have to survive and if they cannot get money from one source they must get it from another.  In my area the main problem is water pressure, not water charges.  People would not mind paying a few bob for good water pressure. <Col N="1038" /> People may be spoiled in Dublin, but they like to have water in the tap.  A global 3 per cent or 5 per cent cut in water pressure does not mean a 5 per cent cut in pressure for everyone, a person living on the top of a hill may not have any water. That has been the main problem down through the years.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not be thanked for introducing this legislation in Dublin city because people will have to pay extra money for it.  The Minister referred to the figure of 3 per cent, but I wonder if he is living in a dream world and if, in a few years, that figure will be considerably increased. The Minister said that local authorities will not lose out and that each one will benefit from this measure.  He should explain that to his party colleagues who are members of Dublin local authorities and to their officials.  They perceive this measure represents an anti-Dublin bias.  In Dublin that bias is located in the Department of the Environment and has been there for some time. That has not changed under this Government. The perception is that the Minister has fiddled again.</P>

      <P>The Minister will probably have to employ ten times as many people in each county as are there are at present to organise group water schemes.  Surely the people who organised them for the past number of years will not continue to do so.  Members of group water schemes have got permission from landowners to run schemes through a number of fields.  I know of a group water scheme where the forestry is growing on top of the pipes.  This measure is probably welcome to a number of people, but we had a fair waiver scheme for people who could not afford to pay for water or service charges. Since the Minister's leader introduced water charges local authorities in Sligo were not afraid to introduce them because they were short of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My local authority imposes refuse collection and sewerage charges.  I cannot see why any person should be given an unlimited free supply of water.  Our party supports the Minister, but coming from rural Ireland I can remember the day I <Col N="1040" /> went to the well for a bucket of water before we had electricity.  While I was happy to bring water from the well I was delighted when we got tap water through a group water scheme.</P>
    <P>A former Member of this House, the late Neil Blaney, was the first Minister for the Environment to introduce group water schemes.  He did an excellent job for everybody and I pay tribute to him.  Running water in any part of the country is of great benefit.  The Minister will now increase motor taxation to pay for this.  I listened with interest to other speakers, particularly to Deputy Quill, who made an excellent contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and our spokesperson, Deputy Dempsey.  Deputy Quill spoke about the roads and employing gardaí to try to reduce the number of road deaths, currently running at over 400 per year.  In County Sligo we do not have enough money to cut the bushes along our county roads.  We are writing to farmers asking them to cut the bushes themselves.  That is the way the county's finances are.  Income from motor taxation in our county will not pay for the roads because it has not a very large population.  My neighbouring county is Leitrim, which has the smallest number of registered vehicles in the country.  How will that county be subsidised?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it comes for them.  One must compare the number of cars in Dublin and the number in County Sligo with the amount of taxation the Minister is taking in.  Heretofore motor taxation receipts went towards the upkeep of national primary roads.  When Deputy Connaughton was a junior Minister in a Government that doubled the national debt we had to get our Minister, Deputy MacSharry, with the support of Deputy Dukes for a minority Fianna Fáil Government, to put this country right.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dempsey criticised section 2 (3) of the Bill which enables the Minister to make regulations.He described it as something unique, fundamentally flawed and possibly unconstitutional. I will give some examples of very similar provisions which have been enacted.  They are to be found in section 52 (3) of the Local Government Act, 1991 &mdash; I wonder who the Minister for Local Government was in 1991?  &mdash; section 3 (7) of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 and section 66 of the Local Government Act, 1994.  It is a standard provision in most local government Acts.  There is nothing sinister, unconstitutional, shaky or doubtful about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey also complained about the use of motor tax to fund local government.He said it was the wrong way to finance local government.  Is it not a suitable mechanism? It is a fund that is collected by local government locally so that local people &mdash; paying a tax that has not increased in any shape or form, and that can be increased next year by 3 per cent at the exclusive discretion of the local authority &mdash; can have access to that money immediately, 80 per cent for their own purposes and 20 per cent to go into an equalisation fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot take total credit for inventing it because it has been put forward at fora throughout the country by councillors and practitioners.  The most heartening thing about the entire package is the positive feeling it has engendered in local authority members and officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened by the Fianna Fáil policy document which mirrors the path I <Col N="1044" /> mapped out for local government on a range of issues.  That is valuable because it shows political consensus.  We differ on the funding mechanism and on breaking up the Department of the Environment.European experience shows that establishing a Department of Environmental Protection without a budget is not the correct way to proceed.  I urge Deputy Dempsey to rethink his proposal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quill made valuable points about road safety.  It is depressing to see the number of road deaths each week.  Last weekend alone six people, including three young people, lost their lives.  We have introduced a range of measures to tackle this problem.  The new regime of on-the-spot fines and unmarked Garda speed cars is having a big impact, although it takes time to change practices. I am deeply concerned about the carnage on our roads.</P>
      <P>As regards investing money in roads, no Government in the history of the State has recognised the need to address substandard non-national roads more than this Government.  This year we will spend £173 million of taxpayers' money on roads.  That will be matched by local authorities which will provide £70 million.  For those who think I do not support rural Ireland, a staggering £0.25 billion will be spent on non-national roads &mdash; an unthinkable sum a few years ago.  Some 10,000 miles of non-national roads will be resurfaced this year.  Last year I asked local authorities to draw up a five year programme. Not only will we complete the entire 1997 road programme with the money I have allocated this year, but we will also do 40 per cent of next year's allocated road resurfacing before the end of the year.  We are bringing the roads of rural Ireland up to the standard the people demand and deserve.</P>
      <P>My record and that of the Government is second to none in terms of supporting rural communities, improving rural roads and establishing group water schemes.  I more than doubled the rate available to Deputy Matt Brennan's group water scheme and every other group water scheme and more than tripled the rate of support to group sewerage schemes in acknowledgement of the needs of rural Ireland.  I represent a rural constituency.</P>

      <P>We have done a remarkable day's work for rural Ireland which will be acknowledged when people there are asked to endorse and re-elect this good Government.  Deputy Dempsey raised the question of the community development contribution.  I want to pick up on that before it develops another life of its own because it took me four occasions to explain the mechanism of increase, that is, 3 per cent on a base, to Deputy O'Hanlon.  He is a very intelligent man and I think he grasped it at the beginning but it did not suit him to admit it.  The community charge is a proposal which came from the Lacey Commission which was endorsed at many of the regional meetings.  It means if a local authority wanted to provide a facility outside its normal remit, a new facility for children, for instance a sports facility or running track, for which it would not have the normal wherewithal to provide, perhaps in conjunction with either a commercial development or a community group which might have access to funding, it would &mdash; after a plebiscite &mdash; be able to levy a charge for that purpose alone on a community.  As I said explicitly in the programme <i>Better Local Government</i>&mdash;<i>A Programme for Change</i>, that good idea will be fleshed out in the new comprehensive legislation which will be enacted to coincide with the centenary of local government next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Education has not turned up but I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The matter I am raising is an important one which pertains to my home town &mdash; that is my declared interest.  A decision was made in September 1996 to amalgamate St. Brigid's national school and St. Joseph's boys' national school and form Scoil Eoghain after two years of complete and utter chaos in the boys' school.</P>
      <P>The boys' school building is very old and in a sad state of disrepair.  For two years there was low morale among the staff, parents, students and even the board of management.  The principal teacher retired early the previous year and it proved almost impossible to find a replacement because of the state of the school building in which the person was expected to work.  People arrived for interview, saw the place and left and the school received national media coverage at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, after lengthy and protracted negotiations, a principal, Mr. Gerard McGeehan, was finally found to replace the previous principal following a year without a principal at the school. He proceeded quickly with the idea of the amalgamation and he worked very hard.  He brought the parents on board.  They thought, as I did, that the Department was on board too.  It had promised <Col N="1050" /> priority action.  It said we should first undertake a modest refurbishment of the boys' school and necessary repairs in the girls' school.  In the longer term, it said it would build four classrooms on the girls' site to create a viable solution for the future.</P>
    <P>The people of Moville, County Donegal, are realistic.  They are not looking for something grand.  They agreed that the modest refurbishment of the boys' school and the repairs to the girls' school were sufficient in the short-term, but this so-called utmost priority will not be even considered in this financial year; it has already been put off until next year.  The school is being provided with a prefabricated classroom in the short-term but the reality is that what was a boys' school is now a boys' and girls' school.  There is only one set of shared toilets, windows are coming loose from their frames and people are concerned about the children's safety.  I could refer to a number of other deficiencies but the Department is aware of the situation and stated that the matter would be given priority.</P>
    <P>The problem is compounded by the fact that the people of Moville believe they are not being given fair treatment with regard to other aspects of this issue.  According to the information I received, Moville is the only parish in north Inishowen which did not receive funding under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  What makes Scoil Eoghan, Moville, with its poor buildings and facilities, more advantaged than the other schools in Inishowen?  It is not high unemployment, the absence of industry, the high percentage of single parent families and broken homes or the poor tradition of community fundraising in the area. Many people in Moville are socially excluded.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative includes ten schools in north Inishowen which are relatively new, well resourced and have active parents' committees.  Those concerned resent the lack of basic facilities in Scoil Eoghan when other schools have obtained additional resources.  This issue centres around the fact that the people of Moville were under the impression that Scoil Eoghan had been given priority in September 1996.  They worked hard to initiate the amalgamation and put a principal in place.  The principal has done a great amount of good work and the parents and the board of management are cooperating with him.  However, he believes the Department has not supported his efforts.</P>
    <P>This is a worthwhile cause.  The people of Moville realise the nature of the situation and are not seeking the immediate construction of a new school.  They accept this is not a priority at present but hope that it will become one in the near future.  They are seeking immediate repairs, not new classrooms, because the circumstances in which their children are obliged to learn must be addressed.  They are demanding that equitable treatment be given to the parents and children of Moville and requesting that immediate funding be made available for refurbishment work.  That <Col N="1051" /> must be done by including Moville in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>I can forward to the Minister of State the letter I received from the principal of Scoil Eoghan, which was co-signed by the chairman of the board of management, outlining the community's strong feelings about this matter.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State took the points raised in the letter on board.  I hope his response to the debate will be positive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline my Department's position regarding Scoil Eoghan, Moville, County Donegal.  As she already stated, in September 1996 St. Joseph's boys' school amalgamated with the Convent of Mercy national school to form Scoil Eoghan.</P>
      <P>The amalgamated school will operate from the two buildings in the short-term.  In the longer term, the proposal is to provide an extension to the existing girls' school to house the amalgamated centre.  It is anticipated enrolments in the schools will decline and a total of eight classrooms will be required on the girls' school site.  The former St. Joseph's school has a current staffing of one principal and five assistants in addition to the services of a shared remedial teacher.  The accommodation at the school consists of four permanent classrooms and a general purpose room.  My Department recently sanctioned a grant towards the provision of a double prefabricated unit to be sited at the boys' national school which will assist in alleviating the short-term accommodation difficulties.</P>
      <P>I understand the school has applied for planning permission for the prefab unit.  The Minister for Education is aware that urgent refurbishment works, at an estimated cost of £50,000, are required at both schools, the majority of the work being necessary at the boys' school.  Funding for these works must be considered in the context of existing contractual commitments and other priority projects.  At present, all available finance is committed on current capital projects and on grants already approved.  The Minister is not in a position at this point to provide immediate funding for the proposed refurbishments at the former St. Joseph's school.  She will, however, keep expenditure on the primary school building programme under review during the year.  In that context, the needs of Scoil Eoghan will be considered at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should put the current financial situation in context.  When the Minister for Education took office in 1993, she was faced with a backlog of 300 urgent major school projects.  These projects accumulated as a result of substantial cuts on the capital funding for primary schools in the period 1988-92.  In the past four years, the Government increased the capital funding of schools significantly and substantial progress has been made in <Col N="1052" /> reducing the backlog.  I accept that more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I will now address the Deputy's interest in having Scoil Eoghan included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The Minister has no proposals to extend disadvantaged area status to additional primary schools.  The scheme was last expanded in 1994 when an additional 54 primary schools were newly included.</P>
    <P>Scoil Eoghan has been an amalgamated school since October 1996.  The amalgamated school is comprised of two schools that were based in the area, namely Scoil Ioseph and St. Brigid's, Moville, County Donegal.  Both schools applied and were considered for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme in 1994.  Unfortunately, when regard was had to the relative levels of need among competing schools, the needs of the individual schools were not considered to be of such priority as to warrant their inclusion on that occasion.  Traditionally, schools have been selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of socio-economic indicators.The indicators in question took account of such factors as levels of unemployment, medical card holding and local authority housing occupancy among the families of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>However, in 1995, the Minister commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre to conduct a detailed review of current approaches to addressing the problem of educational disadvantage.  The Minister's decision to commission this study arose from a concern to ensure that supports were properly targeted and children with real need were in a position to benefit from the scheme.  The criteria used in selecting schools for special support and the nature of the supports provided were among the issues addressed in the study.  Among the key issues raised by the study was a concern that under the current selection criteria, the scheme did not have due regard to rural and dispersed disadvantage.  It was recommended that the criteria used in selecting schools for support be amended to better reflect educational disadvantage as manifested in rural as well as urban settings.</P>
    <P>It was also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  The report considered that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted the present scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.  In response to these findings, the Minister recently launched a new targeted initiative which aims to break the cycle of educational disadvantage in selected urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The operation of the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; initiative is being closely monitored by the Department's inspectorate and the project will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre. <Col N="1053" /> The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for considering future developments in supports for disadvantaged areas.  In the event of any such developments being undertaken, the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>I request that funding be provided to complete the Phoenix Recreation Centre in Carrickmacross, which is a major facility suitable for indoor sports and community events.  In the past, funding was provided by a previous Government and substantial funding has also been raised by the local community.</P>
      <P>Carrickmacross is situated in the Border area. Over the years a great deal of special funding has been provided for the Border region, through INTERREG, special Leader programmes and the International Fund for Ireland but none under the rules, to this centre.</P>
      <P>Following the ceasefire in 1994 the European Union provided peace and reconciliation funding, some of which can be made available through the relevant local authorities for facilities such as that about which I speak in Carrickmacross.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister examine how moneys from that source, from his Department and those collected by the local community can be disbursed to ensure the completion of this facility?  It is very worthy of support.  The nearest town to Carrickmacross is Crossmaglen, only six miles from the Armagh border.  The facility would have a major cross-Border dimension and make a worthwhile contribution to the economic, social and sporting life of a very large community on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister of State will give me an accurate assessment of the position, unlike his Minister two weeks ago when I asked whether she would provide funding to repair a roof on Castleblayney junior school in County Monaghan.Her reply was that she was not in a position to sanction funding for this project at present, that it would have to be considered within the scope of existing contractual commitments and available funds.  She said she would keep expenditure on the primary building programme under review during the year and her Department would contact the school management directly on the matter.  Yet, one week later, she was able to provide £70,000, announced, not by the school but by a Deputy from the Government side of the House.  This is not the way to treat any Member of the House but I know the Minister of State will not adopt such an attitude.</P>

      <P>The Phoenix Club is a necessity for the community of Carrickmacross, which has a very large young population in need of proper facilities to engage in sport and prevent them from becoming involved in other less rewarding or dangerous activities.  Parents and the community at large there are very keen that these facilities be provided.</P>
      <P>One need only cite the case of Rose Lambe who must travel to Monaghan to issue an award to the Patrician High School, located right beside the club, winners of the Junior B all-Ireland final last week, but who have no facilities and the case of St. Louis Secondary School, winners of the Junior A Secondary Basketball Club who cannot play a home game and Inver College, also located right beside the club.  These three major schools want to utilise this very valuable asset.</P>
      <P>At present the club is something of a white elephant.  As Dr. O'Hanlon said, some £250,000 was spent on it, £95,000 of which was Government money.  With approximately £200,000 available in a bank it is absolutely essential that the Minister &mdash; who I know has been in consultation with Monaghan County Council &mdash; produce the remainder.  The danger is that a small amount will be given which would be insufficient to finalise this project.</P>
      <P>The people of Carrickmacross have been awaiting the completion of this club for many years and now depend on the Minister of State and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputies O'Hanlon and Crawford for having raised this matter of the Phoenix Centre in Carrickmacross which affords me an opportunity to explain the position.</P>
      <P>Since the early 1970s, there has been a concerted local effort to provide sporting facilities for the town of Carrickmacross and surrounding areas.  These efforts culminated in a decision in 1986 by the local committee to build a sports hall. My Department was pleased to be in a position to allocate a grant of £100,000 towards this project in 1988 under the national lottery funded sports capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction work began on the sports hall in 1988 and, by 1990, there was a fully enclosed structure, complete with windows and doors, on the site but internal services such as plumbing, heating or lighting had not been provided.  Unfortunately in 1990, due to a number of factors, including lack of funds, work on the building ceased.  At the time my Department had paid a <Col N="1055" /> grant of £95,000.  I am aware the facility, as it stood, was used on occasions by local schools up to 1993 when it closed due to the condition of the building and problems encountered with obtaining insurance cover.</P>
    <P>In 1993 a new local committee was formed which employed consultants to investigate the possibility of developing the building to the extent that it could be used.  The plans and costings prepared show that an amount of £740,000 is needed for completion but that an investment of £500,000 would convert the building into a usable structure.</P>
    <P>The hard working committee has continued to plan and fund-raise for the completion of this sports hall.  I understand it hopes to raise up to £100,000 and has already collected a substantial portion of that amount.  In view of the history of this project, it cannot have been an easy task to have raised that level of funding.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the committee on its commitment and enthusiasm without which the vision of a sports hall in Carrickmacross would have died a long time ago.</P>
    <P>The Committee has been in touch with the sports section of my Department at whose request it contacted the Institute of Leisure and Amenity Management &mdash; known as ILAM &mdash; regarding the operational feasibility of the sports hall in the event that it could be brought into operation.  At the invitation of Deputies Crawford, Boylan and Senator Bill Cotter I visited the site some time ago.  I was impressed with the work already done but noted the derelict, abandoned state of the hall.  Since then I understand that Monaghan County Council has also expressed an interest in the matter and I have had discussions with the county manager.</P>
    <P>We recently requested the committee to undertake a further investigation into the viability of a completed sports hall.  I understand a consultant's report is due to be received very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that even with a very effective local committee, a large investment of public funds will be required if the sports hall is to be brought into use.  Needless to say, it would <Col N="1056" /> be in everyone's interest that, if further work takes place on the building in Carrickmacross, it will result in a sports hall which can operate on a cost-effective basis while meeting the needs of the community it serves.</P>
    <P>The request for additional funding towards Carrickmacross sports hall will be considered under the major facilities scheme.  My Department's sports capital programme comprises more than 140 major projects with total grant allocations amounting to in excess of £40 million.  An amount in the region of £4 million is available for allocation to projects under the major facilities scheme this year.  However, I must point out that demand for funding under this scheme continues to rise with relatively limited funding available for allocation.  Typically, my Department has in hand in excess of 1,000 applications for funding under its sports capital programme at any given time, the overall value of the grant aid requested ranging from amounts of £75 million upwards. Each application is reviewed on its merits in accordance with the criteria of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I assure both Deputies I will give their request every consideration when decisions are being taken on those grant allocations this year.</P>
    <P>The sports strategy group, under the chairmanship of Mr. John Treacy, in its report entitled &ldquo;Targeting Sporting Change in Ireland&rdquo;, launched in February last, sets out a strategic approach to sports in Ireland from 1997 to the year 2000 and beyond and recommends a revised approach to the provision and funding of sports facilities in the future on the basis of the development of a national plan for community facilities and for national and competition facilities.  Work on the development of this plan is now under way.</P>
    <P>In future, any decisions taken will ensure that, whenever allocations are made, projects will be brought to finality.  I very much regret seeing a project like this in its present condition.  I am considering the views of all concerned in the region very seriously and will continue to do so in the weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>The Dail adjourned at 12.20 a.m. until 10.30 a.m., Thursday, 1 May 1997.</P>

      <P>During the period of the IRA ceasefire, the principal obstacle to the launch of inclusive negotiations, at which all parties with a democratic mandate would be present, was, in my view, the existence of a profound lack of trust between many of the prospective participants.  This mistrust came to be focused on the issue of the decommissioning of illegally-held weapons. While there were, no doubt, errors of judgment on all sides during the period, and while some may well have used the arms question for tactical purposes, nevertheless, as the report of the International Body stated, decommissioning, while a serious issue, was also &ldquo;a symptom of a larger problem: the absence of trust&rdquo;.  Moreover, as the body also said, each side of the argument on decommissioning reflected &ldquo;a core of reasonable concern which deserves to be understood and addressed by the other side.&rdquo;  Both Governments are in agreement that the implementation of the International Body's report in all its aspects offers the only practicable basis for the satisfactory resolution of the decommissioning issue, in the context of a meaningful and serious process of negotiations.</P>
      <P>This Government has consistently worked for the achievement through inclusive negotiations of a comprehensive and balanced settlement, and for the complete decommissioning of all illegally held weapons.  When the negotiations resume on 3 June we will continue to pursue those goals.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Dáil on previous occasions, I have had meetings with representatives of the communities and resident groups most directly concerned with the parades issue. I have also discussed the issue on a number of occasions recently with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, including at the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 12 March.  The issue is discussed on an ongoing basis through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the contacts which we maintain with <Col N="1058" /> different groups in Northern Ireland reflect also the very widespread and deep concern at the prospects for this year's marching season.</P>
    <P>Despite the grave damage done to Northern Ireland in terms of confidence in the rule of law, community relations and economic development by the events surrounding Drumcree last year, there appears again the prospect of further confrontation over the marching issue.  Both Governments, responsible leaders and all those in both communities most directly involved must redouble their efforts to avoiding a repetition of the confrontation and disturbances last year.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that avoiding a repetition of the disaster of last year can best be done through local dialogue and agreement, based on mutual respect and the mutual accommodation of the respective rights and heritage of both traditions.</P>
    <P>Courageous steps have been taken by some of those most directly involved to pursue local agreement and genuine progress is being made, however, tentative.  I reiterate that it is the Government's earnest hope that local agreement will yet emerge as a factor to ease tension and point the way forward toward a broader resolution of contentious parades.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes that the recently formed Parades Commission can play a meaningful role in mediating agreements.  The delay in granting it the power to make determinations on contentious parade routes, the core recommendations of the North report, has been disappointing to those, including the Government, who support the implementation of the North recommendations in full.  Unless and until that power is granted to the Commission, it cannot fulfil the roles of education, mediation andarbitration which were envisaged by Sir Peter North and his colleagues as elements of an integrated overall approach.</P>
    <P>Should local agreement fail to resolve certain contentious parades, it is vitally important in those instances that the rule of law is resolutely and impartially upheld.  Only when this occurs can some of the damage done to nationalist confidence in the rule of law by the role of the authorities, including the RUC, at Drumcree last year be repaired.  I will be stressing, in our contacts with the British Government, the importance of ensuring that the rule of law is seen at all times to prevail on this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope to discuss this and other aspects of the marching season with the new Secretary of State for Northern Ireland shortly after the incoming British Government takes office.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the cuts in a number of development budget lines in the European Community budget for 1997.  The cuts made were not exclusive to development, but reflected a rigorous approach to budget discipline in all areas.</P>
      <P>The budget for 1997 does not reflect a clear shift in priorities away from the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa to more developed regions of strategic importance closer to Europe.  The Community development budget seeks to strike a balance between a range of competing and ever-changing needs with limited resources.</P>
      <P>The agreement on the 8th European Development Fund reached at the 1995 Cannes European Summit guarantees funding for the ACP states, including the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, until the expiry of the Fourth Lomé Convention in the year 2000.  This guaranteed funding allows long-term planning of development strategies and offers security to our partners in sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland's contribution to the fund has increased in terms of both volume and as a percentage of the whole over the 7th EDF.  Assistance from the European Development Fund is additional to funding from the Community budget for which the countries of sub-Saharan Africa are also eligible.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that, as development is classified as non-compulsory expenditure, the final decision on the appropriations rests with the European Parliament.  While the member states and the Presidency can propose changes in the course of the budgetary procedure, their capacity to influence the budget in these areas is limited.</P>
      <P>Within the EU, Ireland has consistently emphasised the need to attach priority to meeting the needs of sub-Saharan Africa and we will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners continue to have serious concerns about the human rights situation in Nigeria and the pace and manner of the transition to democratic rule there.  Both bilaterally and with our European partners, we have consistently expressed our <Col N="1060" /> serious concern to the Nigerian authorities about human rights violations.  The Government strongly supported the restrictive measures against Nigeria adopted by the EU in its Common Positions of 20 November and 4 December 1995.  We have also fully supported the subsequent retention of the common position measures, which were extended during the Irish Presidency for a futher six months until 4 June next.  The Government will advocate their further retention as a measure of our continuing concern about the many unresolved human rights and democratisation issues in Nigeria, including the situation in Ogoniland and the charges of treason brought by the authorities against Wole Soyinka and others.</P>
      <P>At this month's 53rd session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the EU initiated a resolution on the human rights situation in Nigeria.This was adopted on 15 April.  The Government strongly supported this important resolution which provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the appointment of a special rapporteur on the human rights situation in that country.  The provision sends a strong message from the international community to the Nigerian authorities and is a direct response by the Union and like-minded states to their failure to co-operate fully with the UN's respective thematic rapporteurs on extrajudicial, summary or arbitary executions, and on the independence of judges and lawyers.  The resolution, <i>inter alia,</i> calls on the Nigerian Government to abide by its freely undertaken obligations under international and other human rights instruments; to ensure that all trials are held fairly and promptly in strict conformity with international human rights standards and to take concrete steps to restore democratic government without delay.  The Government strongly urges the Nigerian authorities to co-operate fully with the proposed special rapporteur when appointed.</P>
      <P>At the General Affairs Council which I chaired last July, it was agreed that the Union would continue to identify and examine further measures that could be taken against Nigeria and to keep developments in the country under close review, in consultation with other interested countries and bodies.  Both as Presidency and currently as a member of the Troika, we have been actively engaged with the EU and other interested parties in this ongoing process of consultation and close review.</P>
      <P>The Government will continue to work, both bilaterally and with our European partners, for the early restoration of democracy and full respect for human rights and the rule of law in Nigeria.</P>

      <P>The Intergovernmental Conference, which opened in Turin in March 1996, remains set to conclude at the Amsterdam European Council in June.  The composition of the Commission is one of a number of sensitive institutional issues being discussed at the conference on which the final outcome is not likely to become clear until the very final stage of the negotiations.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has repeatedly made clear at the Intergovernmental Conference its very firm view that the further enlargement of the Union should not have any implications for the right of every member state to nominate a full member of the Commission.  We believe that it is central to the legitimacy and effectiveness of the Commission that each member state should continue to be entitled to nominate a full member of the Commission.  Members of the Commission, of course, do not act as national representatives.  It is, however, important that the Commission, in reaching its decisions, should be fully aware of the sensitivities in all member states and be seen to be aware of those sensitivities.  Our view is shared by many other member states.</P>
      <P>During Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in the latter half of 1996, we sought, in chairing the Intergovernmental Conference, to advance the negotiations as effectively as possible across the full range of issues under consideration at the conference.</P>

      <P>In reply to a similar question on 19 March, I informed the House of certain developments in EU arms embargoes which are taking place in the framework of the common foreign and security policy established by the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.  I wish to draw attention again to the main elements of that statement.</P>
      <P>EU arms embargoes are now adopted as common positions of the Council and, in accordance with Article J.2.2. of the Treaty, member states must ensure that their national policies conform to common positions.</P>
      <P>In an effort to facilitate a more uniform implementation of arms embargoes by member states, the Union now endeavours to specify the categories of arms covered, at Union level, by UN arms embargoes where these are non-specific as well as by embargoes imposed directly by the Union.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the two most recent EU arms embargoes adopted by the Council, on arms exports to the former Yugoslavia and to Afghanistan, expressly state that the embargoes cover contracts entered into prior to the entry into force of the embargo.</P>
      <P>There are no proposals for an across the board amendment of the operation of EU arms embargoes in order to include current as well as future contracts.  Arms embargoes are adopted case by case and the adoption of the necessary common position requires unanimity in the Council.  Notwithstanding this constraint, the evolving practice of the Council as outlined above does reflect the strengthening of the legal basis, under the Treaty, for the implementation of arms embargoes as well as the determination of the Union to ensure that arms embargoes are made as effective as possible.</P>

      <P>The Government and our EU partners remain very concerned about the situation in Sudan in both humanitarian and human rights terms.  The civil war, continuing human rights abuses and severe food shortages have caused great suffering to the Sudanese people, especially those in the south of the country.  We hope that the signing on 21 April of the peace agreement between the Government of Sudan and the southern factions will lead to an era of stability and peace for all the people of Sudan.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Government about the situation in Sudan have been made known to the Sudanese Government by the Irish Ambassador in Cairo who is also accredited to Khartoum. Both bilaterally and along with our European partners, we have supported the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, which consists of Sudan and seven neighbouring countries, in its special initiative which is supporting the peace process.  At the same time, as part of the ongoing process of critical dialogue between the Europena Union of Sudan, discussions have taken place with the Sudanese authorities on various issues.  These have included the need to pursue the peace process and democratisation, to ensure protection of human rights and to ensure the unhindered distribution of humanitarian assistance.  This dialogue represents an important channel through which the European Union and its member states can communicate their concerns to the Government of Sudan and urge the Sudanese authorities to take concrete steps particularly in relation to pressing human rights issues.  The Government will make every appropriate effort to use the recent peace accord to look for a concrete response by all parties in Sudan towards alleviating the appalling human rights situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This month's 53rd session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva addressed the human rights issues arising from the reports on Sudan of the special rapporteur to the Commission, Mr. Gaspar Biro.  On that occasion, the European Union expressed its continued concern about continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Sudan.  In its statement to the 53rd session, with strong support from Ireland, the Union specifically expressed its concerns about the continuation of slavery and slavery-like practices to which the Deputy has referred.  It also referred to the continuation of deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombing, summary executions, abductions, atrocities against the population of the Nuba mountain region and ethnic and religious discrimination.  It expressed its regret at the continuing failure by the Sudanese authorities to investigate human <Col N="1064" /> rights violations and at the detention of political opponents to the Khartoum regime.</P>
    <P>In order to make progress on the issue of human rights in Sudan, the Government and our EU partners strongly support the efforts being made by the UNHCR special rapporteur to gain free and unlimited access to the whole territory of Sudan and to any persons or organisations relevant to his work.  In reiterating this position we urge the Sudanese authorities to allow the deployment of human rights monitors in their country as a matter of priority and the unimpeded access of international observers to areas where violations are reported.  Full human rights observance will be an essential element in confidence building for the peace process in Sudan.</P>
    <P>Ireland's ongoing concerns about the human rights situation in Sudan were reflected in last year's decision not to renew our technical co-operation agreement with that country.  At the same time, we continue to recognise the need to assist those who have fallen victim to the conflict in Sudan.  Since 1994, Ireland has provided nearly £1.25 million in emergency and humanitarian assistance in Sudan.  This includes an allocation of £100,000 to UNICEF/<i>Operation Lifeline Sudan</i> for the provision of basic healthcare to displaced people in southern Sudan and £125,000 which has been provided to GOAL, as part of an ongoing project with displaced people around Khartoum. In addition Ireland has continued to provide bilateral aid aimed at poverty alleviation at local level.  Since 1994, this has amounted to approximately £1.63 million.  For its part, the European Union has committed a total of 32.5 million ECU in emergency humanitarian aid for Sudan since 1994, of which 13.1 million ECU has been disbursed.</P>
    <P>With our European partners, the Government will continue to follow the situation in Sudan closely and with concern, and to avail of every appropriate opportunity to exert positive influence on the Sudanese authorities, including in the United Nations and other international fora.</P>

      <P>At present, enforcement of the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights is carried out by the European Commission and Court of Human Rights and by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  Over the last decade the number of cases considered under the enforcement mechanism of the European Convention on Human Rights has greatly increased as the convention has become better known to citizens, more member states have accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the <Col N="1065" /> court and new member states have joined the Council of Europe.  This has led to a backlog of applications before the Commission and a lengthening of the time taken to hear cases.  Such delays threaten the effectiveness of the system as a means of protecting human rights.</P>
      <P>At the Council of Europe Vienna Summit in October 1993 the heads of state and Government agreed unanimously on the replacement of the existing European Commission and Court of Human Rights by a single Court.  Protocol 11 (eleven) to the European Convention on Human Rights, which was drawn up to introduce these reforms, was opened for signature on 11 May 1994.  Ireland signed the Protocol on that occasion and it was ratified on 16 December 1996 following Dáil approval.  The Protocol will enter into force one year following its ratification by all states party to the convention.  As of 3 March 1997 the Protocol had been signed by all forty member states of the Council of Europe; ratificaton is still required by Italy, Poland, Portugal and Turkey to allow the Protocol to enter into force.</P>
      <P>The new court will have jurisdiction in all matters concerning the interpretation application of the convention and the protocols thereto.  In order to be heard by the Commission at present, the state against which an individual petition is lodged must have previously made a declaration recognising the competence of the Commission to consider individual petitions.  In practice all contracting states accept this provision, although most do so only for renewable periods.  Following a proposal by Ireland at the Vienna Summit and the subsequent unanimous agreement of member states, Protocol No. 11 will make it a permanent and mandatory requirement for contracting states to accept the right of individuals to petition the new court directly.</P>
      <P>The new court will exercise the functions which are at present performed by the Commission; it will filter out applications at an early stage in cases in which domestic legal measures have clearly not been exhausted, in cases where the application has not been submitted within the required six months of a final domestic ruling or where the subject matter of the application is not covered by the convention The new court will assume the existing Commission's role of establishing the facts with the co-operation of the parties.Final judgments of the court will be binding and the Committee of Ministers will, as at present, continue to supervise their execution. The provision for the Committee of Ministers to decide whether there has been a violation of the convention, currently provided for under the convention, will be abolished under Protocol 11, as the new court will in effect give a judgment on all cases considered admissible and not resolved through friendly settlement.</P>

      <P>I have sought to maintain the impetus towards the establishment of an international criminal court both at the political and at the diplomatic level.  I have raised the question of its establishment in my last three statements to the UN General Assembly in a national capacity. Last year, I repeated this commitment on behalf of the European Union in the memorandum on foreign policy which accompanied my Presidency address to the General Assembly.  I believe that it is only through the establishment of such a court that the international community can effectively demonstrate that massive human rights violations will never go unpunished.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department have participated actively in the work of the preparatory committee which is tackling the substantive and technical difficulties still standing in the way of the establishment of the court.  One outstanding issue is the determination of the crimes which will come within the court's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Ireland participated in the negotiation of UN General Assembly resolution 51/207, adopted on 16 December last.  I am pleased to inform the House that the resolution provides for the holding of a diplomatic conference in 1998 charged with the finalisation and the adoption of a convention on the establishment of an international criminal court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The possible establishment of a UN economic security council has been a recurring theme in discussions on the reform of the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the UN Charter, responsibility for providing overall guidance on policy and operational matters in the economic, social and related fields rests with the Economic and Social Council. ECOSOC, which is a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, has an elected membership of 54 states.  Proponents of an enlarged economic role for the United Nations have argued that an economic security council, with its smaller membership, would contribute to a more focused and practical dialogue on international economic matters and would give the UN the same authority in <Col N="1067" /> the economic area that the security council has in peace and security matters.</P>
    <P>A proposal to establish an economic security council was considered in the course of the discussions which led to the adoption in May 1996 of General Assembly Resolution 50/227 on the restructuring and revitalisation of the United Nations in the economic, social and related fields. It was not acceptable to the broad bulk of smaller and developing countries, who were not prepared to see responsibility for the area of international economic co-operation and development vested in a body of more restricted membership.  Emphasis was given instead to making ECOSOC more efficient, responsive and dynamic.  Resolution 50/227, the product of those discussions, contains a set of measures aimed at strengthening the capacity of ECOSOC to fulfil its Charter responsibilities and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its subsidiary bodies.  The process of implementing those measures is under way and they have already produced a discernable improvement in the functioning of ECOSOC.</P>
    <P>The UN is continuing to undergo a reform process which is aimed at reviewing its activities, responsibilities and structures in order to meet more effectively the challenges of the 21st century.In a situation characterised by scarcity of resources, the focus has understandably been on ensuring that available resources are used as efficiently and as effectively as possible and on enhancing the performance of existing structures and the impact of UN development operations at field level, rather than on the establishment of new bodies.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency, in consultation with partners, prepared an EU discussion paper elaborating the EU position on various aspects of reform in the economic and social areas.  The paper sets out Union proposals on such issues as strengthening the UN Secretariat; on strengthening and streamlining the UN system at country level; and on enhancing the role of ECOSOC.  Its purpose is to contribute constructively to the discussion on reform in the United Nations and to a successful outcome of the reform process.  The paper was presented to the new Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The Secretary General has signalled his intention to proceed vigorously with UN reform.  He recently confirmed the appointment of Mr. Maurice Strong as his executive co-ordinator of reform, outlined the reforms he has already taken with a view to improving the top management of the Secretariat, and announced his intention to submit a comprehensive set of reform proposals to the General Assembly at its next session.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised in its recent White Paper on Foreign Policy that the United Nations, in the context of the new global partnership, has a unique opportunity in the coming years to agree on a new framework for international cooperation and development, in which a reformed ECOSOC would have an essential role to play.  In that context, the Government welcomes <Col N="1068" /> the commitment of the Secretary General to far-reaching reform of the United Nations in the economic and social areas and intends to fully support him in his efforts to achieve that goal.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 13 March last, I discussed the issue of Bloody Sunday and the Government's assessment of the new material emerging on it and the Widgery Tribunal with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew at the meeting of the Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference on 12 March last. The issue is also being raised through the framework of the intergovernmental conference on an ongoing basis.  I understand that the British Government's own assessment is also ongoing.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to present our conclusions to the incoming British Government when this assessment is complete.  As I have previously outlined, it is vitally important that the new material emerging, and its significance in regard to both the conduct and the outcome of the Widgery Tribunal, be considered in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  Throughout this assessment, Government officials have remained in close touch with the Blood Sunday relatives and their supporters.  As both the Taoiseach and I have indicated previously, the Government do not wish to weaken in any way the significance of its assessment by pre-judging its outcome.  Nor will the Government decide what options it may wish to pursue until our assessment is complete.</P>
      <P>However, as I indicated to the House on 6 February last, it is my belief that the British Government which finally acknowledged in an unreserved way the wrong done on Bloody Sunday and seeks to meet the legitimate concerns of the Bloody Sunday relatives, will make a very significant contribution to the cause of peace in Northern Ireland and reconciliation throughout these islands.</P>

      <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic <Col N="1069" /> relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  A grant of IR£50,000 was agreed recently for relief of famine victims in North Korea.  The assistance is being channelled through Trócaire, which is working closely with the implementing agency, the World Food Programme (WFP).  The WFP has been liaising closely with the North Korean authorities to ensure that aid is targeted at those in greatest need.  Irish assistance to the WFP represents around 5 per cent of the total appeal.  A total of IR£65,000 was granted for famine relief in North Korea last year.</P>

      <P>The Government fully supports the development of closer relations between the United Nations Organisation and national parliaments.The current and appropriate framework for this co-operation is through the Interparliamentary Union (IPU) which is the world organisation through which national parliaments work together at the international level and which shares the principles and objectives of the United Nations.  The regular meetings organised jointly by the UN and the IPU, in which parliamentarians from around the world, including Ireland, have participated, are one important aspect of this co-operation.</P>
      <P>Within the United Nations General Assembly, member states have considered ways in which the existing co-operation between the United Nations and the IPU might be further strengthened. Ireland has during these debates supported efforts to agree a new and appropriate framework for enhanced co-operation between the two organisations.  These efforts resulted in a co-operation agreement which was signed between the United Nations and the IPU on 24 July 1996.  This agreement provides for increased consultation and co-operation between the UN and the IPU on issues of international importance.</P>
      <P>The Government has welcomed the conclusion of this agreement.  Ireland was a co-sponsor of the resolution of the General Assembly, adopted during its 51st Session on 7 November 1996, on increasing and strengthening co-operation between the two organisations.  We look forward to the report on co-operation between the UN and the IPU which the Secretary General of the United Nations will be presenting to the 52nd Session of the General Assembly.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of considerable satisfaction to me that there has been a rapid and very significant increase in Ireland's official development assistance in recent years.  Since 1992, the budget has increased from £40 million to £122 million.  In other words the budget has increased threefold in five years.  The proportion of Gross National Product allocated to ODA has almost doubled over the same period increasing from 0.16 per cent to 0.31 per cent.  Given the happy circumstance that our GNP has increased at an unprecedented rate in this period this represents a very creditable performance in GNP terms.  This year expenditure on ODA at £122 million will be the highest ever.  The increases in the ODA allocation in both 1995 and 1996 were very large in cash terms.  The details for 1995, 1996 and 1997 are as follows: in 1995 spending on ODA was £96.8 million which was equivalent to 0.28 per cent of forecast GNP; in 1996 spending on ODA was £110 million which was equivalent to 0.3 per cent of forcast GNP based on provisional outturn figures; and in 1997 spending on ODA will be around £122 million which is equivalent to 0.31 per cent of estimated GNP.</P>

      <P>The European Union Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation was established for the period 1995-9 and is making a substantial contribution towards reconciliation and development in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, financial provision for the current programme of Structural Funds runs until the end of 1999.  The future of the Structural Funds post-1999 was not an issue on the agenda of the Council of Ministers during the Presidency.</P>
      <P>Proposals are currently being drawn up within the Commission for the next round of Financial Perspectives, after 1999, which will make further provision for all EU policies and programmes, including the Structural Funds.  It has been agreed that the Commission will table these proposals following the conclusions of the Intergovernmental Conference.  If the Intergovernmental Conference concludes as planned at the meeting of the European Council in June, we expect the proposals to be tabled the following month.  It is difficult to predict when the negotiations will conclude, but they are likely to extend at least until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Government has taken, and will continue to take, all appropriate steps to ensure that Ireland's continuing development needs are taken into account in the Commission's proposals and in the subsequent negotiations.  We have maintained close contact with the Commission at both political and official level.  For example, the Taoiseach visited Brussels at the beginning of March and held meetings with President Santer, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and other Commissioners and gave a report of his meetings in reply to questions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commissioner Wulf-Mathies, who is responsible for regional development, has acknowledged Ireland's continued need for structural funding after 1999, and accepts that there should be no sudden shock in our case.  It is accepted by the <Col N="1074" /> Commission that the success which has been achieved should not be put at risk by a sudden cessation of funding.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State in my Department, Deputy Burton, will meet Mr. Leonard Good, the Canadian Executive Director of the World Bank, during the course of his forthcoming visit to Ireland to discuss issues of common interest. These will include the HIPC Initiative, the debt initiative for heavily indebted poor countries.</P>
      <P>The HIPC Initiative, which was agreed at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in October 1996, represents a significant step forward in the international community's response to the debt problems of the poorest countries.  It is intended to bring their debts down to sustainable levels in the interests of their economic and social development.This initiative can, if implemented vigorously and fully, produce significant debt relief for severely indebted countries and it represents an important contribution to efforts to bring about sound economic development and growth in the affected countries.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the debt problem and the serious constraint itimposes on the economic and social development of the poorest and most indebted countries. We have consistently used the relevant international fora to emphasise the need to find ways to address the debt problem of the poorest countries.We welcome the HIPC Initiative as a practical expression of the international community's commitment to address the debt problem and we would hope to see it implemented in a full and constructive manner as early as possible.</P>

      <P>The current phase of unrest in the Balkans is generally considered to date from the death of Marshal Tito.  Extreme ethnic nationalism re-emerged in the late 1980s and led to the break-up of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, starting with the secession of Slovenia and of Croatia in 1991, and culminating in the terrible war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which ended in 1995.</P>
      <P>The situation in the former Yugoslavia has been of the utmost concern to the international community since the beginning of the conflict. The question was a priority issue for the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union during the Irish Presidency, when among other developments, the first post-war national elections were held in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and democratically-based institutions were established.  The European Union, and its member states, have contributed enormous energy and resources, both material and personnel, from the outset of the conflict, as part of the international effort to restore peace and stability to the region.  Since this is an ongoing process it is not possible to evaluate at this stage the final outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union will continue to work, with its international partners, to sustain the peace which the people of the former Yugoslavia now enjoy, while remaining fully aware that the primary responsibility for such peace lies with these people themselves.

      <P>At present, EURATOM is obliged to make certain by appropriate supervision that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they are intended, although materials and facilities intended for military purposes are excluded from the scope of EURATOM.</P>
      <P>As non-nuclear weapon states party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), thirteen of the fifteen EU member states have made a binding legal commitment to forego the nuclear weapons option.  For the purpose of verifying the fulfilment of that commitment, these member states and EURATOM acting in concert have accepted IAEA safeguards designed to prevent the diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to use as nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.  As nuclear weapon states party to the NPT, France and the UK have made a binding legal commitment not to transfer nuclear weapons to any state whatsoever and not in any way to assist any non-nuclear weapon state to acquire nuclear weapons. These states, in conjunction with EURATOM, have entered into agreements with the IAEA in relation to the inspection of non-military nuclear materials.  These fundamental commitments have the effect of preventing an evolution of EURATOM which might involve the promotion of nuclear energy for weapons purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be asked whether EURATOM's competance should be extended so as to bring further within its scope the prevention of the use of nuclear energy for weapons purposes.  Any move in this direction will require the agreement of all member states.  Preventing the diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to use as nuclear weapons is the <i>raison d'être</i> of the international non-proliferation regime founded on the NPT.  NPT members include all five declared nuclear weapon states, as well as 181 non-nuclear weapon states.  Its near-universality &mdash; only five countries in the world still remain outside the NPT &mdash; means that the NPT, complemented by IAEA safeguards and by nuclear-related export controls, is the instrument of choice for preventing the use of nuclear energy for weapons purposes.  EURATOM, on the other hand, was not founded as a non-proliferation organization. The EURATOM Treaty contains no specific mention of non-proliferation, but one of its tasks is to ensure that nuclear materials are not used <Col N="1077" /> for a purpose other than that for which they are intended.  EURATOM functions today as a regional organisation with the objective not only of promoting peaceful nuclear co-operation among member states but also of facilitating member states' fulfilment of their non-proliferation obligations, within the limits of its legal competence in the matter.  However, as non-proliferation issues are essentially matters of national rather than community competance, they are properly considered mainly within the framework of the common foreign and security policy of the Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government of Cambodia is a coalition Government formed in November 1993 following national elections held in May of that year under the supervision of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The two main parties in the Government are FUNCINPEC (National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful and Co-operative Cambodia) and the Cambodian People's Party. The Khmer Rouge did not take part in the elections.</P>
      <P>The power and influence of the Khmer Rouge have declined considerably in recent years.  In October, 1996, the Government entered into discussions with a breakaway faction of the organisation following an amnesty granted to its leader, Ieng Sary.  These discussions led to an agreement that Ieng Sary's forces would be integrated into the Royal Cambodia Armed Forces (RCAF). There was a further development in January with the announcement that posts in the armed forces would be given to a number of members of the breakaway group, including 19 posts at the rank of general.</P>
      <P>Joint military activity conducted by the Khmer Rouge breakaway units and the RCAF against the hard-line Khmer Rouge units in the north-west of the country, together with further defections to the Government side, have clearly weakened the position of the Khmer Rouge in the country.  It is now reported that the remaining factions have regrouped in the northern stronghold of Anlong Veng and in bases in the south-west.</P>
      <P>In so far as the general political situation in Cambodia is concerned, there are very serious grounds for concern.  A report in January by the UN Secretary General's Special representative for Cambodia concluded that the human rights situation there appeared to be fragile.  Recently, there have been reports of increased political tensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> A violent attack on peaceful demonstrations protesting against alleged political interference in the judicial system in Phnom Penh on 30 March reflected the volatile nature of the political situation in Cambodia.  In a Declaration of 9 April the EU expressed its grave concern about this attack. In calling on the Government of Cambodia to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, the European Union expressed its hope that such tragic events would lead all parties to recognise that peace and stability were essential in the period leading up to the local elections, which are scheduled to take place in December 1997 with general elections to follow in 1998.</P>
    <P>These elections will be the key to the future of Cambodia and it is essential that the Cambodian Government should adopt legislation to ensure that they will be genuinely free and fair.  For their part, EU member states are currently engaged in an exchange of views as to how best the Union can help in the election process.  This exchange will include consideration of financial assistance and the co-ordination of EU aid with that from other donors.</P>

The objectives of the CFSP, as set out in Article J.1 of the Maastricht Treaty, are: to safeguard the common values, fundamental interests and independence of the Union; to strengthen the security of the Union and its member states; to preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter; to promote international co-operation; and to develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a significant intensification of the foreign policy activity of the Union under the new arrangements with a particular focus on the major contemporary issues including former Yugoslavia, the Middle East peace process and the Great Lakes region.  Under Article J.3 of the Maastricht Treaty, the Union is able to take joint action, covering political, diplomatic and economic action in an organised manner in areas in which there are important common interests. Since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, the Council has adopted Joint Actions, <i>inter alia,</i> in support of the conveying of humanitarian <Col N="1080" /> aid in Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the European Union administration of the town of Mostar; the transition towards a democratic and multi-racial South Africa; the Middle East peace process, the dispatch of a team of election observers for the parliamentary elections in the Russian Federation; the preparation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference and the control of the export of dual-use goods.</P>
    <P>The other main instrument for Union action under the CFSP is the common position, which is a less extensive form of action than a Joint Action.  Common positions have been adopted, <i>inter alia,</i> on assistance to Rwanda and Burundi; on the Union's objectives and priorities in relation to the Ukraine; in relation to sanctions against Libya and Serbia-Montenegro; and on an arms embargo against Sudan, Burma and Cuba.</P>
    <P>I have already reported to the House, both after the European Council and in response to other questions, on the detailed contribution made by Ireland, during its Presidency, to the development of the CFSP.  Ireland is also making a positive contribution to the review of the CFSP which is currently under way at the intergovernmental conference (IGC).</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty on European Union, ratified by the Irish people in a referendum, provides that the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the Union &ldquo;shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence.&rdquo;  The Maastricht Treaty also provided for the convening of a further intergovernmental conference in 1996 to review, <i>inter alia,</i> this Treaty provision.  The current Intergovernmental Conference negotiation are progressing well, although there remain a number of issues to be resolved before the Amsterdam summit in June.</P>
      <P>Ireland's strong commitment to the development of the CFSP is reflected in our approach to the IGS negotiations.  In the negotiations it has been fully recongnised that EU member states which are not members of military alliances have a constructive role to play in the development of the Union in the security and defence area.  I would mention in particular the Petersberg tasks, in which countries such as Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Austria, with their long tradition in UN peacekeeping, could play an important role that is consistent with their non-membership of alliances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> The Government White Paper on Foreign Policy sets out the principles that guide our approach in contributing to discussion of defence policy in the EU context.  It also makes clear that the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy would be put to the people in a referendum.  This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>

      <P>The rate of house price inflation largely reflects very strong demand for housing which is itself related to the strong economic growth in recent years.  Lower interest rates and the expectation that they will remain low, increased real disposable incomes and unprecedented employment growth have all contributed to the upward pressure on house prices.  The changing demographic situation with more young people looking for housing has also had a role to play.  These factors have fuelled the demand for houses, resulting in a rate of house price inflation which is currently considerably <Col N="1083" /> higher than the general inflation rate.  It is to be expected that in a free market strong demand will translate into higher prices.  Nevertheless, despite the fact that house prices are not included directly in the consumer price index, there are clear grounds for concern that persistent high house price inflation may generate inflationary pressures indirectly in other areas of the economy, and so the trend over the near future will require close attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Over the past few years, my Department has made substantial funding available to the International Missionary Training Hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda in respect of the establishment of a CT scanning service.  In September 1996, I approved a consultant radiologist <Col N="1085" /> post for the hospital to initiate a regional CT service for the Louth-Meath area.  In addition, it was agreed that the existing single-handed radiologist based at Dundalk would provide cover at the International Missionary Training Hospital for the CT scanning service.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I recently conveyed approval in principle to the appointment of a second radiologist post based at Navan.  It is understood that this post will also have a sessional commitment to the International Missionary Training Hospital.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this substantial investment in radiology services will facilitate the North-Eastern Health Board in the development of a high quality comprehensive service for the people of Louth and Meath and will also meet the CT requirements across the three hospitals.</P>
      <P>On the question of the delay in getting the CT service off the ground, I have been advised by the health board and International Missionary Training Hospital that the main obstacle has been the securing of a permanent consultant radiologist. Generally there is a long lead-in time from approval of the post to having a consultant commence duties, and this is common to all permanent consultant appointments.</P>
      <P>I am assured that both agencies are making every effort to secure an interim arrangement, pending the appointment of a permanent radiologist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>Standards in pre-school facilities generally are governed by the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations which I introduced on 31 December 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations are the first of their kind in the State and they give effect to section 50 of the Child Care Act, 1991 which obliges the Minister for Health to make regulations for the purpose of <Col N="1086" /> securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of pre-school children. The regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, some childminders, créches and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.  They will have an impact across the various sectors involved in pre-school provision ranging from the voluntary provision for disadvantaged children through to full day care provision in the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations, there is a requirement on a person carrying on a pre-school service to give notice to their health board to this effect. Pre-school providers have been given until 30 June 1997 to give this notice to their local health board.  Pre-schools are subject to inspection by the health boards to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Child Care Act and the Regulations.  Where a pre-school provider and/or her premises does not meet these requirements, details of the deficiencies will be outlined in writing and she will be given a specific period of time within which to make specific improvements (provided such a delay would not adversely affect the welfare of children).  A further inspection will be made after that date.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of these regulations will help to ensure a high standard of pre-school provision throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific allegations made recently in the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> I understand that the Eastern Health Board has contacted the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> to ascertain the pre-school facilities referred to with a view to those facilities being investigated forthwith.  I am disappointed that the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> has not been prepared to give any identifying information to the health board and that as a result the board is unable to identify the services concerned and take whatever action may be required.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to point out that while pre-school facilities will be inspected by health boards under the regulations, there is also an onus on parents to take steps to satisfy themselves as to the adequacy of the pre-school arrangements they make for their child.  Any person unhappy with the standards prevailing in a particular pre-school facility should contact the relevant health board which will then take appropriate action.</P>

      <P>Two hospital based units in Dublin deal with child sexual abuse.  Temple Street Children's Hospital deals with cases from the northside of Dublin and Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, deals with cases from the southside of Dublin as well as Wicklow and Kildare.</P>
      <P>In addition to confirmation of abuse, the development of a treatment service for children who have been sexually abused is important so that an integrated service is available for victims. Until recently treatment services in the Eastern Health Board region were underdeveloped.  In 1995, I provided a capital grant of £650,000 to Our Lady's Hospital for a new therapeutic unit. This grant facilitated the provision of an integrated assessment and treatment service for children who have been sexually abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1996, I approved funding of £75,000 amounting to £150,000 in a full year for the development of a similar integrated service for victims of child sexual abuse in the northside of the city.  Discussions are currently ongoing between Temple <Col N="1088" /> Street Children's Hospital and the Eastern Health Board in relation to this development.</P>
    <P>In addition to these services, community care social workers and child care workers play a major part in the investigation, assessment and rehabilitation of children who have been sexually abused.  In this regard community based family centres are part of the service network and any individual may avail of the social work service in their community care area.</P>
    <P>Regular meetings are held between the community care teams and the two hospital units to review procedures and practice in this whole area.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 79 of 20 Márta 1997 regarding non-Civil Service and other staff costs attached to my office.  The figures provided in that reply do not include staff employed by the heritage service on specific projects in the areas of national monuments, national parks and wildlife and inland waterways.  Expenditure by my Department on consultants under subhead A.7 of my Department's Vote amounted to £148,000 in 1995 and £67,000 in 1996.  No expenditure from my Department's Vote was undertaken on public relations contracts during the years in question.</P>

      <P>The bridge replacement programme on the Royal Canal is a necessary development, but it is not sufficient to fully restore the waterway for navigation.  Other major works to the system will include the completion of the dredging programme, the bog embankment <Col N="1093" /> works, raising the freeboard in certain areas, and the sourcing of water supplies.

      <P>The waterways service of my Department has recently obtained planning permission for the reconstruction works to Moran's Bridge, Mullingar, County Westmeath.  Engineering consultants have been appointed to undertake design and construction works to six road bridges on the main line in County Longford.

      <Quest>his views on whether the shortage of land for development purposes in the greater Dublin area and its hinterland, in view of demand for houses in that area, is contributing to the spiralling, inflationary prices of houses; the action, if any, he proposes to take to address this problem; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The demand for housing in the Dublin area is influenced by a combination of factors; remarkable economic growth, demographic trends, increased income, low interest rates and strong employment growth.  It is clear that the supply of housing in the area has responded well to the increase in demand over recent years, with the number of new housing units completed in the city and county area increasing from 4,285 in 1988 to 9,446 in 1996.  Planning statistics for 1996 show that there was an increase of 18 per cent over 1995 in the number of dwelling units granted planning permission in the Dublin and Mid-Eastern regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preliminary data supplied by the Dublin local authorities indicates that there are about 4,000 <Col N="1094" /> acres of green field or vacant land serviced and zoned for housing in Dublin city and county.  At a suburban density of ten to the acre, this would provide for some 40,000 houses.  There is a further substantial acreage of serviced and zoned land in the adjoining counties.  In addition, a significant number of &ldquo;brown field&rdquo; sites will become available <i>via</i> the demolition of old houses, offices and warehouses, reuse of derelict land etc. and in the context of the docklands development plan. Apartments, which are predominantly located on infill or brown field sites account for 40 per cent of new housing units in Dublin city and county. Clearly, there is considerable potential for further residential development on such sites, although by its very nature, this is difficult to quantify.</P>
    <P>The supply and spread of serviced development land are among the aspects to be considered in developing planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, a process which I am currently setting in train with the local and regional authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 66 and 67 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of Directive 76/464/EEC in relation to the establishment of environmental quality objectives have proven problematic across the EU.  Consequently, there are few, if any, instances of environmental quality objectives for particular substances being adopted by member states in the manner envisaged by the directive. Nonetheless, as indicated in the recently published Sustainable Development: A Strategy for Ireland, the Government is committed to making new regulations in 1997 under the Water Pollution <Col N="1095" /> Acts setting out water quality standards for a range of polluting substances, including phosphorus.</P>
    <P>Work on the setting of water quality objectives for phosphorus is well advanced within my Department.  Proposals in this regard have been circulated to other Departments with a view to finalising the regulations shortly.  The establishment of quality objectives for phosphorus will complement the comprehensive range of actions already being pursued to deal with the pollution of rivers and lakes by this substance.  Details of the actions concerned are outlined in the reply to Question No. 12 of 25 February 1997.</P>
    <P>As regards the setting of quality objectives for other substances covered by Directive 76/464/EEC, the Environmental Protection Agency is currently completing work on a consultation document which will be published shortly. The agency will then finalise its recommendations taking account of comments received and submit these for my consideration.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is at an advanced stage in the preparation of criteria in relation to site selection for local authority landfill development.  Site selection is a matter which has to be addressed in an environmental impact statement submitted to the Minister with an application for certification under Part IX of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 in relation to a proposed landfill development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Waste Management (Licensing) Regulations, 1997 provide for the licensing of public and private sector landfills and other significant waste disposal facilities by the Environmental Protection Agency.  All new facilities and certain existing facilities will be licensable with effect <Col N="1099" /> from 1 May 1997.  Remaining existing facilities will become licensable on a phased basis in the period up to March 1999.  In consequence of the commencement of this licensing system, I intend very shortly to amend Part IX of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 so as to remove the requirement for certification by the Minister for the Environment for such facilities.</P>

      <P>A national strategy in relation to hazardous waste is currently being prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The strategy will provide a basis for a national hazardous waste management plan to be made by the agency under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, 1996.  The strategy and plan will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the management of asbestos waste.</P>
      <P>Primary responsibility for the management of any waste lies with the holder or producer of the waste.  The generation, storage, treatment or deposit of asbestos waste is subject to control under a number of regulatory provisions.  Section 32 (1) of the Waste Management Act 1996 prohibits any person from holding, transporting, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.</P>

      <P>Use of cleaner technology and production processes to minimise waste generation is an important facet of the environmental management programmes required by the Environmental Protection Agency under the terms of IPC licences.  There is an increasing range of mechanisms available for support and development in this area, and business and industry can avail of the services of Forbairt, the Clean Technology Centre &mdash; Cork regional technical college &mdash; and the cleaner production promotion unit &mdash; UCC. A demonstration initiative is also being undertaken under Environmental Protection Agency co-ordination, in relation to cleaner production and environmental management, with particular reference to small and medium sized enterprises.</P>

      <P>A parent group wishing to establish a multi-denominational school should submit a formal application in this regard to the planning section of my Department in Tullamore.  The application should include details of the number of pupils expected to enrol in the proposed new school in the initial and subsequent years and should also indicate how it is proposed to accommodate the school.  Successful applicants would be required to nominate a patron and appoint a board of management in accordance with standard procedure.</P>
      <P>On receipt of official recognition, schools may apply to my Department for grant-aid in respect of teacher salary and towards current operating costs, including the rental of temporary accommodation.Capital grant-aid may be claimed when permanent recognition is granted.

      <P>The overall management and funding arrangements for Tallaght Sports Complex is governed by the terms of the trust deed of Tallaght community school and agreements reached between the school, Dublin County Council and the Department in the early 1970s.  These arrangements provide that the complex be operated on a self-financing basis, with any operational deficit incurred being shared equally between the Department and county council.  The Department also makes provision in its budget allocation to the school in respect of school usage of the complex.</P>
      <P>I understand that discussions are continuing between South Dublin County Council and Tallaght community school with a view to securing an annual subvention from the county council to reflect the value of the amenity being provided to the local community.</P>

These are at present a matter for negotiation between the Chief State Solicitor and solicitors representing Paul O'Donoghue.  In default of agreement on an appropriate level of costs, this matter will be referred for taxation by the High Court.</P>

Rather, due to an increase in the school's enrolment in September 1997, it will qualify for an extra assistant teacher from 1 September 1997.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to temporary unestablished staff employed in my office and in the offices of the Ministers of State at my Department.The salary costs incurred in respect of the persons concerned were £92,351 in 1995 and £110,917 in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to identify separately the amount of other associated costs, such as overheads, arising in relation to these staff.  The total expenditure on consultants for Ministerial public relations was £30,546 in 1995 and £36,173 in 1996.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on ministerial-related photography was £1,274 in 1995 and £3,268 in 1996.  The additional costs in 1996 are accounted for by the EU Presidency.</P>

The Deputy may wish to note that I made one further trip by air during the period 10 December 1996 to 31 December 1996.  Comparative figures for 1988 and 1989 are not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of staff time to compile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that in facing the problem of drug abuse in prisons in general and in Mountjoy Prison in particular, the initiatives which I have brought forward represent a well balanced and effective response to what is, without doubt, one of the greatest menaces facing society, inside and outside the prisons.</P>
      <P>A number of measures aimed at curbing the supply of illegal drugs are in place in Mountjoy. These include video surveillance of the visiting area and special arrangements for the searching of prisoners following visits and on return from courts, hospitals etc.  I am also awaiting the outcome of pilot tests using sniffer dogs to help detect drugs in the prison or on the way into prison.Any regime of searching must take into account the obligations on us to run a humane prison system.</P>
      <P>The improvement of such detection measures in Mountjoy Prison during 1995, has led to a significant increase in the number of drug seizures made there.  This is illustrated by the number of seizures in the main Mountjoy Prison involving illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia in which resulted in formal prison disciplinary proceedings against prisoners over the last three years which were as follows; 1994 &mdash; 172; 1995 &mdash; 392; 1996 &mdash; 423.  There are also cases where gardaí have arrested visitors caught passing over drugs to offenders.</P>
      <P>The most effective strategy for tackling the problem of drug abuse is prevention through education and the rehabilitation of those already addicted.  There are now specially designed drugs education programmes in place in all our prisons. These include the drug treatment facility which is based at the Mountjoy Prison health care unit and the drug-free regime in the training unit.  Both of these initiatives are working well.</P>
      <P>The Mountjoy treatment unit is providing prisoners who, in many cases, have a history of chronic drug dependency, with an opportunity to avail of the most modern treatment and therapeutic methods while serving their sentences. Those who have completed their treatment programmes continue to be monitored and provided with support and assistance within the prison. Those who are released early are also monitored following their release back into the community. As with all such programmes it is important to note that treatment is voluntary and dependent in every case on the willingness of the individual to participate in the programme.</P>

The appropriateness of the non-statutory basis for the scheme can be reviewed at that stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might note that the scheme continues to operate and that in 1996 a sum of £4.296 million was paid in compensation awards.  This year, I have provided the sum of £3.432 million in the 1997 Estimates to meet the payment of awards as they arise.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the enforcement of road traffic legislation is given a high priority by the Garda with a view to keeping the number of accidents and deaths on our roads to a minimum.  A traffic corps whose main duty is the enforcement of such legislation operates in each Garda division in addition to all other members on ordinary duty.</P>
      <P>I have been assured by the Garda authorities that special enforcement campaigns are carried out by them throughout the year and not just at Christmas and during the summer holiday season. Also, the Garda mount regular checkpoints in every division.</P>
      <P>I have been further assured by the Garda authorities that areas of the country which have a high incidence of accidents are targeted by the Garda for special attention.</P>
      <P>I have ensured that the Garda traffic corps is equipped with modern cars and the most sophisticated speed detection equipment available, including video and radar speed guns, as well as the Gatso radar video computer speed detection system.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Garda fully co-operate with the National Safety Council in its efforts to promote road safety.  They also assist local authorities in their endeavours to make the roads safer by drawing to their attention areas where accidents occur and which may need attention.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, an obligation on all drivers to comply with the requirements on the Road Traffic Acts and to drive in a safe and careful manner.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available.To obtain it would require the manual examination of up to 30,000 files and the collation of the information.  Such use of staff time could not be justified at present.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the latest year for which information is available, out of the 10,252 committals to prison, 277 people were committed by the courts for non-payment of debts, default of sureties and contempt of court.  This represented less than 3 per cent of total committals for that year.</P>
      <P>Once such a person has been sent to prison by the courts for such offences, I do not have any practical jurisdiction over the length of time they serve.  The principal way they can be released is by paying their debt or purging their contempt. At any one time, persons in these categories represent less than 0.5 per cent of persons in custody i.e. about 12 persons out of an average of 2,200 in custody.  This is because many of those committed under such warrants make payment either on, or shortly after, committal and are then released. The average number of days served is not available but sentences can vary from five days to a number of months.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel.  They have informed me that the Temple Bar area is patrolled on foot by four uniformed members between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 a.m. the following morning.  These patrols are augmented by regular mobile patrols and by units from the divisional task force attached to Pearse Street station.  For special events in the area, the Garda authorities inform me that extra resources are deployed.  A Garda inspector from Pears Street station has been appointed with responsibility for policing the Temple Bar area and to liaise with the residents and business community.  The Temple Bar area is also monitored by the Garda CCTV system from Pears Street station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities report that in recent months there has been an increase in British tourist frequenting the Temple Bar area, in particular large groups attending parties.  The vast majority are well behaved and good humoured and co-operate fully with the Garda.  I understand from the Garda authorities that on occasions, some have been cautioned over boisterous behaviour, but there is no evidence to suggest that local youths and visiting tourists are terrorising residents <Col N="1115" /> or other members of the public as the Deputy suggests.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current Garda strength for Pearse Street District is 308 as of 31 March 1997.  The local divisional officer is satisfied with the present policing arrangement for Temple Bar.  However, these arrangements are kept under continual review and changes are made as necessary.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 228 on 15 October 1996, the Garda authorities already have arrangements in place whereby Garda protection can be afforded as necessary to any witness and, if appropriate, members of a witness' family before, during and after giving evidence in court.  The Garda authorities inform me that where Garda protection is provided, it is tailored to the needs of the individual witness, following an evaluation of all relevant intelligence.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have implemented specific measures for the protection and security of witnesses with great success over many years in many different investigations and prosecutions.

      <P>The objectives of the Criminal Assets Bureau include the taking of appropriate action to deprive persons of assets suspected to derive from criminal activity. Part of the bureau's remit is to ensure that the Tax Acts are fully applied in relation to the proceeds of criminal activity.  Income and gains from illegal sources were specifically excluded from the 1993 incentive amnesty and the declaration to be filed by an individual availing of the amnesty included an undertaking that the declared amounts did not arise from, or by reason of, an unlawful source of activity.  The Criminal Assets Bureau has the relevant powers needed to fully apply the Tax Acts and to pursue the penalties provided for where there is evidence of abuse of the tax amnesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> I am assured by the Garda that in cases where the bureau establishes that persons have purported to avail of the tax amnesty for the purpose of &ldquo;laundering&rdquo; the proceeds of criminal activity the bureau will avail of any legal option open to it to ensure that any attempted use of the tax amnesty will be set aside.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment on specific cases being pursued by the bureau.</P>

      <P>Motor insurers accept or reject individual risks on the basis of their underwriting experience.  However, because of the compulsory nature of motor insurance, a mechanism exists under the declined cases committee to consider motor insurance risks which have been refused by individual insurance companies.  The committee is composed of representatives from authorised insurance companies under the chairmanship of the Irish Insurance Federation.  Before a case may be considered by the committee it will be necessary for the individual concerned or his representative to forward five written refusals from motor insurers directly to the Declined Cases Committee at the Irish Insurance Federation, 39 Molesworth Street, Dublin 2.</P>
      <P>The documentation should indicate the order in which all the companies were approached together with details of previous insurance held in connection with the risk in question.  The committee should nominate one of the authorised insurance companies to quote for the risk.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 135 and 136 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Control of Horses Regulations, 1997 were made on 24 April 1997.  These regulations set out the formats of the on-the-spot fine notice and of the horse licence and set the fee for a horse licence at £25.  The regulations also provide that horses covered by the legislation must be identified by means of a microchip implanted under the skin. The regulations enable local authorities to implement the powers they have been given under the Control of Horses Act, 1996, to deal with the problem of wandering horses.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ensure that resources are available to assist local authorities in putting this legislation into effect and I have made specific provision in my Department's Estimates for 1997, for grants to be paid to local authorities for this purpose.Allocations to eligible individual local authorities will have regard not only to their implementation of the Act but also to the relative scale of the horse problem faced by each authority.  My Department will shortly advise local authorities of the specific criteria which will be applied in its consideration of grant allocations.  It will then be a matter for those authorities which have put the Act into effect to make formal applications for assistance.  Implementation of the Act by any authority need not, however, await completion of this process.</P>

      <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the world's central intergovernmental agency for co-operation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Ireland's membership of the agency ensures that we have a direct say in ensuring that the highest standards of nuclear safety, radiation protection and emergency preparedness apply in the nuclear industry worldwide and in influencing matters relating to nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation of nuclear materials, nuclear liability and compensation.</P>
      <P>Ireland is represented at meetings of the IAEA by officials from my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Radiological Protection Institute and the Attorney General's office. Many meetings have been serviced over the past two years including the following: quarterly Board of Governor meetings and the Annual General Assembly; ongoing negotiations on the conventions concerning nuclear safety, management of radioactive waste, and nuclear liability; a draft model Protocol to strengthen the effectiveness and improve the efficiency of the nuclear safeguards system; meetings concerned with aspects of the control of materials and technology which could be used to produce or deliver nuclear weapons; and administrative, budget and technical co-operation meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specific items for discussion at IAEA meetings <Col N="1132" /> vary considerably.  The priority for Ireland's representatives is to continue to steer IAEA towards the promotion of nuclear safety, radiological protection, emergency preparedness and the non-proliferation of nuclear materials.  Notable successes in recent years have been the negotiation of a nuclear safety convention now in force and a new convention establishing worldwide standards for waste management and safe disposal of spent fuel which is close to finalisation.</P>

      <P>Total expenditure on consultants in the years 1988, 1989 and 1995 are as outlined in my reply to Deputy Dermot Ahern on 26 March 1996.  The total expenditure in 1996 was £222,856.  This sum, which includes £8,313.00 on public relations services, was spent mainly on purely departmental rather than ministerial matters.  Consultants are used by the Department of Defence for several purposes e.g. management studies, construction projects, personnel and technical evaluations etc.</P>
      <P>The cost of contract staff employed in the years 1988, 1995 and 1996 are as outlined to the Deputy to my reply to him dated 20 March 1997.  The cost of such staff in 1989 was £17,925.</P>
      <P>The total cost of phone services to me and the Minister of State was approximately £5,750 in 1995 and £8,800 in 1996.  Comparative figures for 1988 and 1989 are not readily available.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the £2 billion worth of fish which is taken from Irish waters by EU boats each year and that Ireland's share from Irish waters is £100 million; if his attention has further been drawn to the fact that Ireland has 16 per cent of EU water and only a 2.9 per cent quota, with a 2.5 per cent fleet; the proposals, if any, he has to redress the balance to somewhere near equity; if he will provide funding to update and upgrade the fleet; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>An estimate can be made of the first sale value of fish <Col N="1134" /> stocks caught within the Irish 200 mile zone on the basis of: the number of vessels of all member states fishing in our waters; the percentage of allocated quotas which each member state takes in our waters; the non-quota stocks taken in our waters; the catch per unit effort of certain fleets. This calculation suggests a figure of £700 million as a more realistic estimate of the value of fish caught in our waters.  The value of fish landed by Irish vessels in 1996 was almost £139 million.</P>
      <P>Fish stock levels are assessed annually by EU and international fisheries scientists.  On the basis of this advice the Commission draws up annual proposals for total allowable catches (TACs) for the various stocks for decision by the Council of Fisheries Ministers each December.  TACs are divided into national quotas allocated to member states in proportion to their relative historic catches prior to the introduction of the quota systems.</P>
      <P>The case for an increase in those quota allocations to Ireland is longstanding and remains on the table within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The overall national objective is to maximise fishing possibilities for Ireland while ensuring that conservation objectives are met and taking full account of the socio-economic needs of coastal areas especially dependent on fishing.</P>
      <P>The operational programme for fisheries 1994-9 provides funding for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet with over £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid available to support total investment of some £31 million in the fleet over the period.  The investment support strategy under the programme is designed to improve the overall quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet. In addition I have accepted the recommendation of the consultancy study on the introductions to a pilot scheme for up to four new all weather whitefish vessels and have received the go ahead from Government to proceed accordingly.</P>

    <P>These sums were spent chiefly on departmental rather than ministerial matters.  The Department of the Marine employs consultants for a wide range of activities given its responsibilities for areas such as fisheries, ports, fishery harbour centres, marine pollution and the marine environment. The bulk of the expenditure related to engineering and other technical consultancies.</P>
