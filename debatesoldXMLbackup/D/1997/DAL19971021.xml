      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will report on the current position regarding the National Centre for Partnership; if all the relevant staff have been appointed to date; and if he will give details of the work programme of the centre.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of Partnership 2000, the National Centre for Partnership has now been established with the following board members: Evelyn Owens, chairperson, Peter Cassells, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, John Dunne, Irish Business and Employers Confederation, John Hurley, Department of Finance, Paul Haran, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Mary Doyle, Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The role of the centre is to foster, directly and indirectly, partnership arrangements, involving the acceptance of employees as stakeholders, which will secure the competitiveness, viability and prosperity of enterprises and the modernisation of public services.  Two joint directors have been appointed, together with clerical support. The process of appointing two additional staff is under way.</P>
      <P>The first meeting of the board was held on 24 September and the immediate work programme was agreed as follows: (i) the dissemination of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; through the identification and study of those organisations where successful partnership is in operation and where the lessons learned can be promulgated in both the private and public sectors; (ii) the monitoring of developments on partnership, including putting in place a national benchmarking survey and (iii) supporting partnership through training and development, in conjunction with IBEC, ICTU and other relevant organisations.  The joint directors are now working to this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a liaison group, chaired by my Department, is being established with representatives <Col N="1262" /> from IBEC, ICTU, the Irish Productivity Centre, the Labour Relations Commission, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  The role of the liaison group is to act as a communications forum and as a resource for the acquisition and dissemination of information and expertise on partnership and on training to support partnership.</P>

      <P>How much money is being provided for the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a definite work programme yet been agreed for the centre over the next two years, or is that a matter that remains to be dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A work programme has been agreed, although not for a two year period.  Based on the section in Partnership 2000, they have set out what they will be involved in over the next year or so.  They hope to identify and study what is best practice in the successful areas where this has been used.  They will work on everything involved with the liaison committee through the Irish Productivity Council as well as seeing what they can do to bring forward research by ICTU and IBEC.</P>
      <P>They have already received many suggestions about how this can be brought forward.  The two joint directors have been appointed and two additional staff will be appointed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any duplication between the activities of this new body and existing bodies? If so, how is that duplication to be reduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There probably will be duplication because bodies like the Irish Productivity Centre have been involved in these matters for some time.  However, as the Deputy will recall, in the negotiations on Partnership 2000 the view was taken that in trying to establish best practice and develop partnership in the future, it would be best to bring everybody onto the one agenda through this national partnership and to research some of the issues that have been well handled both in Irish industry and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>All the organisations involved have people of considerable expertise who are putting their own resources to work with this body.  While there may be some duplication, it will not create a difficulty in bringing forward a useful work programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the identities of the two directors and the location from which the centre operates?  Does the Government intend to make additional finance available to the IPC next year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for 1998 we will make available from under £200,000 to £500,000.  The <Col N="1263" /> directors are Mr. Gerry Grogan, a former president of IBEC, and Mr. John O'Dowd the general secretary of the civil service union.  Both have been involved successfully in successive programmes, as the Deputy will be aware.  At this stage they are working with the organisations and my own Department to bring matters forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the location of the centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage the directors are using the Department and their own agencies. They will need a permanent base because two higher executive officers will also take up duty shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it in-house, here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at present, but they will have a permanent base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach given any consideration as to how best practice models will be rolled out into Irish industry so that, moving on from research, companies that heretofore have not had partnership arrangements will adopt some form of partnership?  In the context of the Finance Bills specifically, is the Government considering either promoting employee share option schemes or employee profit sharing arrangements through tax measures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as their work programme is developed, the idea is that they will use the National Centre for Partnership in the first instance for the period of Partnership 2000. They will promote involvement, monitor developments, gather research and use the partnership groupings &mdash; the four pillars of Partnership 2000 &mdash; to send out their best practises, mainly from the Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Some organisations have spent resources over the years.  The social partners would argue that not enough has been spent.  However, the best practises can be developed by them.  In addition, the two directors and the staff through Partnership 2000 can send out what they believe are the models that should be developed into the future. That would prove to be a useful way of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Government put resources into rolling out these models, either through the use of tax vehicles that would make them easier to adopt or through any other methods it may decide to support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit of Partnership 2000, and the detailed section which the agreement contains on these issues, it behoves the Government to look at whatever suggestions are brought forward.  Suggestions have already been made regarding shares in companies and other measures would be legislated for under successive <Col N="1264" /> tax Bills.  Doubtless, new ideas will come forward and some of the best practises in the State at present will be included in the National Centre for Partnership.  The Government will support these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>IBEC is opposed to trade union recognition.  If the director of IBEC, Mr. John Dunne, is also director of the board of The National Centre for Partnership, how does the Taoiseach reconcile this, given that one of the purposes of the centre is to recommend trade union recognition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The director of IBEC, Mr. John Dunne, is also the director of the board of the National Partnership Centre.  However, Mr. Dunne has worked on all of the agreements, apart from one, in that position.  A working group is examining the issue of trade union recognition. The issues of partnership developed over some of those years must be further developed into the workplace.  The concept of worker participation at shop floor and office level has long been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to have partners if their existence is not recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue at difference between the two groups is subject to discussion between them.  I hope they can reach a conclusion. However, it is not one that is directed at the large enterprises.  It arises often in some of the unorganised and smaller parts of Irish labour.  It can be resolved.  If the major multinationals were involved the difficulties would be clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>IBM is not a small corner shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not one of the big ones. With regard to Deputy John Bruton's question on tax, some proposals have been made, especially with regard to relief and shares.  The social partners are again raising the issues of how workers in companies can have an opportunity to gain access to company shares and, in the process, gain tax relief.  This issue is worth examining.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A diverse group of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take supplementary questions. I met with Prime Minister Blair on Friday, 10 October in the margins of the Council of Europe Summit meeting in Strasbourg.  In the course of a useful discussion we reviewed progress on the talks, which we both agreed was satisfactory.  In addition to discussing the talks, I raised a number of issues including the proposed legislation on parades where I reiterated the Irish Government's position.  The public processions legislation, which was published on Friday last, reflects the concerns the Government had and, as I indicated last Friday, I welcome it in broad principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Friday, I also expressed satisfaction that sporting fixtures of all kinds, including Gaelic games, had been specifically excluded from the <Col N="1266" /> legislation.  In applying the legislation, it would be vitally important to distinguish legitimate expressions of cultural identity on different sides of the community which did not impinge on the rights of others from activities likely to give rise to intercommunal strife.</P>
    <P>I also raised the issue of Bloody Sunday at my meeting with the Prime Minister, and am satisfied a response to the Government assessment of the new material forwarded to the British Government will be forthcoming in the near future.  I met the relatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday last Tuesday.  I stressed my support for them and their campaign.  The Widgery report must be repudiated and the truth of Bloody Sunday must be clearly established.  On my way back to Ireland from Strasbourg, I met John Hume in Derry and reviewed with him progress on the talks and related issues.</P>
    <P>In our discussions on the talks, the Prime Minister and I agreed on the importance of the East-West dimension in its own right and in the context of the three stranded process.  A number of issues were raised such as social partnership, trade union recognition and minimum wage provision. There may be benefit in having further discussions with the British Government on those issues.</P>
    <P>On the specific questions about East-West co-operation, Deputies will be aware the issue of British-Irish relations was raised at my meeting with the Prime Minister on 3 July.  At that time, it was agreed to seek to develop, as appropriate, the programme of co-operation agreed in December 1995, together with initiatives covered by the joint statement issued on 23 May 1997.</P>
    <P>Concerning the possibility of Ireland participating in the national grid for learning, this project is still at a very early stage.  In earlier discussions between the relevant Departments on this issue, it was agreed contact would be maintained as this project was developed.  A document outlining potential areas of co-operation was recently prepared by IT experts in the Department of Education and Science and was forwarded to the Department for Education and Employment in the UK for consideration.</P>
    <P>A further meeting of appropriate officials from both sides is planned in the next few weeks to consider these proposals.  In addition, the Minister for Education and Science will meet his counterpart, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, at an early date to examine the possibilities for co-operation between our respective education sectors, having regard to the national grid for learning and the development of information and communications technologies in schools.</P>
    <P>Concerning progress in co-operation on food safety, the opportunity naturally arises for co-operation in areas of common interest in this field as both Administrations are currently involved in similar operations in the interests of food safety. As the proposed UK food standards agency is unlikely to be established before mid-1999, the <Col N="1267" /> formation of a formalised structure of co-operation is not a realistic option at this point.  I am pleased, however, that contacts at official level are ongoing.  As recently as last week, senior Irish and UK officials met in Dublin to discuss matters of mutual concern &mdash; both sides agreed the most productive area of co-operation at this point would be the sharing of scientific data in the field of food safety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree the only satisfactory outcome to the representations made by the previous Government to the British in regard to Bloody Sunday is a new inquiry to establish the full facts, and that anything short of that would be unsatisfactory?  Did the Taoiseach obtain any assurances from his British counterpart that this would be the outcome of the current consideration of the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated the view of the Government in that matter.  I have also outlined that view on a number of other occasions.  The position of the British Prime Minister is that he hopes the British assessment of the material will be concluded within a matter of weeks.  There was some delay because they were engaged in many other matters in regard to starting the talks process and preparing the legislation for the current programme.  However, the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, the British Prime Minister and some of the officials involved have assured me they will try to complete that assessment within the next few weeks and will report back at that stage.</P>
      <P>In fairness to them, I agreed not to comment on any detailed discussions we had until they make that position clear.  However, they did not give me an insight into any comprehensive assessment they have made at this stage.  I think it will go before their Northern Ireland committee before they brief any member of the Irish Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>On the parades legislation, is the Taoiseach concerned that a number of groups in Northern Ireland are already seeking to undermine the credibility of the commission by making false charges against it?  Will he indicate that he is satisfied with the make up of the commission, as it will have an important role in ensuring peaceful parades next year?  Given the British Government's welcome decision to exclude the GAA from the remit of this commission and the Taoiseach's close involvement with the association, will he ask it to offer a <i>quid pro quo</i> by dropping rule 21, which prevents members of the Northern Ireland police force from joining the GAA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the public processions legislation.  It will be debated in the normal way in the Houses of Parliament and may be amended but I praise its composition and the work which has gone into it.  I wish it well and we <Col N="1268" /> will do anything we can to promote its worth.  It is wrong to prejudge the effect of the legislation or those who will be on the commission.  There have been arguments on past issues but the legislation should be taken in the spirit in which it is introduced.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill has been amended because that provision would have affected the GAA and other sporting groups.  At the GAA congress two years ago it was stated that the issues surrounding membership by RUC officers would be debated in a few years &mdash; I think it will arise at the next congress and any decision will be a matter for the association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach ask the GAA to drop that rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on record as saying that in time, as the position improves and we move away from past difficulties, it will be far easier to do that.  It is a matter for people involved in the GAA in those areas to make that assessment.  A considerable number of resolutions were put down by GAA clubs suggesting that was the direction in which the association should move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's direct involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, would it not be a major confidence building measure for the GAA to do that?  Would he welcome such a move in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome it in the future.  As to the timing, when one starts considering the issue I do not agree with getting into the area of the <i>quid pro quo</i> and what one sporting body should do as against another.  I think that, with the passage of time, it is a move the GAA should make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What timeframe has the Taoiseach in mind for linking Irish schools to the British national grid for learning?  Given that the language in both areas is similar there are immense possibilities for North-South co-operation between schools if compatible computer equipment is used.  Does he agree it is important that he takes a personal interest in ensuring Ireland is linked to the national grid for learning and, further, that Ireland has an input into it, so that if it is to be a common grid the policy will be determined jointly by Irish and British policy makers, rather than having the policy drawn up by the British with Ireland offered an opportunity to co-operate on British terms and standards?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  There has already been contact at official level and there will be contact between the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Minister for Education and Science.  The &ldquo;Schoolnet&rdquo; component of the schools' IT 2000 programme in Ireland envisages a virtual meeting place, which I strongly support. The British national grid for learning sets out a number of points which include on-line versions <Col N="1269" /> of the curriculum operating in various parts of the UK, a virtual teachers' centre focusing on the professional development of teachers and information enabling pupils to participate remotely in, for example, science experiments involving space technology which would be too expensive otherwise. We can co-operate in these areas and thus be involved at a far lower cost than if we were trying to do so alone.  Mutual support and advancement possibilities and complementary activities in this area have been identified by the Department of Education and Science.  These matters have been communicated in an East-West discussion document which is being considered by the UK authorities and will be discussed further at a meeting in the near future between the Minister and the Secretary of State.</P>

      <P>With regard to the matter of east-west co-operation and discussions, has the Taoiseach raised the issue of Sellafield with the Prime Minister given that, after Northern Ireland, it is one of the issues of greatest contention between the two states?  What response has he had from the Prime Minister on that matter?  Is the matter being discussed in the context of the east-west discussion document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had other than brief discussions on that matter which have led to meetings set up by a number of my Government colleagues, the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources in particular.  A working liaison group has been set up to deal with issues concerning the Irish Sea which is a useful development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The management of the Irish Sea, including the issues of Sellafield, dumping in the Irish Sea and the use of that sea by the British for submarine exercises, could usefully be discussed on an east-west basis with a view to establishing an understanding of the purposes for which the Irish Sea should be used, given our equal concerns about the sea environment.</P>
      <P>With regard to Bloody Sunday, does the Taoiseach agree that an independent inquiry into the events of that day is needed and that the best way that can be effected is through an international body such as the UN?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>An independent inquiry is required.  I have stated my view on the Widgery Tribunal many times.  The new information which was put together by the good work of the last Government in a detailed assessment of the events requires that the matter be dealt with by an inquiry.  I am conscious that the relatives would far prefer that it was carried out by an international figure, not somebody from the UK.  That is a matter of which the British Government is aware and we await its assessment of the issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's first point, it is a matter that is being dealt with on an East-West basis.  In their co-operation with our Departments <Col N="1270" /> the British Government Departments have been very open.  On taking office the British Government made us aware of details that had not been in the public domain previously with regard to dumping in the Irish Sea.  It has agreed the setting up of the liaison group with the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and a convention has been signed in the recent past.  I detect that the British are extremely anxious to co-operate on these matters, particularly on the important issue of dumping which took place in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the progress made, but we are discussing co-operation between two Governments on a voluntary basis. If we are to get to grips with the problems that have arisen in the past with the Irish Sea regarding the discharge of waste from Sellafield and other issues that may arise in future, some form of institutional arrangement to jointly manage the Irish Sea will be needed.  That would be a fruitful issue for East-West negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">

      <P>I would not rule that out.  A report setting out what has been discussed already as well as new information will be ready before Christmas.  Perhaps then further co-operation can be considered.  This issue has been raised by different groups with me and other Ministers.  I have found no reluctance on the part of the British Government to co-operate in these matters and we will try to develop that.  The report due before Christmas will highlight the difficulties and problems that will have to be addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this, and the British Government position was not very certain. Our Department of Finance and Central Bank, through the Economic Monetary Institute, will form the basis of co-operation, but we must <Col N="1271" /> have firm understanding, in so far as is possible, with the British Government on what will happen after we join.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to take over EMU from the Minister for Finance, though I am capable of doing so.  I assure Deputy Quinn that assessments done by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have worked out strategically what would happen if Britain went in or stayed out in the short-term.  That data can come into play at any time.  We now have a clear idea of the direction the British Government will take in future.  It appears it may not join until 2004 or 2005, which allows concrete decisions to be made by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank in coming to an understanding, if they can, with the British Government.  I am conscious the Minister for Finance is very anxious to do that.</P>

      <P>I attended the Heads of State and Government Summit of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 10 October last.</P>
      <P>I have placed copies of my address to the summit in the Library of the House.  I have also placed copies of the declaration and action plan adopted at the summit in the Library of the House.</P>
      <P>In my address I welcomed the new permanent Court of Human Rights to be established under the aegis of the Council of Europe, and I emphasised the important role the court would play in the protection of human rights in the new Europe.  I also strongly supported the commitments in both the declaration and action plan to tackle drug trafficking and abuse and exploitation of children.  As I also stated in my address, I hope the initiatives and measures agreed at the summit will ensure that the Council of Europe can progress from standard setting in the area of human rights to widespread enforcement.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity in Strasbourg to have a number of bilateral meetings with other Heads of Government.  I will report separately on my meeting with Prime Minister Blair.  I also had meetings with the Prime Ministers of Turkey, Portugal and Sweden.  These meetings facilitated an exchange of views on matters of mutual concern notably, enlargement, future arrangements for the Structural and Cohesion Funds and employment policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the Council of Europe is grossly underfunded in <Col N="1272" /> respect of its ability to effectively develop new human rights initiatives in Europe?  Is this underfunding, which has been prevalent for many years, a serious obstacle to the development of a positive role for this organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation continues to encounter funding difficulties, which are being addressed in the context of its enlargement to 44 countries.  From November of next year &mdash; the organisation's 50th anniversary &mdash; it will take on not only its new role in respect of the central and eastern European countries but also the new court system dealing with human rights, in which judges from all member states will be involved. This will place an increased financial burden on the Council of Europe.  It was stressed at the Strasbourg meeting that if people wish the organisation to continue to play its key role in respect of human rights &mdash; I acknowledge its work since 1949 in this area &mdash; it must be granted adequate resources.  Included in the arrangements for the new court are structures which deal matters of finance, payment and the remuneration of the individuals concerned.  Agreement has been reached in this, which may be of assistance to the administration of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not merely discussing the funding of the court, but the funding of a European organisation with interests beyond the area of human rights.  Does the Taoiseach agree it was a waste of time to partake in a summit of this kind at Strasbourg and not deal with the question of funding?  How does he expect an underfunded organisation to deal &mdash; as he indicated it intends to deal &mdash; with crucial issues such as the fight against racism, the protection of national minorities and interracial stereotyping, which is quite common in Ireland?  Does the Taoiseach agree that an underfunded organisation cannot deal properly with these problems? Does he agree there is a need for an active organisation which is capable of intervening to deal with breaches of its conventions rather than a passive organisation which takes decisions at a snail's pace in respect of cases referred to it by the minority of citizens who can afford to refer them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The organisation is not underfunded to that degree.  Several thousand staff in more than 44 countries are actively involved in the development of human rights policies and are engaged in a tremendous amount of work and activity.  It is unfair to state that a gathering of more than 40 heads of state from countries throughout Europe to discuss business was a waste of time.  I am sure none of those involved believed it was a waste of time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton, in various capacities, served as an active and committed member of the Council of Europe and I know he would never consider his involvement a &ldquo;waste of time&rdquo;.  The organisation must face certain pressures with which it is attempting to deal and it has taken on a further remit.  In fairness to those involved in the organisation, they are conscious of the role it plays in respect of human rights. Deputy Bruton said it is moving at a snail's pace but it dealt with the Belarus issue promptly when it suspended that country from activities.  It also threatened to take prompt action against some other countries in the past year.  This is despite its difficulties in terms of funding since 1949.  It would be entirely wrong to give the impression the organisation is not trying to deal with human rights in a meaningful way.</P>

      <P>I recently raised the issue of the legislation and the implementation of various sections of the Act.  The number of people coming to Ireland recently has created great pressure. However, Ireland should feel proud of the way it is handling the situation <i>vis-a-vis</i> many other countries.  Housing and welfare support are arranged quickly for refugees and asylum seekers. This does not happen in many other EU member states.  Nevertheless, it is unacceptable that people must queue in the rain for appointments at impossible times.</P>
      <P>Legislation is available and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently set out how he intends to deal with this matter. However, a court case must be resolved before the sections can be implemented.  I am conscious this issue must be dealt with humanely but it is not comparable to the cases of human rights breaches outlined in Strasbourg.  However, Ireland has an obligation to refugees and asylum seekers here which must be honoured.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Would the Minister of State not agree that the so-called zero tolerance policy depends on quick, decisive and effective decisions?  This case occurred on 13 September, over five weeks ago, and should have been wrapped up in 48 hours.  A member of the public was arrested and brought to Dundalk Garda station.  This individual attempted to contact his local Garda station.  A doctor was called but was obstructed by a Garda checkpoint and turned back.  He was asked to turn off his mobile telephone, not to respond until 4 o'clock and then to ring Dundalk Garda station and pretend he had a puncture.  Eventually, the doctor had to get a Garda escort to Dundalk Garda station.</P>
      <P>We still do not have a report on this serious matter.  Is the Minister of State serious when she says that the Garda have still not concluded the investigation?  When can we expect a full report on this extremely serious matter?  It makes a total mockery of the concept of zero tolerance.</P>

      <P>If these reports are factual this is quite a serious matter.  I read this article and was extremely concerned.  I was also concerned because I know the Slane area well and I was anxious to establish the facts.  I have made as many inquiries as possible but at this point the Garda investigation is not concluded and, in the absence of such a conclusion, it is difficult to go into the details of the case.  Perhaps not all the facts are before us.  For example, the address I have obtained for the person detained was not a County Meath address.  In essence, we are dealing with a newspaper report.  I have endeavoured to establish the facts but in the absence of the full Garda report is it difficult to come forward with more information.</P>

When does the Minister of State expect to have that report on her desk?  Would she not agree that it is very serious offence to obstruct a garda in the course of his duties?  If an ordinary member of the public does so, he or she is charged and, invariably, there is a jail sentence.  In this case, members of the Garda <Col N="1276" /> Siochána obstructed other members of the force in the execution of their duties.  We have had a protracted, inconclusive, ongoing inquiry for five weeks and no action has been taken.  The facts of this case are known and the members of the force in question should be given their P45s and dispensed with.</P>

Every effort is being made to ensure that those facts are before us and a report has been requested as a matter of urgency.  I cannot give a date for the receipt of that report but such an occurrence would be serious.  I was as concerned as the Deputy on reading the strong reports in the newspapers regarding it.  I know the concern is genuine and as soon as the report is received it will be given immediate attention by the Department.  The businessman was not from Slane, County Meath, and did not give such an address.  It is a serious matter and an indepth investigation is being undertaken.</P>

      <P>On his appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister commenced a review of arrangements for processing applications for refugee status. Within a few weeks he was satisfied resources both in terms of staff numbers and basic facilities were inadequate to deal with the number of applications being lodged.  It is evident to all on a daily basis as we enter the Department the extent of the problem being faced.  The Minister, therefore, sought immediate action and obtained Government approval for additional staff to be appointed to the Department and for new premises to be obtained.</P>
      <P>In addition, a dispute about payment of legal fees which had prevented appeals against refusal of refugee status from being dealt with for nearly three years was resolved in June.  The Minister arranged for appeal hearings to recommence on 12 August.  Resolution of this dispute means it is now possible to finalise the processing of appeals against a finding that an individual has no entitlement to refugee status.  The Minister issued a statement, <i>inter alia</i>, about these measures on 6 August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recruitment of the additional staff is in hand and the Office of Public Works has in the past few days completed legal formalities for the acquisition of new accommodation.  Work on fitting out the new accommodation, estimated to cost £2.5 million, has started and the accommodation should be ready for use in February.  Until <Col N="1277" /> then the work of processing applications will continue in temporary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Minister met representatives of the UNHCR and discussions between that office and his officials are continuing with a view to establishing a procedure to deal with the backlog of cases which has built up over the past two years or so and which currently stands at about 3,500. Both the UNHCR and the Minister are satisfied the arrangement made in 1985 involving formal consultation with the UNHCR in each case is no longer workable due to the huge increase in numbers applying and that a new approach is necessary. The Minister wishes to place on record his appreciation of the advice and assistance being given by the UNHCR in the matter and especially, as part of that assistance, the acceptance by the UNHCR of his offer of part funding for the placement by the UNHCR of one of its staff in Dublin for the next 12 months or so to assist his Department in dealing with the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied these measures, taken together, will bring an improvement in the position, not just in fairness to those who have applied for refugee status who are entitled to a speedy decision, but also to the taxpayer who must support applicants and their families while a decision is pending.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Act, 1996, is dealt with in other questions and has, therefore, not been included in this reply.</P>

      <P>We have seen a distinct lack of urgency regarding this problem in recent months. There are 3,500 people awaiting a decision on their applications for asylum, with a three year waiting period.  The status of these people changes if they have children born here.  Is the Minister serious in addressing this problem?  He has already made passing comments regarding the legislation and whether it needs to be reviewed or if new legislation will be brought forward. He has also spoken of the High Court injunction which has delayed matters.  In the meantime he has a serious responsibility in this matter.

I know the Deputy has genuine concerns about it, but there is a huge number of cases and we want to ensure they are dealt with correctly and that additional staff employed are properly trained.  The Department is dealing with the employment of additional staff and the provision of the necessary premises with great haste. The unfortunate incident on 10 October which was referred to was deeply regretted.

For the third time, I ask the Minister to state the progress made in securing the agreement of staff interests to the recruitment of additional staff in the Department of Justice and the number of people it is proposed to employ.  The Minister cannot continue to say the matter is being dealt with and the Department is doing this, that or the other.

The Office of Public Works has been actively working to meet the accommodation needs of the additional staff who will be employed.  There was much debate on the suggestion that retired people should be employed to do this work.  It is proposed to employ approximately 70 people to deal specifically with this crisis which has arisen as a result of the increase in the number of refugees in recent years.  The recruitment of the additional 70 or so staff to the Department will take place speedily.  Applications have been received and when they are processed people will be interviewed for the jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a total of 276 sex offenders in prisons and places of detention on 16 October 1997.  Of these, 247 were sentenced offenders and 29 were on remand or awaiting trial.  There are currently two forms of therapeutic intervention available to sex offenders within the prison system, both aimed at enabling such offenders gain some measure of control over their offending behaviour.  The first is individual counselling by the Department's clinical psychology service and the probation and welfare service. This is available in all prisons, with the exception of the Curragh where it will be available shortly. The second is an intensive offence-focused group work programme available only in Arbour Hill prison.  Both forms of treatment are voluntary; offenders are encouraged to avail of the services but they are neither compelled to attend nor do they receive extra concessions for attending.</P>
      <P>The dedicated treatment in Arbour Hill caters for up to ten offenders at one time and takes ten to 11 months to complete.  The emphasis is on accepting personal responsibility for the offence and developing effective relapse prevention strategies for each offender.  All convicted sex offenders who are in custody are invited to apply to participate.  All those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are deemed suitable.  Where more than ten suitable offenders apply, preference is given to those nearing the end of their sentences and the others are offered a place on a subsequent programme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Given the overall number of 276 sex offenders, that only ten are receiving treatment is negligible.  What research has been carried out to monitor the effectiveness of the programmes?  What is the rate of reoffending? From the point of view of selling the programmes to the prisoners in question, what steps are taken to encourage as many as possible to undertake the programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the total number of offenders, ten seems to be a small number in receipt of treatment, but the fourth phase of the sex offender treatment programme is under way at present.  Ten offenders started the present programme and nine of those have continued to participate.  In previous programmes 30 offenders participated, with 27 completing the programmes.  One of the important aspects is that the programme is voluntary.  Those of us involved in such matters will understand that people cannot be forced to undertake this type of treatment. It must be approached with openness to ensure it is a success, and it will succeed if people are genuinely committed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" /> As regards the success rate of the treatment programme, it is important that people become involved in the programme so that it is a success. It is difficult to say how effective is the programme. Expert advice is that psychometric assessments carried out pre-treatment and post-treatment confirm a significant reduction in the offenders' cognitive distortions.  Cognitive distortions can be explained as pro-offending beliefs and attitudes that serve to maintain offending behaviour.  We are advised there has been a significant increase in the acceptance of personal responsibility for what happens in their lives.  In terms of success, it comes down to participation by the individual in the programme and how much he co-operates with it.  Those involved in running the programme can only do so much, the person only gets from it what he puts into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: I accept what the Minister has said.  Will she accept we have had a huge increase in the number of convictions for sexual offences?  Out of the 276 sex offenders, only ten received treatment, therefore, there are 266 people in prison who did not receive treatment. We have had a huge influx and soon there will be a huge exodus.  Does the Minister realise when these people are released from prison, are shunned by their families and society, have no jobs and a propensity to re-offend if they have not received treatment, we will have a chaotic problem?  Will she accept this prospect must be addressed urgently in terms of treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Participation by offenders in the programme is voluntary.  Experience over the past three years indicates that only 15 per cent to 20 per cent of imprisoned sex offenders are sufficiently motivated to apply for a place on the programme.  All those who apply are deemed suitable for participation and are accommodated. Up to ten sex offenders successfully complete the dedicated programme each year.  Approximately 60 offenders, some of whom would have served short sentences are released on completion of their sentence each year.  This is not an unreasonable proportion, bearing in mind that it is a voluntary programme with a rigorous selection process. Certainly those who apply for the programme and are committed to it will get a place.  It is important to ensure that treatment is available to those who are willing to avail of it.  Offenders who have completed their sentences cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the probation and welfare services or to take part in any specific programme.  It is important to recognise the probation and welfare service has a tradition where it offers voluntary support and guidance to offenders who seek it on release from custody. Attempts have been made to link some sex offenders who have completed the Arbour Hill programme with community based agencies on a voluntary basis on completion of their prison sentences. <Col N="1281" /> These attempts have been unsuccessful even with the best motivated offenders, due to the voluntary nature of the attendance.  However a small number of offenders who have completed the Arbour Hill programme are under mandatory supervision by the probation and welfare service on foot of court orders, which included one year periods at the end of their sentences being suspended under these conditions.  These are progressing satisfactorily and it is worth noting that they have been a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from listening to Deputy Shortall over the years that she has a genuine commitment to this area.  The most effective strategy in dealing with drug addicted offenders is a combination of appropriate treatment, education and rehabilitation.  To this end there are specially designed information programmes addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs in all our prisons.  The majority of offenders with drugs problems are located in institutions in the Dublin area and in particular in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
      <P>The medical treatment of drug addicts, in common with the provision of all medical services in the prisons system, is co-ordinated by the Director of Prison Medical Services.  The director liaises regularly with the health boards to ensure a level of primary health care for prisoners which is equivalent to that available in the community. Developments in medical services for drug addicts in the community are closely monitored with a view to their application in prisons where practicable.  I am pleased to note there has been an ongoing high degree of co-operation between the Eastern Health Board, including the agencies under its aegis, and my Department.  An example of this is the assistance received in the provision of the necessary professional services for a drug treatment facility in Mountjoy Prison which was established some time ago.  I hope this co-operation between the prisons and the Eastern Health Board, in the interest of tackling this community wide problem, will continue and where feasible expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Mountjoy drug treatment facility has been in operation for some time at the prison's health care unit.  This facility provides for humane detoxification and a therapy programme.  The unit is the first of its kind in a prison environment in the State and is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community.  My Department is examining <Col N="1282" /> the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available to prisoners.</P>
    <P>There are a number of options open where inmates have completed the detoxification programme. They can continue to serve their sentence in the general prison population.  If they are considered suitable they can be granted temporary release to continue treatment with an outside agency or they can opt for a transfer to the drug free unit.</P>
    <P>The drug free unit operates at the training unit which is adjacent to Mountjoy Prison and has accommodation for 96 prisoners.  This facility enables the prison authorities to accommodate prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse in a drug-free and secure environment within the prison system.  It also provides a sympathetic, but closely monitored, setting in which prisoners who are coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug-free status can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs in the general prison population.  The regime in the training unit will provide inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of gainful work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.  Prisoners in the Mountjoy treatment facility and in the drug free unit are closely monitored by regular and random urine testing.</P>
    <P>However, the position with regard to female prisoners is, unsatisfactory.  This is due to a large extent to the extreme overcrowding in the Mountjoy women's prison.  This issue is under continuous review between officials of my Department and the Eastern Health Board.  I hope an interim solution will emerge.  In any event, I am satisfied this issue can be resolved in the context of the move to the new purpose built women's prison which will be ready towards the end of 1998.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>We should stop fooling ourselves about this problem.  Mountjoy Prison is dominated by a drugs culture and successive Governments and authorities have failed to develop an effective response to the drug problem in prisons. Drug free units were set up last year.  Will the Minister of State distinguish between a drugs free unit and a drugs treatment unit?  Reputable reports on Mountjoy Prison indicate the majority of inmates are abusing opiates.  We are failing to address this problem.  Why do not the prison authorities consult the Eastern Health Board in the context of providing the type of drug treatment services that are available in the community? Much progress has been made in recent years in developing drug treatment services in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an immediate constituency in our prisons requiring drug treatment.  Why is the service in our prisons less adequate than in the community? The Eastern Health Board is more than willing to be involved on an agency basis, but the prison authorities will not face up to the serious <Col N="1283" /> problem that exists in relation to drug abuse.  We should stop fooling ourselves.  The Minister of State should indicate what steps she intends to take to provide drug treatment services and not simply drug free units in our prisons?  Ideally, all our prisons should be drug free, but how will we tackle the common problem of heroin addicted prisoners?  What services do we provide for those people other than giving them an opportunity to try a drug free existence?  That is inadequate for most drug addicts.  What treatment do we propose to provide?  No treatment has been provided up to now.  As far as I understand from what the Minister of State suggested, the Minister has no proposals to tackle this desperate matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>What proposals, if any, has the Minister to provide a drug free treatment service for the 60 per cent plus prisoners in Mountjoy Prison who are heroin addicts?  It is a disgrace that nothing has happened and I ask the Minister of State to give this matter her urgent attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of the need for counselling for offenders who are trying to give up illicit drugs.  Counselling is being provided by members of the Probation and Welfare Service with an input from a number of community agencies, but it is generally accepted that their efforts should be complemented by a dedicated addiction counsellor.  To that end I have asked the prisons division of the Department and the director of prison medical services, who has an important role in this area, to address this issue as a matter of urgency.  I am hopeful suitable arrangements can be entered into with the Eastern Health Board to address this need in the future.</P>
      <P>In regard to Mountjoy Prison and the Eastern Health Board area, the Eastern Health Board has been more than co-operative in this regard.  We must also bear in mind that we are working with the medical adviser of the director of prison medical services on the medical treatment of drug addicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Shortall on the distinction between the Mountjoy treatment facility and the drug free unit is important.  I clarify for the Deputy that the Mountjoy drug treatment facility has been in operation for some time at the prison's health care unit.  It is a separate unit and provides a humane detoxification and therapy programme.  It is the first of its kind in a prison environment in this State and is modelled on similar hospital based units in the community. The Department is currently examining the feasibility of further expanding the range of treatment options available to prisoners under the medical director in consultation with the Eastern Health Board to ensure, as pointed out by the Deputy, that what is available in the community should be <Col N="1284" /> available to inmates in Mountjoy Prison.  Separately, the drug free unit is in operation as a training unit.  It is a separate unit adjacent to the main prison and has accommodation for 96 prisoners. That facility enables the prison authorities to accommodate those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse in a totally drug free and secure environment within the prison system. It also provides a sympathetic yet closely monitored setting in which prisoners, who are in the process of coming to terms with their addiction and who have achieved stable drug free status, can serve out their sentences in an environment free from the temptations and risks associated with illicit drugs in the general prison population. The regime in the training unit will provide inmates with valuable opportunities in the form of a wide range of gainful work and training related activities to assist in the rehabilitation process.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, this unit is distinct, different and separate.</P>

I appreciate the <Col N="1285" /> Minister of State would not normally take this question and I extend my sympathy to the Minister for Justice on his loss.  However, is she not aware that the regime in prison is not the same as that outside as regards drug treatment?  She should consider that methadone has been proven as a treatment which provides some hope to addicts.  This is not presented to them in Mountjoy in the same way it might be outside the prison.  Will the Minister ensure that the medical policy in Mountjoy is altered and expanded so methadone is provided as an option to ensure that people whose lives can be transformed by this method of treatment are enabled to be cured of their addiction?  On the drug free unit, is the Minister satisfied that people who qualify to enter the unit can avail of the opportunity?  I know of some people who have tried to get into the unit but have been unable to.  It may be a question of space.  Can the Minister inform us about the adequacy of places and the people who may be waiting in line to enter the unit?</P>

If so, it is a cause for concern.  I will also query the availability of methadone as an option. I am advised there are specially designed information programmes in the prison addressing the risks associated with the misuse of drugs.

        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: Does the Minister of State agree that the resources being made available to try to solve the problems of heroin addiction in the prison are hopelessly inadequate? <Col N="1286" /> Did she not admit as much when she referred to primary health care in the prison being equivalent to that available in the community? Is the Minister of State aware that there are thousands of heroin addicts crying out for help who cannot find a place in a programme which would help them to come off heroin and begin to get their lives back together?  Has the Minister of State not heard the Governor of Mountjoy speaking of the need to view heroin addiction in the prison in an overall context?  Prisoners who have served their terms and are released back into the community are faced with long-term unemployment, bad housing and other problems and have no proper aftercare.  That ensures this vicious circle continues.</P>

I am advised that the necessary professional services are available in the drug treatment facility in Mountjoy; that facility is being actively monitored with regard to any possible improvements which could be made.  A special treatment facility has been in operation in the health care unit of Mountjoy prison for some time and is having an important effect.

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Mandatory custodial sentences apply at present only to the crimes of murder and treason and where there is a mandatory penalty of life imprisonment.  In the case of treason and murders that previously would have been capital murders, section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 obliges a court, in passing sentence, to specify imprisonment for a period of 40 years as the minimum period to be served.  A minimum of 20 years is set down for attempted murders to which that section applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1287" /> The House will be aware that, with the limited exceptions which I have mentioned, the traditional approach of the Oireachtas to sentencing matters has been to establish maximum penalties which apply to particular offences leaving it for a court to decide, in the light of all the circumstances of a particular case, to impose a penalty which it believes appropriate, subject to the maximum penalty set down in legislation.</P>
    <P>Generally, that approach to sentencing has served us well and I would not favour a wide extension of mandatory custodial penalties; I know I speak on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in making that point.  Nevertheless, the House will be aware that as the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Justice, the Minister, when in Opposition, proposed that minimum ten year sentences should apply in the case of serious drug trafficking offences.  Regrettably, this approach did not find favour with the Government of the day.  The Minister is more convinced than ever that the unique dangers posed by drug traffickers to the very fabric of our community clearly warrant exceptional measures.  Accordingly, the Criminal Justice Bill which the Minister will be publishing very shortly will include a provision for minimum ten year sentences in serious drug trafficking cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept, as the import of the initial part of her answer suggested, that a State's imposition of mandatory sentencing is fundamentally wrong and gives rise to the administration of bad law?  The proposal she outlined in the second part of her answer is such a proposal.  Given that she seems to suggest it is worthy of the Government to take from the Judiciary the power to deal with a case as presented before the courts, does she accept that sentencing policy on conviction by a court must bear a relationship to the fundamentals of the case, that each and every case is unique and that the imposition of mandatory sentences is, in effect, tying the hands of the Judiciary?  Does the Minister accept that the Judiciary in some circumstances should have their hands tied in the manner in which the Minister proposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons involved in trafficking controlled drugs to the value of £10,000 are, by any definition, playing a major role in the illegal drugs trade.  The legislation the Minister expects to bring forward is to deal with this important issue.  Ten thousand pounds worth of drugs is quite substantial and a minimum ten year sentence would appear appropriate.  The provision will be drafted in such a way as to include appropriate safeguards.  These details will be clear once the Bill is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware the average sentence on conviction for a person convicted of murder is approximately eight to nine years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1288" /> Is the Minister seriously suggesting it is fair in any jurisdiction to implement a law whereby somebody found with a pocketful of cannabis will serve more time in prison than a convicted murderer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people consider dealing to that extent in drugs of that type would be very close to the other very serious crime to which the Deputy referred.  I do not know that any of us could realistically refer to £10,000 worth of cannabis as a pocketful of cannabis.  It certainly would have to be viewed by the Oireachtas as substantially more serious than that.</P>

      <P>I am not able to say, but drug trafficking to that extent is a very serious crime, bearing in mind the substantial impact this has had on so many families and particularly on young people.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that nobody could say this is not a hugely serious crime.  In the climate in which we are operating today the Minister feels it is important to introduce mandatory sentencing because of the seriousness of the crime.</P>

        <i>(Mayo)</i>: Would the Minister of State agree this is a knee-jerk reaction by her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, in that when he discovered the Garda Commissioner frowned on his zero tolerance policy he decided to dilute zero tolerance and to apply it to one aspect of crime, namely, drugs?  Has there not always been zero tolerance in the case of drugs, particularly among the Judiciary who, without mandatory sentencing, have always handed down very heavy punitive sentences?  Does the Minister not realise there is every likelihood that by taking discretionary powers from the Judiciary and introducing minimum sentencing he is doing something that, even though politically popular in the short term, will ultimately be proven to be unconstitutional when the Bill is finally examined if it is passed?</P>

      <P>When the Law Reform Commission reported in July 1996 the then Minister, Deputy Owen, said that she recognised there were great complexities involved in relation to some of the recommendations contained in the report.  For example, the commission recommended the abolition of mandatory and minimum sentences for imprisonment for indictable offences.  This would mean in practice that mandatory life sentences would be abolished. Deputy Owen said that while she respected the views of the commission she was conscious that there were cogent arguments for maintaining the <i>status quo.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that point but the Law Reform Commission did not recommend an extension of mandatory sentencing.  Does the Minister of State not think that her words sound hollow when one considers that during the watch of the current Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, who has committed himself to a policy of zero tolerance to get to grips with the problem of drug dealing, a man charged with possession of £1.5 million worth of drugs was mistakenly let out on bail?  This is the first time I have heard the figure of £10,000 mentioned in relation to drug trafficking. Is the Minister of State aware that there are instances where drug addicts are involved in dealing to feed their habit and that on occasion judges in sentencing have taken into account the fact, even where the charge is a serious one, that an addict has attended for treatment and is clean?  Is she not concerned that this facility would no longer be available and that a young life could be blighted as a result of what appears to be an arbitrary decision by the Minister which goes against the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission in every way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Oireachtas has taken the view that drug trafficking poses a unique threat and that special measures in relation to sentences need to be taken.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto contained a commitment to provide for mandatory ten year sentences for those caught in possession of controlled drugs with a street value of £10,000 and over.  This received substantial coverage at the time.  This is not therefore the first time the figure of £10,000 has been mentioned. We are being consistent.  The Minister said in the House previously that it is hard to imagine a more corrosive threat to the quality of life in our community than that posed by those who engage in the evil trade of drug trafficking. Their activities have resulted in death and destruction on an incalculable scale.  As we are all aware, families have been destroyed and communities placed under siege.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputies is as follows.  Ireland's extradition arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland are governed by the simplified extradition procedures set out in Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965, while Ireland's extradition arrangements with countries other than Britain and Northern Ireland are governed by Part II of the Extradition Act, 1965.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ireland is a party to the 1957 European Convention on Extradition and to a number of international conventions mainly in the aviation field which provide for extradition for the specific offences comprehended by those conventions. If the Deputies require further information in relation to them, I shall be happy to supply it.</P>
      <P>Apart from our arrangements with Britain and Northern Ireland under Part III, an order was made applying Part II of the 1965 Extradition Act to the following countries party to the European Extradition Convention: Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.</P>
      <P>With regard to countries not party to the European Convention, orders have also been made applying Part II of the 1965 Act to the USA and Australia following the negotiation of bilateral extradition treaties with those countries.</P>
      <P>The Minister recently approved an amended draft of an extradition treaty with Canada which has been submitted to the Canadian authorities. The Minister has also conveyed his approval of the opening of negotiations with the Republic of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> South Africa on a draft extradition treaty between our two countries.</P>
    <P>A new draft order to apply Part II of the 1965 Act to a number of additional European countries, which have become parties to the 1957 European Convention, is being prepared at present by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The countries concerned are Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.</P>
    <P>Two new EU conventions were concluded recently in order to facilitate and improve, as between member states of the European Union, the extradition arrangements provided for in the 1957 European Convention on Extradition.  The first of these, the EU Convention on Simplified Extradition Procedures, was formally adopted by all member states on 10 March 1995.  This convention deals with the procedure to be applied where a person consents to extradition.  The second convention, the EU convention relating to extradition, was formally adopted by all member states on 27 September 1996.  This convention improves and simplifies extradition arrangements between member states.  Work on the preparation of the necessary legislation to enable Ireland to ratify these two conventions has begun in the Department. The Minister will bring forward his proposals as part of his extensive legislative programme as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Events have overtaken the answer to this question since I tabled it some weeks ago. As I pointed out to the Minister in the course of the debate on the Europol Bill, I began to wonder whether we had extradition treaties with any countries.  I asked him then why one could read of a litany of Irish criminals, particularly drug barons, in countries such as England and in places like Amsterdam and the Costa del Sol, whose names and whereabouts were known, yet we did not appear to be doing anything about having them extradited.  That led me to wonder whether we had extradition treaties with, say, Holland and Spain, fellow member states of the European Union.  If we are to resolve our crime and drugs problem does the Minister agree that there remains a large number of people whose extradition we should be seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree.  I know Deputy Deasy is genuinely concerned about this subject, having been present during the debate on the Europol Bill when he raised these matters and having passed on his concerns to the Minister. He also raised them separately with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before extradition is sought a suspect must have been charged with the extradictable offence, convicted of such an offence, or there must be sufficient evidence to justify charging the person with the extradictable offence.  This matter has been gone into in great detail since the Deputy <Col N="1292" /> raised it in the course of the debate on the Europol Bill.</P>
    <P>The decision on whether to proceed with making an extradition request for the purpose of bringing a person before the courts on criminal charges is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent in the exercise of his functions.  My understanding is that among the issues considered by the DPP in any individual case is whether sufficient evidence exists to enable criminal proceedings to proceed should that individual's extradition be secured.  The concerns the Deputy raised on Second and Committee Stages and again today have been noted in the Department and certain people are very concerned with regard to his questions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There are a number of ways in which we develop agreements with other countries.  We currently do not have extradition arrangements with Belgium or Portugal but that is because they had not acceded to the l957 European Convention when the last order was made <Col N="1293" /> in l989.  Both countries are now parties to the l957 convention and the order being prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs will apply Part II of the l965 Act to them.  It is not necessary for a case to arise.  In the European context a treaty may be established when a country has acceded to the l957 convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach propose to make a statement in the House on suggestions he made about named Members who he suggested might have leaked Government documents, in particular the references he made to me by name?  Does the Taoiseach accept that I did not <Col N="1297" /> leak any Government documents, did not authorise anyone to do so and, in the case of the documents referred to, could not have done so because I left my copies of these documents in the Department and they are now in his possession, not mine?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is out of order on the Order of Business, but I will allow the Taoiseach to comment briefly.  There cannot be a discussion or debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to comment.  I noted what Deputy John Bruton said outside the House on what I said on this matter and it is incorrect. There are no grounds for me to withdraw what I said about anything which has arisen from this controversy.  I would like to state what I said rather than what people imagine I said.  I made three comments on this matter.</P>
      <P>The first was on Thursday night when I said: &ldquo;Only a few people see the documents.  I do, as Taoiseach, and the previous Taoiseach also received a document.  Perhaps the previous Taoiseach can explain that&rdquo;.  I have nothing to withdraw there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I stated: &ldquo;Very few people received the document.  I did not receive the document last January.  Those senior people who were in office at that stage received the document.  Deputy Bruton said he received a document and I am sure he would clarify the truth to the country as to whether it was him&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton then made a statement and, as soon as he had made the statement, I said that if Deputy Bruton said he did not do it, then, naturally enough, I would accept that.  These documents are very restricted.</P>
      <P>I received a letter yesterday from Deputy Bruton to which I intend to reply.  I received it just before 6 p.m. but it was referred to on the 6 o'clock news before I got a chance to read it.  In the letter, Deputy Bruton states he did not take any documents from the Department and I readily confirm that when I checked it that was the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. D. Carey Mr. D. Carey">

      <P>Deputy Bruton asked me to reply and I would like to do so.  The Deputy points out that I should have had time in the five days to check the files with the staff in my Department, that if I had done so, I would have found out that he did not take any green books with him when he left office, nor did any of my <Col N="1298" /> staff.  Furthermore, I would have discovered that it was his practice to return all such reports, when read, to his officials.  In reply to the letter which I intend sending to Deputy Bruton, I will make it absolutely clear that he did not take any documents out.  However, I will not agree with the second part of his letter, that none of his staff did.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem with calling people's character into question.  I have been waiting three weeks for Deputy Bruton to withdraw baseless allegations he made against me.

      <P>In relation to other matters that were raised, when I gave confidential information it was based on a letter that is now in the public domain, so there is no need for Deputy Barrett to raise those issues.  Deputy Bruton has asked me a question and I will answer it in so far as it relates to him.  He did not take the documents.  I will convey the information within my Department to him in my letter.  However, it is a matter for Deputy Bruton or the Garda to follow up all of these matters.  I am sure they will interview many of us in this House.  They might interview me.  They have already interviewed my officials.  I am not making any allegations but I am stating that what Deputy Bruton said in his letter about none of his staff being involved, is not correct. That is all I am stating.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1305" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997, is intended to provide a framework which will enable Ireland to market itself as an attractive venue for international commercial arbitrations.  It achieves this aim by adopting the Model Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law which deals with international commercial arbitration.  The Commission is generally referred to as UNCITRAL and, during the late 1970s and early 1980s it devoted a considerable amount of time to drafting the Model Law which was finally adopted by it on 21 June 1985.</P>
      <P>The Model Law sets a standard for a modern code of international arbitration practice and it is one which I am glad to propose to this House for adoption by Ireland.  Indeed, the law has already been enacted into legislation by a substantial number of countries, including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Scotland, and by a number of American states.  It is worthwhile to point out that, in adopting this law as part of our domestic legislation, Ireland is following a well recognised international trend.</P>
      <P>The Bill follows on representations from the International Financial Services Centre, the Law Society, the Bar Council and a number of specialists in the area of arbitration.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that arbitration is concerned with the resolution of disputes outside the ordinary court system.  It is an example of what is known as Alternate Dispute Resolution or ADR. The use of ADR has expanded considerably in recent years and is recognised as being particularly suited for resolving disputes of a commercial nature which have connections with two or more countries.  This is because the parties to such disputes will frequently be involved in long-term commercial relationships and will wish to seek solutions to their problems which will not jeopardise those relationships.  Arbitration, by tackling the dispute at a pre-court stage, can help to bring the parties in dispute to just this kind of solution.</P>
      <P>In these relationships, the confidentiality of sensitive commercial material may also be an issue and arbitration, with its guarantee of privacy, provides the kind of security which the parties may value.  Properly managed, arbitration can be cheaper and speedier than litigation.  It offers a flexibility of approach in specialised disputes and parties have the option to appoint as arbitrator someone who is an expert in the area in question. At the end of the day, arbitration, unlike other forms of ADR, is backed up and enforceable by law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to realise that much of arbitration practice is not regulated by statute and that the parties to an arbitration agreement have considerable autonomy in determining how their arbitration should be conducted.  The statutory framework for arbitration which now exists in Ireland is provided primarily by the Arbitration <Col N="1306" /> Acts of 1954 and 1980, and these Acts will continue to be important for arbitrations which are not covered by the scope of this Bill.  However, for the type of arbitration dealt with by this Bill, the 1954 legislation would seem to be problematic.</P>
    <P>Typically, the parties in dispute are likely to be the subsidiaries of large multinational corporations or financial institutions and the 1954 Act, which does have a somewhat domestic focus, does not readily commend itself to these parties.  In the 1990s, the world is becoming a more connected place.  Business dealings involving two or more commercial entities based in different geographic locations are commonplace and such entities look to familiar rules to resolve commercial disputes rather than to a regime which is geared to more local concerns.</P>
    <P>In presenting this Bill I pay tribute to the work of an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group chaired by Mr. Michael McDowell, SC.  The initial draft of the Bill was prepared by that committee and underpinning the work which went into it was a significant degree of consultation with those who were specialists in the field of arbitration.  The work of that group, in combination with the work subsequently done within my Department and the Office of the Attorney General, has resulted in a legislative product which has benefited considerably by being exposed to a variety of experiences and views.  I am confident that the Bill, in providing for the adoption of the Model Law, is a desirable aid to the development of international arbitration in this country.  It will provide a familiar legal environment for those who have decided to resort to arbitration to resolve their disputes and, in this way, should facilitate the conduct of major international arbitration hearings in this country.</P>
    <P>Before dealing directly with the provisions of the Bill itself, it might be useful to outline briefly the philosophy which lies behind the Model Law. When it was drafted, the perception was that international trade would benefit greatly from the harmonisation of national legislation relating to the resolution of international disputes.  The idea was that this could happen either by countries adopting the Model Law in its totality or by adjusting their existing legislation to bring it into line with the Model Law.  Bearing in mind its intended audience, the text of the Model Law is couched in pragmatic terms and is written in relatively plain language.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main elements of the Model Law itself, the text of which is included as a Schedule to the Bill.  The Model Law specifies that the term &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; should be given a wide interpretation so as to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or otherwise.  Examples of matters which come within the scope of the law include any trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services, various types of financial services such as investment, financing, banking and insurance, and various forms of industrial or business co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> The Model Law, which as I have already indicated is limited in scope to international commercial arbitration, is divided into a series of chapters dealing with a wide variety of issues which arise in the course of the international arbitration process. Chapter I deals mainly with the issue of scope.  Chapter II focuses on the form of the arbitration agreement while Chapter III deals with the composition of the arbitral tribunal &mdash; for example, the number of arbitrators, how they are to be appointed and how such appointments may be challenged.  Chapter IV deals with certain matters pertinent to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.  Chapter V covers the conduct of the arbitral proceedings including the determination of rules of procedure, the place of arbitration and the right of each party to be given a full opportunity to present his or her case.  Chapter VI has rules relating to the making of an award.  It must be in writing and, unless the parties otherwise agree, must state the reasons upon which it is based.  Chapter VII specifies the grounds upon which an award may be set aside.  These include the fact that a party may have been under some incapacity, that the award deals with a matter falling outside the scope of the submission to arbitration, or that the award is in conflict with public policy.  Chapter VIII deals with the recognition and enforcement of awards and the grounds upon which such recognition and enforcement can be resisted.  Those grounds are substantially the same as those which apply to the setting aside of an award.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Part I of the Bill contains standard provisions in relation to short title, commencement and references. The Bill will come into operation three months after its passing.  The central elements of the Bill are contained in Part II.  Section 4 contains standard interpretation provisions.  The key provision in the Bill is section 5 which provides that, subject to Part II of the Bill, the Model Law shall apply in the State.  The &ldquo;subject to&rdquo; provision is included in this section to make it clear that the application of the Model Law in the State, while generally intended to apply in an unrestricted manner to international commercial arbitration proceedings, is made subject to other provisions in Part II of the Bill which, by and large, supplement the Model Law in a variety of ways.  Such supplementary provisions extend to matters such as the award of interest by the arbitral tribunal, the allocation of costs in respect of arbitral proceedings and the liability of arbitrators when undertaking arbitration work.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains certain clarificatory provisions. In particular, subsection (2) provides that the documents of UNCITRAL and its working group relating to the preparation of the Model Law may be considered in ascertaining the meaning or effect of any provision of that law.</P>
    <P>Those who opt for arbitration, particularly in the commercial arena, do so because of the need for finality which requires that there be minimal <Col N="1308" /> interference from outside bodies, including the courts, in the arbitration process.  Accordingly, one of the purposes of incorporating the Model Law into the State's arbitration code is to limit the extent to which a court may intervene in that process.  This question of court involvement in the arbitration process is, perhaps, the most significant example of the way in which the Model Law differs from our existing legislative regime and it merits a few words of explanation.  Under the 1954 Act, it is open to an arbitrator to state a consultative case on a question of law arising in the course of a reference and he or she can also be directed to do so by the court.  The court may also direct that an award &mdash; essentially the arbitrator's decision &mdash; be stated in the form of a special case for the decision of the court.  In practice, the courts use their discretion in this area very sparingly and tend to be conscious of the need to uphold the integrity of the arbitral process. However, for those unfamiliar with the practice of our courts the language of the statutes can appear to be somewhat forbidding and, indeed, could be used to suggest that Ireland has an arbitration regime which has a heavy court involvement.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the Model Law provides for a State, when enacting that Law, to specify the court competent to perform certain functions specified in that Article.  Those functions deal with the scope of court intervention in the international commercial arbitration process and include, for example, the power of the court under Article 11(3) to appoint a third arbitrator for arbitration proceedings where three arbitrators are required and where, <i>inter alia</i>, the other two arbitrators fail to agree on such an appointment, and the power to set aside, in accordance with Article 34(2), an arbitral award. On this latter point, the Model Law specifies clearly that the exclusive recourse against an arbitral award is to seek to have it set aside by a court on grounds which are limited in number to six by the Model Law itself.</P>
    <P>In addition to specifying the High Court as the court for the purposes of Article 6, section 7 (1) also specifies the High Court as the court for certain other purposes which are provided for in the Model Law.  Article 9 allows a party to an arbitration agreement to request interim measures of protection from a court.  Article 27 allows for court assistance in taking evidence.  Article 35 deals with the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards and Article 36 sets out the grounds on which a court may refuse recognition and enforcement.  Subsections (2) and (3) of the section are mainly concerned with procedural issues governing the bringing of applications to the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) provides for arbitral proceedings to be consolidated with other arbitral proceedings with the agreement of the parties to those proceedings or for the holding of concurrent hearings on such terms as may be agreed.  Section 9 gives the arbitrator wide-ranging powers in relation to <Col N="1309" /> the granting of interest on an award.  The Model Law does not deal with the question of interest and this provision is intended to introduce clarity into our arbitration code.  In particular, subsections (2) and (3) make it clear that a tribunal may grant interest on any amount awarded by it in respect of the period up to the date of the award. Under our existing law there is some uncertainty as to the ability of an arbitrator to award interest prior to the date of an award.</P>
    <P>The cost provisions of the arbitration are dealt with in section 10.  Under subsections (1) and (2) the parties to an arbitration agreement are free to agree on how the costs of the arbitration, which include the costs of the arbitrators' fees and expenses, are to be allocated and on the costs that are recoverable.  However, where there is no agreement of the parties as to costs, subsection (3) provides that the arbitral tribunal may determine by award the recoverable costs of the arbitration on the basis that it thinks fit and, in that context, also provides for certain matters to be specified by the tribunal such as the items of recoverable costs and by and to whom those costs shall be paid.  Under subsection (4) if the arbitral tribunal does not determine such costs any party may apply to the tribunal within 30 days after being notified of the award for an amendment specifying the matters referred to in subsection (3).  Under subsection (5) the arbitral tribunal is mandated to amend the award in the appropriate way after notice to the other parties.  Subsection (6) provides that the High Court, on application by any party within 30 days after the applicant is notified of the arbitral tribunal's award of costs, may order that the amount of any costs awarded by an arbitral tribunal shall be reviewed and adjusted by the means and on the terms that court may direct.</P>
    <P>Section 11 makes it clear that an arbitrator shall not be liable for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of his or her functions as arbitrator unless the act or omission is shown to have been in bad faith.  These protections are extended to the arbitrator's employee, agent or adviser and to an expert appointed under Article 26 of the Model Law by subsection (2).  Subsections (3) to (5) contain similar provisions in respect of institutions or persons by whom an arbitrator is appointed or nominated. Subsection (6) provides that witnesses who give evidence before an arbitral tribunal shall have the same privileges and immunities as are given to witnesses in proceedings before the High Court while subsection (7) provides that a barrister or solicitor or person holding equivalent qualifications who appears in proceedings before an arbitral tribunal shall have the same privileges and immunities as barristers and solicitors have in proceedings before the High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 12 contains an exception to Article 34 (3) of the Model Law which specifies a time limit of three months for an application to be made to set aside an arbitral award.  The section provides this time limit shall not apply to an application to <Col N="1310" /> the High Court to have an arbitral award set aside on the grounds that the award is in conflict with the public policy of the State.</P>
    <P>The ability to enforce an award is central to the arbitration process.  Section 13 (1) provides for an award made by an arbitral tribunal to be enforceable in the State either by action or by leave of the High Court in the same manner as a judgment or order of that court.  This section also allows for interim measures of protection made by an arbitral tribunal under Article 17 of the Model Law to be similarly enforced.</P>
    <P>The recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards is dealt with in a number of international conventions which have already been given the force of law in the State by the Arbitration Acts of 1954 and 1980.  Section 14 (4) makes it clear that nothing in section 13 affects the recognition and enforcement of awards under these conventions.  Only if the arbitration award is not already covered by one of these conventions will the recognition and enforcement provisions of the Model Law come into play.  This provision is fully in keeping with the framework envisaged by the Model Law.</P>
    <P>New legislation often requires transitional provisions to clarify the circumstances in which it will or will not apply, particularly in the initial stages of its operation.  The arbitration proceedings to which this Bill applies are set out in section 14. In the interests of fairness to those parties who may have commenced arbitration proceedings before the day on which the Act comes into operation, subsection (1) of that section makes it clear that Part II of the Bill shall not apply to such proceedings unless the arbitration is concluded after that day and the parties so agree.  Subsection (2) provides that Part II shall apply to relevant arbitrations commenced on or after the day on which the Act comes into operation under an arbitration agreement entered into on or after that day.  Where the arbitration agreement has been entered into before that day, it is open to the parties to agree that the Bill's provisions shall apply.  Subject to the exception provided for in section 13(4) to which I have already referred, section 15 ensures that the Arbitration Acts 1954 and 1980 shall not apply to international commercial arbitrations.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis of this Bill is on international commercial arbitration.  However, the opportunity is also being taken to bring the domestic interest provisions contained in section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1954 into line with those contained in section 9 in respect of international arbitrations.  Section 34 of the 1954 Act provides that a sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry interest as from the date of the award at the same rate as a judgment debt.  The more detailed provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of the new section 34 are in general identical to those of sections 9 (1) to 9 (4) of the Bill which I described to the House earlier in my speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> The new section 34 deliberately excludes property arbitrations from its scope.  This is a specialised category of arbitration and one where there is already a body of detailed legislative provisions. Accordingly, it is provided under subsection (6) that section 34 shall not apply to an arbitration conducted by a property arbitrator appointed under section 2 of the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Having gone through the provisions of the Bill, l draw Deputies attention to the fact that its introduction coincides with the very welcome development by the Bar Council of a major international arbitration centre in its new Law Library building in Church Street, Dublin.  The centre, which will open in January 1998, will provide 10,000 square feet of purpose built facilities for international arbitrations, including large hearing rooms, translation services, video conferencing and state of the art electronic services.  I understand the Bar Council will market the centre abroad and a large potential market in international commercial arbitrations has been identified.  I wish the Bar Council well in its efforts to attract such business and I am glad to be in a position to put the legislation in place which should make that task easier. The Bill is an example of the way in which the Government and business interests can work together to generate work for specialist services as well as ancillary work for the service industries.</P>
    <P>Central to a successful arbitration are the skills the arbitrator brings to bear upon his or her task. Ireland is fortunate in that it can offer a high level of legal and professional services to those who wish to hold their arbitration here.  We also have a pool of highly experienced international arbitrators who are well placed to take advantage of the supportive framework which this Bill will create.  In addition, education in arbitration matters is a growth area and will ensure that many more individuals are able to develop their careers in this field.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that international arbitration services are now offered in most major capital cities as a result of the desire in the international trading community that disputes be resolved quickly, fairly, cheaply and in accordance with commonly agreed rules.  London, Paris, Geneva and Stockholm have capitalised on this growing market.  London, a relatively recent entrant to the market, is estimated to generate £100 million annually from its international arbitration business.  It is noteworthy that many commercial arbitrations in Europe are conducted under the auspices of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce which administers more than 400 requests for arbitration each year.  Where the parties agree to abide by ICC rules, which would not be uncommon, the ICC court would often be involved in choosing a venue for the arbitration which it would regard as compatible with its rules. Our new legislation has this compatibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I hope Ireland can build upon those factors which, in combination, should make us an attractive venue for international arbitrations.  We have the expertise available in this jurisdiction, we have a first class telecommunications infrastructure, we are located on a hub between the US, Europe and the Middle and Far East and there is also the exceptional value and quality we offer in our travel, accommodation and recreational facilities.  Furthermore, the English language is, by and large, the language of international commerce and this is something I hope we can exploit.  There is now the added element of this legislation which makes our international arbitration regime compatible with that of our trading partners, which should prove a significant attraction for those wishing to arbitrate their dispute in a neutral venue which has legislation which operates to a familiar and valued set of rules.</P>
    <P>Since the Dáil resumed on 30 September, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought three Bills before the House.  The Children Bill is designed to update the law on guardianship, custody of and access to children and to deal with the evidence of children in civil proceedings.  The Europol Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the EU Convention on the establishment of a European police force.  The Bill now before the House, the Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997, will, I hope, mark the beginning of Ireland's development as a centre of excellence in the business of international commercial arbitration.  Taken together, these three Bills testify to the diversity of work which is now taking place within my Department.  In broad terms, they span the range of criminal, civil and commercial legislation.  The Minister and I look forward to publishing equally wide-ranging proposals in the future and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Mayo)</i>: The Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997, is to be welcomed on several fronts, because Ireland has shown the capacity on the international stage to compare and compete with the best in many areas of endeavour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre, quoted as an organisation which has been pressing for this legislation, has been a phenomenal success.  Those who had the vision to conceive the idea and, more importantly, the determination to run with it deserve our commendation.  It showed a welcome confidence and readiness to enter full-bloodedly into top level financial sector involvement, an area hitherto shied away from, which represented a certain degree of psychological inferiority.  One need only look at the scale of the development to date, with l,026 million square feet of office space built and a further 220,000 square feet under construction. A multi-storey car park, hotel, pubs, shops and 333 apartments have been constructed.  While the proposed £130 million Eco Centre for the IFSC has been the subject of a negative Government <Col N="1313" /> feasibility study, it does nevertheless set in perspective the scale of ambitious projects envisaged for the further expansion and development of the centre.  Like the Minister of State, I am delighted to welcome the Bar Council's International Arbitration Centre on Church Street. When it is completed, it should attract the type of large scale arbitration traffic it deserves.</P>
    <P>Just as Ireland has proven to be a most attractive base for some of the biggest players in the financial services sector, it also has the capacity to become a most attractive location as an international arbitration centre if certain alterations are made to our domestic law.  Irish arbitration law at present is seen as most unattractive in the field of international law and in some cases this could be seen as a definite deterrent.</P>
    <P>Adoption of the Model Law has certain undoubted advantages over the creation or the drafting of a complete new law to cover international commercial arbitration.  First, by adopting the Model Law one is in unison with what is happening on the international stage.  There was anxiety seven or eight years ago that by opting for the Model Law, a country could find itself exposed or isolated given the fact that so few countries had opted for the Model Law at that stage; one could not be sure that some other more generally accepted model or norm might be arrived at which would have greater universal acceptance.</P>
    <P>For example, the Preliminary Report of the Law Relating to International Arbitration in Ireland, published by the Legislation Sub-Committee of the Irish Branch of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators in March 1989, listed this as a perceived disadvantage of adopting the Model Law at that stage.  The report states:</P>
    <P>the Model Law has been adopted so far only by a limited number of countries and there is no guarantee that its adoption or acceptance will be by any means universal and if, because of perceived shortcomings, other countries do not adopt or favour the Model Law, those countries that have adopted the Model Law may be isolated</P>
    <P>In the interim it has transpired, as the Explanatory Memorandum outlines, that some 25 countries have now enacted legislation based on the Model Law.  By joining such a substantial and growing cohort of Model Law countries, Ireland is helping to ensure that a standard form of International Arbitration Law in countries throughout the world should lead to a uniform standard in both practice and procedure.  The Model Law is not perfect but it is as near to an acceptable set of common denominator regulations and practices as one will get.</P>
    <P>One notes, for example, that British Columbia, the first of the Canadian States to adopt the Model Law, introduced several amendments to it, going out of its way to ensure as little court involvement as possible, excluding the courts even more than is the case under the Model Law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Their adopting legislation allowed for reference to the <i>Travaux Préparatoirs</i> for interpretation purposes.  There is also provision for arbitration hearings to be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
    <P>Hong Kong deleted the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; so that the Model Law would apply to all international arbitration, and again it included the <i>Travaux Préparatoirs</i> as a key reference point. There is also provision for court proceedings arising out of an arbitration to be heard <i>in camera.</i> While some States have, therefore, inserted their own particular amendments, the essence of the Model Law remains intact.  Other States have adopted the Model Law without amendment with even countries such as Switzerland and the Netherlands, which did not adopt the Model Law because they were far advanced in preparation of their own arbitration laws when the Model Law was introduced, not differing substantially from it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to examining the Bill in greater detail on Committee Stage.  However, I seek clarification from the Minister now on Article 5, which states that &ldquo;in matters governed by this Law no court shall intervene except where so provided in this Law.&rdquo;  The Minister of State should explain her interpretation of the extent to which court intervention or involvement can be excluded.  Is the Minister of State absolutely satisfied that the limitations of court involvement as laid down in the Model Law conform or are compatible with the definitions of the powers of the courts as set down in Article 34 of the Constitution? This arises particularly in the context of Chapter 1(d), Article 1(6).</P>
    <P>I welcome Section 8 of the Bill which deals with consolidation of arbitrations.  This is one area that does not seem to be included within the text proper of the terms of the Model Law.</P>
    <P>I note that Article 34 (2)(b) deals with the setting aside of an award if &ldquo;the award is in conflict with the public policy of this State&rdquo;.  It does not, however, expressly cover fraud and it should do so.</P>
    <P>Again, Article 34, subsection (2) states</P>
    <P>an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed.  from the date on which the party making that application had received the award.</P>
    <P>One would imagine that the time limit for making the appeal on the grounds of fraud or whatever other serious misconduct was involved should be linked directly to the date when the fraud misconduct became known or could have become known, rather than the actual date of the award. The clock should start ticking from the time the misdemeanour was discovered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The core product is sound but there are a few amendments which I will table on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister of State is sympathetic to them.  The proposal to introduce legislation to deal specifically with international commercial arbitration with a view to attracting such arbitration to Ireland is welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> Members on this side of the House will do everything possible to assist the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  The Model Law on which it is based was adopted by the UN Commission on International Trade Law in 1985. Proposals for its adoption by Ireland, including draft Bills, have been in circulation since 1990.  A commitment to legislate along these lines formed part of the Fianna Fáil/Labour programme for Government.  On foot of that commitment, former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, secured Government approval for the detailed heads of a Bill which he submitted to the parliamentary draftsman prior to his retirement from office.</P>
      <P>International commercial arbitration must be seen both as an industry with a potential for growth in its own right and as one that can develop in a manner which compliments the activities of our international financial services sector.  There are traditional seats for international arbitration, London being at the forefront, which are integrated centres of international commercial activity.  Ireland can hope to share in that business only if it puts the necessary infrastructure in place.</P>
      <P>The absence of legislation has arguably hindered the development of Dublin's financial services sector in its attempts to move beyond its tax shelter reliant status &mdash; mainly designed for the benefit of nameplate subsidiaries of foreign corporations &mdash; to claim, in its own right, a share of the business and profits of general international commercial activity.  Adoption of the Model Law in its entirety and unamended, will be welcomed by the relevant professions and industries.  It will place the State one step ahead of the jurisdictions of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, where a lengthy Act, only indirectly based on the UN model law, is currently in force.</P>
      <P>The conditions are now right for Ireland to be advertised as a forum for the settlement of international trade and other commercial disputes. Salesmanship will not be a part of the Minister of State's function but the necessary commitment to such follow up activity must be made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      <P>Enactment of this Bill highlights a number of deficiencies in the 1954 and 1980 Acts, which will continue to apply to domestic arbitration.  For example, Article 31 of the Model Law provides that an arbitrator's award should generally state the reasons upon which it is based.  Article 16 sets out rules according to which an arbitrator may rule on his or her jurisdiction, including any objection with regard to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.  These are improvements to the rules which govern domestic agreements. The enactment and implementation of this legislation should serve as an incentive to revisit the 1953 and 1980 Acts with a view to updating them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> One aspect of the Bill raises a question which the Minister of State may be in a position to answer in her reply.  This concerns the private individual dealing with a company as a consumer, that is, otherwise than in the course of business. Sometimes, as in travel agents' agreements, for example, the consumer may discover that he or she has become party to an arbitration agreement without being aware of the fact.  Such an agreement excludes the jurisdiction of the courts in favour of a private resolution of the dispute between traveller and travel agent.  In such circumstances, the arbitration agreement has not been freely negotiated and entered into between the parties but is offered on a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>While speed, informality and privacy are selling points for arbitration as an alternative to litigation in the courts, it should remain as an alternative which can be accepted or refused.  Arbitration should not be foisted on consumers by large commercial organisations where there is no equality of bargaining power between the parties and where the interests of both parties may not be equally served.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether it is intended that contracts with consumers could, if the other party has a place of business outside the State, be classed as international commercial contracts to which an arbitration clause could be applied?  Is there any risk that rules of Irish law designed for the protection of consumers and which cannot be overwritten by contractual small print could be ousted by a clause of an international commercial arbitration agreement specifying that the rules of law of another country would apply?  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Apart from those general queries and points, I have no difficulty with any aspect of the Bill as proposed and I am pleased to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a contentious Bill and it will have the support of all parties.  The brevity of Members' contributions should be taken as a model by the House because I suspect we sometimes speak at unnecessary length.  Members comments on Bills should be more concise.</P>
      <P>The principle of arbitration as an alternative to court action or litigation is a welcome development. We must ensure that it continues to develop in a positive manner.  As other Members stated, this Bill involves adoption of the UN model law on international commercial arbitration to facilitate such arbitration in Ireland. The Model Law has been found to be internationally acceptable, has stood the test of time and has been adopted, either in whole or in part, by many countries.  One of the amendments in the law, which is welcome in respect of the 1954 Act, deals with the lacuna relating to interest, namely, where an arbitrator was not in a position to award interest.  That will no longer be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is a technical measure and will not have a general impact on Irish society.  However, it is worth noting that in a sense it reflects the <Col N="1317" /> changes occurring in society.  Ireland is now regarded as a serious player in the world of international business and commerce.  Other Members referred to the financial services centre and the Bill will pave the way for our entry to the area of international arbitration.  It will enable us to create an expansion in international services which, in turn, will provide an expansion of economic activity and job generation.  It is clear that we have the qualified professionals necessary to provide these services.  Six Irish arbitrators have been appointed to the international court in Paris, the requisite facilities are coming on stream and the Bar Council has shown initiative in developing the arbitration centre.  Therefore, Ireland will be in a position to offer good value and high standards to international firms seeking this service.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that when companies decide where they intend to seek international arbitration, Dublin will have clear advantages and attractions to offer.  Not least of these will be good value, a good environment and the necessary tourist and leisure facilities for those seeking the service to enjoy.  The advances in technology and telecommunications in Ireland will also prove advantageous in providing this service.  There are instances where companies might be fearful that if they sought arbitration in the US or Britain their cases might not be given a fair and scrupulous hearing and, as we are an English-speaking people and perceived to be neutral, Ireland, in offering arbitration services, might occupy this niche to its advantage.  To use an agricultural simile, this development of international arbitration is equivalent to processing our meat at home rather than exporting cattle on the hoof.  It means there will be economic activity directly at the centre and indirectly in hotels, restaurants and other facilities people wish to use.  Arbitration covers a wide range of commercial and business activity, including the building industry, insurance and cases of medical negligence.  This internationalisation is taking place in the context of Ireland as a modern economy and society which can play its part seriously.  Financial and business services have been made smoother and better.</P>
    <P>The power of business and its globalisation are reflected in the debate.  However, I wish other services and provisions were facilitated by legislation and that we could move with such alacrity towards international compatibility in terms of a minimum wage or membership of a trade union so that these were universally guaranteed on a standard basis in all developed countries.  Then we would truly move towards a modern society which deals not only with the needs of those who own or have shares in business but also those who work for businesses.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Bill is non-contentious and will be passed.  I hope the anticipated business comes to Dublin and I do not doubt that when it happens, the professionals who carry out the activity will do so to a high standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  It is heartening to note that the Members who spoke agreed with the basic thrust of the legislation and I thank them.</P>
      <P>At first glance the Bill appears somewhat technical in nature.  However, Deputies appreciated the fact that a modern arbitration law, which the Bill provides, has the potential to attract valuable business to the State.  The consensus which exists in the House regarding the merits of the legislation can only serve to give a message to those who might think of arbitrating their disputes in this jurisdiction that Ireland offers the type of supportive environment which can make it a real player in the international arbitration field.</P>
      <P>My comments are not meant as a criticism of the 1954 and 1980 Arbitration Acts.  On the whole, they function efficiently and provide the necessary supportive framework for the different type of arbitration which already takes place on a regular basis in the State.  However, there is a perception among practitioners that existing legislation makes it difficult to attract international commercial arbitration to this country because it is not based on the principle of minimal court interference in the arbitration process. This is the key element underlying the requirement for finality in arbitration awards.</P>
      <P>The Bill, which incorporates the Model Law in our arbitration code, addresses this difficulty.  It will counter any adverse perceptions which might exist concerning Ireland's suitability as a venue for international commercial arbitrations.  When it is enacted there will be a single item of legislation which deals comprehensively with international commercial arbitration and we will have advanced significantly the day when our adoption of the Model Law can be used to attract additional inward investment to the State through the medium of arbitration business.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an example of the willingness of the Government to respond to a well argued and well founded case for legislative reform.  A number of bodies, including the International Financial Services Centre, the Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators and the Irish branch and committee for arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, advocated the adoption by Ireland of UNCITRAL Model Law as our international arbitration code.  The Bill is the outcome of that advocacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the decision to adopt the UNCITRAL Model Law stems from the work of an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group which began in 1993.  I commend those people for their involvement and work in that regard.  The initial draft of the Bill was prepared by the group and underpinning the work which went into it was a significant degree of consultation with specialists in the field of arbitration who recommended strongly the approach that has been adopted.  In many ways international commercial arbitration business is a form of trade related activity.  As such, it has consumers <Col N="1319" /> who require a regime for resolving their disputes which is geared to their needs and accords with the best modern practice.  The Model Law offers this type of regime.  However, in addition to the legal framework, other factors of an economic nature will also play a part in making Ireland an attractive venue for international commercial arbitration.</P>
    <P>Today, Ireland has a vibrant economy and the market is very much focused on the desirability of sustaining an enterprise environment.  Priority has been given to the creation of a stable, macroeconomic climate, capable of delivering high growth rates coupled with low inflation.  Above all, the emphasis has been on ensuring that this growth is translated into increased employment. In this context the availability of a skilled, flexible and motivated workforce has been an essential element in Ireland's growing competitiveness. Investment in education and training has been a particular priority and it is consistent with the economic strategy on which the nation has embarked.  This priority has been reflected in the substantial increase in the provision of third level places in the areas of languages and information technology.  Furthermore, there have been significant improvements in transportation infrastructure with particular emphasis on strategic primary routes and on the improved operation of key sea ports and airports.  Specific attention has also been given to increasing competition and investment in the telecommunications sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Higgins raised the issue of whether the fact that the legislation cogs the supervisory role of the courts is compatible with the Constitution. One of the purposes of incorporating the Model Law in the State's arbitration code is to limit the extent to which a court may intervene in that process. This approach has been taken because those who opt for arbitration, particularly in the commercial arena, which is the area covered by the Bill, do so because of the need for finality and certainty in the arbitration process.  This requires minimal interference from outside bodies, including the courts.</P>
    <P>The report of the review group on the Constitution, published in 1996, addressed the possibility of the Model Law being adopted in domestic legislation.  It was of the view that there was no reason to believe such an approach would present constitutional difficulties.  In arriving at this conclusion the review group commented that the decision of the parties to an arbitration agreement to freely choose a private arbitration tribunal rather than the courts to resolve the dispute must be respected by any legal system.  Provided the jurisdiction of the courts may be invoked to ensure that minimum standards of legality and fair procedures are observed by the tribunal, it did not appear that constitutional values would be infringed.  The Attorney General, who was consulted on the legislation, also advised that the implementation of Model Law would not give <Col N="1320" /> rise to constitutional difficulties of the nature referred to by Deputy Higgins.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned fraud as a separate ground for setting aside an award.  The working documents of UNCITRAL referred to in section 6 of the Bill make it clear that public policy covers matters such as corruption and fraud.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shortall raised a number of interesting questions with regard to consumers and arbitrations. Matters in this area generally arise in a domestic context but they can be considered in terms of a more general review of domestic arbitration. The Deputy had further interesting points which will be considered in advance of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is that competitiveness in the economy is improving and the conditions for foreign direct investment are buoyant.  There is a new spirit of national self confidence evident in many aspects of life and the drive and enthusiasm now manifest in society will be of assistance in attracting arbitration business to this jurisdiction. Ireland is trade dependent and it is committed to full participation in the global economy.  Developments which I hope the Bill will inaugurate for international commercial arbitration are fully in keeping with that commitment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GVWright" hpid="Mr. Wright Mr. Wright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wright</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned previously that I spoke in the Seanad in 1992 about the crisis then facing TEAM Aer Lingus and the airport in general. I mentioned that I believed employee share option schemes should be part of any restructuring programme.  I am pleased that this is part of the restructuring programme and the employee share participation scheme has been a great success in Aer Lingus.  This should be included in Part 2 of the Bill.  The report of Aer Rianta's chief executive stated:</P>
      <P>We believe that the involvement of staff and management on a partnership basis in all matters which affect the company is the right way to go and one which will underpin the success of the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with this statement and I hope that when the Minister replies on Second Stage she will consider the possibility of incorporating an employee shareholding scheme.  If not, I hope it will be contained <Col N="1321" /> in a future Bill.  This would be a natural extension of the company's success story.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales have been an integral part of Aer Rianta's success.  I commend the Minister's efforts in bringing this issue to the forefront of future decision making.  The removal of duty free sales would have a devastating effect on the company's profits and, more importantly, on jobs and investment.  Throughout Europe, 140,000 people are involved in duty free sales; 1,500 of these are in this country.  Many of our major companies and best products have achieved success through marketing at duty free outlets.  The Minister should continue her efforts.  She has the support of all Members who want to see jobs created.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales have ensured a price structure in air travel.  Aer Rianta has not increased airport charges since 1987.  Many airlines offer cheap fares and this has ensured the development of our tourism industry.  I have yet to see any country which is opposed to duty free sales.  It is a travel perk.  In the past it may have been a perk for the well off but that is no longer the case.  On-board duty free sales are an integral part of Ryanair's pricing structure.  Aer Rianta currently achieves £35-£40 million profits each year, perhaps 85-90 per cent of these from duty free sales.  The abolition of these sales would have a huge impact on the company.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales are a success showcase post Maastricht and should be marketed as such rather than being considered for abolition.  I hope that the current review will be successful.  The Minister will soon meet John Prescott and the Taoiseach has raised this issue on each occasion he has met the British Prime Minister.  This rightly highlights the priority which this Government attaches to duty free sales.  It is easy to talk about a success story in the context of the profits I have mentioned.  I support the extension and the retention of duty free sales as part of our airport structure. I welcome Aer Rianta's worldwide success. It has been a flagship in many airports.</P>
    <P>Previous Ministers may have had a different view of the value of the Great Southern Hotels to Aer Rianta.  The development of hotels at airports is a core value for any airport.  I support the Minister's view that these hotels should be a part of Aer Rianta.  In spring 1998 a Great Southern Hotel will open at Dublin Airport with over 120 beds, creating over 120 jobs.  If the Minister believes that the hotel group is to be a part of Aer Rianta it should be allowed freely to develop these hotels similar to a private sector company. One or two of these hotels need investment and refurbishment.  This should be allowed to take place.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes a £250 million cap on investments. It is a great credit to Aer Rianta that it has been able to fund the capital investment in our airports from its profits.  It is committed to a further £200 million investments in the next few years.  I am concerned about the cap on investments and we should look at this on Committee Stage.  In 1992 the Culliton report spoke of investments <Col N="1322" /> in the private and semi-State sectors.  There is nothing wrong with future private sector investment alongside that of Aer Rianta at Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports.  This will develop the full potential for jobs in the North Dublin constituency.  In the debate about the 1992-3 development plan those of us who believed in the job creation potential at the airport travelled to airports abroad.  We saw warehouse development and other airport related activities adjacent to those airports and I would welcome this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen, as Minister with responsibility for this area, asked his Department to produce a document in relation to a public and private sector partnership for the development of the airport. I would like to see that revived.  Unfortunately, the idea of developing the airports with the support of capital as opposed to constant State grants was dropped by the previous Government.  No progress was made in relation to developing such an ethos.  I would like to see the Minister reintroduce that document which was a point of reference regarding airport development and allow us debate it again.  We should ensure that lack of capital in no way inhibits the progress and job prospects possible at the airports, especially at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The staff and management believe absolutely in ensuring that Dublin Airport is an international airport of the highest standards in line with the demands of travellers.  This was my reason for not supporting a second airport for Dublin when the issue emerged in debate.  It is only through capital investment that the board can ensure Dublin Airport is of the highest possible standard.  Capital investment will ensure the board's hands are not tied.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and welcome the chance to develop the debate.  Regarding the board's structure, I ask the Minister to discuss the issue of providing in the Bill for a worker director on the board.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Joe Higgins.  I welcome the purpose of this Bill which is to establish Aer Rianta as a normal commercial State company in line with the practice over a number of years of enhancing the commercial freedom of State companies.  It is a welcome development.  Aer Rianta has been a very successful State company and the new structure gives expression to this.  Its profits for 1996 were £40 million.  The Minister traced the 60-year history of Aer Rianta and it is time for the company to move into a new modern era.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the 60 years industrial relations at the company have been remarkably good.  It is probable that industrial relations will be put under considerable strain in the years ahead if the decision to abolish duty free sales in 1999 is proceeded with.  Duty free sales account for half the profits made by Aer Rianta.  Their abolition on foot of the 1992 ECOFIN decision, which was subscribed to by the Taoiseach when Minister for Finance, will have a devastating effect on employment, <Col N="1323" /> the future of Aer Rianta, tourism and the company's revenue.  It is particularly important that the decision is reversed.  It has enormous implications for the companies dependent on it in Ireland.  It would be ironic if Aer Rianta, the pioneer of duty free shops and their management both here and abroad, should find itself exposed to a very serious financial problem caused by the abolition of duty free sales.  The employees of Aer Rianta have a strong interest in ensuring the continuation of the duty free regime and every effort should be made by the Government to have the decision to abolish it reversed in the interests of the company, its employees and the sea ports and ferry companies, the employees of which also have a strong interest in ensuring duty free facilities are maintained.</P>
    <P>I am also interested in the lands owned by Aer Rianta.  It owns a substantial land bank, particularly in the surrounds of Dublin Airport.  As Deputy Wright stated, some years ago those lands became the focus of various rezoning efforts during consideration of the Dublin county development plan.  It is necessary for Aer Rianta to maintain sufficient land for the development of the airport.  However, it is also clear that airports have the potential to attract considerable investment and I hope Aer Rianta in managing its land bank and its future use has regard to the industrial and employment potential in the areas adjacent to our airports.</P>
    <P>I am curious as to where the legislation provides for the disposal of land or property by Aer Rianta.  There is provision for the properties to be transferred from the Minister to the new company when it is established.  Power is given to Aer Rianta to acquire land, to sell water and to fell trees.  However, I see no reference in the Bill to the disposal of land or the circumstances under which land might be disposed of by the company. Will they have the power to dispose of land?  If they have that power, under what circumstances may they do so?  Will disposal require ministerial approval?  I would like this issue clarified.</P>
    <P>How was this Bill approved by a Government which claims to have signed up to Partnership 2000 and to subscribe to the concept of social partnership without making the standard provision for worker participation and the election of worker directors to the board of the company? For 20 years it has been standard practice, including in Aer Rianta, for workers to be represented on the board.  Such provision is not made in this legislation, the first to come before this House for a long time establishing a State company which has no provision for the election of worker directors to the board.  This should be rectified and the Minister should introduce amendments on Committee Stage to effect this.  It is the intention of my party to introduce appropriate amendments to correct this serious omission from the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that there is no provision for workers' shareholding in the company, <Col N="1324" /> the precedent for which was established in Aer Lingus.  These omissions should be corrected. Given that the Government has signed up to Partnership 2000 and that its spokespersons seek to assure the social partners of its commitment to social partnership, I am astonished the Bill was approved and introduced by Government with these serious omissions.  If the Bill is to have any real meaning the basic achievement won by the trade union movement over many years which gives workers the right to elect representatives to the boards of State companies must be protected. The omission of this important provision from the legislation is a very worrying sign from the Government and a worrying indication of the rightward trend in thinking in the governance of State companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin West)</i>: I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time with me.  Aer Rianta is a crucial public enterprise and national resource and the first concern of any new legislation must be to protect it and to copperfasten it in public ownership.  Any suggestion of privatisation of a company like Aer Rianta, any preparation for privatisation or anything which leaves the company open to privatisation should be strenuously resisted.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not do this.  Rather it gives rise to a suspicion that this crucial resource is being left open to privatisation. Under the Bill the Minister has latitude to dispose of the shares and core activities of the company without reference to the Dáil.  Public ownership of Aer Rianta must be regarded as sacrosanct. The staff of TEAM Aer Lingus suspect the company is being prepared for privatisation, that sections of management, political interests and some sections of relevant Departments have a privatisation agenda and that policies are being directed towards this.  Such policies must be resisted.</P>
      <P>Sections 17 and 18 deal with the acquisition of land for airport development.  However, when it is known that a large concern such as Aer Rianta proposes to buy land in the environs of an airport for development purposes landowners can move in for the kill by speculating in land which they know the company must acquire.  There are no provisions in the Bill to prevent blatant speculation in lands around airports, particularly Dublin Airport.  Aer Rianta stated that during the next ten years it will require a substantial number of acres to the south and west perimeters of Dublin Airport for a new terminal and related activities. This land was the subject of a scandalous rezoning decision in the context of the 1993 county development plan.  I drew attention to this during the debate on the tribunal and it should be covered by the Bill which is supposed to protect the interests of Aer Rianta as a public company. I will give one example.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 Aer Rianta made it clear it would need 100 acres of land at Harristown on the southern perimeter of the airport to further expand and develop Dublin Airport.  Yet a coalition of councillors <Col N="1325" /> on Dublin County Council, including Progressive Democrats councillors, who moved the proposal, and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors, refused to listen and rolled their rezoning juggernaut over that 100 acres.  The upshot of this is that the cost of the land will increase from £5,000 per acres under agricultural zoning to £100,000 per acre under industrial zoning.  This means that instead of paying £500,000 Aer Rianta, a public company, could have to pay £15 million for this land.  That is a scam by any standard and I ask the Minister to address it.  I hope it will be addressed in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Speculation involving publicly owned companies should be criminalised.  Provision should be made for this and other rezoning decisions relating to land around Dublin Airport to be negated and for the land to be rezoned as agricultural. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has the power to vary the development plan under existing legislation.  If this rezoning is allowed to stand then the Government will leave Aer Rianta open to the payment of up to £20 million to a handful of landowners.  The political parties concerned will have to answer for this when the time comes.  I hope the legislation deals with this matter.  This kind of speculation is robbing from the public purse, it is stealing from the taxpayer to enrich a few speculators.  It is scandalous that elected local representatives should facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Section 23(e) deals with partnerships with other enterprises and provides that Aer Rianta may become involved in international ventures in other countries.  If Aer Rianta becomes involved in such ventures it must take note of the interests of local communities.  If I am not mistaken Aer Rianta has an interest in Manchester Airport. Local communities in Manchester have put forward very strong arguments against building new runways.  Airports are essential but there is a big downside to them in terms of noise, aviation fumes etc.  Residents must be protected and Aer Rianta must ensure it does not encroach on the rights and sensitivities of residents who live in the environs of airports in which it might have an involvement.</P>
    <P>Workers' democracy in State bodies has usually been regarded as the appointment of one or two worker representatives to a board.  However, they are so hidebound by restrictions that they are unable to report to their fellow workers on many matters of significance.  The Bill does not even provide for this tokenism.  What is the reason for the exclusion from the Bill of this modest input by workers?  The constitution of boards of publicly-owned bodies is a scandal.  Normally boards of directors comprise Ministers' hacks and political party hacks who, because they have run around constituencies looking after the interests of TDs and Ministers, or perhaps funded their parties, are rewarded by being promoted to State boards.  All major parties are guilty of making such promotions.  Political hackery is no qualification <Col N="1326" /> for the efficient management of Stateowned companies and it should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>Deputies correctly paid tribute to the staff of Aer Rianta whose expertise, talent and commitment have rendered the company a success.  A majority of the board should comprise elected staff and Government appointees who should be recommended by independent commissions rather than by political favouritism.  Passengers who utilise airport services should also be represented on the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which gives greater autonomy to Aer Rianta.  Despite the fact that boards of State companies allegedly comprise party political hacks, Aer Rianta is undoubtedly one of our most successful public companies.  Not only does it manage and develop our airports in an efficient and imaginative manner, it is also a major employer and promotes business and enterprise generally through its operation of duty free shops, worldwide retailing and airport management consultancy services, the Great Southern Hotels Group and its many other ancillary activities.  In short, Aer Rianta is a success story.  It should be congratulated on its views on partnership and particularly its policy on constructive participation.  It is a model of the way public companies should be run.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta should be to the forefront in developing business and enterprise in and around the Dublin Airport hinterland, but sadly that is not the case.  Unfortunately, the policy of Aer Rianta of sanitising the lands around Dublin Airport, of buying up as much land as possible, automatically objecting to planning applications and charging high rent for these lands obstructs the development of aviation-related industries by private enterprise in the locality, and that is regrettable.  Deputy Wright drew attention to the fact that many aviation-related industries are unable to set up in and around Dublin Airport because of the policy of Aer Rianta in regard to the lands there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment what happened the enterprise development task force report on Dublin Airport. That task force was established by the former Minister, Deputy Quinn, in a fanfare of publicity in July 1993 in response to the serious crisis in TEAM Aer Lingus.  The report was presented to the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, in April 1995, but he got around to publishing it only in June 1996, more than a year later.  Four recommendations in the report were the establishment of an enterprise centre in Swords, the <Col N="1327" /> development of advance factories, the creation of a large industrial park in the vicinity of Dublin Airport and the setting up of a pilot training technical school in Gormanstown, County Meath.  Has progress been made in that regard?  Have new jobs been created?  The lack of an official response to that report by the previous Government gives employment task forces in general a bad name.  That should be remembered when the next major factory closes down and demands are made for such a task force.</P>
    <P>When a Private Members' motion was put down in the Dáil on this matter, a number of Labour Deputies refused to support the Government. That was simply a political response and the enterprise development task force report on Dublin Airport was merely a public relations exercise.  I ask the Minister to dig out that report, dust it down and see how much of it can be salvaged in order to develop much-needed projects in the locality of Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport is a success story.  In 1996 it had a throughput of 12 million passengers, an increase of 13 per cent on the previous year, and carried about 146,000 tonnes of freight, an increase of 18 per cent on the previous year.  For many people living in and around it, including myself, the airport is part of our everyday lives.  Residents are concerned from time to time about the operation of the airport.  Noise pollution, particularly during the busy season, is an obvious nuisance and health related issues also arise from time to time. During the month of August residents have to put up with dreadful noise from planes, particularly those heading in an easterly direction over the Irish Sea.  For example, people are unable to conduct a conversation in their houses or to hear their televisions while planes are flying overhead. Burglar alarms are regularly set off by the vibration from planes.  Even though residents accept the role of Dublin Airport in providing employment, they should not be taken for granted.  In the interests of good public relations, Aer Rianta should put in place a mechanism to allow for consultation with local residents about their anxiety.  The residents should not be taken for granted.  There should be a mechanism to allow for consultation to let them know which runways are being used at particular times of the year.  In the interests of good public relations that would be welcome.  The art exhibitions held at Dublin Airport are a popular and major feature of artistic life on the northside as are the Christmas decorations which are enjoyed by thousands of homecomers and their families during the festive season in December and January.</P>
    <P>Plans by the EU to abolish duty free shopping on 30 June 1999 must be resisted at all costs.  In her Second Stage speech the Minister said duty free sales help Aer Rianta keep airport charges low, fund their discount schemes and finance development at the three airports.  The view that duty free sales are a subsidy to the well-off is simply out of date.  Air travel is a reality for everybody <Col N="1328" /> and the suggestion from the Commission that it is merely a subsidy to the well-off is outrageous. The implications for such an abolition of duty free shopping on jobs, tourism, the aviation industry and the economy as a whole are serious. I welcome the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke's active role in the campaign to raise awareness of the duty free issue by her demand for an EU study on the matter.  Ireland must insist on an open-ended derogation.  Aer Rianta must seek also to develop alternative activities to save jobs at our airports should this abolition take place.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret plans for a light rail system, as outlined in the DTI, to Ballymun, Dublin Airport and Swords have been put on the long finger.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a northside representative and not on a party political basis northsiders have every right to be aggrieved about this.  Dublin Airport is the largest single employment complex in the eastern region and yet there is no rail link to the city centre.  We need a commitment from the Government that this line will go ahead even if EU funding should not materialise and planning should begin now.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the work of a residents group known as Drumcondra 2005.  This group is based in the Drumcondra area which is a hinterland of Dublin Airport and has to tolerate a great deal of traffic heading to and from the airport.  This group is lobbying hard for the implementation of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and in particular the Luas project.  The group has done much research on the role of Dublin Airport in the economy of this locality and is adamant there must be a Luas connection to Ballymun, Dublin Airport and Swords in due course.  I hope the study on the underground option will not delay the Luas project and jeopardize EU funding.  I know Deputy Dukes will not seize on my remarks to attack the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke and I accept her assurance EU funding is not being put in jeopardy.  The Luas project is essential to implement the DTI plans and for the future development of Dublin airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister or Minister of State respond to SIPTU's concern that the Bill fails to provide for an employees' share option scheme and outline his views on industrial relations in TEAM Aer Lingus.  TEAM employees constantly lose out in pay and conditions in contrast to employees in the parent company.  This should not be allowed to continue indefinitely. Employees of TEAM Aer Lingus have made great sacrifices as have the employees of the parent <Col N="1329" /> company, Aer Lingus, to put the company on an economic footing.  There should be parity in respect of pay and conditions between the employees of Aer Lingus and TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister I pay tribute to the outgoing chief executive of Aer Rianta, Mr. Derek Keogh, who has overseen its growth as a public company. I commend his efforts in association with the various boards over the years.  Aer Rianta is a success story and an example we should follow in respect of other companies.  The compact for constructive participation is particularly good and brings forward the idea of partnership between management and employees.  That has obviously been successful.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann, bearing in mind the long established principle, first adopted by the Government in 1969 and confirmed to this House repeatedly since then, that public service pensions should be related to current rates of pay, considering that recently negotiated increases in public sector pay should therefore be reflected by proportionate increases in the pensions paid to already retired employees, and recalling the pledge of the Government parties outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions, calls on the Government to implement improvements to the pension entitlements of retired nurses, teachers, gardaí, civil servants and employees of local authorities and health boards, in order to re-establish parity with increases obtained by serving employees under recent pay agreements.</P>
      <P>I regret the Minister for Finance is not present to take this debate.  This is, perhaps, characteristic of his cavalier attitude to this entire issue.  There are 77,150 people who have been made an explicit pledge by the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats on 4 June 1997.  I do not mean to be discourteous to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, whose responsibilities do not extend to public service pensions, who is present on behalf of the Government, but it is sad the Minister for Finance is not present.

      <P>On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome the temporary Minister for Finance to the House &mdash; this is a temporary Administration.</P>
      <P>The issue of public service pay and the implementation of the Strategic Management Initiative are central issues of Government policy.  If they are not, they should be.  Modernisation of the Irish public administrative system is the key to the continuing success of our economy and the maintenance of our competitive position in an increasingly competitive global economy.  The fair treatment of all public servants is essential to achieving that objective.  While tough negotiations between staff and unions are to be expected, they should not be confused with the overall objective of ensuring we have a competitive, well motivated and efficient public service.</P>
      <P>Clarity and commitment must inform negotiations, but is not surprising that neither clarity nor commitment inform the current negotiations. The Government's position is unknown.  We knew Fianna Fáil's position in Opposition and, in so far as one could ever know anything about the Progressive Democrats, we also thought we knew their position in Opposition, but we do not know the position of this temporary Government.  Why is that the case?  This matter has a lengthy history and as a former Minister for Finance I am well aware of it.</P>
      <P>The last formal meeting between the Public Service Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Government representatives took place on 23 June, a number of days after the poll on 6 June but three days before the Dáil met to form a new Administration in which Deputy McCreevy is the Minister for Finance.  Understandably, the professional civil servants representing the Government and the incoming Minister indicated to the Public Service Committee that they could not give a clear view on the question of parity between pensions and the rate of pay on which pensioners retired because they were awaiting the political direction of the incoming Administration.  The professional civil servants said they would get back to the committee as soon as possible on the matter.  The committee indicated that it wanted the matter dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Public Service Committee was aware that on 4 June, two days before the general election, the engaged couple, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, made an explicit pledge.  They made a governmental vow to the 77,150 pensioners who <Col N="1331" /> had been assured during their working lives that they would retire on a pension of 50 per cent of their salary and that if their salaries were altered as a consequence of general increases, arbitration awards or variations or structural changes in the relationship of the grades, the traditional 50 per cent parity link between salary and pensions would be maintained.  On Wednesday, 4 June, before their marriage was consummated on 26 June, the engaged coupled issued a joint statement on public service pensions in which they stated:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil leader, Mr. Bertie Ahern TD, and the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Miss Mary Harney TD, have announced today that in Government they will resolve the problems surrounding the pensions of retired public service staff.  Both leaders acknowledge the role played by public servants over the decades and believe that retired public service staff should receive fair treatment.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government will request the Central Review Committee of Partnership 2000 to resolve the claim for pension parity for retired public service staff as a matter of urgency.  Mr. Ahern and Ms Harney are committed to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public service pay.</P>
    <P>As Eoghan Harris might say, the subtext of that message is that 50 per cent means 50 per cent. This means a retired civil servant should get 50 per cent of the pay of a working civil servant who is doing the job from which he or she has retired.</P>
    <P>I draw Members' attention to the words &ldquo;as a matter of urgency&rdquo;.  I suppose 77,150 votes constitute some class of urgency.  They amount to roughly ten quotas or ten Deputies.  The Government would dearly love ten more Deputies sitting on its benches.  Two or three more would give it an overall majority.  A total of 77,150 people were told that, as a matter of urgency, the traditional link of 50 per cent would be restored.  I am amazed at the Minister for Finance's interpretation of the definition of &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; because responsibility for delivering this marriage vow has fallen on his shoulders.  The Minister's sense of urgency is such that since 23 June no official meeting has taken place between the Public Service Committee of Congress who has responsibility to negotiate on behalf of retired pensioners and representatives of the Minister's Department. There have been exchanges and encounters. People have met to deal with other matters, which is the norm given the way we do business in our relatively small society.  In regard to this issue, however, 117 days have passed, nearly four months into this jaded and tired Administration, and the sense of urgency that animates the Minister is that the Government has not yet even requested a meeting with the Public Service Committee. I therefore accuse the Government of reneging on its promise on 4 June to deal with <Col N="1332" /> this issue &ldquo;as a matter of urgency&rdquo;.  It has betrayed the people concerned.</P>
    <P>The commitment to restore the traditional link between pensions and increases in current rates of public service pay was articulated in a press statement and on the doorsteps by Fianna Fáil candidates, not to mention the few candidates standing for the Progressive Democrats.  That was sold on the doorsteps as 50 per cent of the rate of pay for nurses, teachers, gardaí and the other categories.  I was aware, as was the Taoiseach when he issued that statement, of the complexities surrounding this issue.  I was also aware of the cost implications involved in all these matters and the constraints on public expenditure in any Administration, but so were Deputy Bertie Ahern and, if we are to believe her, the handlers of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney.  She may not have understood fully the complexities of these issues, but her advisers, some of whom are no longer in this House, argued they understood them.  Yet this statement was issued.  It is a promissory note.  It promised urgency and something that can never be explicitly distorted into something else.  It promised the restoration of the link between pensions and increases in current rates.</P>
    <P>The representatives of the public service committee of congress who, among other things, have helped to deliver partnership Government and various forms of partnership arrangements over the past ten years, accepted there were some anomalies and difficulties.  They saw a case could be made in a particular way that might be excessive and proposed something reasonable on 23 June. Understandably, the professional civil servants representing an outgoing Administration could not commit themselves to a response on its behalf regarding a decision that would have to be taken after 26 June when the new Government would be formed.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government can be indicted in a third possible area, that even when presented with the option of a reasonable way to move forward on this matter that option has been spurned by an incredibly dramatic silence.  Some 77,000 people heard the Minister's message loud and clear on 4 June. Some, but not many, may have changed their minds about the way they intended to vote. People, particularly those of pension age, do not readily change their minds about how they intend to vote, but they easily change their preferences. The Minister would not be where he is today if it were not for changes in regard to preferences made by people in this House and elsewhere. They ensured that instead of voting for the party to which they would normally give their preference their preference went to a party that has specifically misled public service pensioners.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Deputy will not have much time to hear more from me on this side of the House because his days are numbered. It is less than four months into the job, but I have never seen as distraught, distressed and tired an Administration as this one.  The Minister's friend and colleague, the Tánaiste, has not had a smile on her face since she was elevated to the highest executive political position held by a women in Government.  One would have thought that on 26 June Santa Claus had come to Deputy Harney, but instead it appears the Wicked Witch of the West has arrived ahead of Halloween.  Will the Government do something to make her happy because neither the lady nor this Minister has smiled in nearly four months?</P>

      <P>We understood the Minister had a certain ability to ensure she could smile.  If her facial expression is an inner picture of the angst that is driving this Administration, all its members must be fiercely unhappy.  If their happiness is related to their sense of urgency they must be distraught because the Minister has been 117 days in office and his sense of urgency has been such that he has not arranged a meeting with the public service committee of congress nor instructed the officials to have such a meeting.  He has not asked them to consider the five options put on the table by the public service committee. Neither has he indicated, unless something has happened between 5.30 p.m. and 7 p.m., if the word &ldquo;urgency&rdquo; means anything to him &mdash; he would know what an urgent horse looks like if he had bet money on it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the meaning of a sense of urgency when a horse on which he has bet money is running.  The Minister is running with pensioners' money.  That money was taken from them, although they signed a contract that when they retired from the Civil Service they would get 50 per cent forever and a day of the going rate for the job from which they retired. The Minister's advisers promised, with a sense of urgency, that deal would be cemented, notwithstanding the complexities of productivity arrangements, restructuring and the other matters involved in finalising the complex and detailed negotiations that characterised the end of the <Col N="1334" /> PCW when we moved from a base of 3 per cent to a norm that was closer to 5.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>If any Member knows the complexity of figures, it is the Minister.  If anyone has a sense of urgency about getting rid of a previous leader of his party, it is the Minister.  If anyone knows how a slow horse can bring ruin to punters, it is the Minister.  I put it to him that he should have delivered on this matter given the knowledge he has and that is on file and the reasonableness of the proposition delivered to him by his representatives from the public service management division of the Department of Finance and the public service committee of congress.  Because they were involved in the negotiations on restructuring they understood the need for productivity and were committed to the strategic management initiative and accepted fully there could be some difficulties on the margins.  Notwithstanding that, they were prepared to negotiate to overcome them, provided the traditional parity link on which the Minister had given a commitment would be delivered. This Administration has been in office for 117 days but has failed to deliver on two points that were part of an election pledge.</P>

The Minister's party made a promise before any of the negotiations which put him where he is now.

      <P>It is regrettable that it was necessary for the Labour Party to table a motion calling on the Government to implement increases in the pensions of retired public servants in accordance with the policies operated over the past 30 years.  I thought that after 26 June that there would not be any need for further debate on this matter because I thought the Minister would deliver on his promise.</P>
      <P>On completion of discussions on the restructuring of different grades in the public service the matter of pensions was left to the public services committee of the ICTU.  Pensioners, in the belief that their pensions were protected by law, were satisfied for the matter to be clarified by the trade unions.  It was only at the recent protest march that the union leaders expressed their dissatisfaction at the failure to secure justice for pensioners and indicated their determination to resort to industrial action if necessary.</P>
      <P>Are there any provisions in the legislation governing payments to pensioners, following an adjustment in the salaries of particular grades in the public service, which could enable the Minister to discontinue the existing policy of pay parity? The amount of hurt and frustration felt by all public service pensioners cannot be overstated. This is understandable when one realises these are the same people who developed health, education, justice, local authority and other services during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when resources were scarce.</P>
      <P>During and after the Second World War, salaries and working conditions were appalling.  For example, in the 1940s, the starting salary of a nurse was £42 per annum and the maximum was £72 over six years.  Due to economic constraints and the standstill orders on wages there was little or no increase until the 1950s, and then only by small amounts.  At that time tuberculosis and fever were rampant in hospitals and institutions and many nurses fell victim to the ravages of TB at an early stage in their career.  Equally, bad working conditions were the lot of teachers, gardaí and others in the public service.</P>
      <P>Many retired gardaí never enjoyed a normal working week or overtime pay.  They responded to the call of duty as required, day or night. Surely such dedication to duty is worthy of acknowledgment.  In the 1930s and 1940s, psychiatric nurses had to endure many difficulties due to the non-availability of drugs for patients and custodial treatment was difficult on the patient and the nurse.  Custodial treatment progressed to drug therapy, a big step forward &mdash; these nurses had to learn about these drugs which had not been in use when they started training &mdash; and then there were open wards and community treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know psychiatric nurses who voluntarily went into the community to get work for patients.  They did this in their own time.  These are the people we are now telling we cannot pay what is due to them.  Despite their terrible pay and working conditions, these people demonstrated a commitment <Col N="1336" /> and dedication that enabled the different services to improve and develop to their present level.  Our hospitals, institutions and the public service would not be what they are today but for the service of these people.  It is also worth recalling that up to 1950 they worked 56 hours a week; most of those in retirement today worked at least 48 hours per week.  The role these people played in the public service is widely acknowledged and this makes it more difficult to understand the current impasse.</P>
    <P>Recently the Tánaiste was widely acclaimed for her statement that this was the year of pay for the workers.  It is also payback time for pensioners and the electorate.  Retired public servants fully deserve a substantial payback at a time of such buoyancy in our economy.  It is necessary to draw special attention to the widows whose husbands died while serving or subsequent to retirement. Their position is extremely bad and should be examined.  They only qualify for half the pension of their late husbands.  How can they live without an increase?  It is an insult to the lifetime of service their husbands have given to their country.  I ask the Minister not to forget widows when he is paying the pensioners.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to resolve this matter without delay so that these pensioners can anticipate the payment of their adjusted pensions prior to Christmas.  It has to be remembered that many of these pensioners are old, invalid, semi-invalid or in retirement homes.  Many are now looking for subvention from the health boards to maintain their dignity at the end of their days because they cannot afford to pay for a nursing or retirement home.  They also have considerable drug and medical costs which are causing them enormous stress.  I urge the Minister to deliver on at least one election promise.</P>

      <P>On 4 June, the bombshell was dropped that this matter was to be looked at urgently.  Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats had already announced a trial marriage and we assumed this issue would be taken on board without further ado.  I always have grave reservations about any statement from the Progressive <Col N="1337" /> Democrats.  No party could be further from me on the political spectrum in the philosophy it espouses, particularly in the area of public expenditure. I respect the Minister, who is perhaps fighting against those who wish to hold him to 4 per cent.  His colleagues hectored and lectured us about public expenditure, and they may be the root cause of the problem.  I hope they are not.</P>
      <P>The need to put down this motion is another example of this Government's cynical attitude to pre-election promises.  No promises should be made at election time.  The people should be told of the difficulties and treated with respect.  They are not fools.  A promise is a solemn contract which cannot be resiled.  This attitude has already led to a number of U-turns by the Government. I hope this does not lead to another U-turn in relation to public service pensions.</P>
      <P>As my colleague Deputy Quinn pointed out, the abject failure of the current Administration to resolve this issue as a matter of urgency has already constituted a withdrawal of, and a reneging on, the solemn promise given in the joint statement issued on Wednesday, 4 June, in relation to public service pensions.  There can be no ambiguity about that.  The literal, schematic, teleological interpretation &mdash; call it what you will &mdash; is there in black and white and the Government must deliver on it.  There must be no prevarication or obfuscation on this issue.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Moynihan-Cronin said, the people concerned &mdash; some of whom are relatives of mine &mdash; gave numerous years to the public service in hard times in the 1940s and 1950s.  Some earned as little as £4 per fortnight.  Let us not forget the menial level of pay those people earned and the difficulty they faced in rearing their families. Now, when their families are reared, they see an opportunity to get something back for the input they made.  They have already fulfilled their contractual obligations and are now seeking a solemn commitment on the Government's part to honour that contract.</P>
      <P>The public service has been at the centre of this country's development as a modern State.  During the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s the public servants currently being affected by this Government's prevarication and obfuscation worked tirelessly to build the foundations of our public service.  It is totally unacceptable that these people who contributed selflessly to the development of Irish society are being treated in such a shabby fashion by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policies set out in The Action Programme for the Millennium state under the heading &ldquo;Caring for Our Older People&rdquo; that a key priority will be the protection of public service pensions.  The Government must start to accelerate the delivery of that commitment.  Prior to this policy commitment and prior to last June's general election polling day, the joint statement issued by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats highlighted their commitment to restoring the link between pensions and increases in current rates of public service <Col N="1338" /> pay.  Government spokespersons say that the issue is still under consideration.  Deputy Quinn pointed out that nothing has happened since 23 June.  If that is true, it is unbelievable.  How can the Government be considering the issue when no action is being taken?  It cannot just put files away, leave them there and dust them down from time to time.  Action must be taken now.</P>
    <P>Pay parity between public service pensions and current rates of public service pay is a long established principle.  As our motion states, that principle was first adopted by the Government in 1969 and the precedent for parity has existed since then.  The hurt and frustration felt by pensioners and public service unions has reached a point where trade unions could well take industrial action over the Government's attitude and its unwillingness to concede to what it would call pensioners' demands but what I believe is a well established right.</P>
    <P>The case of retired nurses serves to highlight the situation in which many public service pensioners now find themselves.  Retired nurses have not benefited from the pay increases which working nurses received on 1 June 1996.  Only those nurses who retired since the 1 June 1996 will benefit.  As the Retired Nurses Association of Ireland has pointed out, this will lead to a two tier system of nurses' pensions.  I spoke to a nurse this evening who retired in March 1996 and he feels that he is getting an extremely raw deal.  He feels that this issue should be taken on board by the Government without any further fuss and people given their rights.</P>
    <P>In a period of unprecedented economic growth and Exchequer returns, most people would agree that the situation in which public service pensioners now find themselves must be resolved.  It will not suffice for the Government to say it is still considering the issue.  The Government has already made a commitment to these pensioners and it is obliged to honour that commitment.</P>
    <P>This issue affects 77,000 to 78,000 people.  In relation to costs, my own view &mdash; though I would not be as sharp on figures as the Minister &mdash; is that £25-30 million could be involved.  That is not a lot of money when one considers that revenue returns exceeded budgeted returns by £700 million. We are seeking a very small fraction of what has already been garnered by the Government. As the Minister is aware, a significant proportion of any increase is clawed back through the income tax system.  The net cost, which is the one Revenue and Department of Finance officials will consider, will be significantly lower than £25-30 million.  The Minister will have a better view in relation to the costs but that figure is my best estimate.</P>
    <P>If the Minister fails to honour the promise the Government made, he will undermine a relationship which has been at the core of Irish development since the early days of independence, namely, the relationship between the public service and the Government.  The basis upon which the process of social partnership between the <Col N="1339" /> Government and public service is built could also be undermined.  That is a very important aspect we should not forget about.</P>
    <P>Many people mentioned that the increases granted under the agreements were on a restructuring basis and could not be reflected in retired nurses' pension payments.  I reject that notion.  I feel that those pensioners have a legal right based on the European law principle of legitimate expectation.  They worked and made their contributions based upon an expectation that they would get back 50 per cent of what they had contributed. If that does not happen, this could and should lead to a legal challenge against the basis of any assessment which would give a different result.  People have a legitimate expectation to be paid this amount and, whatever solution is proposed, it should concur with that legitimate expectation.</P>
    <P>The time has come for this Government to face the responsibility of being in power.  It is all very well to make promises from the sideline.  A Government must deliver on its promises when in power; when a solemn commitment is given on a particular issue it is even more important to deliver.  Burying one's head in the sand is not only a totally inadequate response to the problem, it is undignified.  The sooner the Government addresses the issue of public service pensions the better for everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>This may well be a complex issue and the Minister will probably say it is.  However, it is my view that if the Government does not meet the other side involved, namely, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the public service committee, it cannot expect to make progress and resolve the problem.  Tardiness and obfuscation are no substitute for action.  Four months, or 117 days, have elapsed since this Government took office.  It is time this problem was resolved once and for all. I assure the Minister and the Government that pensioners will acknowledge the fact if progress is made.  As Deputy Quinn pointed out, a number of solutions were put forward but not one has been refined.  The Government has made no effort in the past four months to resolve this problem.  I ask the Minister to tackle this problem; I hope he is not being hindered by people who preach and practise right wing doctrinaire economics, namely, his Progressive Democrat colleagues.  I listened to too much heckling and lecturing from them when I sat on the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  One thing the Minister can be sure of is that as long as I am in Dáil Éireann I will not support any Government that has a PD influence.  I call upon the Minister to ensure immediately that the pensioners are given their just rights.</P>

      <P>The subject matter of the Labour Party's motion has been at the heart of public sector pensions increase policy for a considerable amount of time.  The Opposition Deputies should know that.  It did not suddenly emerge as an issue when this Government took office.  It was a live issue during the period of office of the previous Government but that Government did not take any action on it.  To put it in a nutshell, the question at issue is how to apply to pensioners the restructuring deals negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Those restructuring deals vary widely in their nature and give rise to great complexity when it comes to deciding how they should be applied to pensioners who retired before the various deals came into effect.</P>
      <P>I will set the issue in the wider context of public service pension costs generally, both the current costs and, in particular, the greatly increased costs which will emerge in the medium to long term.  I refer also to the work of the Commission on Public Service Pensions which submitted an interim report to me recently.  I intend to publish that report in the near future.  It is to present its final report by the end of next year and I look forward very much to receiving it.  The commission was established by my predecessor, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, against a background of growing concern generally about the emerging costs of existing public service pension terms, a problem which was likely to become even more difficult if concessions were made to the growing clamour for substantial improvements in those terms from a variety of public service groups.</P>

    <P>On the emerging cost of public service pensions, I note the Commission on Public Service Pensions is undertaking its own actuarial assessment of public service occupational pension schemes.  All the evidence indicates the projected <Col N="1342" /> increase in costs over the coming decades will be at least of the order indicated in earlier preliminary studies.  The likelihood is that, expressed in constant price terms, the cost of public service occupational pensions will increase from £540 million in 1995 to £2.2 billion in 2025 and to £2.6 billion in 2045.  This represents a fourfold increase over a 30 year period.  These projections are made in constant 1995 price terms and I assume there will be no improvement in public service pensions terms over this period.  In addition, if one were to assume a higher level of pay increase than is assumed in the projections, there would be a markedly different outcome.  For example, if it were assumed that average pay levels would increase by 5.2 per cent annually and prices by 2.7 per cent annually &mdash; as happened between 1987 and 1995 &mdash; the bill in the year 2025 would be £2.9 billion in constant price terms.  This would represent a multiple of over five times the 1995 bill.</P>
    <P>While one can argue about the precision of demographic forecasts and projections, this growth in Exchequer pension costs is not in doubt and the factors underlying it are quite clear.  The primary cause is the major increase in recruitment in the public service which took place in the late 1970s, which will lead to increased retirements in 20 to 30 years' time.  The two other contributing factors identified by the commission are increasing life expectancy and the greater number of female public servants who will qualify for pension benefits in the future.  These factors will mean that on average a pension will be paid over a longer period, and so will increase overall pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>The unfavourable cost outlook for public service pensions will materialise at a time when the general ageing of the population is placing ever growing demands upon the State's resources, particularly in the form of Social Welfare pensions and health care costs.  As regards the former, an actuarial review of social welfare pensions similar to the study being carried out on public service pensions was launched recently by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The review estimates that total pension payments by his Department will increase from £1.7 billion currently to £3.2 billion in 2026 and £4.3 billion in 2046, on the basis that pensions are increased in line with inflation.  If increased in line with earnings, the bill would rise to £5.6 billion in 2026 and £11.3 billion in 2046.</P>
    <P>The questions which must be asked when considering this evolving cost scenario are: can we afford the expected increase in pensions expenditure over the years ahead, and what must we do to manage and prepare for this growth in costs? As regards the first question, it is necessary to relate the growth in costs to measures which will grow in line with economic activity.  Making some broad assumptions about GNP growth, the commission has shown that expenditure on public service occupational pensions will increase from 1.6 <Col N="1343" /> per cent of GNP in 1995 to 2.3 per cent of GNP in 2025, before moving to 1.8 per cent in 2045.  By way of comparison, expenditure on social welfare pensions will increase from 4.8 per cent of GNP in 1996 to 5.9 per cent of GNP in 2026 and 7.9 per cent in 2046, assuming rates of payment are increased in line with earnings.  As a percentage of the public service pay bill, pensions expenditure will increase from a level of 11.5 per cent of pay in 1995 to 30 per cent of pay in 2025.  It will then reduce to 26 per cent of pay in 2045.</P>
    <P>As regards preparation for and management of the expected growth in costs, there are two aspects to this: the actual benefits provided by the pension schemes, and financial management and control arrangements.</P>
    <P>Turning to pension terms, it must be acknowledged that public servants have accrued pension entitlements on the basis of existing terms and these obligations cannot be set aside or ignored. It is also conceivable that some changes to pension scheme terms may be inevitable to take account of changes in operational needs and terms of employment and to reflect possible developments in EU and national legislation and case law.  The priority must be that additional pension scheme improvements are not introduced which would impose significant extra pension liabilities.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Commission on Public Service Pensions is carrying out the first independent examination of public service occupational pension schemes and their financing arrangements since the foundation of the State. Members are drawn from the pensions industry, Government Departments, trade unions and employers.  It is to present its report to Government next year.</P>
    <P>The interim report which I have recently received from the commission gives an outline of its work to date and comments on a number of issues coming within its terms of reference.  Commenting on the cost figures, the commission notes that the gross cost of public service pensions will undergo rapid escalation during the period 2005 to 2025.  While discounting the more alarming suggestions of a pensions &ldquo;time-bomb&rdquo;, the commission adds that an increase in the future pension costs of public servants of the magnitude indicated must give serious grounds for concern. The increase in cost will impact not alone on the fiscal position but on the competitiveness of the economy as a whole.  We can all agree that, given the prospect of a fourfold increase in the Exchequer pensions bill in coming decades, we cannot afford to adopt a liberal approach on this front with a consequential negative impact on the economy generally.</P>
    <P>Regarding pension terms, the commission states that a major change in pension terms could cause a significant escalation in pension costs well beyond the figures outlined in its report.  By their nature, changes to pension terms can often be effected at little or no short-term cost.  The commission <Col N="1344" /> warns that, while the effect of such changes might be modest in the short term, regard must be had to the long-term effects and the possibility that specific arrangements made in respect of one group of employees might trigger similar demands in respect of others.</P>
    <P>The commission's remit includes the question of whether public service occupational scheme terms remain appropriate having regard to changes in the working environment and conditions of employment of public servants and evolving operational requirements.  It must be acknowledged that public service pension schemes have remained fundamentally unchanged since the last century.  The system of occupational pension provision in place derives from the arrangements put in place to meet the needs of British civil servants in their old age. These were formalised in legislation during the 19th century and have remained unchanged since apart from some significant improvements in the last 30 years, for example, the introduction of a contributory scheme for spouses and children of public servants.  I look forward to receiving definitive views from the commission on these matters.</P>
    <P>To broaden the picture, Ireland is not alone in facing the effects of demographic ageing and the ever-increasing cost of pensions under both national pension systems and the pension systems for public servants.  Other European countries have had to face similar problems.  Many have introduced changes to pension terms with the aim, at least in part, of controlling the inevitable growth in costs.  For example, the commission has noted that there is a tendency abroad to increase retirement ages for public servants. We are at an earlier point in the demographic cycle compared with these countries and should be well placed to take the necessary action to help contain the emerging costs.</P>
    <P>How to manage and prepare for the anticipated growth in public service pension costs will also require an examination of the most appropriate mechanism for meeting pensions expenditure. The traditional approach, followed by most European countries, is &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; in which the cost of pensions is met from current revenues. Having regard to the escalation in costs in the years ahead, it is reasonable to ask whether advance funding might be a better alternative.</P>
    <P>It is often said in support of funding that the &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; system fails to recognise the long-term cost of an improvement in pension terms or an increase in coverage.  The focus is on benefits rather than costs.  The commission reviews the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches.  It has highlighted the costs of funding public service pensions which would be substantial. It has been estimated that a fund of the order of £15 billion would be needed to meet the public service pension liabilities accrued to date with an annual contribution of around £700 million to pay for future service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> The establishment of a fund would require &ldquo;double&rdquo; contributions from the Exchequer from the outset &mdash; it would be meeting on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&ldquo; basis the costs of the current generation of pensioners while meeting on a funded basis the accruing liability in respect of staff currently serving. A possible alternative to establishing a fund capable of meeting all liabilities would be to set up a partial fund to which pension contributions made by public servants could be lodged.  Other possibilities which may be examined include funding certain components of pension schemes while continuing to meet the cost of the other components on a &ldquo;pay-as-you-go&rdquo; basis.</P>
    <P>The commission has noted a number of practical and budgetary difficulties that would arise if funding, or even partial funding, were introduced and indicated that the matter will be examined further in its final report.  It suggests that there should be regular actuarial reviews of public service occupational pension schemes and proposed changes to pension scheme terms.  If formal funding is not introduced it is considered that there is a need to put in place a system which can clearly and quickly identify existing pension liabilities and the impact on these liabilities of increases in numbers or improvements in terms.</P>
    <P>The strategic management initiative has, as one of its objectives, the development of better financial systems.  The commission has indicated that a more transparent system of recording pension costs and liabilities would help contribute to an improved awareness among public service managers, employees and trade unions of the true value and cost of public service pensions and the cost impact of changes in pension terms.  These suggestions will have to be given careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of pension increases in the context of restructuring deals negotiated under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, a matter of immediate concern to public service pensioners.  It is useful to recap on the development of &ldquo;pensions parity&rdquo; in the public service.  The principle of parity of pensions was agreed in 1969.  In 1984, it was announced in the budget that general pay increases would apply to pensioners with effect from the date of the increases.  The 1986 budget extended full pension parity to special increases with effect from 1 July 1986.  During the past decade parity has been applied on the basis that pensioners would continue to have their pensions related to the salaries they would have had if they had continued to serve.</P>
    <P>The restructuring deals negotiated under the PCW do not fit comfortably within the traditional pattern of special pay increases.  In most cases, they were negotiated under option A of the restructuring clause.  This requires &ldquo;changes in structures, work practices or other conditions of service&rdquo; and &ldquo;must have regard to the need for flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change and must result in savings <Col N="1346" /> and an improved quality of public service&rdquo;. As an alternative, option B allows a single cost increasing claim for an amount not exceeding 3 per cent of the basic pay cost which would &ldquo;take into account the need for efficiency, flexibility and change and the contribution to be made by employees to such change&rdquo;.  While option B increases could readily be accommodated within the parameters of the old special increases and, therefore, passed on to pensioners, option A commits serving and future staff to deliver genuine productivity and flexibility which would not have been delivered by pensioners.  This clearly begs the question as to the appropriateness of applying such increases to people who have already left the service.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the various option A deals differ widely in their structure as a result of which, if traditional parity applied, the impact on public service pension groups would vary substantially. For example, many of the deals concentrated increases on the payscale whereas others concentrated some or much of the increases on non-scale improvements.  Consequently if parity, as traditionally operated were applied, some pensioners would get increases of the order of 15 per cent plus while many others would get 7 per cent or 8 per cent only.  At the other end of the scale, a substantial number would benefit only from a 1 per cent increase in salary already paid with effect from 1 April 1994 while many others would get nothing because their deal did not involve a pay increase.</P>
    <P>This may sound very esoteric and complex but it should be immediately obvious to Members that, if traditional parity applied in this instance, as proposed in the Labour Party motion, Garda pensioners would get no benefit whatsoever and teacher pensioners would get nothing more than the 1 per cent increase they have already received.  Is this what is intended?</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions the Government has considered in great detail the issue of applying pension increases under the restructuring clause of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to pensioners and, in order to help it in this area, referred the matter to the Commission on Public Service Pensions.  I wish to inform Deputy Quinn that I have given this matter a considerable amount of thought.  Indeed on 21 July last &mdash; approximately 27 days after assuming office &mdash; I wrote to Professor McAleese, chairperson of the Public Service Pensions Commission, asking him to consider this specific matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>Later that month or early August I met Professor McAleese to discuss my <Col N="1347" /> letter in detail and I informed him of what I wanted him to do.  Professor McAleese kindly said he would put it to the Commission on Public Service Pensions and replied to me on 18 September 1997.  Therefore it will clearly be seen that in that short interval I have done more about this matter than my predecessor over the preceding two and a half years.  I have referred the matter to Professor McAleese, met him, received his reply and discussed it with him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, its preliminary view on the pension increases issue, as set out in its interim report, was that pensions should be increased to provide a secure and fair level of retirement income to pensioners.  The commission went on to suggest that there are three principal pension increase options available &mdash; that is in line with pay, with the CPI or with some other index appropriate to pensioners &mdash; each of which will be considered in its final report.</P>
      <P>Members can rest assured that the Government will fully honour its commitment outlined in the Action Programme for the Millennium to protect public service pensions.  I trust my words this evening will have served to highlight the complexity of the problem and shown it cannot be resolved by the crude application of a simplistic obvious formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wants a fair and reasonable outcome to this matter and to provide, on an ongoing basis, a secure and fair level of retirement income for public service pensioners.  While ensuring that pensioners in general are dealt with equitably, I have to devise a solution which marries the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> deals with the rationale underlying the concept of pensions parity.  I must also have full <Col N="1348" /> regard to the emerging costs of the Exchequer pensions bill.</P>
    <P>It is against that background the Government will decide the manner in which the commitment to protect public service pensions will be implemented as part of the current Estimates/budgetary process.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Quinn is a democrat but, to endeavour to introduce the spurious argument that he is upset about the manner in which the electorate voted, how it gave its first preferences in the last general election ill becomes him.  The election is over, the Deputy should get on with being in Opposition, just as we are in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>I come from a constituency where the vote is secret so I do not know how many public service pensioners voted for me. During the general election canvass I met many people on pensions who were worried about this problem.  The commitment given by the Minister this evening will be honoured.</P>
      <P>Over the past weeks, and particularly since the presidential campaign began, we have heard a great deal about the U-turns done by those on this side of the House.  Fianna Fáil is not yet in a position to fulfil the promises made in the general election but if people examine our record in Government over the years, promises made before or during our terms of office were honoured. There is no reason to believe that the promise made on this occasion, to provide an equitable and fair level of retirement income for public service pensioners, will not be implemented.  That must be done and that is the Minister's view.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputies Quinn, Penrose and Moynihan-Cronin setting out their case.  One would think, having listened to them, that they did not exist prior to this evening but it must be remembered that it was under the aegis of the previous Government and the Labour-led Department of Finance that the PCW was negotiated.</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined in detail the problems he has encountered since coming into office but he assured the House and the pensioners that he will address those problems in the forthcoming budget.  The pensions, social welfare and public service areas will have great implications not only for this country but for all nations.  I assure my constituents that I will continue to raise this matter with the Minister to ensure they get the fair deal they deserve.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that the service given to this country by teachers, social workers, nurses, etc.  is second to none.  In comparison to the public service of other countries, the quality of our public service is excellent.  We all have relatives who served at different levels in the public service and we are therefore familiar with it on a personal basis.  These people deserve to get a fair return in the winter of their lives.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak to this motion.  I accept the Minister's point regarding the complexity of pensions and particularly the protections that will be required.  The Minister's elucidation of the projections need not be so dismal.  Let us hope there will be changes in the 21st century as dramatic as those which occurred in the last decade of this century.  I would like to think the projections could be a little more generous.</P>
      <P>Despite the complexity of projections for future pensions, current pensions should be increased in order to provide a secure and fair level of retirement income to pensioners.  Future commissions on pensions will examine projections and many of our pension structures might even change to include individual payments to pension schemes.  However, we are discussing the current situation of pensioners who are urgently seeking the payment of the pensions which were promised to them.  They not only worked to earn their pensions and the increase that is due to them, but they did so at an extraordinary time in our history and at huge cost which sometimes involved living almost on the poverty line.  They did it not only for themselves but to make this country what it is today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the difficulties in the projections, and we accept there might be restructuring in the future, the case to be made in this debate is on behalf of the pensioners who are seeking, with just cause, the immediate implementation of part of their pensions.  Their request should be considered in the context not only of the work they did, often at low levels of pay, to earn their pensions <Col N="1350" /> but also the inequalities under which they worked.</P>
    <P>I wish to remind Members how much we owe these people.  Many of the pensioners were involved in areas of employment which were virtually vocations, such as teaching and nursing, and they paid dearly for doing such work.  It is important to highlight the inequalities in their earnings during that time and the consequent discrimination against them in their pensions.  This is particularly relevant when one considers the position of women.  Deputy Moynihan-Cronin has already referred to the low levels of pay and the long, unsocial hours of hard work which nurses, the majority of whom are women, had to endure. That is still reflected in the pensions on which these nurses retired.</P>
    <P>During the decades we are discussing, there were three pay grades for teachers.  Female teachers were paid less than male teachers while teachers who were single women were paid less than either.  We owe these people not only for the work they did for low pay, at huge sacrifice and both outside and inside working hours, but also because they did that work at a time when there were huge social and legal inequalities.  The complex projections we make in the future will at least be based on equality and parity.</P>
    <P>The case we make tonight must be considered in terms of fairness as well as urgency.  In many cases women did not reach pension age because of the level at which they entered pension schemes, particularly in the public service.  It was assumed that many women would marry and move on.  If women did not marry and retired early, their pensions were severely curtailed because of the level at which they entered pension schemes.  Whatever the difficulties and state of the economy, we must be fair and pay pensions to workers in the future.  Thankfully, there are more workers today and I hope a larger number of earning people will contribute to pension schemes in the future so that we will not face the precarious situation being projected.</P>
    <P>We owe those people and not only in relation to recent promises.  They faced difficult times, were on low pay and often their work was not well rewarded or valued, particularly the women who were denied equal pay which would have given them parity in terms of pensions.  It is now pay back time.  I am sure our competent public service and future Ministers will adequately deal with pensions in the future.  However, we must pay those who were there for us when we depended on them.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny)</i>: Creid mé i gconaí, agus creidim fós, go mba chóir cothrom na féine a thabhairt do gach éinne, pé óg nó sean. Go mór mhór, ba chóir cothrom na féine a thabhairt do na sean daoine.  For that reason, I am not interested whether the previous, this or a future Government deals with this matter.  We must see that justice is done to pensioners who have served this country during their working years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> The Minister worries about the year 2045, but what did posterity ever do for us?  I know a teacher who would set off on a four mile journey on his secondhand Raleigh bicycle to a rural school where he had the company of a rat for a long time, where the door was falling apart and which had a fireplace in which three sods of turf would fit but by evening there would only be an ember.  That is a true story because I was that teacher.  Forty years ago gardaí set off on their bicycles to keep law and order.  We should not punish those who worked hard in the past and tolerated poor conditions simply because a new arrangement has been made where teachers and gardaí will use modern equipment and do tasks which those in the past did not do.  We did not have squad cars or radar traps in the past.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for the decision that pensioners should carry the can.  It is fascinating that the PCW, negotiated by the unions and Government, caused this problem.  Why should health workers, who looked after us in the past, but who are now known by another name, be deprived of the pensions which are due to them? I defend the rights of pensioners to be looked after.  If we will face a problem in the year 2045, we have almost 50 years to plan ahead.  We cannot tell people, who in the past paid their taxes in good faith and who worked in very bad conditions, that the future looks bleak and because we may not have enough to fund pensions in the year 2045 ask them to make a sacrifice now.  It is deplorable and I am not making that as a political point.  I understand the Minister's position because he is trying to balance the books.  In his opening statement he said this was being considered in the course of the current Estimates and budgetary process.  I presume he is saying that when the budget comes along he will fix this up despite the difficulties.</P>
    <P>The people who have served this country well deserve that and I will continue to argue on their behalf while I am a Member.  If I were on the Government benches I would do the very same thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people are now receiving pensions which date from a time when we could not afford to pay them adequate salaries.  Their pensions were inhibited because of that.  In addition, cost of living demands on people living on pensions today take on a whole new urgency and create a new poverty for many differing reasons.  The Minister pointed out the type of problems we may face in future with regard to restructuring pensions and having a new perception of how people should fund their own pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, the social context in which people live has changed dramatically and pensions have not taken cognisance of that.  In a simpler and more rural social existence we had an extended family where people retired gracefully with a pension.  They did not have to pay for their <Col N="1352" /> total upkeep, including rent and individual maintenance which, naturally, is always more expensive when living alone than if it is shared.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge social change in the way we live and in the cost of living.  We all know the numbers of people who are living on small pensions, sometimes in genteel poverty, if I may use the phrase.  Because of the work they have done and their standing and status within the community, they will not allow their dignity to be damaged by telling others the level of subsistence on which they must live.  They do not have an extended family, or the country style many of us grew up in, to cushion them.  Many pensioners live in isolated areas and must pay not only for their maintenance but for sheer survival with regard to security and the ever present danger of being robbed of the small amount of money they have.</P>
    <P>The older generation faces social and financial difficulties which were not foreseen when they were working.  Many pensioners are attempting to keep and maintain large houses and accommodation which they cannot sell because in doing so they would lose their only sense of investment, security and funding for their old age.  In addition, while the progress of medical science has resulted in longer life cycles, there are huge medical, financial and security burdens placed on people if they are to have a quality of life in their final years.</P>
    <P>We are not just considering a group of people who have come from a low pay and low pension strata compared with the earnings and pensions, many of them private, that our educated and trained young workers will be able to fund.  We must also remember that we have a highly trained and financially secure youth today with secure pension provisions to 2045 because the people now on pensions invested in them.  That contribution must be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The last deadline before which the Government must resolve this problem by giving pensioners what they deserve with dignity and without further lobbying is 3 December.  If it is to be conceded in the budget it should be made in time to make the lives and security of pensioners at Christmas and during 1998 better than when, to our shame, they had to picket and lobby before these Houses to get what is rightly theirs and what they rightly deserve.</P>

      <P>I support the pensioners in this instance.  A delegation from the Castlebar area, including people from St. Mary's Hospital and the county hospital, who visited my clinic some weeks ago were upset and annoyed that this commitment was not being honoured by the Government. The Government has broken many commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should reward those who have worked loyally for the State for many years and were expecting these increases.  It is wrong that we should have to debate this matter tonight; the pensioners should have been given these <Col N="1353" /> increases automatically.  The convention should not have been broken.  As a result, they will not receive the same treatment as those on non-contributory pensions.  It is wrong that they must fight for the increases.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition, Fianna Fáil gave a commitment to honour this increase.  I hope the party does so because it has not honoured any of its pre-election promises.  I also hope it will be included in the budget and that the pensioners in St. Mary's Hospital, Castlebar, and the general hospital, Castlebar, and all those in the public service will be paid their entitlements.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sligo Harbour Commissioners.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this issue.  I compliment Sligo Harbour Commissioners for their tremendous work over the years to keep Sligo port up and running.  It was a difficult task because funding was not forthcoming from the Department for many years.  The commissioners have outlined the extreme seriousness of the situation at Sligo port and the threat to port business, employment and related commercial activities as a result of the diminishing depths of water in the approach channel and at the deepwater berths.</P>
      <P>The level of port traffic, while modest in national terms, has remained reasonably stable over recent years and continues to make an important contribution to the economic activity of the north-west region.  For example, in 1987 there were 28 vessels in the port with a tonnage of 48,836 tonnes, and in 1996 there were 22 vessels with a tonnage of 34,288 tonnes.  The cargoes are largely of coal, slack, coke and timber.  To maintain even this level of traffic, however, requires the carrying out of immediate remedial drainage or dredging.</P>
      <P>The future development of the port and the attraction of new business calls for a programme of integrated and phased investment in the infrastructure of the port and new equipment.  This can only be achieved if the port receives fair treatment in the allocation of State and EU aid, as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full-time gang of dockers, which provides a stevedoring service at the port, has a complement of ten men.  The harbour board itself has two full-time employees and one part-time <Col N="1354" /> employee.  The port also employs directly two harbour pilots and one pilot boatman.</P>
    <P>While the direct employment at the port and its marine-related activities reflects the modest level of trade in terms of numbers of vessels and tonnage, there is a considerable indirect effect on employment in the major companies using the harbour.  Even with modern cargo handling equipment, the loading and unloading of vessels remains a labour intensive activity.</P>
    <P>The main timber importing firm has approximately 30 persons involved in the servicing of its port-related trade.  This includes the lorry drivers and helpers, forklift truck drivers and manual workers as well as administrative staff dealing with shipping business.  The coal trade accounts for the employment of a further 15 persons and the occasional cargoes, both import and export, of fishmeal gave casual employment to four persons in recent years.</P>
    <P>Maintaining the port open and in a condition which will attract continuing business is crucial to the continuation of this level of employment.  This does not take into account the potential for further employment which would result from a growth in trade.  The ability to attract bulk dry cargo and other business, as envisaged in the 1995 development plan for the port, would greatly enhance the capacity of the port to provide additional employment in cargo handling and in warehousing, storage and distribution to the benefit of the north-west region.</P>
    <P>The order of priority for port improvement works is, first, the dredging and restoration of the approach channel and deepwater berths, at an approximate cost of £980,000; second, cargo handling equipment, at a cost of £243,000; third, a new roadway to provide access to bunded areas and to open up the port's industrial zone, at a cost of £260,000; fourth, a spur road linking deepwater berths to the new roadway, at a cost of £80,000; fifth, warehousing and dry storage areas, at a cost of £375,000; sixth, an open yard area for bulk cargo, at a cost of £95,000; and seventh, the reconstruction of the upper quay wall, at a cost of £70,000.</P>
    <P>Sligo port is an important regional resource.  It has a special strategic importance in the Border region and justifies support in terms of regional development and investment.  It is the only real commercial harbour between Derry and Galway. It has cross-Border potential because of its proximity to Fermanagh and Tyrone.  While it is financially viable at present, it needs to have its operational facilities greatly improved if it is to remain open to shipping.  Millions of pounds of EU and UK money have been spent in Derry port in recent years and this poses an obvious threat to the continued operation of Sligo port.  Sligo should be enabled to operate on a reasonably level playing field with other ports, North and South, which have received significant State and EU funding.  Also, since it is in the Border area, Sligo is the only commercial harbour on the west <Col N="1355" /> coast which would be eligible for assistance under the INTERREG programme 1994 to 1999.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Department and the Minister give their support to the immediate implementation of the main proposals I have outlined. Surely it is unacceptable that Sligo port should be left in an unregarded category as far as State and EU funding are concerned, where it can only stagnate and decay.  The grant of State company status to the harbour and a fair allocation of funding to enable it develop commercially and successfully must be given serious and urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Reynolds for giving me the opportunity to address the House on this matter.  In September 1997 Sligo Harbour Commissioners submitted a revised development plan for their harbour.  Dredging of the harbour and disposal of the spoil was considered by the commissioners to be the most urgent work required. The commissioners' estimate of the cost of the works was in the region of £900,000.</P>
      <P>On 10 September 1997 two senior officials of my Department visited the harbour and met the harbour board.  They were briefed, <i>inter alia</i>, on the need for such dredging.  Deputy Matt Brennan also drew this matter to my attention and as a result I am meeting a deputation from Sligo Harbour Commissioners tomorrow.  The commissioners are anxious to obtain dredged levels, which were provided by the last major dredging campaign carried out in 1985, of 2.2 metres below chart datum.  Soundings taken by the commissioners in May 1997 indicate that the amount of situation adjacent to the deep water jetty and in the approach channel is considerable and variable in depth.</P>
      <P>On 22 September 1997 the Department's district engineer visited the harbour and met the harbour master and a dredging agent to discuss the proposed dredging campaign.  In his preliminary report the Department's engineer has noted that while the proposal for dredging is to restore levels to 2.2 metres below chart datum, this may require further technical assessment by way of hydrographic survey, site investigation, spoil analysis, etc., to ensure that any dredging undertaken meets the full needs of vessels using the harbour currently and in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that the volume of dredged spoil may be of the order of 150,000 cubic metres and that this could be accommodated in the port's bunded disposal area.  A preliminary estimate of the cost of dredging, including disposal of dredged spoil, is some £1 million.  I am also advised that the existing wall needs substantial renovations at an estimated cost of £250,000.  The preliminary report from my engineering division puts the proposed dredging and ancillary works at around £1.25 million.  I am advised that while the harbour commissioners could provide some funding towards the dredging project, they are <Col N="1356" /> not in a position to fund the total cost of the project. A financial contribution from the Exchequer has been sought by the harbour commissioners.</P>
    <P>Traffic levels through Sligo harbour have been declining in recent years and the long-term future of the port is a matter of shared concern.  Prior to any decision on dredging and possible funding options, the Department will require a business plan covering the next five years to underpin the required Exchequer assistance as well as the investment from the port's own resources.</P>
    <P>The strategy statement for my Department includes provision for a review of the strategic options or the future development and management of the declining commercial regional ports, including Sligo, where traditional activities may be diminishing.  In the context of Sligo port as well as other regional and strategic ports, the question of national port capacity requirements &mdash; and in particular, future capacity requirements &mdash; needs to be addressed.  I will shortly make an announcement about arrangements for a national review which will include Sligo harbour.  The Deputy will appreciate that pending the outcome of this comprehensive evaluation process and the full exploration of the economic viability of possible options, I am not in a position to finalise a decision in the matter of the provision of funds to Sligo Harbour Commissioners.  The Deputy can take it that this is a matter I will examine in detail.  I understand the present position.  I will meet the commissioners tomorrow and I will bear his concerns in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the problem of flooding in Clonmel. I wish to convey to the Minister the anger, hurt, frustration and annoyance of the flood victims at the unacceptable delay in the publication of the expert report on the causes of the exceptional flooding in Clonmel.  I wish to stress my embarrassment at the inhuman, uncaring and delaying tactics of the Government on this matter. This is a sad example of a political response to a traumatic and harrowing experience.</P>
      <P>Why has the report not been published?  While my party was in Government my colleague, Deputy Coveney, having visited Clonmel during the flooding, insisted on commissioning an independent investigation into the causes of the flooding and possible solutions to the problem.  I understand that this report was ready to be presented to the Department in June.  However, although in the intervening four months there have been promises of publication, they have been broken.  The last promise was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, who indicated in a letter dated 3 October that the report would be published in a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last excuse given was that the report was being updated to take account of the most recent flooding in August.  I remind the Government that as recently as last week the flood victims continued <Col N="1357" /> to experience the trauma of having flood water at their doorsteps.  Fortunately, it did not flood the houses on this occasion.  If the Minister wishes to delay publication to update the report for the latest flooding I guarantee there will be plenty of examples to take into account unless the Government solves the problem because one flood will follow another.</P>
    <P>There is suspicion in Clonmel why the report is being delayed.  We want the report in full giving the unvarnished truth.  We will accept nothing less and we will wait no longer.  While the Minister and his officials update the report on the recent floods in Clonmel, the people there live in fear of the next downpour.  Yet, there has not been a word from the Department since January when the most serious flooding took place.  There have been no consultations, meetings or communications. The people in Clonmel are the victims and the Minister's silence is a further blow.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Cullen, gave a verbal commitment that he would attend the 7 October meeting of Clonmel Corporation.  We looked forward to meeting him because we thought it would be an up-front meeting.  He did not honour his commitment.  He left the public representatives and the victims of the flooding with nothing to look forward to.  Of course, he was accompanied then by television cameras and reporters.  In January 1996, at the height of the flooding, the Taoiseach, accompanied by cameramen, visited Clonmel to view the flooding.  Nobody will visit Clonmel now. We want to know what is causing the flooding and what solutions are being offered.</P>
    <P>I speak from the heart and remind the Minister of the trauma and fear the people of Clonmel are suffering.  There is no word from the Government on the causes of the flooding or a solution to that problem.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State saw the situation at first hand last August.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw it and it was horrendous.  The Minister of State appreciates the hardship many of the citizens of Clonmel suffered then and before as a consequence of flooding.  The Deputy can be assured that no unnecessary time has been lost or no effort spared in getting the expert report completed.  The Minister of State advised Clonmel Corporation on 24 September 1997 that his officials would be in touch with the corporation directly when they had examined the report.  His office further communicated with the corporation on 29 September 1997 to inform it that he would <Col N="1358" /> not be accepting its invitation to attend a meeting of the corporation on 7 October 1997 in advance of the expert report being completed.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the preliminary report prepared by the consultant engineering firm commissioned by the Office of Public Works to investigate the causes of flooding in Clonmel, County Tipperary, was updated to take account of extra data obtained from recent flooding in August last.  The consultants' updated report has been received by the Office of Public Works in the past few days and the Minister of State is taking steps to have this report evaluated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, arrangements have been made for officials from the Office of Public Works in conjunction with the consultant engineers to make a presentation of the findings of the report together with suggested solutions to the flood problems identified for Clonmel to a meeting of Clonmel Corporation on the evening of 4 November 1997.  In addition, consultants are being commissioned to carry out a full environmental impact assessment on the basis of the report.  A cost/benefit analysis will need to be undertaken when a final scheme design has been agreed.</P>
    <P>It is not the practice to publish this type of report nor is it proposed to publish the consultants' report in this case, but copies will be made available to the local authorities and, if necessary, a copy can be lodged in the local library.  The report will form the basis for discussion regarding the acceptable level of flood protection required by the people of Clonmel and the scheme of works necessary to achieve that protection.  When a design has been agreed between all the parties the consultants will finalise the cost/benefit analysis and complete the environmental impact assessment.  When a cost beneficial scheme has been identified, documents will be prepared for public exhibition in accordance with the Arterial Drainage Act and submitted to the Minister for Finance for approval to exhibit.  On completion of the exhibition process and the resolution of all objections and observations, the scheme will then be submitted to the Minister for Finance for confirmation as required by legislation.  I assure Deputy Ahearn that the Minister of State is proceeding to deal with this matter.  He and Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food are conscious of the points she raised and of the urgency of having the works agreed and completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this important matter which is reaching crisis point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> The County Hospital in Roscommon received an allocation of £300,000 for capital works in the surgical ward from the previous Government. That funding, which must be welcomed, is long overdue.  This refurbishment will provide 30 beds where there are currently 29, in addition to four day beds and one bed for a hospice unit.  This allocation is wholly inadequate to alleviate overcrowding in the hospital.</P>
    <P>Prior to November 1996, St. Coman's medical ward, with an official complement of 31 beds, was overcrowded on a regular basis.  The ward often accommodated 45 to 50 patients and occasionally more than that number.  As a result, concerns arose about privacy, comfort, the ability to deliver nursing care and health and safety issues, including fire safety.  Following a consultation process a limit of 37 was placed on the number of patients admitted to the ward, which has placed pressure on the accident and emergency unit in the hospital.  Since this shift in policy, over 700 people have been obliged to remain on trolleys overnight with some spending up to three nights in these intolerable conditions.  This is a damning statistic for any health service, particularly as the country is enjoying its greatest economic boom since the foundation of the State and has one of the fastest growing economies in the world. However, Ireland's expenditure on health is the third lowest of all OECD countries.</P>
    <P>In the first eight months of the current year there have been 9,666 attendances at the accident and emergency unit, an increase of over 1,000 on the corresponding period last year.  Since September 1997, no patient awaiting a bed is accommodated in the accident and emergency waiting area.  Until that date, patients were accommodated in an area which was described by nursing staff as bleak and cold.  Patients are instead cared for in the accident and emergency suite itself. This is placing serious pressure and demands on staff and putting the lives of critically ill patients in danger.</P>
    <P>A patient recently entered the hospital during the early hours of the morning suffering a cardiac arrest and was obliged to wait for 15 hours on a trolley before being admitted to coronary care. This is only one of the many hair raising stories from the casualty unit and such situations should not be permitted to happen.  Must we wait until something serious happens to a patient before the problem is rectified?</P>
    <P>The County Hospital in Roscommon urgently requires additional funding to avoid a disastrous situation during the winter period when serious overcrowding traditionally occurs.  This year the problem is worse because, due to overcrowding, enormous pressure was placed on staff, resources and accommodation during the summer.  A time bomb is waiting to explode during the winter.  I urge the Minister to provide funding for an additional 20 beds at the County Hospital.  While any additional allocation would be welcome, the provision of 20 beds is the minimum required to <Col N="1360" /> ensure that this perennial problem can be tackled once and for all.</P>
    <P>There is a need for the Department of Health and Children to honour a commitment given to the Western Health Board to provide funding for four nurses and one laboratory technician who were employed when the consultant geriatrician was appointed in 1993.  For the past four years, the health board has had to fund these appointments from its own budget and the promised additional funding from the Department has not materialised.  This additional pressure on meagre resources leaves little room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto states that in Government that party would streamline accident and emergency services, particularly in Dublin where a major crisis develops each winter.  There are serious problems in Dublin, but the greatest crisis this winter will occur in County Roscommon. The Taoiseach, when he was in County Roscommon prior to the election, gave a commitment that the required funding would be provided under a Fianna Fáil led Government.  It is now time the Minister for Health and Children lived up to the commitments given by his Department and the Taoiseach.  If this money is not approved immediately, the Minister will have blood on his hands in a couple of months.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister who does not live far from County Roscommon &mdash; just across the River Shannon &mdash; to view the position first hand.  I will accompany him if he visits the County Hospital in Roscommon.  The situation is serious and somebody will have blood on their hands if it is not rectified immediately.</P>

      <P>I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister is fully aware and appreciative of the acute services which Roscommon County Hospital provides to the population of its catchment area on behalf of the Western Health Board.  Throughout the years it has served the community well in areas such as surgery, medicine, geriatric assessment and psychiatry as well as providing consistently high quality casualty and outpatient services.  In this regard the Western Health Board has increased the budget of the hospital by 9.5 per cent since 1995 to enable it to maintain a high level of service.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Children is, however, aware of the difficulties the hospital has had in recent years in relation to overcrowding and has taken steps to address this problem by approving capital works at an estimated cost of £300,000.  The Western Health Board has informed the Department that these works will commence shortly and should be completed in the early part of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When completed, the medical overcrowding will be alleviated, hospice bed and ancillary <Col N="1361" /> accommodation will be provided, the surgical ward will be renovated and increased private bed accommodation will be provided.  The post of the second surgeon has been cleared by the Department of Health and Children and I understand that, subject to some final clarification on the proposed sessional split for this post, it is due to be approved finally by Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Children is also aware that the hospital has pressing equipment requirements and he is glad to inform the Deputy that he has sanctioned an additional maximum <Col N="1362" /> grant of £400,000 for the health board to purchase priority items of equipment for its acute hospitals, including Roscommon, during the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>It is important to bear in mind that the warrant for arrest for failure to pay a fine was issued by the court.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the exercise of their functions.  It is not open to the Minister to comment on the courts' decision and there is a duty on the Garda to act on foot of those decisions.  The Minister wishes, however, to comment on the circumstances surrounding the execution of the warrant, given the publicity which the matter has attracted.</P>
      <P>While fully appreciating the upset and inconvenience which is experienced when the garda come to execute a warrant, the Minister wishes to explain that the person referred to by the Deputy was given notice, both orally and in writing by the gardaí that there was a warrant in existence for non-payment of her television licence.  The fine was not paid and she was accordingly arrested on foot of the warrant.  Following her arrest, a neighbour took care of her children and the Minister understands that the person in question agreed to this arrangement.  She was taken to Rathfarnham Garda station where she spoke to her father and sister by telephone.  The Minister understands that an offer was made by a family member to pay the fine at this stage but that she declined the offer.  In addition to the warrant for non-payment of the television licence, a second warrant &mdash; for sale of intoxicating liquor by retail &mdash; was also executed against this person.</P>
      <P>The precise information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of persons committed to prison for non-payment of fines for not having a television licence is not available.  However, in 1993, the latest year for which relevant information is available, the total number of persons committed in default of fines was 1,880.  It is not possible to say how many of these committals related to television licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a general point the Minister wishes to say that he is concerned that we have a relatively cumbersome and expensive system for dealing <Col N="1364" /> with the non-payment of fines even for small sums of money.  The Minister is having this issue considered to see if there are viable alternatives, including the attachment of income.  But, as the law stands, the Garda will be obliged to execute warrants of this kind issued by the courts.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been provided with some factual information in this case which points towards human error within the courts.  While in no doubt that this is a matter of understandable public concern which must be investigated, the Minister thinks it would be wrong, pending completion of the examination being carried out by the president of the District Court, to provide partial information, lest it prove prejudicial to the president's examination.</P>
      <P>The Minister thinks its important however &mdash; and that it is not in any way prejudicial to the examination now under way &mdash; to inform the House that in advance of completion of this examination the president, in conjunction with the chief clerk of the Dublin Metropolitan District Court, made changes to arrangements regarding the issuing of warrants designed to ensure that there can be no repetition of the circumstances which are in this case.  The person in question has not yet been rearrested and is being actively sought by the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commissioner correctly emphasised that policing solutions alone will not solve the crime problem.  There is a need to identify features of our society which may contribute to crime and to reach agreement on how best to deal with them.  It is important, also, that the community itself is involved, in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, in reducing crime levels.</P>
      <P>The Minister wishes to state that many of these points were highlighted in a discussion document Tackling Crime which was published last May by my Department.  As the Minister has already announced he intends to set up a crime forum which will canvass comment, assessments and suggestions on crime and crime-related issues from the general community and from both national and international experts.</P>
      <P>The proceedings of the forum will also assist in the further development of criminal justice policy and, in particular, will help clarify the issues which will need to be addressed in the forthcoming White Paper on Crime.  The Minister expects the forum will also provide ideas on how best to structure the community based crime council which he intends to establish.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, of course, extensive action is being taken on a number of fronts.  The Government is pursuing a range of measures to tackle social exclusion.  Some £10 million is being made available through the national drugs strategy team to fund projects identified by the 13 local drugs task forces as priorities in each of their areas.  The initial allocation from this fund has recently been approved by Government and the Minister expects to see the benefits come on line in the near future.  The allocation of the balance of the fund is now being addressed.</P>
      <P>There are also currently 12 special projects run by the Garda Síochána which are aimed at diverting at-risk juveniles away from crime.  These projects are crime preventive in nature and have been introduced successfully in a number of areas throughout the country.  There are, in addition, other developmental projects or initiatives in deprived areas either run or funded by the Departments of Education and Science, Social, Community and Family Affairs, and the health boards.  In July of this year, the Government established the interdepartmental policy group on local development to develop a comprehensive Government strategy on local development and to focus on improving the quality of life of communities characterised by high levels of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Having said all that, the Minister thinks it important also to make the point that deficiencies within society can never excuse crime and that there are many who would engage in crime as a career, regardless of societal influences.  In regard to these there should be no misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> The Government is proceeding with a range of initiatives to frustrate career criminals.  The Minister need hardly say that the commissioner fully endorses these initiatives.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland has among the lowest crime levels of any developed country and this Government is committed to lowering that level even further.</P>

      <P>The Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order, 1997, (S. I. No. 277 of 1997) which came into operation on 29 June 1997, provides that an immigration officer may examine a non-national arriving in the State from Great Britain or Northern Ireland for the purpose of determining whether he or she should be given leave to land in the State.  The effect of the measure is to introduce into Irish law a requirement that non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from Britain or Northern Ireland must meet the same entry requirements as non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from any other part of the world. In accordance with the statutory provisions, an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a non-national who, for example, is not in possession of a valid passport or some other document establishing his nationality or identity, or who does not have a valid Irish visa where required.  I have no proposals for a change in the present situation.</P>

      <P>The implementation of this policy and the development of policing strategies is the subject of ongoing consultation between the Minister and the Garda Commissioner as well as between senior management personnel in the Garda Síochána and my Department.  A number of specific initiatives have already been taken and more will follow.  Evaluation of the effects of such initiatives will be made after an appropriate lapse of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> The Government has set out very clearly what it intends to do to meet the challenge of crime in society.  The intention is that no category of crime which interferes with the safe and peaceful conduct of citizens' lives will be ignored.  Clearly, however, the major focus must be on serious crime.  The approach being taken comprises a range of practical measures and key legislative changes which will focus mainly on the serious criminal &mdash; in particular those who seek to profit from the deadly trade in illegal drugs, whether as financiers, suppliers or pushers.  That focus is directed towards assisting the Garda Síochána with resources to strengthen its operational hand and to increase the State's statutory armoury to deal effectively with those engaged in major crime &mdash; in particular introducing a minimum ten year sentence for drug dealing, speedier trials and automatic asset inquiries at the sentencing stage.</P>
    <P>At a structural level the Government is taking a number of steps to ensure that the crinimal justice system is an effective deterrent to criminals. These include the provision of 1,000 more prison spaces in two years, increasing Garda numbers to 12,000 over five years and giving agency status to the Prisons Service and the courts to help them function more efficiently.</P>

      <P>Notice of issue of all certificates of naturalisation is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in the prescribed manner.  However, it has not been the practice to identify separately persons naturalised under the provisions of the investment based scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> There is no doubt that persons granted naturalisation under the scheme would have assumed that their business was otherwise being conducted on the basis of confidentiality and would not be the subject of any special publicity.  It would certainly be of considerable importance to companies benefiting from such investments that commercially sensitive information, concerning their future viability etc., would be treated in confidence.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that my Department is the most appropriate Department to exercise responsibility for promoting equal opportunities for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Government views disability as a social rather than a health issue and recognises that disability is one of the most important social issues facing Ireland today.  We are committed to radical change to ensure that the needs and aspirations of people with disabilities, their families, carers and advocates are comprehensively addressed.  It is for this reason that, for the first time, a Minister of State who will have specific responsibility for promoting the rights of people with disabilities and their families and carers, has been appointed and assigned to my Department.  I, and my colleagues in Government, are committed to ensuring that disability is firmly placed where it belongs &mdash; on the agenda of every Department and public body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> The Government's key priorities include the implementation of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, the preparation of revised Employment Equality and Equal Status Bills, which will have regard to the findings of the Supreme Court, and a disabilities Bill which will set out the rights of people with disabilities together with a means of redress for those whose rights are denied.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda Síochána that the problem of drugs and drug related crime in the Dublin area is being addressed in the context of Operation Dóchas with considerable success.  This is a Garda anti-drugs initiative and incorporates dedicated gardaí being employed in specific identified areas, concentrating on drug related activities.  Since Operation Dóchas commenced on 7 October 1996, drugs with an estimated value of £4,240,335 have been seized.  Gardaí involved in Operation Dóchas and local communities are united in their efforts to make it a success.</P>
      <P>With regard to vandalism, I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no identifiable increase in instances of vandalism in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>I would also like to draw attention to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, which was introduced by the Minister for the Environment and came into effect from 1 July 1997. The Act provides for a range of measures to assist housing authorities in addressing problems arising on their housing estates from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour.  The Act provides for a new exclusion order procedure against individual occupants of a local authority house involved in anti-social behaviour thereby avoiding the need for eviction of entire households in certain circumstances.  It also includes provisions for the Garda, on notification by the housing authority, to remove squatters who are engaged in anti-social behaviour from local authority housing.  The Act also assists housing authorities to discharge their housing estate management function in a positive manner in conjunction with the various other initiatives which have been taken to promote estate management particularly in the area of partnership between the authority and tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the national drugs strategy team on which my Department is represented is involved in focusing the distribution of resources to those <Col N="1372" /> areas most affected by the drugs problem which would include communities such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that there will be no let-up in the fight against crime and that further measures will be taken by this Government as required.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>In the interests of efficiency and effectiveness the Minister intends to pursue a policy where the Gardaí could shed functions which they have traditionally carried out, but which do not necessarily have to be discharged by police officers.  This will assist them to focus on the core policing duties for which they have been specially trained. In this regard, the Minister will be reviewing the proposals contained in the reports of the interdepartmental group on Garda deployment in the DMA and the steering group on Garda efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>I should, of course, emphasise that what the Minister has in mind in all of this is the assignment to others of non-police functions only.  The Minister will be taking particular care and will listen to expert advice to ensure that what can properly be regarded as police functions remain with the Garda Síochána who have the training and the tradition to discharge these functions in the way the public expects them to be discharged.</P>
      <P>The plans to transfer responsibility from the Garda in Dublin for the management of the traffic warden, on-the-spot fines and tow-away services to Dublin Corporation are an entirely separate matter.</P>

      <P>The Garda Commissioner has established a CCTV advisory group to review the future of CCTV systems as an aid to policing. They have prioritised the following locations for the installation of Garda CCTV systems: Dublin South-Central, Finglas, Cork and Limerick.  I understand that the operational benefits of CCTV in other urban locations including Dundalk are under consideration by the advisory committee and that these will be scheduled as resources become available.  However, no application has been received from local community interests for the installation of a CCTV system in Drogheda.  Funding for CCTV is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Persons who arrive in the State and seek asylum are classified as asylum seekers.  Persons who do not satisfy the regulations governing control on entry to the State, such as arriving in the State without proper documentation and persons failing to report as required to an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána, would be classified as illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>The Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order, 1997, which came into operation on 29 June 1997, provides that an immigration officer may examine a non-national arriving in the State from Great Britain or Northern Ireland for the purpose of determining whether he or she should be given leave to land in the State.  The effect of the measure is to introduce into Irish law a requirement that non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from Britain or Northern Ireland must meet the same entry requirements as non-EU nationals seeking to enter Ireland from any other part of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As of 30 September this year some 2,992 persons had claimed asylum in the State.  To date, <Col N="1374" /> approximately 1,300 persons, over 800 of them in the past four months, have been refused leave to land as they were not properly documented or did not meet other immigration requirements.  It is not possible to give a breakdown of the number of persons who are illegally in the State.  Such persons, by their very nature, are usually unknown to the authorities.  Experience to date would suggest that a significant proportion of those persons who have sought asylum in the State over the past year in particular may be persons who have no valid claim to refugee status and are abusing the special provisions for protection of refugees.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister introduced the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order, 1996, specifically in an attempt to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and to ensure the integrity of Ireland's refugee procedures.  There has been much public disquiet about the growing problem of illegal immigration into Ireland and I share that disquiet.  I am satisfied that any arrangements which will prevent persons from abusing the provisions for the protection of refugees will benefit genuine asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I might add that international experience is that asylum procedures are regularly abused for illegal immigration purposes.  I recently attended an international conference with almost 40 other Ministers and representatives of international institutions which examine the worldwide problem of illegal immigration.  At that conference, I was interested to hear the UNHCR representative speak on discouraging the abuse of asylum procedures.  He said that a number of migrants seeking employment, rather than protection from persecution, circumvent legal immigration regulations and request asylum.  He emphasised &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that attempts by people with no valid claim to international protection to take advantage of asylum procedures create serious problems by clogging those procedures. He went on to say that, moreover, such abusive claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and, in turn, reflected negatively on the asylum institution and, hence, on bona fide refugees.  The UNHCR also underlined another major concern of states and the UNHCR alike and that is the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have found, or could have found, protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere. Movements of this kind have a destablising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that genuine refugees and others who lawfully enter the state will be treated in accordance with the highest international standards &mdash; which is what they deserve &mdash; we simply must continue with measures designed to halt illegal immigration.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 49, 97 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Nobody has been refused asylum as a result of the implementation of the Aliens (Amendment) (No. 3) Order, 1997, which entered into force on 29 June 1997.</P>
      <P>In the period up to 16 October some 820 persons were refused permission to land on arrival from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Of this total, only 22 persons said they were seeking asylum. They were returned to Britain or Northern Ireland, as appropriate, to have their cases processed. This action was in accordance with long held policy that a person should seek asylum in the first safe country reached.  The persons concerned obviously arrived from Britain or Northern Ireland where they had an opportunity to lodge asylum claims.  Since 1 September such cases fall to be dealt with dealt with in accordance with section 22 of the Refugee Act, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the general policy of successive Ministers not to disclose information on the nationality of asylum seekers or refugees having regard to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided. Such identification could have serious implications, particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin.  However, where there is a significant number of applications from certain countries of origin I am prepared to list those nationalities.  The main countries of origin of asylum seekers this year are Romania, Zaire, Nigeria, Algeria, Somalia and Angola &mdash; persons stating that they come from <Col N="1378" /> these countries account for almost 80 per cent of the applications lodged so far this year.</P>
    <P>Applications are considered in accordance with out international obligations &mdash; the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 New York Protocol thereto, and the 1990 Dublin Convention.  The procedure for processing cases has been agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Asylum seekers are referred to the local health board, usually the Eastern Health Board as most asylum claims are lodged in Dublin, where they are paid supplementary welfare allowances and assisted in finding accommodation.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs has advised me that additional staff, community welfare officers, interpreters and porters, have been allocated to the Eastern Health Board to help deal with the increase in the number of asylum seekers.  A specialised reception centre has been set up at James's Street Hospital.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance legislation provides entitlement to &ldquo;every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs .&rdquo; (s. 171 Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1993).  There is no residence condition in the legislation, and presence in the State is sufficient to receive a payment regardless of immigration status.  Accordingly, asylum seekers qualify for SWA.  A single person may qualify for a payment of £65.40 per week and a married couple with two children may qualify for a payment of £131.80 per week.  Payment may continue indefinitely and may include all SWA elements including adult dependant allowance, child dependant allowance, rent supplements and other payments such as exceptional needs payments and clothing and footwear allowance.  In addition, child benefit may be paid for each qualifying child.  It is not possible for me to put a cost on the provision of services to asylum seekers.  Such costs would be borne by a number of Departments &mdash; Education and Science, Environment and Local Government, Health and Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the legislative priorities of my Department in the civil law area are as announced on 25 September 1997 by the Chief Whip in the Government's programme of legislation for the current session.  None of those measures are confined solely to consolidation.  However, in the context, for example, of the promised Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill, the purpose of which is to give effect to a convention on the accession of new EU member states to the Brussels Judgments Convention, I am taking the opportunity to consolidate all the statutory law in this area.  In the course of preparing reforming legislation it is the intention of my Department to consolidate aspects of the law in such legislation where this is feasible and warranted.  While I have no proposals at present for legislation that is confined solely to consolidation of civil law the matter will be kept under review having regard to the need to dispose of urgent reforming measures.</P>

      <P>As stated in the Department's recently published discussion paper, Tackling Crime, the number of sexual offences reported to the Garda has increased more than six-fold over the period 1971 to 1995.  These figures would suggest a growing willingness on the part of victims to report crimes of this kind to the Garda.  The Department and the Garda authorities are determined to do all that can be done to further encourage the reporting of such crimes as it is only after the reporting of offences that offenders can be ultimately brought to justice.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided to establish a national steering committee on violence against women which will be chaired by me.  All relevant Departments, together with the Garda and voluntary groups, have a vital role to play on this committee.  The decision to establish the national steering committee is in accodance with one of the central recommendations of the recent report of the task force on violence against women.  I would expect this committee to address, among other things, the question of the level of the reporting of sexual offences to the Garda.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is probably aware that up to December 1995 the Probation and Welfare Service assisted the courts by providing reports in family law cases although there was no statutory requirement to do so.  The Family Law Act, 1995, and subsequently family law legislation has put a statutory obligation on the Probation and Welfare Service to provide reports to the courts.  Due to increasing work demands, especially in regard to criminal law work, the Probation and Welfare Service has not been able to deliver a family law service since the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the need to meet the court's requirements in this regard and my Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Finance in an effort to secure additional resources to enable the service carry out family law work.  These efforts are continuing in the context of the Estimates for next year and I would be hopeful that progress can be made fairly soon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44, 98 and 237 together.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Ring's question referring to the recommendations of the commission report on physical and sensory disabilities, there would appear to be some confusion here with regard to what are two separate reports.  The report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities contains 402 recommendations dealing with a wide range of issues affecting the lives of people with disabilities, their families and carers.  The report of the Review Group on Health and Personal Social Services for</P>
      <P>People with Disabilities entitled Towards an Independent Future was published by the Department of Health.  The review group was asked to examine the current provision of health services to people with physical or sensory disabilities and recommend how such services should be developed to meet more effectively their needs and those of their families.  Both reports are being considered by the interdepartmental task force and their recommendations will be dealt with in tandem as part of the work of that task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force was scheduled to submit its plan to Government at the end of June 1997 but, following the Supreme Court finding in relation to the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, the Government asked the task force for a recommendation on how the concept of reasonable accommodation can be managed in the context of addressing discrimination against people with disabilities in employment equality legislation.  The task force was invited to consider, in this regard, such matters as the need, if any, for a Constitutional amendment on this issue; the role of society in bearing costs of reasonable accommodation; the scope for a distinct statute dealing with disability to progress or supplement the employment equality provisions, and any other measure which may be appropriate.  In order to assist the task force in their consideration of this issue, an <Col N="1384" /> officer from the Office of the Attorney General has been appointed as a member.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the circumstances as outlined above, the task force was unable to submit a plan of action to Government by the June deadline. When I took office, I was anxious to address the issues raised by the commission's report in a constructive way and I have made arrangements to have an interim plan submitted to Government within the next month.</P>
    <P>I am committed to the preparation of a final plan of action and, in this regard, I have asked my Department to go to tender to have the recommendations made by the commission costed.  This exercise will identify costings accruing to the State, people with disabilities and their families and to third parties and will facilitate the preparation of a cohesive and cost effective strategic plan for the implementation of the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I intend to host a national information day in the week preceding 3 December.  The theme of the event will be progress through partnership and the intention will be to emphasise the commitment at a European and national level to involving people with disabilities and their representatives in the formation of policy and the planning and delivery of services.  The audience will include politicians at national and local level, a number of people with disabilities from whom submissions were received by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, representatives of the Irish Council of People with Disabilities, service providers, civil servants and representatives of the social partners and city and county managers and chief executive officers of health boards.</P>

      <P>Section 5 of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, makes the unauthorised accessing of computer data an offence, whether or not the person intended to access any particular data or data kept by any particular person.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the Garda report on illicit drug use and related criminal activity in the Dublin metropolitan area is an invaluable piece of research providing information about the link between crime and drugs in Dublin.  Information and research are essential to the formation and execution of effective crime policy.</P>
      <P>The research shows the strong links between drugs and crime and demonstrates that the fight against drug abuse must be relentless.  The report shows that the principle drug abused is heroin and 77 per cent of heroin abusers have some form of criminal record.  Forty-three per cent of indictable crimes are committed by hard drug abusers. The majority of drug abusers had tried drugs out of curiosity and had a poor understanding of the effects of drug use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report provides an overall picture of the various aspects of the drug problem &mdash; poor education, initiation into drug abuse, treatment problems and involvement in crime.  Effective action against drugs, including heroin, requires concerted action by all the relevant authorities.  This confirms the Government's view that interagency <Col N="1386" /> co-operation in the areas of research, treatment and law enforcement are essential.</P>
    <P>I consider that the document provides reliable information which will be of assistance to decision makers.  It is envisaged that the study will be repeated at future dates to determine the trends and examine the effectiveness of strategies adopted by various agencies.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured of my total commitment to dealing with the drug problem.</P>

The approach being taken comprises a range of practical measures and key legislative changes which will be directed mainly at the career criminal &mdash; in particular those who seek to profit from the deadly trade in illegal drugs whether as financiers, suppliers or pushers.  These are aimed at assisting the Garda Síochána with resources to strengthen its operational hand and to increase the State's statutory armoury to deal effectively with those engaged in major crime.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70, 233 and 234 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that the information sought by the Deputy with regard to the number of people charged with offences relating to graffiti is not readily available and could only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
      <P>The term, graffiti, is not used in any relevant legislation but such activity would come within the provisions of the Criminal Damage Act, 1991 and the Dublin Police Act, 1842.  Under the Criminal Damage Act, it is an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> for a person to damage, without lawful excuse, any property belonging to another.  A person guilty of such an offence is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, and on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.  The penalty to be applied in any case is a matter for the presiding judge.  The Minister has no reason to suppose the law, or the penalties available under it, are inadequate to deal effectively with this offence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue of overtime spending in the prison service, I am concerned at the rate at which this has increased over the years.  The long-term solution to this problem lies in introducing major changes in how the prison service operates.  Such changes are at the heart of the recommendations of the prison service operating cost review group's report.  However, in the meantime, I have met all prison govenors and have instructed them <Col N="1393" /> to take every possible step to limit the amount of overtime worked to that which is absolutely essential for the safe operation of the prison service.</P>

      <P>A wide range of controls designed to tackle the problem of under age drinking is included in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The primary purpose of those statutory controls is to make it as difficult as possible for persons under 18 years of age to lawfully purchase alcohol, or to be in possession of it or to consume it other than in a private residence.  I understand that the Garda Síochána are undertaking a campaign to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of the 1988 Act on under age drinking.</P>
      <P>I am determined that all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure the existing controls on under age drinking are even more effective.  I have therefore asked officials of my Department to urgently examine the question of the introduction of a national, voluntary, age card scheme under the regulation making provisions in section 40 of the 1988 Act.  This initiative on my part is not to be interpreted as taking away from the good work being done under local age card schemes or from the dedication of the people involved in them. However, there may be potential for making a greater impact on the under age drinking problem by introducing a uniform scheme of nationwide application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, I recognise that measures aimed at curbing the supply of alcohol to young <Col N="1397" /> people cannot, on their own, be expected to solve the under age drinking problem.  Measures are also required which deal with the demand for alcohol among under 18s.  The gardaí play a prominent role in participating in school programmes which deal with the abuse of alcohol by young persons.  The Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children are also very much involved in measures that address the demand side of the problem.</P>

      <P>Prior to the introduction of divorce in February 1997, a separate list of persons seeking legal aid services for divorce was maintained by the Legal Aid Board.  On 27 February 1997 that list was amalgamated with the then current waiting lists at each of the board's law centres and all applications for legal aid for divorce received subsequent to that date were placed on a single waiting list in each centre.  This led to an increase of 68 per cent, i.e., 1,018 persons, in the number of applicants waiting for an appointment with a Legal Aid Board solicitor. With the amalgamation of the waiting lists separate records of persons seeking divorce no longer exist neither does the Legal Aid Board maintain its records in such a manner as would facilitate the extrapolation of the information in the form required by the Deputy and it would take a disproportionate amount of work and staff time to <Col N="1399" /> make it available.  The information which I have set out in tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report on applications made to the Legal Aid Board for legal aid in relation to divorce may, however, be of assistance to the Deputy.  These give the waiting times for legal aid applications in each of the 30 full-time law centres of the Legal Aid Board as at 30 September 1997 together with the number of persons at those law centres awaiting Legal Aid Board services in relation to divorce.</P>
      <P>Waiting times are continually reviewed by the board and where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board and appropriate remedial action is taken.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel to different areas.</P>
      <P>They have informed me that the deployment of gardaí in particular areas of the country is dictated by the policing needs of the region at any given time and they state that the policing needs of every area of the country are subjected to a process of continual assessment in response to changing circumstances.  Hence the allocation of gardaí at the present time in the Border area is based on the current assessment of operational requirements and likewise, policing in the Dublin North area is continually assessed in the light of changing circumstances and needs.  In the interest of security and crime prevention in general, details of Garda operational matters must remain confidential.</P>

      <P>The determination of the sentence to be imposed on any person following <Col N="1401" /> conviction for an offence is a matter for the courts, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 contains a number of provisions intended to protect the public against various types of assaults.  The Act sets out a range of offences and penalties.  An offence of assault, which would cover most minor assaults, carries a penalty on summary conviction of a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for up to six months or both.  The more serious offences carry greater penalties.  An offence of assault causing harm, which replaces the old offence of assault causing actual bodily harm, carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.  Where the offence is one of assault causing serious harm, which replaces the old offences of wounding or causing or inflicting grievous bodily harm, the penalty for conviction on indictment is imprisonment for up to life.  Conviction for an offence which consists of threats to kill or cause serious harm carry a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this range of penalties is approriate for dealing with all offences of this kind, irrespective of the origin of the victim, and I am not satisfied that it is appropriate or necessary to single out tourist offences for different treatment.</P>

      <P>The Department has recently initiated an evaluation of community based <Col N="1402" /> initiatives such as community alert and neighbourhood watch.  This review is taking place in the context of the report of the Task Force on the Security of the Elderly which recommended that a comprehensive evaluation and assessment be carried out of all the various community based initiatives to ensure that all areas of the country are adequately covered and that the question of the provision of appropriate funding is examined so that these initiatives can be placed on a secure footing.</P>
      <P>It would be premature to consider funding a specific neighbourhood watch project until such time as the national evaluation has been carried out and a decision made about funding.  Work on the evaluation phase of the review recently commenced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of reducing motor insurance premiums for young <Col N="1403" /> drivers was examined in some detail in the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on &ldquo;An Economic Evaluation of Insurance Costs in Ireland&rdquo;, published in October 1996.  The report found that premium rates for younger drivers are high in all EU countries relative to the rates charged to more mature drivers.  This reflects the significantly higher risk they represent for insurance companies in providing insurance cover.  The consultants found that the average cost of an insurance claim for 17 to 24 year old drivers is over twice that for the 36 to 40 age group and that motorists in the 17 to 24 age group are responsible for over 3½ times the average claims costs of motorists in the 36 to 40 age group.  In addition, the National Roads Authority Annual Report for 1995 indicated that almost 38 per cent of the motorists involved in fatal and personal injury accidents in 1995 were young drivers and that 41 per cent of the road casualty victims in 1995 were between the ages of 18 and 34.</P>
      <P>The Deloitte &amp; Touche report also considered the question of spreading premium rates more evenly across the different risk categories of motorists and concluded that reducing the premiums for the young motorist at the expense of increasing premiums for the mature and safer motorist would reduce the incentive for safer driving.  Also, by increasing the pool of young high-risk motorists, it would result in an overall increase in the cost of claims leading to higher premium rates for all motorists.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that the solution to lowering premiums for young drivers is to improve their driving standards and accident-claims record.  The report recommended that a graduated licensing system for learner drivers, similar to such a scheme operating in Ontario, should be evaluated with a view to the possible introduction of a similar scheme here.  The Ontario model is currently being examined by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>Of more immediate benefit to young drivers in Ireland is the Insurance Incentive Scheme recently established by the Irish Insurance Federation and the Driving Instructors Register wherby insurance discounts will be granted to young drivers who have completed a required number of driving lessons.  The National Safety Council is also working to produce course material on road safety for primary schools and for transition year students in secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is clearly no soft option for reducing motor insurance premiums for young drivers in Ireland.  As a group, they represent a very high risk for insurers and many insurance companies are reluctant to quote for that risk.  As in any other branch of insurance risk, for example employer's liability, reductions in premiums can only be achieved by improved safety standards and, in the case of the young Irish motorist, the inculcation of safer driving standards and education in driving skills is the key to reducing their <Col N="1404" /> high accident rate which, in turn, should lead to lower premium quotations.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment, three task forces have been established as a direct response to announced closure of major companies.  These are as follows: Tralee Inter-Agency Group; Tullamore Inter-Agency Group; North Mayo Enterprise Initiative Group.</P>
      <P>These groups were established to assist the workers involved with training and retraining opportunities; provide assistance to any workers wishing to establish their own enterprises, and attract alternative industry for the location involved and, additionally, in the case of the North Mayo Enterprise Initiative, to explore the options available to secure the future of the Asahi plants at Killala as synthetic fibre manufacturing undertakings.</P>
      <P>All three groups have met on a regular basis since their formation and are progressing the issues outlined above.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by the Industrial Development Agencies and the groups involved to find suitable alternative employment for the redundant workers.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made in securing additional investment in some of these areas.  In early October, I announced that Carrokeel Seafoods Limited was to expand its operations in Killala with an additional 85 jobs.  Last week I announced a software and hardware testing facility for Ballina, which will provide 100 jobs.</P>
      <P>The recently announced expansion of the Lowe Alpine Systems International facility at Tullamore, County Offaly will create an additional 30 jobs.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, with regard to the introduction of legislation governing payment practices in the private sector, the Task Force on Small Business <Col N="1405" /> recommended that the position should be reviewed three years after the introduction of such legislation in the public sector.</P>
      <P>During the Second Stage debate on the then Prompt Payment of Accounts Bill in the Seanad, the Deputy indicated that the then Government was willing to give time to see whether the voluntary codes established in the private sector brought about improvements in payment practices in that sector.  He agreed, however, that the position regarding the private sector should be examined before the expiration of the three year period after the Act comes into effect.  I concur with that view and I intend to instigate an examination not later than two years after the Act has been in operation.  That examination will, <i>inter alia</i>, review the effectiveness of voluntary codes of payment practices in the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon management strategies, which I am currently progressing, do not include plans to terminate net salmon fishing.  Consequently, I have had no discussions on the matter with the EU Commission.  As I advised in my reply of 14 October overall policy is aimed at maximising on a sustainable basis the value of the wild salmon resource.  The basic premise underlying policy is that the balance of advantage, on conservation ecological and economic grounds should lie increasingly with redirecting salmon exploitation towards the rivers and estuaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, as I have previously advised this House, my immediate priority is to review the various salmon conservation measures introduced for the 1997 season.  My decisions in relation to conservation measures for 1998 and future years will be informed by a comprehensive analysis by our salmon scientists of the state of <Col N="1406" /> Irish salmon stocks as well as of the international data; the impact and effectiveness of the conservation measures taken this year, and an assessment of fishing effort, enforcement and compliance levels.</P>
    <P>The international prognosis on the worrying state of salmon stocks in the North Atlantic and the initial reports available to me on Irish catches and stocks this year underline the need to continue at minimum with the existing conservation measures.</P>
    <P>On salmon management strategies generally, I have already announced my intention to move to a catchment-based approach for inland fisheries management, involving and empowering all users and beneficiaries at local community level.  The catchment approach will address the specific and localised impacts of salmon management and conservation strategies, through ongoing review and consultation with all stakeholders in the salmon resource.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Marine Institute has recently submitted practical proposals for the introduction of a total allowable catch, a quota system and a tagging regime for salmon.  These proposals will be the subject of further consultation with all the relevant interests, both commercial and angling as well as the fisheries boards in the short-term.  The outcome of the consultative process will critically inform considerations of the legislative licensing, funding and technical issues inherent in a quota based management strategy for salmon.</P>

      <P>Funding of some £5.1 million is available for coastal protection works under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99.  The Deputy will appreciate that, with this level of resources, it is not possible to meet all the demands from maritime counties for protection schemes.  Every effort is made, nonetheless, to address particular priorities while ensuring a reasonable geographical distribution of the available funds.  The South East has benefitted considerably from the available funding.</P>
      <P>Last year, support was provided towards emergency works at Cunnigar and Tramore, County Waterford and studies of the erosion problem at these sites.  Following those studies, I have approved a scheme at Tramore which will cost £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable funds have also been made available in County Wexford over the past few years. Funding for a £100,000 rock revetment at Courtown has been provided and a major scheme, <Col N="1407" /> costing some £1.5 million, has been completed at Rosslare Strand.</P>
    <P>In the case of County Wicklow, a major beach nourishment scheme is planned at Bray and will cost in the region of £2.5 million.  Aid was also made available to Wicklow County Council during 1996 to undertake a beach and dune management scheme at Brittas Bay.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for sustained investment in coastal protection within a framework of an overall policy on coastal zone management, and I am addressing the issues involved.  The Deputy can be assured that the requirements of the South East will continue to be taken into account fully in that context.</P>

      <P>The European Council Directive 94/25/EC, which is due to come into effect in June 1998 is primarily intended to eliminate technical barriers to trade by approximating design and construction standards for recreational craft throughout the Community.  The Directive only addresses the construction aspect of recreational craft, and does not require compliance with safety standards to ensure the safe operation of such craft.  Furthermore jet skis and water bikes are excluded from the scope of the Directive.</P>
      <P>Proposals to amend the Directive, to include engine exhaust and sound emission requirements, are currently being discussed by the European Commission.  It is intended that these requirements, if adopted, will apply to the construction of water bikes and jet skis.</P>
      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boat) Regulations, 1992 were introduced to enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to propose to the Department of the Marine that areas, within, or in the seas adjoining, their jurisdiction be designated as unsuitable for the operation of these craft in the interests of the safety of pleasure craft and their occupants.</P>
      <P>The measures are available only for the protection of pleasure craft and their occupants and do not extend to the protection of swimmers, bathers or the natural environment as these matters would be beyond the scope of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources statutory powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no direct function with regard to swimmers, bathers and other users of the coastal resource, I am, nonetheless, very concerned <Col N="1408" /> about the threat to their safety, and the general nuisance, from craft such as jet skis and fast power boats.  As a result, my Department is currently carrying out a review of the 1992 Regulations in order to identify the most effective means of controlling power craft in the interests of other water users.  In addition to this review, I have very recently decided to establish a group to examine models whereby competing uses of marine leisure area, including by jet skis and fast power boats, can be accommodated.  I can assure you that I will be supportive of any recommendations made which will lead to the improvement of safety for all water users and the general enjoyment of our unique coastal environment.</P>

      <P>A number of the task force's recommendations on new salmon management strategies were implemented for the 1997 season, including the reduction of the sea fishing area from 12 to six nautical miles out from the coast; a cap on the maximum numbers of commercial fishing licences; the postponement of the open season for commercial netsmen by several weeks; and the introduction for the first time of day-only fishing and a 3-day weekend close period.  I am reviewing these measures to assess their effectiveness with a view to deciding whether additional conservation measures are required for 1998 in light of all the available scientific and other assessments.</P>
      <P>The Marine Institute has recently submitted practical proposals for the introduction of a total allowable catch, a quota system and a tagging regime for salmon wich was also recommended by the task force.  These proposals will now be the subject of further consultation with all the relevant interests, both commercial and angling, as well as the fisheries boards in the short-term.  The outcome of the consultative process will critically inform my considerations of the legislative, licensing, funding and technical issues inherent in a quota based management strategy for salmon.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 130 together.</P>
      <P>The Dublin-Sligo line is included in an EU co-financed investment programme in mainline and suburban rail over the period 1996-99.  This programme will cost £73.3 million and the European Commission has allocated £62.3 million in grant aid at a rate of 85 per cent from the EU Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>Of the £73.3 million package, £12.5 million was allocated to upgrading track on the Dublin-Sligo line.  The work involves the replacement of life expired jointed track on timber sleepers with continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers.  It is being undertaken on the Dublin-Mullingar section of the route.  Up to the beginning of September 1997 spending on this project amounted to approximately £3.5 million.</P>
      <P>A further £14 million was allocated to the replacement of an outdated mechanical signalling system on four routes, including Sligo, with a new, modern, cost-effective and centralised control system.  The work on the Sligo line will be undertaken on the Maynooth-Sligo section of the route.  The total package of investment is scheduled for completion by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>I have no function in relation to the details of railway investment other than the EU-funded programme.  The non co-financed programme, and its implementation, is a matter solely for CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Transatlantic air carriers wishing to serve Ireland must operate at least an equivalent number of flights to Shannon as to Dublin.  This is designed to ensure that Shannon receives at least 50 per cent of direct transatlantic services to and from Ireland.  This policy is enshrined in the Ireland-US Bilateral Air Services Agreement.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of this agreement, landings at Shannon and Dublin are counted over a 12 month period beginning in April in any year.  This period coincides with one full summer and winter season. Because of this, it would not be necessary for operations during a specific period within the year, such as between 1 June and 14 September 1997, to comply with the requirements of the agreement.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all airlines currently abide by these rules.</P>
      <P>My Department does not inquire of airlines as to the reason for specific cancellations which are an operational matter for the airline concerned.  I am not aware of any particular problem in this regard.</P>

      <P>The licensing scheme to which the <Col N="1414" /> Deputy refers was proposed by my predecessor shortly before the change of Government in June 1997.  However, no regulations were made to establish the scheme at that time.</P>
      <P>The legislative position is that while I have a policy role in relation to the allocation and use of radio frequency spectrum, the legal power to issue licences to television deflector operators pursuant to section 5 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926 was transferred, with effect from 30 June 1997, to the Director of Telecommunications Regulation appointed under the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, it is a legal function of the director to address the question of licensing such systems and I understand that all applications submitted under the proposed scheme are now with the director.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the director has initiated a study into this issue and intends making a decision in regard to licensing such systems following consideration of this study.</P>
      <P>Regulations required to give effect to any licensing scheme for television re-transmission systems which may be proposed by the director under the 1926 Act would statutorily be subject to my consent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133, 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>Section 47 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954 prescribes that &ldquo;An officer may for any prescribed reason be retired by the President&rdquo;.  Pursuant to the provisions of that section of the Defence Act, paragraph 18 of the Defence Force Regulations A.15 &mdash; Officers (Appointments, Promotions, etc.) &mdash; prescribes as follows:</P>
      <P>18.  (1) An officer may be retired pursuant to subsection 47 (2) of the Act for any of the following reasons:</P>
      <P>(a) on his being found, on medical classification or reclassification, to be in medical category E unless the Minister, in accordance with paragraph 74 of Defence Force Regulations A.12, otherwise directs;</P>
      <P>(b) if he is undergoing treatment in a sanatorium abroad, on the director, medical corps, being of opinion, from a report obtained from the medical superintendent of the sanatorium, that he is in medical category E;</P>
      <P>(c) if, on the expiration in his case of the total periods of sick leave and/or hospital treatment and/or sanatorium treatment authorised by Defence Force Regulations A.12, he is, in the opinion of the Director, Medical Corps, in medical category D or E;</P>
      <P>(d) on his being certified to be of unsound mind by an officer of the Medical Corps who is a registered medical practitioner or, where such an officer is not available, by a civilian registered medical practitioner;</P>
      <P>(e) for misconduct or inefficiency;</P>
      <P>(f) in the interests of the service.</P>
      <P>(2) An officer shall not be recommended for retirement for misconduct or inefficiency or in the interests of the service unless or until the reasons for the proposed retirement have been communicated to him and he has been given a reasonable opportunity of making such representation as he may think proper in relation to the proposed retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> In the period 1966 to 1997 a total of three persons were retired from the Permanent Defence Force by the President pursuant to section 47 (2) of the Defence Act, 1954.  Additionally, in the same period two persons were dismissed from the Force pursuant to section 50 of the Defence Act. Section 50 of the Defence Act states:</P>
    <P>50 (1) The president may dismiss any officer.</P>
    <P>(2) Except in the case of an officer who is sentenced by a civil court to suffer penal servitude or imprisonment for a term exceeding six months or who is absent without leave for a period exceeding three months, an officer shall not be dismissed under this section unless or until the reasons for the proposed dismissal have been communicated to him and such officer has been given a reasonable opportunity of making such representation as he may think proper in relation to the proposed dismissal.</P>
    <P>(3) An officer who is dismissed shall cease to be an officer.</P>

On foot of that inspection certain problems were identified and my Department wrote <Col N="1418" /> to both the applicant and his planner in April 1997 outlining these problems and requesting that a revised plan be submitted.  A revised plan was received but when it was examined it was found to be still deficient.  Letters seeking to have the deficiencies rectified issued to both the applicant and his planner in September 1997.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information available to my Department indicates that at an overall level the new plastic eartags are performing well.  A detailed survey carried out by my Department shows that the rate of tag loss is quite low and compares favourably with loss rates experienced with the brass eartags formerly used to identify cattle.  In addition, studies carried out in other countries indicate that the present plastic eartag is as reliable as any other tag from the point of view of quality, legibility and durability.  The small number of reported instances of high tag loss were generally attributable to either particular farm management practices or incorrect application of the eartags.</P>
      <P>At the present time replacement tags are supplied to farmers by Mullinahone Co-op within two to three days of an order being received.</P>
      <P>When the plastic eartags were introduced in 1996, it was considered appropriate that farmers should pay the cost of replacement tags.  Among other things, this was intended to encourage greater care in the use of eartags.  The charge for replacement tags is relatively modest.  I do not have any plans to change the current payment arrangements for replacement tags.</P>

As 897 gallons, the average milk production per cow, equalled one <Col N="1420" /> livestock unit, this represented 74.69 livestock units.  He applied for 1996 ewe premium on 90 ewes representing another 13.5 livestock units at a rate of 0.15 livestock units per ewe.  In all, therefore, his 1996 milk quota and 1996 ewe premium application absorbed 88.19 livestock units, i,e, 9.09 livestock units more than his stocking density limit.  This means he could not be paid any 1996 suckler cow or special beef premium claimed as he had already exceeded his 1996 stocking density limit.</P>

      <P>The ewe premium is designed to compensate producers for the difference between the EU basic price and the average EU market price for sheepmeat.  In view of this, it is inevitable that the rate of the ewe premium will be lower in a year, such as 1997, when market prices are relatively high.  The reduction in the premium payable this year reflects the high market price throughout the EU.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the EU sheepmeat regime recognises the position of the hill sheep farmer through the payment of a supplementary rural world premium of £5.51 on eligible ewes to producers in disadvantaged areas, where all hill sheep farmers are located.  In addition, these producers also receive a headage payment of £10 per head on the first 200 ewes-hoggets.</P>

      <P>I presume that the payment referred to by the Deputy is the national element of the agrimonetary compensation arising from revaluations of the Irish green pound on 8 November 1996, 11 January 1997 and 29 March 1997.  This compensation was announced by my predecessor as £50 per head payable on steers and bulls slaughtered <Col N="1426" /> and on heifers slaughtered or sold at marts in the period 1 April to 10 June, 1997.</P>
      <P>In accordance with EU regulations it is necessary to obtain the Commission's prior approval for all schemes for agrimonetary compensation whether the funding comes from the EU budget or the national Exchequer.  On assuming office, I learned that this approval had not been obtained by my predecessor prior to his announcement of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The compensation to be paid for cattle disposed of in the period 1 April to 10 June must relate, under EU regulations, to the price reduction arising from the revaluations of the Irish green pound alone, and not from any other factor.  The problem of obtaining Commission approval arises from the obvious difficulties in establishing, to the Commission's satisfaction, the amount of the overall price reduction in the relevant period which was due to the revaluations.</P>
      <P>As a result of consultations which I have had with Commissioner Fischler, I am hopeful that there will be a satisfactory outcome to this issue in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1988 accelerated capital allowances have been significantly curtailed as part of the reform of corporation tax aimed at broadening the base and reducing the main rate.  Much progress has been made in this regard with the standard rate now at 36 per cent compared with 50 per cent in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to building on this progress by providing further substantial reductions in corporation tax over the coming years with the aim ultimately of bringing in a single low rate for all trading activities.  This will be of major benefit to the tourist sector, allowing enterprises such as hotels to retain more profits for re-investment and to generate more employment. In order to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to keep a tight rein on reliefs in the years ahead, particularly accelerated capital <Col N="1429" /> allowances which can be very costly to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the existing capital allowances for hotels, at 15 per cent per annum &mdash; 10 per cent in year seven &mdash; compare favourably with allowances of just 4 per cent per annum for industrial buildings generally.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, parts of Westport and Salthill are included in the pilot tax relief scheme for certain resort areas which has very favourable capital allowances for hotels, with up to 75 per cent or 50 per cent allowances in year one and an annual allowance of 5 per cent thereafter.  This pilot scheme, which runs until 30 June 1998 is currently being reviewed by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department.</P>

The taxpayer began work with Enniscorthy Tidy Towns Association on 9 June 1997.  On 14 July details of the amount of taxable unemployment benefit which the taxpayer had received before starting work with Enniscorthy Tidy Towns Association were sent to his employer.  It would appear that when this was taken into account an underpayment of tax arose and the employer decided to collect the <Col N="1430" /> arrears on a week to week basis.  The inspector has been unable to contact the employer by telephone to get precise information on the matter. The taxpayer is therefore advised to contact his Inspector of Taxes as soon as possible to clarify the position regarding his tax liability.

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of the information supplied by Deputy O'Shea, it is not possible to establish the particular tax form to which he is referring.  There are a number of different income tax return forms to cater for different categories of taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The Form 12 is the tax return form normally appropriate to a person with a survivor's pension and an additional pension &mdash; on which it is assumed PAYE tax is deducted.  Where a person has a pension on which PAYE is deducted, tax is effectively collected from other pensions, such as a survivor's pension, by restriction of tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>Form 12 is the tax return issued to PAYE taxpayers generally and is considered to be the simplest of the tax returns.  Essentially, it looks for details of the taxpayer's income and includes a claim for any allowances or reliefs to which the taxpayer may be entitled.  Some of the other tax return types are designed for taxpayers with more extensive and varied incomes and allowance-relief entitlements.  These forms are more complex than the Form 12 and it is possible that the Deputy's query relates to one of these.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners continuously review the design and layout of all their forms to ensure that they are made as easy as possible for people to complete.  However, tax returns must make provision for a person to identify all sources and amounts of income and also to claim all allowances and reliefs to which the person is entitled.  In these circumstances, the extent to which they can be further simplified is limited.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific case in mind he might wish to contact the individual's tax district to ensure that the appropriate tax return form is being issued.  Staff in tax offices are available to assist taxpayers if they are having difficulties completing tax return forms.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle the majority of social welfare payments, including survivors' pensions, are therefore reckonable as income for tax purposes.  This means that the social welfare payment is combined with any other income a person might have for tax purposes.</P>
      <P>Treating such social welfare payments as income for tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.  The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the survivor has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stamp duty code must be viewed in the context of overall tax policy.  A key element in the tax reform strategy of successive Governments over recent years has been to maintain as broad a tax base as possible and to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  Stamp duty on property has an important role to play in this regard by shifting some of the burden of taxation from wage and salary income to property.  The stamp duty yield from the transfer of real property for 1996 was £194 million.  The yield from the 6 per cent rate on real property, both residential and commercial, accounts for about 70 per cent of this yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that if the bands were re-adjusted upwards or indexed, as apparently proposed by the Deputy, there would be a significant ongoing cost to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, indexation of the bands would add to the complexity of the stamp duty code and given that property includes housing, commercial and agricultural <Col N="1432" /> property, it is far from certain what the appropriate indexation factor would be.  Also it should be mentioned that property generally is taxed lightly here as compared to labour and, in fact, Ireland has been criticised both domestically and by international bodies for this imbalance in our tax system given our rates of unemployment.</P>
    <P>As regards the effect of a reduction in the stamp duty on the property market, it seems likely that a reduction would benefit sellers most and would become built into the level of house prices generally.  Apart from reducing Exchequer revenue, with no apparent benefit to the purchaser, such action could in fact further accelerate an already over-heated property market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>Negotiations for the next round of European funding are currently in the initial stages.  The Commission proposals in Agenda 2000 cover, among other things, the overall budgetary projections for the Community up to the year 2006 and the share of the funding which is proposed for structural actions.</P>
      <P>Although the Commission has suggested certain broad criteria governing future structural funding &mdash; such as eligibility, concentration and simplification of objectives &mdash; negotiations have not yet, nor will they for some time, reach the stage of decision on individual member states' share-out.</P>
      <P>As regards eligibility for Objective I status, the Commission has proposed that, for regions like Ireland which are currently eligible under Objective 1 but which will have passed the eligibility level of <i>per capita</i> GDP of less than 75 per cent of EU average, appropriate transitional arrangements should apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While acknowledging our growing prosperity the Government has put forward and will continue to argue strongly Ireland's case for continued <Col N="1433" /> access to the Objective 1 funding envelope in any transitional arrangements in order to meet the substantial backlogs in infrastructural and social development which continue to exist and are even, to a degree, accentuated by our recent economic growth.  The Government is particularly conscious of the needs of the less-developed parts of the country in this regard and of their commitment to these areas in An Action Plan for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>The Government, in pursuing the best possible share-out for the country as a whole, will be seeking to ensure that the optimal outcome is obtained for all regions within the country, and that the needs of the less developed regions are fully addressed.</P>

A copy of the final report will be placed in the local library for inspection by the general public and as has been the case heretofore with the interim report a copy will also be given to the south Galway IFA and the south Galway Flooded Victims Action Group, both of whom represent groups who suffered flood damages in the 1995 floods.  There is a commitment to present the final report at a public meeting in Gort when the evaluation procedure is completed.</P>
      <P>The question of financial commitments will not arise until detailed designs and cost benefit analyses have been completed on the specific proposals recommended in the report.  The financial implications will be a matter for consideration in the context of the annual estimates on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <P>There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance &mdash; and double rate bands &mdash; is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>vs.</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, I should explain in the Hyland case in 1989 the Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple. This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances. An interdepartmental working group has recently been set up under the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to examine the treatment of married, co-habiting and one-parent households under the tax and social welfare codes.  This group is due to report by March 1998.</P>

      <P>The priority of this Government is not only to tackle the drugs problem, as mainfested in the numbers of drug misusers in need of treatment and rehabilitation, but also to address the underlying causes of the problem.  In pursuance of this strategy, the Government has reconstituted the Cabinet Drugs Committee into a wider Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion and Drugs &mdash; including Local Development &mdash; to reflect the fact that drug abuse is a symptom of a wider problem of social and economic exclusion.  This committee will pull together the various strategies to combat social exclusion, and resultant problems such as drug abuse, into a co-ordinated, targeted response.</P>
      <P>In addition the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation has been assigned responsibility for the national drug strategy team and will report directly to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on Drugs.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide financial supports to certain pre-school services which cater for children who are regarded as being at-risk or disadvantaged.  This function is in keeping with the boards overall responsibilities in regard to the promotion of the welfare of children and provision of family support services under the Child Care Act, 1991.  This policy of supporting certain pre-school services will continue in the future.</P>
      <P>While section 56 of the Child Care Act empowers health boards to provide pre-school services in their functional areas, this must be read in conjunction with section 3 of the Act which limits the responsibilities of boards to promoting the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  It is not intended therefore, that boards will provide services for the generality of children or to facilitate working parents.  Policy in this wider area in order to promote equality for women and especially to promote equal opportunities in employment is currently being developed by an expert working group involving the relevant interests chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The working group was established under Partnership 2000 and its remit is to devise a national framework for the development of the child care sector.</P>

      <P>Counselling and advice for people with cancer is provided by a variety of agencies, both public and voluntary.  It is done by individual hospitals and at community level through such organisations as the Irish Cancer Society.  I am conscious that the number and type of counselling services offered by different organisations vary greatly.  The form of counselling may range from reassurance at the time of diagnosis, to basic information about managing an illness, through to working with patients and their families for some considerable period about all of the implications of their condition. I am also conscious that counselling is of equal relevance to people with other long-term illnesses.</P>
      <P>Given the complexity of the area I wish to develop a framework for assessing the need for and value of the many types of counselling currently available.  My Department will initiate a review of the role of counselling services for persons with cancer and other long-term conditions. It will then be possible to form a view on how best to support counselling services.</P>

      <P>Reflective side markings and rear markings on certain goods vehicles, goods trailers and tractors are required under Irish road traffic regulations as a positive aid to road safety.  In addition, all mechanically propelled vehicles, other than cycles and invalid carriages, are required to be fitted with side and rear lamps at all times.  Where appropriate they are also required to be fitted with rear and lateral projecting load lamps and marker lamps, designed to outline the vehicle and any trailer or trailers and any projecting loads.</P>
      <P>There is no EU requirement at present for side marking lamps to be fitted to vehicles.  The European Commission is expected within the next year to complete proposals for whole vehicle type approval for goods vehicles and trailers.  The question of EU wide requirements for reflective side markings and side marking lamps will be considered in that context.</P>

His application for old age non-contributory pension was also rejected as his means exceed the permitted limit.  In the circumstances, he is entitled to a refund of £727.49 being the pension element of PRSI contributions paid for 1988-89, 1989-90, 1990-91, 1992-93 and 1993-94.  This refund will issue to him shortly.</P>

      <P>I understand that Dublin Corporation engaged some 200 people from midJune to end-September 1997, some of whom would previously have been long-term unemployed. All of those engaged for this short-term full-time work were liable for Class A PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of paying full Class A PRSI contributions, some of those workers engaged by Dublin Corporation would have requalified for unemployment benefit when the scheme ended. In the case of persons who re-qualify for unemployment benefit, their earnings in the relevant tax year determine whether they receive a graduated rate or the full rate of unemployment benefit. Persons entitled to a reduced or graduated rate of unemployment benefit are entitled to claim unemployment assistance if it is more beneficial to them.  However, long-term unemployment assistance is not payable where the claimant is entitled to full rate unemployment benefit.  The Deputy will be aware that the social welfare secondary benefits of Christmas bonus, free fuel allowance and butter vouchers are not awarded to recipients of short-term benefits.</P>
      <P>I should mention that I am having the wider issues of the effects of secondary benefits on the incentive to take up employment and training opportunities examined at present.</P>

      <P>The free schemes such as the free electricity allowance, the free telephone rental allowance and free TV licence are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition, widows-widowers between the age of 60 and 65, whose late spouses had entitlement to the free schemes, retain that entitlement.  Widows and widowers may also be eligible for a fuel allowance subject to satisfying a means test.</P>
      <P>To extend the free schemes to all widows under the age of 66 would involve significant additional expenditure which could only be considered in the light of the resources available.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to enable people aged 66 years or over as well as certain incapacitated people to <Col N="1450" /> travel free on public transport and certain private buses and ferries.</P>
      <P>There are currently two private transport operators who already provide bus services for free travel passholders in the general area referred to. In May 1997, officials from my Department met the general manager of one of the local bus companies which sought to extend services to include locations not directly covered by the existing bus routes.  The proposal was subject to full funding of all the operational costs as the company did not consider it commercially viable to operate a service on these additional routes.  My Department was unable to agree to this request which would fundamentally alter the scope of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Since its inception in 1967, transport operators who participate in the free travel scheme are paid on a commercial basis for actual travel undertaken by passholders at the normal fare value less a volume discount in recognition of the extra business generated by the scheme.</P>
      <P>My Department is concerned to ensure that people entitled to free travel under these arrangements are facilitated within the context of the scheme.  To that end consideration will be given to the inclusion of new services and extensions to existing ones provided they come within the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Barrow navigation &mdash; river and lateral canals &mdash; is part of the canal system including the Barrow Line, the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal which were transferred to my Department from the Office of Public Works in March 1996.  The legislation governing <Col N="1451" /> these waterways is the Canals Act, 1986. Under this Act, by-laws were brought into force in 1998 (S. I. No. 247 of 1988) prohibiting, <i>inter alia</i>, any person to &ldquo;throw, shoot or otherwise propel any stone, shot, bullet or other missile from, into or over any boat, or the canal property&rdquo;. [by-law 38(r)].  Accordingly, the prohibition on shooting over canal property applies throughtout the canal system.</P>
      <P>The question of shooting along the Barrow navigation came to the fore last year when the National Association of Regional Game Councils made representations on behalf of local gun clubs in the Carlow-Kilkenny areas.  They indicated, <i>inter alia</i>, that the prohibition stated in by-law 38(r) prevented these clubs from exercising their &ldquo;traditional shooting rights&rdquo; along the Barrow. The matter was referred to my predecessor who instructed that the Waterways Service carry out an extensive consultation, seeking the views of a large number of interested groups on whether the prohibition on shooting along the Barrow should, or should not, be lifted.  This consultation indicated that a clear majority of the respondents wished to retain the shooting ban along the waterway.  Accordingly, having taken all views into consideration, I decided recently that the prohibition on shooting over canal property should be retained.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a sum of £5 million was earmarked from funds available for cultural tourism purposes under the EU Structural Funds assisted Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, with the necessary funds being channelled through the Vote of the <Col N="1452" /> Office of Public Works, in the years in which expenditure is incurred, towards the development of the Turlough Park facility, to house the folklife collection of the National Museum of Ireland, a project to which Mayo County Council has also made a significant commitment.  However, the detailed operational aspects of the Castlebar facility have yet to be finalised.  Any charge on current expenditure, as distinct from the capital expenditure referred to above, would arise only on completion of the overall project and accordingly would not be necessary to be provided for in 1997.  Details of requirements for this facility are being further examined by a firm of museum consultants as part of overall functional and exhibition briefs being prepared for the development of the National Museum at all of its locations, and the cost of this is provided for in the museum's current budget.</P>

    <P>I understand that the operational benefits of CCTV in other urban locations are under consideration by the advisory committee and that these will be scheduled as resources become available.  However, no application has been received from local community interests for a CCTV system for Ballyfermot.  Funding for CCTV is normally provided jointly by local community interests and the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>As part of my Department's ongoing courts building programme to provide modern office accommodation and court facilities such as family law court room, consultation rooms and other modern facilities and general improvements, priority is given to refurbishing courthouses where staff are located.  On this basis Bandon courthouse would now be due for refurbishment.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the staff in the District Court office in Bandon are working in very cramped conditions and my Department is anxious to provide them with better office facilities as soon as possible.  However, as there is no space available to provide for the necessary expansion at Bandon courthouse consideration is being given to transferring the District Court Office to Clonakilty where there is space available at the rear of the courthouse for an extension to be added to the building which would incorporate both modern office and court facilities.</P>
      <P>It is intended that when the work on Clonakilty courthouse is completed and the staff have been transferred, Bandon courthouse will be refurbished and the space vacated by the office staff will be used to provide modern facilities for court sittings at Bandon.  Court sittings at Bandon would not be affected by this proposal.  I intend to announce my decision in the matter in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda authorities are fully committed to measures to decrease the national availability of all types of controlled drugs, including cocaine.  I should point out that recent statistics on cocaine seizures would not support claims of increased availability of cocaine.  There has been no let up in anti-drugs activity yet only 3.5 kg, provisional figure, of cocaine were seized in the period January to July 1997 compared with 642 kgs of cocaine seized in 1996.</P>
      <P>The Garda national drugs unit, in conjunction with dedicated drugs units throughout the country, are working on a full time basis to eliminate the street supply of all controlled drugs &mdash; including cocaine.  The gardaí work closely with the Customs and Excise service.  Joint task forces comprising members of An Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise and Naval Services are set up as necessary to co-ordinate strategies for the seizure of drugs and the apprehension of the criminals involved.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda national drugs unit and officials from my Department and others are actively participating in international co-operation to control drug trafficking.  In particular we are participating in the Latin American drug conferences taking place within the EDU at The Hague which are specifically aimed at reducing the supply of cocaine into Europe.</P>
      <P>Two members of An Garda Síochána are in place as drugs liaison officers in Madrid and The Hague and it is expected that these appointments will greatly assist the gardaí in combating the supply of all drugs into Ireland.</P>
      <P>As we all know, dealing with the drugs problem requires more than supply control measures.  The Garda and my Department are involved with other Departments and agencies in attempting to deal with the demand for drugs.  An example of this multi-agency approach to broader drugs problem is the national drugs strategy team which comprises representatives from the relevant Government Departments, including my Department, the Eastern Health Board, An Garda Síochána and a representative from the community and voluntary sector.</P>
      <P>In addition the Garda authorities tackle the demand side through their drug awareness programme. This programme involves local gardaí giving talks and advice to various groups throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Among the initiatives outlined in the Programme for Government to combat the drugs problem is a commitment to create a drug court system involving court supervised treatment programmes as an alternative to criminal prosecution for less serious drug-related offences.  The establishment of a drug court system is a key priority in the overall strategy for dealing with drugs and drug related crime.</P>
      <P>Shortly after taking office, I requested the working group on a courts commission, which was established to review the operation of the courts, to examine this matter and report to me as soon as possible.  As soon as I receive their report it will be given immediate attention.  The question of the treatment programmes and other resources which may be required for the operation of a drug court system are also being assessed as part of the overall examination of the matter.</P>
      <P>I can inform the Deputy that I would not be in a position to discuss the resource implications of the proposal, if any, with the Minister for Finance until such time as I have received and considered a report on the matter.  Any proposals which I will be bringing forward in this area will be brought before the Government in the usual way.</P>

      <P>The Law Society of Ireland made the Solicitors (Adjudicator) Regulations, 1997 (S. I. No. 406 of 1997) on 26 September 1997 in exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 71, as amended by section 69 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 of the Solicitors Act, 1954.  Under these regulations, the Law Society established a scheme for the examination or investigation by an adjudicator of written complaints concerning the handling by the Law Society of complaints about solicitors.</P>
      <P>I understand that an adjudicator has been appointed on a part-time basis pursuant to the above regulations.  Under the regulations, the terms and conditions of the adjudicator's appointment, including remuneration, is a matter for agreement between the Law Society and the adjudicator.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the scheme established by these regulations is consistent with the objective of section 15 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 which made provision for the establishment of an adjudicator scheme.

      <P>I met the representative associations for the Garda Síochána last week concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of Garda pay.</P>
      <P>I informed the associations that there were issues to be addressed in relation to Garda pay and welcomed the offer of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to assist in identifying a workable mechanism to enable all the issues to be considered.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the outcome of these considerations will have to be set in the context of Government policy on public sector pay, I informed the associations that the Government will immediately consider the report of the review of Garda efficiency and effectiveness and will examine how the issues affecting the structure of Garda pay and allowances might be addressed in the context of delivering the changes recommended in the report.</P>
      <P>I urged the associations to make early contact with ICTU and offered to make the arrangements to ensure that the ICTU process commences quickly.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of public knowledge that one association has expressed opposition to the arrangements envisaged.  However, I do not believe it would be helpful, in terms of addressing the issues involved, if I were to provide further details of the discussions that took place, or if I were to speculate about future progress in this regard.</P>

      <P>The persons referred to in the question have declared their interest in a transfer to Ireland.  However a formal application <Col N="1462" /> from the United Kingdom authorities has yet to be received.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, all persons serving life sentences in the UK have a tariff on their sentence which is determined by the Home Secretary. The tariff is the period to be served by the prisoner in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence.  The prisoners concerned were sentenced in 1977 and it is my understanding that no tariffs have yet been set by the Home Secretary.  In such circumstances, it is the practice of the UK authorities not to transmit applications in respect of such prisoners until the tariffs have been set.</P>
      <P>It is Government policy that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families.  The Home Secretary has been made aware of our concerns, and I would hope that a decision will be made in the near future.  The Deputy can be assured that representations will continue to be made to the UK authorities in this regard.</P>

Some of the ideas in that paper have been incorporated into the tourism chapter of An Action Programme for the Millenium.</P>

    <P>The Government is just 100 days in office.  I assure the Deputy that I will be progressing work, as appropriate, during my tenure in office as Minister, on the tourism priorities identified in the Government's programme.  For example, I have already advanced work on the proposed development of the national conference centre and have had very useful and productive initial discussions and consultations with a range of key groups, organisations, individuals and State agencies associated with the sector. <Col N="1466" /></P>

The working group is comprised of representatives of parents and teachers as well as medical professionals and Department of Education and Science representatives.  The first meeting of the group was held on 9 October 1997. It is expected that the group will report by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>This group will address all aspects of the problems posed by the weight of school bags, including any possible implications for the health of pupils.  It will also formulate proposals to alleviate such problems.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, he is currently putting in place to resource his decision to make physical education an exam subject covering, specifically, the revision of the existing syllabi, in-service training for teachers and coaches, the establishment of a benchmark of school facilities needed to support the programme, the bringing of facilities in schools up to the required standard and the addressing of deficiencies in opportunities for female participation and participation by people with disabilities.</Quest>

      <P>Proposals to undertake a pilot project in physical education at junior certificate level are being actively considered by my Department. This pilot project will examine the issue of assessment in physical education and devise effective modes of in-career support for teachers in the implementation of a proposed new syllabus in physical education at junior certificate level which is being developed by the NCCA.  The new syllabus will attempt to ensure that there will be equal access to physical education for all pupils regardless of gender or ability.</P>
      <P>The proposed pilot project will inform the work of the NCCA course committee in finalising its proposals on physical education in second level education.</P>
      <P>The National Coaching and Training Centre at the University of Limerick provides a programme for the training of coaches.</P>
      <P>Physical education facilities encompass indoor PE halls, outdoor hard play areas, such as basketball and tennis courts and playing fields.  Virtually all schools have at least one of these facilities.  It is the policy of my Department to provide PE halls as part of the schedule of accommodation for all new post-primary schools.  PE halls are also provided when a major extension to a school which does not have such a facility is being built. In addition, my Department has a programme for providing PE halls as stand-alone projects and it is anticipated that a number of these will proceed to construction before the end of 1997.</P>
      <P>In all cases, the appropriate range of physical education equipment is provided as part of the project.</P>
      <P>Schools which require repairs or refurbishment to be carried out to existing PE facilities are eligible to apply for grant-aid under my Department's scheme of capital grants and are allocated funding as resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> Two committees have been established under the aegis of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  These are researching, <i>inter alia,</i> the lower levels of participation by women in sport, including physical education activity in schools, and improved access to sport and physical education activities by people with disabilities.  Final reports are expected during 1998.</P>

      <P>Following a briefing in which the needs of the programme and the limitations of what could be approved were set out, applications were invited from all vocational education committees to tender for participation in the international teleservices initiative.  The overall number of centres which could be approved under the programme was limited by the capital budget for the initiative, with the required investment per centre being very large.</P>
      <P>The applications received exceeded the number of centres which could be supported.  Specific criteria used for the selection process included the stated language proficiency levels of staff, geographical spread and population density, proximity to other potential providers, previous track record in PLC provision, scale of PLC provision etc.</P>
      <P>In ensuring that the spread of provision within the limitations of resources was maximised, my Department was unable to approve the course in a number of locations.  This was a feature of the limitation on the overall number of centres which could be approved, and did not in any way reflect on the quality of the proposals or provision in the centres concerned.</P>

      <P>I announced on 18 July that my objective is to develop a framework for the structured development of institutions in the technological sector to address changing local and national demands, while ensuring the maintenance of the complementary third-level systems of university and technological education.  I further stated that the diversity of institutions and the separate missions of the two broad sectors will be maintained so as to ensure maximum flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of students and to the wide variety of social and economic requirements.</P>
      <P>A consultation process is now under way and I hope, following the conclusion of this process, to publish legislation as early as possible next year which will provide for the co-ordinated development of the technological sector and enhance its contribution to national and regional development. I am giving this matter priority but, pending the conclusion of the consultative process, I cannot be more precise about the timing of the publication of the legislation.  It is the intention that the development of this legislation for the technological sector will form part of broad legislation for the development of a national qualifications framework.</P>

      <P>The difficulty Regional Technical College, Tallaght has experienced this year in staffing the evening courses in computing is due to staff recruitment problems combined with some non-availability of existing staff for evening courses. The problem has been exacerbated by a recent union ban on overtime by college lecturers. Additional staff posts have been sanctioned by my Department in order to alleviate the problem.</P>
      <P>College management had advised my Department that in an effort to alleviate the problems for students places have been provided on full-time day courses for whose who can avail of this arrangement.  Arrangements have been made for other students to take some modules of their course so that they may continue with their studies during 1997-98.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 289, 302, 305 and 306 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1997, the outgoing Minister for Education agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools for the 1997-98 school year with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>These agreed arrangements were based on the allocation of surplus posts available for redistribution from the demographic dividend for the 1997-98 school year and included the allocation of 51 remedial teacher posts to primary schools with effect from September 1997.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need for remedial tuition.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am not in a position at present to allocate additional remedial teacher posts to primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am currently reviewing provision across the special needs area, including responses to remedial needs, to ensure that all available resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of the schools to which they refer will be fully considered in the context of any additional allocation of special supports which may be undertaken.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 290 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>A resource teacher post was sanctioned in May 1997 for a cluster of six national schools in County Roscommon with effect from September 1997.  Frenchpark NS was originally selected as the base school for this post because of its location within the cluster.</P>
      <P>However, I understand that in finalising the caseload for the resource teacher, it emerged that a number of the children involved had changed schools.  As a result, some of the schools originally proposed for inclusion in the cluster no longer had special needs children requiring the resource teacher service.  At the same time, it was necessary to include some other schools not originally involved.</P>
      <P>Given the revised locations of the schools being served, it was necessary to change the base school arrangements.  Fairymount NS has now been designated as the base school.  Frenchpark NS will continue to be served as part of the cluster.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the board of management of Fairymount NS is now in a position to proceed with the appointment of the resource teacher.</P>

      <Quest>the obstacles, if any, there are which would prevent him from raising the capital grant to voluntary secondary schools to 95 per cent; the annual additional cost to the Exchequer in this regard; the proposals, if any, he has to introduce such a change in the allocation of capital grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The factors concerning the level of capital grants paid in respect of building work undertaken at voluntary secondary schools relate mainly to financial considerations.  In addition, the requirement for a local contribution reflects the private nature of these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The cost to the Exchequer of increasing the level of grant-aid would depend on the number and value of building projects proceeding to construction in any given year.  In 1996, the value of the local contribution in respect of the voluntary secondary school sector was in the region of £1 million.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals under consideration at present to change the level of grant-aid.</P>

      <P>Since its introduction under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1992, the scheme of additional capitation grants to schools in respect of clerical and caretaking services has been expanded in line with undertakings given in PESP.  The scheme has been extended to include more schools by reducing the qualifying enrolment figure, with an ultimate target of providing additional capitation grants to all primary schools with 100 pupils or more and to all secondary schools with 200 pupils or more.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that this scheme provides a grant to schools which is not directly related to any specific pay scale.

      <P>The eligible part-time scheme for teachers grants <i>pro rata</i> pay and conditions of service with their permanent colleagues to part-time teachers who teach at least half the hours of their full-time colleagues and are timetabled for a full year.</P>
      <P>The revised proposals on the pay and conditions of teachers in primary and second level schools under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work include proposals which improve the treatment of part-timers with regard to pensionability.  The proposals include (a) the admission to pensionability of certain part-time teachers; (b) the reckoning for superannuation purposes of actual part-time teaching service which is followed by whole-time pensionable teaching service; (c) the admission of eligible part-time teachers who teach the equivalent of a whole-time teacher to the superannuation scheme applicable to wholetime teachers.</P>
      <P>While teachers in both first and second level schools holding certain posts of responsibility forfeit the allowances attaching to their posts while job-sharing, this matter is the subject of on-going discussions with the interested parties.</P>
      <P>Discussions on the pay and conditions of academic staff in the Dublin Institute of Technology, Waterford Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work are ongoing.</P>
      <P>The type of part-time staff employed in the university sector can vary from college to college. Some are paid on an hourly basis while others are paid a fixed amount.  The main limitations facing part-time staff are in relation to pension benefits and incremental credit.</P>

      <P>A key consideration in relation to the issuing of examination results is to ensure that they are received by all candidates on the same day.  This is important in minimizing the stress and anxiety of students.  An Post can guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 second level schools, whose addresses are long established and well known.

      <P>The arrangements for the payment of grants under the higher education grants scheme are a matter for the local authorities, who are statutorily entrusted with the administration of the scheme under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.  My Department does not have details on the current position in relation to the issue of payments by each of the individual local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am engaged in an ongoing review of all aspects of higher education grants and in this regard, the administration of the scheme is an area of particular concern.  The Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support, whose report was published in February, 1995, found the present system of student support to be fragmented, cumbersome and very confusing for grant applicants.  It identified overlaps and duplication with up to 70 different organisations involved in the administration of the grant schemes.  It also found that payments were too frequently delayed and that students were often disadvantaged by various administrative problems in the system.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the current administration of the student support schemes must be improved. Apart from reservations about the need for a new body I have an open mind as to what the best and most appropriate options are for a new centralised system.  A joint working group involving officials from my Department and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs has begun an examination of various options and the possible role of that Department in any new system.  I expect to have a report and recommendations in the matter towards the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from Wexford County Council, the body statutorily entrusted with the administration of the higher education grants scheme <Col N="1486" /> in this case, that the maintenance grants to the students in question will be paid this week.</P>

      <P>My Department's planning section is currently examining the possibility of the amalgamation of the school referred to by the Deputy with a neighbouring school.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position at this stage, to authorise a major works programme at the school.  However, it is open to the school to use its devolved grant to undertake minor improvement works.</P>

      <P>There is no provision under the school transport scheme whereby grant assistance can be given towards the cost of purchasing vehicles.</P>
      <P>I am pleased, however, to inform the Deputy that my Department may sanction remote area transport grants towards the cost of private transport arrangements in situations where groups of eligible children have no access to a transport service. To qualify for such grants, pupils must reside at least three miles from their nearest national school, and from any transport service to that school.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that if the group in question makes an application to my Department for a remote area transport grant it will be considered without delay.</P>

      <P>The enrolment of the school to which the Deputy refers on 30 September 1996 was 56 pupils.  This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and one assistant teacher for the 1997-98 school year.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that the staffing allocation for this school will be closely examined when the 1998-99 staffing allocations for primary schools are being determined.</P>
