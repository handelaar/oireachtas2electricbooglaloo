      <P>Is the proposal for the late sitting to 12 midnight tonight satisfactory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make points on all the issues because it is a very long Order of Business.  Last week the Government Whip requested of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that all this business would be taken this week on the basis, we assumed, as did everybody else, that we were wrapping up business, and we will not change that position even though there was no formal agreement.  I was upset over the weekend to hear the Taoiseach and others say that we have no interest in the business.  I am in favour of an orderly wind up of the 27th Dáil.  I have never been in favour of rushing Bills through without adequate examination because we usually find that works against everybody in the House.  On the basis that this order assists the Government in winding up business, I am happy to comply with that.  However, if the Taoiseach's plan is to continue for a number of weeks and get other business through, I would not agree with that.  I ask him to at least respect the Opposition in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these Bills are important and I do not disagree with them, but it would not be a good idea to rush through legislation for the next few weeks.  I do not say that in a contentious way, but it is proper that we deal with it.  On the first question put by the Ceann Comhairle, people other than Members of this House are implicated in that decision.  The staff of the House, who were here one morning last week until 3 a.m., will be here tomorrow morning and the following morning until 1 a.m.  It is not fair to continue to do this.  While I agree to the late sitting, I ask the Taoiseach not to abuse the goodwill of the Opposition in this way.  He will have our full co-operation when dealing with important legislation, but I do not want people saying outside the House <Col N="603" /> that Fianna Fáil did not provide speakers for certain legislation when the Whips agreed the basis for taking the legislation.  We can complete this Dáil in an orderly fashion, otherwise there could be seven or eight votes today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's concern, but the Government has a substantial legislative programme.  Many items of legislation are at an advanced stage and completing the legislation ordered for this week will make legislative time available next week to take legislation which otherwise might not be considered so soon. I am confident the arrangements for dealing with the legislation on today's Order Paper will allow a reasonable opportunity for debate and response to substantive issues raised.</P>

      <P>While we support this important legislation, it is not appropriate to take all Stages in two and a half hours.  We invariably make mistakes when we rush legislation through the House.  A two and a half hour debate is not adequate for Second, Committee and Report Stages of this legislation.  It must be teased out line by line.  As the Dáil will not sit next Tuesday, it should not be necessary to deal with all Stages in such a short time today.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to introduce a telecommunications Bill to provide for general reform of telecommunications legislation for the liberalised market we will face when derogations expire.  We expect that legislative change to be dealt with here in the second half of this year. The Government favours employee shareholdings in all companies, including Telecom Éireann. We have made provision in many Finance Bills to facilitate employee shareholding in companies. I am sure the Deputy will recollect that I was the first to promote the idea of employee shareholding in business in the 1980s.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

I am pleased to have been responsible for changing the Constitution to allow for the remarriage of divorced persons and I would also like, as Taoiseach, to put through legislation dealing with a referendum on excessive Cabinet confidentiality.I am sure the arrangements will be considered prudent and moderate when the legislation is introduced.

      <P>Work is continuing on a consultative basis with all the interests concerned.  I hope the heads of a Bill will be available for public discussion and to the Opposition within the next 48 hours or so.  We will then proceed to prepare and enact the legislation as quickly as possible.The consultative process has been worthwhile and has led to a considerable measure of consensus.  I hope the heads of the Bill will demonstrate that.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I raised the matter of regulations for holding public concerts following the death of a constituent of mine in The Point.  At that time the Taoiseach said a committee had been set up and a report would be published.What is the position on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter must be dealt with by regulation.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, has been working on this for some time.  As this relates to regulations rather than legislation, I do not have a brief on the matter.  However, I will submit the information to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motions:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approved the terms of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (The OSPAR Convention).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the United Nations Economic Commission for <Col N="606" /> Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.</P>
    <P>These conventions have in common a concern for Europe's water environment and a recognition that this can only be adequately protected through co-operative action between countries. The UNECE Convention has the wider target area: It potentially addresses inland water quality across the entire European continent from the Atlantic to the Urals.</P>
    <P>The so-called OSPAR Convention aims at the protection of the North-East Atlantic, including all Irish coastal and marine waters.  It is complemented in the wider European area by the Baltic Convention and the Barcelona Convention which also address the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, respectively.</P>
    <P>Dáil approval to the terms of both new conventions is required in view of cost implications for the Exchequer and requirements in this regard set out in Article 29 of the Constitution.  Direct costs by way of State contributions towards the operation, administrative and secretarial expenses of both conventions will be small, while limited expenditure will also arise in respect of specific projects such as research studies.</P>
    <P>Marine pollution in the area of the North-East Atlantic, including all Irish coastal and marine waters, has been covered since the early 1970s by the Paris and Oslo Conventions.  They dealt respectively with pollution from land-based sources and dumping from ships and aircraft, and attracted the support of 14 contracting parties, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The contracting parties some years ago initiated a review of both the Oslo and Paris Conventions.The process resulted in the preparation of a new consolidated Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic or, as it is usually referred to, the OSPAR Convention.  The new convention provides a stricter and more comprehensive environmental protection regime.  Its entry into force is expected later this year as soon as all parties to the present conventions have deposited their instruments of ratification or accession.</P>
    <P>Under the new OSPAR Convention contracting parties are required to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution of the North-East Atlantic.  They must individually and jointly adopt programmes and measures in pursuit of these objectives, harmonise their policies and strategies, apply the precautionary principle and impose controls corresponding to the best available techniques and best environmental practice.  The main potential sources of marine pollution are identified by OSPAR as involving land-based sources, dumping or incineration at sea and pollution from offshore activities associated with the exploration, appraisal or exploitation of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.</P>
    <P>Further important elements of the convention relate to: the preparation and publication of periodic <Col N="607" /> assessments of the quality of the marine environment &mdash; a major undertaking in this regard in respect of the entire OSPAR area is now under way.  My Department and the Department of the Marine, acting through the Marine Institute, have engaged a team of experts to prepare the assessment for the Celtic Seas sector which incorporates the Irish Sea and marine waters off our south and west coasts; the establishment of complementary or joint programmes of research; and access to information on the state of the marine environment.</P>
    <P>The incineration of waste at sea which was previously allowed, subject to permit, under the Oslo Convention is now prohibited.  The presumption in favour of the dumping of waste at sea, subject to permits and appropriate conditions, which was a feature of the old convention will no longer obtain.  Instead, the new convention will start from the premise that dumping at sea is prohibited except for a limited number of exceptions concerning mainly dredged materials from locations such as navigation channels and ports, inert materials of natural origin entailing little threat to the marine environment and sewage sludge until the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>A major shortcoming of the Oslo Convention was the complete absence of provisions for dumping radioactive substances, including wastes at sea.  In those circumstances, it was open to countries to have recourse to dumping at sea as a disposal route for low and intermediate level radioactive materials; the practice of allowing the dumping of high level radioactive material was terminated some years ago under the London Convention which has global application.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations on the OSPAR Convention, Ireland pressed strongly for a permanent prohibition on marine dumping of radioactive substances and wastes.  There was considerable support for this position with the result that the convention, as concluded, confirmed in respect of the North-East Atlantic the prohibition on the dumping of high level radioactive materials and for the first time introduced a ban on dumping radioactive materials coming within the low and intermediate level categories.</P>
    <P>The new convention's provisions on the prevention of pollution and the use of best available techniques and practices as part of the programmes to be adopted in pursuit of this are being assessed as part of the ongoing review of the options available to the Irish Government to mount a challenge against the operation of Sellafield.As the Members of the House will be aware, the Government has conducted a comprehensive and effective strategy to minimise the risks posed by nuclear operations in the United Kingdom.  Our opposition to the NIREX proposal for a rock characterisation facility was instrumental in the recent rejection by the British <Col N="608" /> Secretary of State of that proposal.  The governments of countries which have reprocessing agreements with Sellafield have been fully apprised of our position and our concerns about risks associated with the transport of radioactive materials by sea.  We have actively addressed, through the International Maritime Organisation, the issues of safeguards, controls and procedures applying to all such shipments.  The Government has ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention and is supporting a new Global Convention on Radioactive Waste Management which is expected to be finalised this year.  These efforts represent a practical response and will help bring about real improvements as regards the risks associated with nuclear operations for the long-term benefit of the Irish public and our environment.</P>
    <P>Our coastal and marine waters are generally of a high quality and support a sea fisheries sector and an expanding aquaculture sector.  However, pressures are evident in some areas with localised polluted conditions being experienced mainly due to sewage and industrial discharges.  These problems will be addressed through a combination of strict environmental regulation and continued investment in coastal sewage treatment facilities.</P>
    <P>The House is also being asked to approve the terms of the UNECE Convention on Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes. In Ireland's case, the focus of attention will be on those rivers, lakes and groundwaters which mark, cross or are located on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The main waters concerned are the Erne and Foyle systems and, to a more limited extent, the Lough Neagh catchment, a section of which is transboundary.  It is the Government's intention when acceding to the UNECE Watercourses Convention to inform the UK authorities and the Convention Secretariat that boundaries in transboundary watercourses agreed or used in the course of co-operation under the convention in relation to the Erne, Foyle and other relevant water, are agreed or used in the context of such co-operation and have no other effect.</P>
    <P>Parties to the convention are obliged to take all appropriate measures to prevent, control and reduce transboundary impacts on relevant waters. In practice, this will require co-operation in developing harmonised policies covering common catchment areas.  The convention also contains provisions concerning water quality monitoring programmes, research and exchange of information.  Also highlighted is the importance of ensuring the availability of public information on the condition of transboundary waters, measures taken or planned to protect them and their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The authorities here and in Northern Ireland are committed to protecting shared resources represented by waters such as the Erne and Foyle systems.  They will work together to improve our <Col N="609" /> understanding of these systems and of the activities that affect them; and to devise management policies which can cater for all legitimate uses of these waters in a sustainable manner.  The Shannon-Erne waterway is a flagship example of the economic benefits of a sustainable managed transboundary watercourse.  Last week I was pleased to announce the publication of water quality management strategy reports for the Erne and Foyle, including Lough Foyle.  These were prepared by consultants and funded by the Departments of the Environment, here and in Northern Ireland, with assistance from the European Union under the INTERREG initiative.</P>
    <P>These reports represent the most comprehensive joint work to date on water quality in both catchments.  They present management strategies for consideration and are available for inspection by the public at the offices of all the relevant county councils.  A period of formal public consultation on the reports is being arranged and, in the light of comments received, the appropriate authorities, North and South, will finalise their management policies on both catchments.</P>
    <P>All of this work will provide a strong framework within which to pursue the objectives of the Transboundary Watercourses Convention.  I commend both conventions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party is happy to support both motions, which are designed to ratify the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, and the UN Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes.</P>
      <P>I have a vivid memory of the negotiations on one of those conventions in 1992, when we argued late into the night about the dumping of radioactive nuclear waste.  We ended up with the best possible result, even though we would have liked to have been able to go further at the time. However, the discussions that took place over several years, culminating in the signing of that convention, were extremely necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody once said humanity is in a race between education and catastrophe, in the sense that it sometimes takes us a long time to learn enough about the natural environment and what can happen over the years for it to deteriorate, thus affecting life at sea and on land.  There are growing concerns around the world that dumping of hazardous materials at sea still goes on.  As we move towards ratification and completion of these conventions, which are good in themselves, it is important to draw together communities around the world.  They should be drawn into these conventions with all the responsibilities entailed in that.  There are no real boundaries to environmental degradation and therefore the <Col N="610" /> cohesion, commitment and involvement of the world communities in combating the problem is extremely necessary.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the strict enforcement of these conventions, we should compare our ability to patrol and police the marine environment with that of some of our European partners.  I do not have to lecture the Minister on the fact that our economic maritime zone covers an area of 132,000 square miles.  Given the best will in the world to patrol that, we have only ten ships with which to do so.  In fact, one could say we have only seven vessels, taking into account the loss of service during periods of maintenance and repair. By comparison, France has 70,000 square miles and 285 ships; Belgium has 1,200 square miles and 32 ships; and Denmark has 145,000 square miles and 125 ships.  No one can say that situation will change overnight, even if there was to be a new Government in the morning.</P>
    <P>I have no argument with the Minister over the necessity to ratify these conventions quickly and I am sure he is as impatient as I am that it has taken so long to reach this stage.  Of course, we need to have all the contracting parties in agreement.In his reply, perhaps the Minister could indicate who else is dragging their feet on this.</P>
    <P>We need to discuss seriously whether we can provide the capacity to deal with the kind of problems that emerge.  There is no argument about the fact that the world community has been traditionally happy to dump at sea.  It was seen as the place into which town sewage systems could be drained and the same could be said about our rivers and lakes.  The waste would go away and we would not see it.  As the problem got worse local communities became involved, there was a stronger political response and more funds than ever are now being provided for updated treatment systems in coastal regions.</P>
    <P>As we moved further out to sea, hazardous waste and oil rigs were out of sight and out of mind.  In 1977 we had the <i>Christos Bitos</i> incident, in 1987 the<i>Kowloon Bridge</i>, in 1989 the <i>Yarrawonga,</i> and last year we had the <i>Sea Empress</i>oil spillage.  At times it seems as if we are waiting for another maritime disaster to happen.  Luckily, in a number of these instances we were not dealing with the kind or extent of pollution that has occurred elsewhere.  However, it will be essential to provide the capacity to police such incidents if we are in earnest about these conventions.</P>
    <P>Many of our EU partners have the capacity to deal with these problems.  Even though it is not relevant to this debate, we are seen very much as an open target for the exploitation and importation of dangerous drugs.  We do not have ocean-going tugs or a serious deep sea diving capacity, and we have only a limited underwater research capacity.  These are critical areas that future Governments must be concerned about in the context of how we implement and see to fruition <Col N="611" /> the conventions that are now in the process of being ratified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the UN Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, on this island we would naturally welcome the maximum possible co-operation between all the authorities, North and South, in not only protecting these watercourses but also working towards their positive exploitation in terms of bringing communities closer together.</P>
    <P>The development on the Ballyconnell canal, which began in the late 1980s, was one instance where that type of co-operation can be beneficial, particularly to areas that up until then did not have the same opportunity to exploit their full tourist potential.  While that is not directly relevant to today's debate, it provides an opportunity for the two communities to work together to protect their natural watercourses.</P>
    <P>There is evidence to suggest that groundwater is becoming contaminated at an accelerated rate in different parts of the world.  While we take water and sufficiency of supplies for granted, that is not the case in other parts of the world.  We have a responsibility to ensure that our inland waterways and seas are protected.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is happy to support these motions. We were in power when these conventions, which are an extensive and radical improvement on the Oslo and Paris Conventions, were negotiated.  We would like further improvements, particularly in relation to the dumping of radioactive nuclear waste at Sellafield.  The public is concerned about the health problems caused by dumping such dangerous substances in the seas close to our country.  The Government and Opposition must work together to close systems which, although essential in their time, are now a danger to people's health and lives.</P>

      <P>I also support the motion on behalf of the Progressive Democrats.  This is another small step in promoting environmental protection and preventing environmental pollution and degradation.  It is a pledge to co-operate with other contracting parties to achieve the objectives of these two important conventions.  I am particularly pleased to give the support of my party to the spirit and substance of these conventions.</P>
      <P>Air or water pollution does not respect national or county boundaries.  As a small island nation, it is important that we are part of a wider movement which deals with pollution on a transboundary basis and that we play our part as a contracting party to these conventions to achieve their objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Society has been incredibly careless and thoughtless about the way it has used coastal waters, rivers and lakes.  People believed for too long that if waste was flushed out to sea it would disappear <Col N="612" /> without trace.  However, we know better now.  It is important to put proper measures in place to reverse that trend.  There is a price to be paid and nature has a habit of sending home the bill.  If we continue to pollute our rivers, lakes, seas and groundwater, we will pay a huge price. It is time we faced up to this and co-operated with other states to defeat the bad practices of the past and to put better provisions in place for the future.</P>
    <P>The seas around our coasts are a vital national resource and are important for the continued success of good public health.  The quality of fish in our seas depends on the quality of the waters in which they feed and breed.  It is important for public health, the success of our tourism industry and the thousands of people who swim, wind surf and bath in our seas that the water is of good quality.  It is important to keep our beaches, coasts and outer seas as clean as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>Much marine pollution originates outside the State.  It can be difficult, for example, to control ships which flush their tanks close to our coasts and leave traces of waste along our shorelines. This can have a severe impact on our bird life. This problem can only be controlled if there is a determined European approach to tackle it through conventions.</P>
    <P>We must set clear targets for reducing the quantity of untreated sewage in our seas.  That is within our remit and it must be accelerated in the years ahead.  It is an important element in dealing with the protection of our waters and the prevention of pollution.</P>
    <P>The improvement and protection of water quality in the Irish Sea must be a major priority in any Government's environmental policy.  This will require determined action to reduce and neutralise the threat posed by the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing complex.  My party's approach to Sellafield is in keeping with that taken in these two conventions.  Although some improvements have been made, it is difficult to fight Sellafield on our own.  I have a key argument, which I put to this Minister on a number of occasions as an objective for the Irish Presidency of the EU, and it is that we must put in place an independent EU body to monitor, police and eventually oversee the decommissioning of Sellafield.  That is terribly important.  When one considers the level of policing which the European Commission can undertake in respect of a number of Directives with regard to the size of nets, for example, and the detail into which it can go to regulate such matters, it is ironic that the Commission has not put in place an independent transboundary body with proper legal standing to police Sellafield.  That must be done because if we are to deal with Sellafield successfully, we must seek to involve international agencies and organisations to a greater extent in monitoring and controlling what goes <Col N="613" /> on there.  In particular, we must seek to have the issue of nuclear safety dealt with at EU level.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission should press for a strong regulatory role for the EU in the nuclear industry.A European body with the necessary expertise and resources and legal powers of inspection and enforcement would provide the best protection possible to this country from the threat of nuclear accident.  The transboundary co-operative approach is the best approach to this and other environmental issues and for that reason I give my full support to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion to ratify the OSPAR Convention which provides a sound framework for protection of the marine environment.</P>
      <P>No state, and particularly no coastal state, in the world can ignore its duties of stewardship of the world's oceans and seas.  It is incumbent on Ireland, and all other states bordering on the world's extensive and complex marine resource, to ensure that it is passed on to the next generations in a sound and healthy state.  We would ignore this duty at our peril.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the marine system, local action alone will not protect national coastlines, and still less the quality of the high seas.  We cannot control deep sea pollution without solid, unambiguous agreements between governments. The OSPAR Convention provides a basic and effective framework for protection of the marine environment.  It is aimed at an extensive ocean area of the north-east Atlantic, which borders the majority of the countries of the continent of Europe.  It is an area of intensive economic and industrial activity where the adjacent seas are particularly threatened by pollution.  National measures must be combined with international agreement to reduce the input of pollutants to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>As an island nation close to major shipping lanes, Ireland is particularly vulnerable to the effects of marine casualties, oil spills and wilful disposal of wastes in the North Atlantic.  Thus, we have a very special interest in promoting protection of the marine environment in the interests of human health, marine life and amenity values. We also have a deeply principled interest in ensuring that our stewardship of our adjacent seas and oceans will be seen by future users of the resource to have been wise and far-sighted.</P>
      <P>The new OSPAR Convention takes account of developments since the original Oslo and Paris Conventions were signed in 1972 and 1974, respectively, and merges and consolidates their provisions.  The OSPAR Convention attaches particular importance to the need to increase our knowledge of the state and science of the north-east Atlantic.  Contracting parties to the new OSPAR Convention have been preparing for the ratification of the new convention by agreeing on new scientific committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparations are under way for the completion <Col N="614" /> of an environmental quality status report for the entire area covered by OSPAR by the year 2000. The information gathered in this report will allow for assessment of the environment of the area and will provide a firm basis for future monitoring and management of the maritime area.  For the purpose of the report the convention area has been divided into five sub-regions.  Ireland and the UK are responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of that part of the north-east Atlantic region extending westwards of the UK mainland to the edge of the continental shelf.  The area includes all of Ireland's marine and coastal areas.  The report will comprise: a compilation of existing knowledge &mdash; physics, chemistry, biology, human activities &mdash; of the area; an assessment of this information in relation to agreed criteria of environmental quality; and a statement of the prevailing condition of the area.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with similar reports on the four other parts of the OSPAR region, the Celtic Seas QSR will be assimilated into a convention-wide QSR that will be published in the year 2000.  It is expected that a draft of the report in respect of the Irish/UK region will be completed early in 1998.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution to the QSR is being managed by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Departments of the Environment and of the Marine.The institute has established a QSR office at the Forbairt laboratory in Shannon, County Clare, staffed by a team of four marine scientists. The team is lead by Mr. Rick Boelens, a recognised international expert in marine environmental science, who has been seconded to the institute for this project.</P>
    <P>The new OSPAR Convention generally obliges contracting parties to adopt, individually and jointly, programmes and measures involving the use of best available techniques, best environmental practice and, where appropriate, clean technology for the purpose of preventing and eliminating marine pollution and protecting the maritime area covered by the convention against adverse effects of human activities.  The new convention: provides a stricter marine environmental regime; establishes mechanisms for the protection of the marine environment; allows more in-depth consideration of ideas and proposals affecting the marine environment through an increased number of scientific working groups; operates on a precautionary principle, where countries are asked not to license activities where there is any question of possible damage to the marine environment; and provides an arbitration mechanism for the settlement of disputes involving transboundary pollution.</P>
    <P>Sufficient statutory support to implement the provisions of the convention on pollution from land-based sources exists in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 to 1990, the Air Pollution Act, 1987, and the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, provides an updated legislative framework for provisions <Col N="615" /> relating to discharges or emissions from offshore installations and pipelines, abandonment of offshore installations and placement of disused offshore installations and pipelines in the sea for a purpose other than originally intended.</P>
    <P>The Dumping at Sea Act, 1996, which is administered by the Department of the Marine, gives domestic effect to provisions of the convention relating to dumping.  When drafting this Act, I took the opportunity to carry out a full review of dumping at sea legislation.  I will now advise Deputies of the key provisions of this Act, which gives effect to the dumping provisions of the OSPAR Convention.</P>
    <P>The maritime area to which the Act applies has been extended beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial seas limit.  It now extends 200 miles, and in some cases up to 350 miles off the Irish coast depending on the extent of our continental shelf. This is a major development.  Up to now Ireland was only in a position to regulate out to 12 miles. Our control over the marine environment has been greatly enhanced by this provision.  This Act applies strict limitations on the types of substances which can be disposed of at sea.  It bans incineration at sea, the dumping of radioactive wastes, offshore installations and toxic, harmful or noxious substances.</P>
    <P>The previous exemptions, that is, sovereign immunity, which existed for State vessels, including military vessels, will no longer apply.  The Government has decided that, even though dumping by State vessels is legally permitted under international conventions, it is no longer appropriate that Governments should be exempt from the restrictions imposed on others by these conventions.  This Act marked a decisive step in developing a strategy for the healthy management of the marine resource and for the protection of the environment of our seas and oceans.</P>
    <P>With regard to the need for international action to deal with the menace of Sellafield and nuclear hazards in the marine environment generally which was raised by Deputy Quill, we have been taking significant action at international level to deal with this question.  In particular, I refer to the progress we have made at the International Maritime Organisation to put far stricter controls on the shipment of nuclear materials, which is obviously a major concern particularly in the Irish Sea.  We have made very significant progress in strengthening the INF code which governs the shipment of nuclear materials.  In addition, at EU level we have made considerable progress to have nuclear materials included in the Hazmat Directive which deals with the shipment of hazardous materials, so considerable progress is being made in those areas.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the House should ratify the OSPAR Convention which will, among other things, strengthen the hand of the Government in dealing with the Sellafield and nuclear issue at international level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Enviornment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on these important conventions and for urging the Government to strongly support full implementation of our objectives under the conventions.</P>
      <P>The environment has changed dramatically since the original OSPAR Convention was put in place.  When the Oslo and Paris Conventions were concluded in the 1970s, the objectives agreed upon were regarded as ambitious but would not now be perceived as such following the process of reevaluation engendered by the Rio conference. Deputy Michael Smith is aware of that process because he attended the Rio conference as Minister for the Environment and was directly involved in the OSPAR negotiations.  I pay tribute, to him for arguing strongly in favour of the extension of the stringent controls governing the dumping of low and intermediate level radioactive materials.  He was responsible, in no small way, for bringing about this change which, initially, was trenchantly opposed by the United Kingdom and France.  There is a common purpose among Deputies on all sides in respect of these objectives.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith inquired about the countries that have ratified the OSPAR Convention and those that have yet to ratify it.  To date, those countries that have ratified the convention include Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden.  Those yet to ratify it include Ireland, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Iceland and the European Union as a whole.  However, all are expected to ratify the convention this year.  The OSPAR Convention will not come into effect until it has been ratified by all the contracting parties.  There will be a meeting of the contracting parties later this year and it is envisaged that each one will have concluded the necessary domestic ratification processes at that stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine indicated the legislative framework which will be used in Ireland to implement the provisions of the OSPAR Convention and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes and I will not refer it in detail.  However, I will respond to a number of the points raised by Deputy Quill regarding Government action on the domestic front.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have identified a number of the major sewerage schemes which are already under way or at the planning stage.  The Dublin Bay project, which is the largest undertaking of its kind in this country and which will entail an estimated expenditure of £200 million, will incorporate the extension of the existing treatment works at Ringsend and provide secondary treatment and the construction of a pumping station at Sutton to transfer sewage currently discharged off Howth to the Ringsend plant.  It is expected that secondary treatment will be in place by the end of the year <Col N="617" /> 2000 in line with the timetable set out for the implementation of the Urban Waste Water Directive.  An extensive programme of works has been put in place which involves expenditure of £150 million, in the current year, on water treatment and provision.  The programme will probably have to be accelerated between now and the projected deadline in 2005, which will provide a major challenge.</P>
    <P>In terms of investment in sewerage schemes, with the support of the INTERREG II programme we are targeting a number of the transboundary catchments.  The Erne catchment will benefit from schemes in planning or which are under way in respect of Ballyconnell, Carrick-on-Shannon, Cavan, Fenagh, Newtowngore, Keshcarrigan, etc.  A number of individual initiatives are being undertaken jointly by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment to monitor water quality and to work in co-operation to ensure the highest standard of transboundary river systems.  I have also taken a number of initiatives with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in respect of reducing pollution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill inquired about discharges from coastal vessels.  Such discharges are not covered by the OSPAR Convention but are dealt with under the MARPOL Convention which Ireland has ratified.  We are anxious that action will be taken to ensure that the type of activity to which the Deputy referred will be addressed.</P>
    <P>Sellafield and its operation continues to be a major cause of concern for the people of Ireland and the Government.  We are committed to mounting legal action against this facility when we are in a position to provide sufficient evidence of pollution or public health impact to sustain such a case.  An active interdepartmental group is working towards this objective.  In the interim, significant progress has been made towards reducing risks posed by the nuclear industry in Britain, including the initiatives outlined by the Minister of State in respect of the movement of waste to or from Sellafield <i>via</i> sea routes.  We must acknowledge the achievement of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stage, in encouraging the British Secretary of State to overturn the application from Nirex for an underground waste facility.  Few people expected this would happen and it is a testament to the effect of consistent and structured opposition.</P>
    <P>The Government remains determined to pursue all possible avenues to minimise the threat from Sellafield and the entire British nuclear industry.  We have made our views known at every available international forum.  I thank Deputies for supporting these important conventions.</P>

      <P>In the course of our lengthy discussion of this matter on Committee Stage I indicated that the Minister should retain discretion when deciding what conditions should be applied to individual licences.

    </Speaker>
    <P>There was not a great deal of dispute about this amendment.  The Bill provides for conditions to be attached to licences, the type to be attached to each individual one being dependent on the type of licence involved.  For example, that attached to a licence for a shellfish operation would be somewhat different from that attached to a licence for, say, salmon farming.  Therefore, I do not consider it appropriate that there should be a requirement <Col N="619" /> that conditions relating to the disposal of dead fish, preventing escapes and so on should necessarily be attached to every type of licence but rather dependent on the type of each individual one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the disposal of dead fish &mdash; for which provision must be made &mdash; the Minister of State will be aware that a large percentage of the aquaculture sea fishing industry is located in my constituency off the coast of Galway.  Experience there has been that, from time to time, unfortunate incidents occur in a fish cage resulting in the need to dispose of a substantial quantity, in our case, mostly of salmon.  An arrangement has been entered into by the fish farm owners and Galway Corporation which operates a public refuse dump at Carrabrown in the Galway County Council area.  I understand a condition has been laid down recently that no further disposal of fish shall take place at the Galway city dump.  Can the Minister give some indication of the arrangements he will make to facilitate the industry whenever the need arises to dispose of dead fish whenever the relevant local authority has no facilities available?</P>

      <P>Among the many conditions the Minister may require a licence holder to comply with is the reporting of instances of disease and the presence of parasites.  The intent of my amendment is to add conditions in relation to the control of disease on the site.  I should appreciate the Minister giving the House his views.  Surely it would be necessary to require any licence holder to satisfy the Minister that he had made satisfactory provisions to control any disease affecting the fish cages for which he was responsible?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of the disposal of dead fish, my Department requires that such fish must be disposed of hygienically; fish waste can now be ensiled which means it can be reduced or converted into hygienic form suitable for disposal.  In addition there is a provision under licence <Col N="620" /> whereby fish wastes may be disposed of in certain circumstances at sea.

However, I ask him to take cognisance of the new situation that has arisen in the Galway area.  It will be serious for the companies operating aquaculture licences which, from time to time, may have to dispose of fish in certain circumstances.  Do I take it from what the Minister said that the reduction of fish in some mincing process facilitates their disposal at sea, and that the intention from now on is that the fish will be dumped at sea rather than placed in a landfill site or a bed of lime or some such arrangement that has existed up to now?  Will the Minister take cognisance of what I have said in regard to difficulties that may confront the industry in Galway West?</P>

I am also aware that the practice of disposing of fish on landfill sites gave rise to some concern and I am aware of the decision of Galway County Council in the matter.  There are certain circumstances where fish may be disposed of on land. There are also certain circumstances where fish may be disposed of at sea.  In addition there is the practice whereby the fish &mdash; as Deputy Molloy put it &mdash; may be minced down into a form which is more suitable for disposal.  That disposal can take place under certain conditions and controls. The intention is that the conditions relating to the species of fish &mdash; they will vary from species to species &mdash; will require the licence holder to comply with those conditions in the event of dead fish having to be disposed of.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that this amendment is warranted.  I am anxious to maintain the maximum discretion in relation to public notice and notification procedures.  As it stands, details of applications are published in a newspaper and the newspaper insertion indicates where the plans can be inspected, usually in the local Garda station.  I do not envisage any change in the present notification procedures which have worked well.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister see the point of the amendment in that it would require applicants to publish and give specified notices relating to their applications?  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the full information is published and the detail of the application is made available to the public or any interested bodies which wish to examine them.  It would seem that as worded they are only required to publish but not required to give the specified notices to which the Minister refers.  I am disappointed the Minister will not accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>An applicant for a licence would be required to publish a notice that the application is being made and in the published notice <Col N="622" /> to indicate where the plans can be inspected.  That is the practice at present and I envisage it will continue after the passage of this Bill.  I understand Deputy Molloy has tabled another amendment, to which this one probably relates, which suggests in addition to publishing a notice there should also be a requirement to place a notice, in much the same way, for example, as one places a notice on a site when a planning application is being made.  The difficulty with an aquaculture licence is that there are obvious physical difficulties in placing a notice on the site and there are obvious difficulties in attempting to place a notice on, for example, a roadway approaching the site because the site may be out at sea and there may be a number of roadways.  It is simpler and safer to require the applicant to publish a notice in a newspaper and to state where the plans can be inspected.  The licence assessment process will have within it a requirement that the statutory bodies be formally consulted &mdash; the fisheries boards, local authorities, Bord Fáilte, the wildlife service and so on.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he did not mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of the Irish Free State with a State event.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11268/97]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Doyle, informed the Deputy in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1 on 17 December 1996, the Government approved the issue of 12 special stamps this year to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>There are differing views on when the State was established.  In office in 1994, Fianna Fáil was involved in arranging at public expense a Government reception to mark the 75th anniversary of the meeting of the first Dáil, the event generally regarded by it as making the establishment of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not consider it appropriate to hold, at public expense, a second function marking the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the State but equally did not wish to let 1997 pass without marking in an appropriate way the remarkable achievements of the 1922 Provisional Government in laying the foundations on which subsequent Governments were enabled to build. <Col N="623" /> Hence, the issuance of the stamps. Fine Gael also held a successful function on 17 April 1997 to mark the 75th anniversary of the foundation of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I agree there are different views on the date but would it not be better to commemorate such matters on an inclusive basis?  I had no difficulty in commending the generous contributions to the State by many of the people who worked in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1922 &mdash; Michael Collins, W.T. Cosgrave, Kevin O'Higgins and Paddy McGilligan.  We should try to commemorate the 75th anniversary on an inclusive basis to show that we are capable of putting divisions behind us and agree that we should not try for political purposes to substitute civil war history for civil war politics.  This is the way I wish to see Irish politics move in the years ahead.  In my speeches I have tried to acknowledge the contribution of the people in our parties between 1922 and 1937 who played a major role in developing the State.  The Taoiseach made no reference to Éamon de Valera or any of the other people who worked hard in the 1930s in his speech and that is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I made an approving reference to Éamon de Valera in my speech at the Fine Gael function.  Second, the Deputy is not right in suggesting it is inappropriate for political parties to commemorate important national events.  Last weekend his party held an exclusive commemoration of a national event to which no other party was invited.  I did not criticise that. Therefore, the Deputy does not have any grounds for criticising my party for organising a function to commemorate another important national event a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The inclusive nature of these commemorations is clearly shown by the fact that I attended one, as leader of Fine Gael, in the Mansion House in 1994 to commemorate the foundation of the Dáil. While I might have some criticism of the details of the arrangements for that function, it was organised on an inclusive basis.  In so far as the commemoration of the foundation of the Provisional Government is concerned &mdash; which is a date not necessarily accepted by the Deputy's party as the date of the foundation of the State &mdash; the Government has also taken an inclusive approach to this through the issuance of stamps which are open to all to purchase.  Nobody is excluded from commemorating that event.  The stamps were not issued to commemorate the date but the services founded by that Government, such as the Civil Service, the Garda Síochána and the Army and to place an emphasis on the services that have developed subsequently.  That was appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware, for instance, that it was very strongly stated by a previous leader of the Deputy's party that he did not accept 1922 as the <Col N="624" /> appropriate date for the foundation of the State. On 9 December 1971 Mr. Jack Lynch said that he clearly believed the appropriate date was the meeting of the first Dáil.  That was commemorated and I attended the function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's reference to Éamon de Valera in his speech.  I read one except from it in a newspaper and it did not contain such a reference.</P>
      <P>However, this is not just a question of the date. The Taoiseach can hold Fine Gael functions every night of the week, it is none of my business but there should be at least one State function during the year.  Perhaps, both of us could agree on 6 December, regardless of the positions we hold.  That would be an appropriate day as it is the 75th anniversary of the handing over of rule from the British to the Irish Government.  These commemorations are important and it is also important they are celebrated in an inclusive way, regardless of the date.  The year 1916 was the start of the movement and that date is as important as the meeting of the first Dáil.  Will there be an inclusive function to commemorate the events of 75 years ago during the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Deputy's comments.  One of the reasons we did not want to hold a national commemoration was that the Deputy's party had not in the past acknowledged the relevance of this date and we did not wish to get involved in an event that would be seen as divisive or offensive to any party.  The Deputy's comments remove that difficulty and that is good. There are difficulties in deciding what is the date to be used.  The Treaty was signed on 6 December 1921 without which there could not have been a Provisional Government.  The next date was 6 January 1922 when the Treaty was approved by the Dáil.  Various installations were handed over at different times during the year.</P>
      <P>The Constitution of the Irish Free State was approved on 22 October 1922.  On 5 December 1922 the Irish Free State Constitution Act was approved by the British Parliament.  On 6 December 1922 the Constitution of the Irish Free State came into force.  There is room for discussion as to which of those dates would be appropriate.  I think we should consider doing something on 6 December, if that is acceptable. It is a good idea, we should do it and we will.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces review implementation plan recommended that a more detailed examination of the Air Corps and Naval Service be undertaken.As Minister for Defence, I requested the Efficiency Audit Group to commission a special study of the Air Corps and Naval Service.  A preliminary draft of this report has been presented to the steering group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> I am advised by the civil and military representatives of the Department of Defence on the steering group that there are a number of aspects of this draft which require further work to ensure the terms of reference are fully addressed.  Far from shelving the review of both services, as has been suggested in some quarters, this is a genuine attempt by the steering group to ensure the final report covers all aspects of the operations of the Air Corps and Naval Service and will serve as a workable blueprint for their future development.</P>

      <P>It was expected that the report would have been published about six months ago based on earlier commitments.  Everybody has been patient but we are now hearing for the first time that there will be a further delay.  In view of the fact that morale is at an historically low level in the Air Corps and Naval Service and bearing in mind the tough operations they are required to carry out, including fisheries, drug trafficking and dumping at sea surveillance as well as search and rescue operations, will the Minister publish the interim report, although I accept it will not be possible to cover all the angles?  As he is aware, a more detailed examination is being undertaken as the preliminary examination was not considered to be comprehensive enough.  Because of the long delay and the fact that this is the second bite at the cherry, will the Minister publish the interim report and move on from there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that morale is at a low level in the Air Corps and Naval Service.  The flag officer commanding the Naval Service and the general officer commanding the Air Corps are members of the Efficiency Audit Group steering group and have participated fully in all the decisions made.  The draft report is not in my possession and it is not open to me to publish it. Although I requested that a further examination be carried out, it is being undertaken under the auspices of the EAG which is under the control of the Department of the Taoiseach with its own chairperson.  It will be up to the EAG to satisfy itself that the report is satisfactory and in accordance with the terms of reference laid down.  When that is done I presume it will present it to me.  I, in turn, will present it to Government with various recommendations.</P>
      <P>I am as disappointed as the Deputy that it is taking so long to complete the report.  I wish to ensure the Naval Service and the Air Corps have clear directions for the future and that we move away from the questions of lack of personnel and proper structures.  Unfortunately, I have no control over the consultants or the draft report presented so far but I share the Deputy's concern at the long delay.  I would have preferred to have had the full report in my possession some months ago.  When it is presented to me I will not delay in presenting it to Government or publishing it so that we can have the debate the Deputy is seeking.</P>

      <P>With respect, I am surprised by the Deputy's comments.  As a former Cabinet Minister, he knows full well that I am not in a position to publish the draft report as it has not been presented to me.  He is also aware that the Efficiency Audit Group was established in 1988 during the period he was a member of the Government.  He was a member of the Cabinet which asked the EAG to carry out an examination of the Defence Forces.  He is further aware of the procedural arrangements.  The report will be presented to the EAG by the consultants.  It will have to satisfy itself that it is in accordance with the terms of reference laid down.  The only difficulty is that the steering group is not satisfied the draft report complies with the terms of reference set out for the consultants.  It is a matter, therefore, for the Efficiency Audit Group, the Naval Service and the Air Corps to ensure that a proper and comprehensive study is carried out and the full report is presented to Government as quickly as possible.  With respect, the Deputy does not need me to tell him the procedures involved: he is asking me to do something which is not within my control.</P>

      <P>The terms of reference are satisfactory and I have not been informed of any proposal to change them so that another report can be requested.  I am satisfied the terms of reference agreed in the first instance ensured the best possible prospects for the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  This is the only matter in which I am interested; I am not interested in playing politics with either the Naval Service or the Air Corps. We all appreciate the extraordinary commitment, dedication and work of these arms of the Defence Forces.  I assure the Deputy there has been no mass exodus from the Naval Service.  As my reply to a later question indicates, 20 recruits were taken on at the end of 1996 and 35 recruits have been taken on to date this year.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 3,000 claims from former members of the Defence Forces alleging some degree of hearing impairment due to negligence.  As I said in the Adjournment debate on 4 March, liability is an issue in each claim.  It cannot be assumed a plaintiff's loss of hearing is attributable to his service in the Defence Forces or that the military authorities were negligent.  Ear defenders have been provided to military personnel for many years.  The plaintiff may have subjected himself to some other source of acoustic trauma, for example, as a member of a gun club, or there may be medical evidence to suggest some other cause of his deafness, for example, a previous illness or ear infection.I am advised that many of the claimants suffer from minor handicaps as assessed in accordance with international best practice.

      <P>On the latter question, that is a matter for our legal advisers in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The high level of compensation awarded by the courts is for hearing patterns which would be regarded in other jurisdictions as coming within the normal range of relatively low levels of hearing handicap and, as a result, would attract little or no compensation.  The problem is that to date the courts have apparently not accepted the difference between hearing loss and hearing handicap, which is the key issue.  If I had <Col N="629" /> time I could outline in detail the differences between hearing loss and hearing handicap, how they are assessed etc.  However, I will give the Deputy one example.  In a recent High Court action the judge found that the plaintiff was exaggerating his hearing loss and said he was satisfied that he had normal hearing.  However, he awarded him £20,000 on the grounds that he was satisfied that if he had not joined the Army his hearing would probably have been better.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the need for consistency when dealing with such issues.  We are talking about large sums of taxpayers' money and in cases where an individual suffers injury or loss of hearing or a hearing handicap during the course of his or her employment then I have a moral obligation, on behalf of taxpayers, to ensure that the State meets its liability.  However, I also have an obligation to contest other cases in which the State does not have a liability.  For this reason we have gone to extraordinary lengths, and will continue to do so, to get the best professional advice in establishing a pattern which clearly indicates whether the hearing loss was incurred during the course of the person's employment or for some other reason or whether, like us all, the person's hearing disimproved as he became older.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that where the evidence shows the hearing loss relates to the time spent by the person in the Defence Forces efforts are made to settle the claim at an early stage.  The settlement of any claim involves both parties and if the other party is not happy with the award or level of compensation then he or she has the right to go to court.  This would be the case regardless of whether there was a tribunal.</P>

There is a formal agreement between the Irish and Zambian Governments in regard to the training of Zambian nationals in Ireland.  Between 1967 and 1973, four groups of Zambian cadets were trained under the terms of this agreement.  The Zambian cadets are being trained here because, first, we were requested to do so by the Zambian Government and, second, there is a formal agreement in place.  The Zambian Government is paying the cost of the cadets undergoing the course.

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to advise the House on the outcome of the negotiations on the new five year EU fleet plan which was finally agreed by the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 15 April last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council decision sets the broad principles on which individual national programmes will be negotiated bilaterally with the Commission before the end of the year.  It differs radically from the original Commission proposals for cuts of up to 40 per cent across the board which were rejected by Fisheries Ministers last October.  It is closely based on the alternative approach which <Col N="631" /> was tabled by the Irish Presidency last November. The outcome, therefore, reflects Ireland's overriding position throughout these negotiations that the solutions to over-fishing and over capacity in EU waters should be rational and equitable and targeted as closely as possible at those causing the problem.</P>
    <P>The key principles of the agreement include the &ldquo;critical stocks&rdquo; approach which targets the reductions on depleted and over-fished stocks and the fleets which fish them; reductions in principle of 30 per cent and 20 per cent spread over five years and weighted in practice according to specific criteria; reductions to be taken in either fishing effort or capacity; safety related capacity increases are excluded; and the option of separate treatment for small scale coastal fishing boats under 12 metres.</P>
    <P>The complex technical process of translating these principles into individual national fleet programmes is getting under way.  Our assessment is that the practical impact for the Irish fishing industry over the five year period will be comparatively minor by the time the specific criteria, safeguards and weighting mechanisms are factored into the Irish programme.  Most notably, the &ldquo;critical stocks&rdquo; approach means that the extent to which the stocks in trouble are fished by the Irish fleet will be the key determining factor in the Irish programme.  In practice, the most severe cuts will be borne by the fleets causing the real over-fishing problems and will be taken in the areas where stocks are under the most pressure.</P>
    <P>The unique circumstances and needs of the Irish fleet will, in practical terms, be taken fully into account in implementing the guiding principles now agreed at political level.  In that context, having successfully negotiated the option of excluding fishing boats under 12 metres from the national programmes, we will now assess, in consultation with the industry, whether the balance of advantage lies in exercising that option.</P>
    <P>The agreement is a good outcome for conservation and the best achievable outcome in terms of realistically tackling European over-fishing. Our efforts will ensure Irish fishermen can plan for the future with certainty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Minister's reply, although some of the fisheries organisations may not agree with him when he refers to minor cuts.  Will he indicate whether the exclusion of 12 metre boats will have a dramatic effect on the cuts with which Irish fishermen will have to comply?  Will he be more specific in regard to the percentage reductions for the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and the north west coast because fishermen are not happy with his reference to minor reductions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an example. In the west of Ireland zone, two white fish stocks are classified as over-fished, namely, hake and <Col N="632" /> monkfish.  These stocks would attract a 20 per cent pilot reduction but because Ireland only has approximately 10 per cent of the quotas in that area, we will only take 10 per cent of the 20 per cent which means that over a five year period we would only take 2 per cent &mdash; 0.4 per cent per annum.  It is important to realise that because we took this approach, those who are causing the damage should carry the penalty.  The countries with larger quotas which are affecting the species will carry the biggest cuts.  If one compares that with what was being proposed by the Commission through the commissioner, all member states would have been taking up to 40 per cent cuts, even though we were not causing the damage to the stocks.  During our Presidency, we successfully managed to persuade our European partners this would not solve the problem and it was downright unjust.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne said some people may not be happy, but perhaps it has not been fully explained to them the way this system works.  The percentage we have of the over-fished stock in an area will apply to either the 30 per cent or the 20 per cent cut.  If we have 10 per cent of the quotas, 10 per cent of the 20 per cent is taken out of the 30 per cent.  In each area, species have been identified from the available scientific evidence as to the state of the stock.  In area X, for example, there could be a particular stock which is regarded as critical or another stock which is regarded as being over-fished.  If it is a critical stock, up to 30 per cent is taken but 20 per cent is taken if it is an over-fished stock.  That is the way the system works.  We only take a percentage of the 30 per cent or the 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>To give the Deputy an example, in the Irish Sea we would take 8.7 per cent of the 30 per cent or the 20 per cent &mdash; or an average of 25 per cent &mdash; over five years.  That would relate to a 2.2 per cent cut over five years.  I will give the Deputy all the figures now if he wishes to take a note of them.  West of Scotland area &mdash; 11 per cent over five years; Irish Sea &mdash; this is the Irish cut &mdash; 2.2 per cent over five years; west of Ireland &mdash; 2.2 per cent over five years; the Celtic Sea &mdash; 4.1 per cent over five years; and the pelagic, all areas &mdash; 4.2 per cent over five years.  In any area the most we would take in a year would be 0.58 per cent. The deal was an exceptionally good one for Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Minister's explanation.  Perhaps he could find a way to convey this message to fishermen who do not seem to be under that impression.  The Minister said action would be taken against fleets which were overfishing.  How will this be policed?  Has the Minister negotiated extra funding to beef up our under-resourced Naval Service which is not currently in a position to protect our coastline?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>By June of this year each member state will have to submit to the Commission its plan for dealing with cuts in each area, and that <Col N="633" /> plan will be transparent in that it will be available to all other member states.</P>
      <P>On the question of boats under 12 metres, we negotiated the option to include or not to include them for the simple reason that if all boats under 12 metres were excluded, they would be treated as one segment, and the tonnage could be used only within the 12 metre segment.  Somebody who owns a 12 metre boat of 20 or 30 tonnes who wants to give up fishing could, under the old system, sell it on to another fisherman who had a 20 metre boat and wanted to trade up to a 24 metre boat.  If 12 metre boats were excluded, fishermen could not use that tonnage.  I was conscious that there are some people who regard the ability to use that tonnage in trading up as an asset, and that asset could have been wiped out overnight had we not negotiated this option.  There are arguments for and against the inclusion of 12 metre boats but, before any decision is taken, we will discuss the matter with the industry and make it aware of what is involved in either excluding or including them.  On initial examination of the matter I thought it would be in our interest to continue to include them.  However, it will be a matter for discussion.</P>
      <P>On the question of surveillance we have already negotiated a special package for Ireland. We will get £12 million for operational costs over five years.  We will also get a slice of the 205 million ECU capital fund that has been set up, and Ireland is the only member state that will get a grant for capital purposes in excess of 50 per cent out of that fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A total of 1,797 individuals applied for general service enlistment to the Defence Forces in response to the advertisements placed in 1996.  Of these 470 applied for the Naval Service and 1,327 applied for the Army.  Also in 1996 there were 605 applications for 27 Army cadetships advertised, 280 for ten Air Corps cadetships and 122 for three Naval service cadetships.The number of applications received for <Col N="634" /> apprenticeships in 1996 was 834 for 18 available Army and Naval Service apprenticeships and 659 for 15 available Air Corps apprenticeships.  While the number of applicants is down on previous years I am happy that there will always be a sufficient number of young people who will be attracted to a career in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The number of applicants for enlistment is always likely to reflect the prevailing economic climate and employment opportunities in the wider labour market.  The recent very strong growth in the economy and the consequent increase in job opportunities has inevitably had a bearing on the likely pool of potential applicants for appointments in the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Another factor which has affected the number of potential applicants for general service enlistment is the more targeted recruitment policy adopted in recent years.  The upper age limit for recruits was reduced from 27 to 22 years in 1996. This followed specifically on a recommendation of the Efficiency Audit Group and its consultants who reviewed the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  This policy is specifically geared to achieving a much needed reduction in the age profile of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      <P>In the case of cadetships, the educational standards required have been raised in recent years to reflect the standards required for third level college entrants.  This has had a consequential impact on the number of eligible applicants. However, in the 1997 cadetship competition applicants with certain diploma and undergraduate qualifications will be eligible to apply, and that should increase the number who will compete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise a number of factors are influencing the decline of the number of people enlisting in our Defence Forces, and it is a worrying development.  In announcing a plan to reorganise our Defence Forces, the Government promised we would have a properly structured and well equipped Defence Force capable of carrying out its roles in the most efficient and effective way with the capacity and flexibility to adapt to a changing environment.  The reality is that numbers are falling rapidly, but there has been no reduction in the operational or administrative duties, and training commitments have increased significantly.  As a result of the voluntary early retirement scheme a smaller number of people is being asked to carry out a greater number of duties but, while the number of duties has increased, the number of barracks and posts remains the same.  Would the Minister agree that people are no longer prepared to embark on a career which involves so much uncertainty and that we are not demonstrating the commitment to the Defence Forces that we promised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree for one second with the Deputy that people are not prepared to embark on a career in the Defence Forces.  The fact that 1,797 individuals applied in 1996 for general <Col N="635" /> service is not an indication that there is a decline in interest in the Defence Forces.  The fact that there were 605 applicants for 27 Army cadetships advertised does not show lack of confidence in the Defence Forces.  With the greatest respect to the Deputy, I understand politics; I sat on that side of the fence for many years.  We hear regularly from the Opposition that morale is low in the Defence Forces, but we have the finest Defence Forces in the world.  They are complimented every day of the week for the work they do at home and abroad.  They are held in the highest esteem at UN level.  The only place there seems to be a problem is on the Opposition benches whose members consistently say our Defence Forces are falling apart.  We undertook restructuring of the Defence Forces following a review requested by the Deputy's party in Government.  We had the guts to go ahead with the recommendations of that review and, of course, in the initial stages of any restructuring, there will be certain changes with which some people will be uncomfortable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy conveniently ignores the fact that 400 new recruits have been taken into the Defence Forces since last December, 200 in December and 200 in January, all of whom are young, active people between the ages of 17 and 22.  As a result of young, vibrant, enthusiastic people coming into the Defence Forces there has been an improvement in morale.  In addition, last month we settled a manpower policy problem caused by the previous Government when it took on soldiers on five year contracts and did not tell them whether they would be kept on after that time.  That matter has been resolved to the satisfaction of the representative associations and the delight of the recruits who were taken on in early 1994.</P>
      <P>Great strides have been made in the past two years in the Defence Forces.  I ask the Deputy not to send out an image from Parliament that our Defence Forces are crumbling and morale is very low.  These people are proud to wear the Defence Forces' uniform and are doing a very fine job both here and abroad.  Whenever there is a problem the Defence Forces are the first people to be called upon to fill the gap.  We have spent time and taxpayers' money training people to the highest level so that emergencies can be covered by the Defence Forces.  The people who serve Ireland in a fantastic manner in many countries abroad carry the flag and do only good for Ireland.  I reject out of hand the suggestion that the Defence Forces are crumbling and morale is low.</P>

He should visit the barracks and talk to people.  On 5 March 1996 the Government stated that the savings achieved through the reorganisation of the Defence Forces would be divided between the Department of Finance and the Department of Defence, on a basis to be agreed between the Ministers in those Departments. That decision was to be made within a month, but no decision has yet been made.  That, more than anything else, shows the lack of commitment by the Government to reorganise the Defence Forces and is seen by most people in the Defence Forces as nothing but a cost cutting exercise.</P>

This year four cadets are being recruited to the equitation school.  A new headquarters has been constructed and a state of the art transporter has been purchased.  We are in negotiations at present for money for horses. Coming from Kildare, Deputy Power will be aware it is not the easiest thing in the world to find international standard showjumpers, bearing in mind that the equitation school deals in Irish horses.  Because of the competitive market, huge prices are paid for horses.  The purpose of the equitation school is to promote the Irish horse abroad, and therefore we are confined to getting good young international standard Irish horses.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has information that requests are outstanding I would be glad to hear from him.  As in any walk of life, regardless of how much we have we always want a little more, but it is a question of ensuring a solid foundation for the future of the equitation school.</P>

      <P>I recognise the basic requirement of the school is a good horse.  Is the Minister saying there is a difficulty with the purchase of horses in terms of the cost implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always a difficulty in getting the right quality horse.  We take advice from the equitation school, particularly the colonel in charge.  There is a purchasing board that tries to <Col N="638" /> find suitable horses.  For those who know the horse business, as I am sure the Deputy does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the last thing they want others to know is that they are interested in purchasing. There is no such thing as a set price for a horse, it depends on how much a person is prepared to give.  One must be discreet.  It takes good people to find suitable horses and make an appropriate bid.  In latter years the equitation school has leased horses from people who do not want to sell them and we could use those horses.  This is good policy.  When possible we avail of the opportunity to purchase horses, but as it is often difficult to find the right type of horse, we must take advice from the equitation school.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Molloy</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
      <Quest>whether the current strength and equipment of the Naval Service are considered adequate to patrol and protect Ireland's sea fisheries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9021/97]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The current strength of the Naval Service is 987.  Arising from the recruitment campaign for enlistment in the Permanent Defence Force in 1996 and 1997, 20 recruits were enlisted in the Naval Service on 30 December 1996 and 35 have been enlisted to date in 1997.  Further enlistment will take place this year, but the number that will be enlisted for service in the Naval Service has yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service is currently equipped with a total of seven vessels comprising one helicopter carrying patrol vessel, four offshore patrol vessels and two coastal patrol vessels.  The Naval Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and directed at all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  Fishery protection patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps in the form of aerial surveillance by the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
      <P>The EU has introduced a five year programme of financial aid towards the cost of measures to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy.  Approximately £1.35 million was committed by the Department on EU-funded projects in 1996.  The position in relation to the programme for 1997 is that Ireland's submission provides for a down payment on an additional naval patrol vessel. Requests for proposals for the supply of an additional vessel were advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union.  The proposals received have been assessed and invitations to submit definitive tenders for the supply of the vessel will be issued shortly to a short list of suitable tenderers.  It is anticipated that the Department will be in a position to place a contract in the latter half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> Pending the implementation of the five year programme the Naval Service will continue to carry out its various roles using the existing seven patrol vessels.  Two of these vessels were refurbished in recent years and another is currently undergoing a major overhaul to replace and refurbish obsolete or deteriorated equipment and extend its operational life.  A further vessel will undergo similar refurbishment commencing in August next.</P>
    <P>The question of the resources in terms of equipment and personnel required by the Naval Service to enable it fulfil its fishery protection role is kept under continual review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister, in his dual capacity as Minister for the Marine and Minister for Defence, will agree that Ireland has a phenomenally rich resource in its sea fishing waters.Surely he must be astonished at the extent of robbery of Irish fish from our fishing area by foreign vessels, some of whom are prominent members of the EU.  Such fishing vessels under-record catches to such an extent that it is estimated approximately £2 billion worth of fish has been illegally taken from our sea fishing area.  It is obvious from the Minister's reply that we do not have the naval capacity to adequately control the vast wealth of our fishery area and, consequently, it is ripe for rape by Spanish, Portuguese, French, Japanese and other large vessels which regularly come into our waters.  Naval personnel who have boarded some of these vessels claim some of them have grossly under-recorded their catches.  Surely the Government is gravely concerned about this.  While I accept we are not in a position to defend our wealth, surely our EU partners have a duty to come to our aid on this matter.  What steps has the Minister taken to get a commitment from the European Union to fund the establishment of a proper EU fishery patrol based in Ireland to protect our waters?</P>

      <P>The Naval Service did not even have the aircraft or the technology it now possesses, not to mention the new ship for which we will tender this year.  The comments of some people would lead one to believe the Government has been in power for the past 20 or 30 years.  We have been in Government for only two years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am proud that in that short time we have made a number of improvements in the Naval Service.  A reply to a parliamentary question tabled today will show there is <Col N="640" /> no evidence to support the suggestion that we lost £2 billion worth of fish from our waters. However, I oppose any member state breaking EU law or regulations.  As a result of providing additional resources in terms of new technology, co-operation between the Air Corps and the Naval Service, use of the CASA aircraft and more efficient use of the fishery patrol vessels, boardings and sightings have increased significantly.The comments of some people would lead one to believe the Naval Service does very little work.  I am proud of the work it does.  In 1996 the Naval Service record showed 2,927 sightings, 1,204 boardings and 33 detentions of fishing vessels.This represents an increase in sightings and boardings and a decrease in detentions, reflecting enhanced efficiency in the discharge of its fishery protection role.  That the Naval Service has increased the number of boardings and the number of detentions has reduced proves the service is working effectively.  The number of detentions is low given the number of boardings.  This does not mean, however, the Naval Service does not detain people who break the law but that fewer people are breaking the law.  Irrespective of whether five or ten more vessels are provided, there must be greater co-operation between member states in regard to reported landings and surveillance.</P>
      <P>There has been much talk about mainly Spanish owned, British registered flagships.  Those vessels fish out of British quotas.  When I met the British Minister I told him there was no point in him shouting about flagships at Council of Ministers meetings if the British authorities do nothing to check the flagships fishing out of British quotas.  I want greater co-operation between the British and Irish authorities on the quotas that apply to those fishing vessels and information on if and when they have been filled.  During our Presidency of the EU we secured greater co-operation between this country and the country where landings are made because it is at that point landings can be checked against quotas. There is no point in providing 20 more vessels if these rules are not put in place and adhered to.</P>
      <P>During our EU Presidency we endeavoured to secure agreement on satellite monitoring to ensure we know the whereabouts of all fishing vessels over 24 metres long.  From 1 January 1998 vessels leaving our waters will have to report their catches.  We have secured agreement to allow Irish inspectors to carry out inspections on landings in other member states, such as Spain, France or the Netherlands, and vice versa.  EU inspectors can carry out spot checks.</P>
      <P>I would like the Naval Service to have five or ten more vessels.  I am doing something about that and we are in the process of getting a new vessel.  I hope that programme will continue.  It is grossly unfair to give the impression that nothing is happening in the meantime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that if we do not agree a problem exists we cannot <Col N="641" /> be on the road to solving it.  I did not table this question to score political points.  When it comes to support for the Naval Service and enlarging its capacity in fishery patrols, my record in this area is hard to surpass.  I am entitled to speak on this issue.  I do not wish to reduce it to a petty party political discussion.  This matter is of concern to our people and every party in this House.  I put the question to the Minister because he holds the portfolio for this area.  We must all be seriously concerned about the extent of the illegal fishing being undertaken in our waters. Surely we must admit that our capacity to patrol our fisheries is minimal and that is well known to those who are intent on stealing valuable stocks in our sea fisheries area.  It was estimated by those who are in a position to make an educated guess that the value of illegal fishing in our waters amounts to £2 billion.  Some naval officers have put the value of illegal fishing as higher than that figure.  Fishermen and naval personnel are frustrated by the daylight and night-time robbery of one of our valuable resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The tragedy is that the vessels in question move to other waters when they have cleaned us out and the damage is done.  Even though we do not have the capacity to catch all our fish stocks we should ensure that others do not steal them before we build up our fleet and have a better opportunity to extract more wealth from our waters.  We are getting only £100 million value for this resource at present.  Could this matter not be approached on an all-party basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting there is no illegal fishing.  We are conscious of that problem and are taking every possible step to address it.  It is grossly unfair to claim we are doing practically nothing about it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I carried out a study on this.</P>

    <Col N="642" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very poor study.  There is an obligation on the member state where such fishing vessels land their catch to report such landings centrally to the Commission and to the flag state of that fishing vessel.  During our Presidency of the EU we were successful in getting greater regulation and co-operation in requiring member states where catches are landed and flag states of fishing vessels to co-operate in providing information.</P>
      <P>When it is more difficult for fishing vessels to enter and exit our waters and satellite monitoring and tighter controls are in place, regardless of our number of patrol vessels, the job of checking and surveillance will be much easier.  In the past few years there has been greater co-operation in surveillance operations.  The Air Corps uses CASA aircraft to report sightings of trawlers to enable the Naval Service to direct its attention to the areas under threat.  That is what is happening.  I am not suggesting we have enough naval vessels. As well as doing something about that this year we are also tightening up controls.  Instead of directing our attention to the Irish authorities we should pay attention to those authorities which are not fulfilling their obligations.</P>
      <P>Most of the flagships in question are under the British flag.  The British authorities sold those vessels, but they are still under the British flag and the British authorities have responsibility for their activities.  If the owners and crew of those vessels are breaking the rules and over fishing their quotas, the British authorities have obligations to stop them from doing so.  The British authorities could use one of their patrol vessels to set up a checkpoint in international waters and require every British flagship on its way out of Irish waters to report its landings.  Aspects of this matter could be dealt with by those who have responsibilities in this area.  I am not shy about saying that those authorities could do a great deal more instead of constantly complaining about the activities of flagships and doing nothing to address that problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-1999 provides funding for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, with over £11 million of EU and Exchequer aid already available to support total investment of some £31 million in the fleet.  To date 131 modernisation projects have been approved for over £4 million grant aid in the last two years.  The good take-up of funding to date is contributing to the objectives of improving the quality, efficiency and safety of the fleet.</P>
      <P>In addition to this existing investment support strategy, I have been giving detailed consideration to the future direction of fleet policy and, in particular, the socio-economic and commercial merits of the introduction of new vessels into the whitefish fleet.  In that context I commissioned consultants last year to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of strategies and options for the renewal and restructuring of the whitefish fleet, taking account of current trends, long-term sustainability requirements and financial and socio-economic factors.</P>
      <P>The study, which I published two weeks ago, assessed and quantified the risks associated with investment in new whitefish vessels and recommended that in all the circumstances the most prudent way forward would be to introduce a pilot scheme of grant support for a number of new whitefish vessels.  I have asked the industry to revert to me with its considered response to the report as quickly as possible.  I look forward to getting its views.  In publishing the report, I confirmed my support for the introduction of a pilot scheme and I have since got Government approval to go ahead.  The Department and BIM are progressing practical implementation of the proposal and are drawing up a detailed scheme which will be presented to the European Commission for approval.  I am also pursuing the necessary additional funding for such a scheme in the context of the current mid-term review of Structural Funds on the basis that virtually all the funding currently available under the Fisheries Operational Programme will be required to deliver on the existing programme to modernise the fleet as a whole in order to meet safety, efficiency and quality objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a recent Dáil question, the Minister stated that the average age of vessels in our multi-purpose fishing fleet was 31 years.  In view of this, does the Minister agree that an <Col N="644" /> urgent programme is required to introduce new vessels into the fleet as quickly as possible?  I welcome what the Minister has said and, although I am not too clear about how extensive the benefit arising from that will be, the intention seems to be good.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that this is a matter of extreme urgency because of the age of our fishing fleet and the danger to those who are fishing in those vessels?  They are competing with much larger steel-hulled trawlers owned by EU members states which are poaching our fish and threatening our fishermen, constantly endangering their lives.  There are numerous reasons why this State should make a much greater investment in modernising its fishing fleet to achieve a greater return from the value of our own stocks and from the employment that would be available from an expanded fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Deputy. It is a disgrace that things have been allowed to get to this stage.  For that reason I commissioned this report, which has now been published.  I am sure the Deputy has received a copy of it but if he has not I can make this one available to him. It was done by KPMG to establish once and for all what is required for the future of the whitefish fleet and how we should go about modernising it, taking into account various factors, including availability of quotas and the need to have vessels that can travel distances to avail of non-quota species.  That report should form the basis of future policy whoever is in Government or whoever holds my position.</P>
      <P>We are taking on board the recommendations of this report &mdash; which I will supply to the Deputy if he does not have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;including a pilot scheme which would involve an investment of over £7 million, identifying suitable people to take part in the scheme for which grant aid would be made available, and building up a whitefish fleet to do precisely what the Deputy has suggested.</P>
      <P>It was important to get that study done so that all those in the industry will be aware of the investment and what will be required before any grant aid can be given.  I share the Deputy's concerns, particularly in relation to safety, and for that reason a lot of money has been spent on modernising existing vessels.  The Operational Programme for Fisheries did not allocate sufficient moneys when funds were being divided up in 1993-94.  I inherited that situation and I am staking my claim for additional funds in the context of the mid-term review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a lot of money has been spent on modernising the fleet up to now.  I beg to differ and feel there is room for much expansion.  The money that is being expended is the equivalent of giving a new parachute <Col N="645" /> to a 50 year old aeroplane &mdash; it does a certain amount but obviously we are looking for much more.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of the report providing a sense of reality and telling people what the situation is, but fishermen already know.  Everybody can quote figures relating to EU waters, our quotas, the age of our fishing fleet and its deficiencies.  I welcome the report but we seem to be talking only about reports, studies and reviews of policy, while we want more action.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the economic dependency of many coastal communities on the whitefish fleet?  Is there a policy, perceived or otherwise, to wind down the whitefish fleet instead of expanding it?  In my area we feel there is potential for the fleet.</P>
      <P>In relation to the report itself, it has been mentioned that the boats would cost £1.8 million and there would be a 40 per cent grant.  Is that grant aid 40 per cent of £1.8 million or of the first million?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider, as it says in the conclusion to the report, that three or four boats on a pilot basis would add a critical mass of new vessels to the whitefish fleet?  Does the Minister agree that three or four boats is a critical mass, given the size of our fleet and considering that 64 per cent of its vessels have serious deficiencies? We are worried about safety.  Will three or four boats serve the élite or will they serve those who need them?</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  It is an absolute disgrace that when Deputy Keaveney's party was in Government two short years ago, when it had the opportunity of allocating considerable sums of money from the Structural Funds to the fisheries programme, it totally neglected it.  Not only did it do that, but the original sum that was allocated was actually cut at the last minute.  A paltry sum of money was left for modernising the whitefish fleet.</P>

      <P>All parties in the House, except the Green Party, have been in power so we should all share responsibility for the inadequate investment in the fishing industry, the age of the fishing fleet, the lack of modernisation and the inadequate quota in our fishing waters.  All parties should join together to gain valuable resources through the development of the sea fishing industry, rather than each party trying to score political points.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have Deputy Molloy's support so we can have a practical and reasonable discussion on how to improve the industry, rather than the negative criticism we have had for the past 12 or 18 months.  I would be delighted to work with my colleagues for the sake of the industry.  However, I object to the ongoing litany of what should be done which has not been based on sound scientific evidence.  At least we now have a basis on which to work.  Anyone involved in business must deal with reality. Deputy Molloy knows from his vast experience here and in business that a company must have good prospects before an investment will be made in it.  We are trying to develop the long-term future of our business.</P>

      <P>Is the grant aid level of 40 per cent for £1.8 million or for the first £1 million?What incentives are there for young fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the grants will come from EU Structural Funds so we are obliged to adhere to the rules.  The 40 per cent grant will be nominal.  The grant aid level for £1.8 million will be 25 per cent.  The figure of 40 per cent is based on the EU's assessment of what a basic 24 metre whitefish vessel would cost to build.  Rather than giving a 40 per cent grant on any figure produced, the EU set a limit of up to £1.2 million.  If that is exceeded, the grant will be less.  However, if the lowest cost is achieved in the marketplace, the grant could be increased to 40 per cent.  It depends on the price charged for a 24 metre whitefish vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the pilot scheme, I share the Deputy's deep concern about the entry of young qualified skippers and trained deckhands into the industry.  I hope the pilot project will give these young qualified people the opportunity to operate one of the vessels.  That would be important in terms of investment because it would guarantee <Col N="648" /> its continuous usage.  Perhaps we could also develop non-quota species and the whitefish sector.That is why BIM, the Department and other agencies will work with the industry to identify these people and to monitor their progress.  I would only be too pleased to find an opening for young qualified skippers and deckhands who have been trained in Greencastle and will now also be trained in Castletownbere.  It would be a shame if such skills were wasted because of a lack of opportunity.  I would like the pilot scheme to use that valuable talent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated to the House on many occasions, I am extremely concerned about flagships from a number of perspectives &mdash; notably, the serious difficulties of control and enforcement arising from their activities in our waters and the fact that flagships benefit from national quotas without providing real economic benefits for the fishing communities of the flag state.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 150 flagships operating in these waters.  The majority are registered in the UK, while 12 are on the Irish register and some are registered in France and Germany. They are owned, crewed and operated by companies or individuals in other EU member states, mostly Spain, and their catch is mainly landed in other member states, which imposes particular enforcement problems.</P>
      <P>Flagships fish against the quota allocations of the member state of registry.  The management, control and access to national quotas by such vessels is therefore a matter for the flag state concerned rather than the coastal state where the fishing activity is carried out.  The fishing activity of flagships, and all vessels irrespective of nationality, in these waters is closely monitored by the Irish fishery protection services with considerable resources being applied to targeting potentially illegal activity on land and at sea.</P>
      <P>Ireland has consistently pressed the UK authorities to co-operate more closely with us in monitoring and controlling fishing activities of UK registered flagships in these waters.  We are also putting pressure on the Spanish authorities to improve the policing of landings by flagships in their ports which is also a matter of direct and considerable concern for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I used the opportunity of the Irish Presidency <Col N="649" /> to take an initiative geared towards improving practical co-operation between member states on fisheries control and enforcement.  This was designed, among other objectives, to bring about substantially improved scrutiny by other member states of flagship activity and to encourage better information exchange.  As a result of this initiative, the Fisheries Council agreed a number of practical initiatives to improve communication and co-operation on fisheries control, including better co-operation on land-based inspections in member states other than the flag state.  We are working to ensure these commitments are delivered on through bilateral discussions with Spain and the UK and at technical working groups on control involving the Commission and other member states.</P>
    <P>The operation of flagships is legitimate business under the general Treaty provisions relating to right of establishment and freedom of movement.I am, however, concerned to ensure there is the necessary link between the economic benefits of national fish quotas and the national coastal areas dependent on fishing.  We share the concerns of the UK in this regard and have said so at the Intergovernmental Conference when the issue was aired, while taking the view that there may be ways other than a Treaty change to secure the same objective.</P>
    <P>I will continue to explore actively with the Commission, the UK and other member states ways of securing that objective, in addition to pushing all relevant member states to ensure that the activities of flagships are adequately controlled both at sea and in port.  I am not prepared to tolerate flouting of fisheries law by flagships or any fishing vessels, irrespective of nationality, operating in these waters.  European fish stocks are under severe pressure and the activities of flagships must be recognised as one of the dimensions of the overall conservation and enforcement problem.  Enhanced control of flagships by their states of registry and by the member states in which they land their catches is essential to our efforts as a coastal state to protect stocks and enforce the rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the long reply but I must remind him that Deputy Harney asked the steps, if any, he is taking at EU level to stop other member states operating flag of convenience procedures to fish for other member countries' quotas.  This device, which is being used mainly by Spanish interests to circumvent EU Common Fisheries Policy quota laws, should be stopped.  The purpose of the question was to ask the Minister if he is taking a stand at EU level to change the Common Fisheries Policy in such a way that it will not be possible for these vessels carrying a flag of convenience to fish out Irish quotas.  The Minister mentioned the number of vessels which are fishing in Irish waters.  Was it 115 or 150?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is extraordinary.  The capacity of those vessels to take fish from the Irish quota and Irish fishery waters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not taking them from the Irish quota.  It is important to understand this problem.  They are taking them from quotas which belong to the UK.  Whether it is a flagship or a UK vessel, it is still from the same quota. The reality is that we must have this enforced properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not cede to the Minister.  I understood the Minister to say that there were flag of convenience ships operating out of Ireland and the UK, from which the number is obviously greater, but this practice should be stopped.  It should not be tolerated.  Seeking to introduce regulations to control it or provide for greater surveillance is not the way to approach the matter and it is not the way the sea fishing industry wants.  It wants the practice brought to an end. The question is directed at the measures, if any, the Minister is taking at EU level to bring the practice to an end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that, as a result of the Maastricht Treaty and other treaties, there is freedom of movement for people, goods and business.  There is nothing to stop me from going to Britain, Germany, France or any other member state and buying a business.  The treaties allow me to do that.  There is nothing to stop anybody coming to Ireland or the UK and buying a business.  That is the basis of this and that is the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would not get away with it in Spain.  The Spanish would not tolerate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats are great supporters of Europe and the various established rights, such as the freedom of movement, under the general treaty provisions, and rightly so.  Deputy Molloy knows the position as well as I do.  The Government supported the issue when it was raised at the Intergovernmental Conference and we will continue to do so.  We are endeavouring to ensure that the flag state insists on the economic link which is part and parcel of the requirements of the freedom of movement throughout Europe.  The ball is at the foot of the UK authorities.  It is galling for me to listen to the UK Minister talking about flagships and saying that he will not do this or that until this issue is addressed.  In the meantime nothing is being done to control the people who are the responsibility of the UK Government.  These people are fishing in Irish waters from UK quotas.  The onus is on the British authorities to ensure that they adhere to the quotas allocated to them.  In turn, it is also the obligation of Spain or any other member state where this fish is landed to ensure that the quantities <Col N="651" /> landed match the quotas which they were allocated.  That is the point at issue.</P>
      <P>The problem, which the Deputy identified earlier, has been that up to now there was insufficient control, particularly in the landing state.  There are insufficient checks by the flag state on its vessels.Most of them are registered in the UK and, therefore, the UK authorities have a responsibility.We have a responsibility because it is occurring in Irish waters.  We are taking on board that responsibility but we are trying to find a practical solution to this problem in the short term.  If the rules of the game are changed at a later date at the Intergovernmental Conference, a referendum is held and some issue is dealt with by the people, that is fine by me but in the meantime the rules state that there should be an economic link between the flagship and the flag state, on which it is the responsibility of the flag state to insist.  There is also a responsibility on the flag state to ensure that those vessels do not over fish their quotas and the state in which the fish are landed reports accurately the landings of those vessels.</P>
      <P>We have endeavoured to highlight the issue at EU level and press for greater co-operation and control.  We can do all the shouting we like in relation to our dislike of flagships, but until we change the treaties and the Intergovernmental Conference deals with this issue I have the responsibility of insisting that nobody is allowed to flout the law by over fishing in Irish waters.  I am endeavouring to do that.</P>

      <P>I am proud the Irish authorities are insisting that people adhere to the law.  If Ireland did not raise this issue about the landing state, nothing would be done about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Deasy has identified the problem.  I was trying to do so before he arrived in the Chamber but it did not suit some people to hear what I was saying because of the little bit of press coverage which they might get in telling the Minister what to do.  Deputy Deasy is right.  If there are proper controls in the landing state which accurately records catches, undersized fish, etc., and it cooperates with the flag state and the coastal state involved, this issue will be resolved.  We have made it clear not only to Spain but to all member states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we will continue to insist that EU inspectors visit the landing states without any warning to carry out spot checks on landings. If it is discovered the law has been broken, the landing state should be heavily penalised.  I agree with Deputy Deasy in respect of how the matter should be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure Deputy Molloy that we will not cease our efforts on the flagship issue.  I do not believe the process of granting flags of convenience should be allowed to continue.  If someone is determined to purchase a business in a member state, he should do so in accordance with the rules and regulations.  There should be a clear economic connection and relationship with the flag state.  We will insist this takes place.  To allay the <Col N="653" /> Deputy's fears, I inform him that we have no intention of going soft on those who flout the law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) require applicants to give notice of the application by the erection or fixing of a site notice which shall be easily visible and legible by persons using the nearest public road,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to amendment No. 7 in his reply to an earlier amendment and proffered a number of reasons for not accepting it.  Given that he stated the procedures for the allocation of aquaculture licences would be based on the general system applied under the terms of the An Bord Pleanála legislation, I thought it would be appropriate that a similar requirement to that which applies in respect of applications for planning permission should apply to aquaculture licences.</P>
      <P>I note the Minister of State's argument against this proposal but I recall tabling a similar amendment in the 1970s when the An Bord Pleanála legislation was debated in the House.  That amendment was rejected by the then Minister for the Environment, as were subsequent amendments to other legislation dealing with planning. However, in recent times, it has become usual to see notices covered with strong plastic for protection against the elements placed in prominent positions on sites and in fields to inform local people that there is an intention to undertake developments.  Members of the public are thereby given the opportunity to inspect plans relating to such developments, make comments and raise objections if they so desire.  People are now provided with more adequate notification than was previously given by way of public notices in newspapers.The new system has proven very effective.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago, a previous Minister for the Environment rejected an amendment which dealt with planning matters and which was similar to that under discussion.  However, the relevant legislation was subsequently amended.  Even though the Minister of State may choose to reject amendment No. 7, it may become law in the future.  Why not accept it now as a reasonable proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aquaculture developments, because of their nature, will be located on the more remote parts of the coastline to which it is difficult to gain access.  People living in such areas do not always have access to newspapers.  There should be a requirement that a notice must be erected on roads approaching the shoreline from where a development will be serviced, given that there is usually a point from where goods, feed, equipment, etc., are transported to the location at sea and where support facilities, such as sheds for storing meal and maintaining equipment and spares, are situated.  It would be reasonable to <Col N="655" /> require interested parties to erect a notice similar to a planning application notice in locations where it is proposed to construct buildings to service possible aquaculture developments so that people could be alerted.  These developments will be situated in remote areas and every effort should be made to inform local people of their planned construction.  Amendment No. 7 would be a good way to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am sympathetic to having the widest possible public notice procedures, including road signage, at the nearest point to proposed developments, there are practical difficulties in applying such a provision to all applicants.</P>
      <P>The circumstances relating to aquaculture licensing differ from those which apply to planning applications.  It would be problematic to erect a notice on property not belonging to the applicant.  This would be unlike planning applications where the applicant would most likely be the owner of or have a beneficial interest in the sites proposed for development.  Furthermore, access to sites is often gained at a distance from the operation.  In such cases, signage at the access point would not be helpful to residences which overlook the development site but which are situated some distance from that access point.  In short, there are too many potential difficulties in attempting to enshrine the minutiae of these procedures in primary legislation.</P>
      <P>On the points raised by Deputy Molloy, acceptance of his amendment would require the erection of a notice visible to and legible by persons using the nearest public road which, in the case of aquaculture operations at sea, would pose obvious practical difficulties.  For example, an aquaculture development, say, in Killary Harbour, where the nearest public road may be on the Galway side of the harbour might have implications for the Mayo side.  Therefore, placing the public notice on the Galway side of the harbour may not have any practical relevance or benefit those living on the other side.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the circumstances which would arise in the case of land-based aquaculture development, which would include any development in fresh-water.  In respect of a fresh-water development there is a requirement to apply for planning permission and the planning application would be notified by the erection of a sign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to make provision for reforms of public signage under the application regulations in instances where it is considered appropriate or desirable, but there are circumstances in which practical difficulties would be encountered, when it would be unwise to enshrine in primary legislation a requirement that, in all circumstances, a sign must be erected on the nearest public road which may not relate to the location or the visual impact of the development.  The best <Col N="656" /> way to overcome any such difficulty would be to make appropriate provision in the application regulations.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage some Members requested that I review the provision relating to the composition of a quorum in the case of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board.  My objective in tabling this amendment was to assuage any concerns, perceived or otherwise, about the impartiality of the board in terms of its composition or deliberations.It is vital that the board commands the confidence of all interests and that there be no ground for any interest to have even a perception that the balance of representation and quorum arrangements for meetings are in any way biased.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for acceding to our strong arguments on Committee Stage, that there would be perceived to be a clear bias if the chairperson or the member representing the aquaculture industry had to be present for the purposes of establishing a quorum.  The removal of those words from the section removes any such remote possibility of bias.  It is important that that be done and I thank the Minister for having taken this action.</P>

      <P>I thought I had accommodated Deputy Molloy's concerns on this matter on Committee Stage by inserting a new subsection. As the section stood, the provision for annual reports mirrored a similar provision in legislation generally.

      <P>In page 30, to delete lines 34 and 35 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) The Board may, on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister, make submissions or recommendations to the Minister on any matter relating to its functions or to licensing (including trial licensing) policy.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to give the appeals board a statutory role to make submissions or recommendations on licensing policy in addition to any matter relating to its functions. I have referred specifically to &ldquo;trial licensing&rdquo; in the light of concerns expressed by Members on that subject.  The mechanism provided here leaves it open to the appeals board to act on its own initiative or for the Minister to take the initiative.</P>
      <P>I have deliberately strengthened this provision to give the appeals board a statutory role in licensing policy, particularly in regard to trial licences.  I can place on record my assurance that not only will the letter but the spirit of the law be applied here.  It is not intended, nor will it be the case, that the trial licence mechanism will be used as a measure to circumvent full licensing requirements.Permissions for trials always will be temporary with no guarantee that the trial development can move to permanent licensing.</P>
      <P>As in the case of all other aquaculture developments, the full requirements of the new licensing process, including appeals mechanisms and provisions for judicial review, will apply in full should a trial licensee wish to proceed to permanent licensing.</P>

      <P>Section 74 makes provision for the orderly consideration of licence applications already in hand.  I do not accept that applications not fully processed on commencement of the new licensing and regulatory regime should have to go back to square one.  It is proposed that they will be deemed to be applications and subject to licensing and appeal under the new legislation.  To require licence applicants to start all over again would be unfair and unnecessary given that the licences will be issued under the terms of the new legislation and will be subject to appeal.</P>

      <P>It is not my desire or intention to go back over debates we had on Committee Stage on a point such as this where the matter was well debated.  The points I made then are still valid. By tabling the amendment on Report Stage I was hoping the Minister would have had time to reflect and possibly agree to make some alteration to accommodate the point I made.  In reply to a question, the Minister informed us there were 800 applications for aquaculture licences which had not been determined.  They are in the Department and on the passing of this Bill all those applications will be considered to be applications and will be processed accordingly.  The difficulty arose when I asked the Minister <Col N="661" /> whether any of those 800 cases had already commenced operations and the Minister said some had.</P>
      <P>People are operating aquaculture enterprises without a licence and the Minister is going to accept them under the provisions of this Bill.  In my view many of those are in contravention of section 11 which provides that any application for a licence for an enterprise that has already commenced operations shall not be a valid application.The Minister has not made reference to that point which we made continously on Committee Stage.  It is still a valid point and perhaps some provision could be made to accommodate the difficulty but the procedures of the new legislation should apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal position is tricky.  As was pointed out on Committee Stage, legal opinion has been offered which states that arising from the Supreme Court judgment in the Ballyvaughan case, those who were granted licences for aquaculture activities in sea water did not hold valid licences because under section 15 of the principal Act licences could only be granted for such activities in freshwater.  We discussed this at great length and the Minister has maintained his position.I tabled the amendment again because I thought in the intervening period the Minister of State might add to points made on Committee Stage.  He offered to examine them and has proved on a number of occasions to be reasonable and co-operative in regard to views expressed by Opposition spokespersons.</P>
      <P>I do not want to put people out of business who consider they were operating legitimately with licences issued to them under section 15 but provision could be made for an interim period to enable them to operate while reapplying to have their licences renewed under this Bill so that they would be brought into line with everybody else. Officials in the Department did not have the authority under the principal Act to grant licences for aquaculture activities in sea waters as determined by the Supreme Court.  The Minister of State's view is that the only licences struck down are the cases specifically brought before the Supreme Court.  However, it decided on a principle and if this is extended to all others who benefited from the same licensing procedures under section 15, their licences must also be struck down as they were illegally granted.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has taken a different view and it puzzles me how he can justify that in law. Has he anything to add?</P>

      <P>The position is clear.  Aquaculture operations that currently hold licences will <Col N="663" /> remain valid under the Bill.  That is normal practice when new legislation is introduced.  The licences will then be subject to the terms of the Bill and will remain valid for the remaining life of the licence.  Any licence which has been struck down by the courts will not become a licence under the Bill and operations which are not licensed will not be automatically licensed under it.  Any person who does not have a licence has to apply for one and follow the normal procedures.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said a licence that is not valid because the courts struck it down remains invalid, and a licence validly issued before the Bill will remain valid.  If persons operating illegally do not apply for a licence before the Bill is enacted, they will be precluded from applying.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>In regard to section 81, there is concern that the inspectorate provided for in the Bill will come under the umbrella of the Department.There is a view that those who will be charged with the responsibility of carrying out inspections and enforcing the provisions of the Bill should be independent of the Minister in the exercise of their functions.  The independence of An Bord Pleanála is one of the major principles which has helped to win public support for the planning process.</P>
      <P>Section 81 states that a person employed by the Marine Institute may be appointed as an authorised officer for any of the purposes for which an officer of the Minister may be appointed as an authorised officer under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1995, as amended by this Bill.  He or she will have extensive powers.  In addition to any other powers he or she may have under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1995, as amended by this Bill, he or she will have the power to enter any place or waters the subject of an aquaculture licence or trial licence on or in which he or she believes, on reasonable grounds, aquaculture is being or has been carried on, or any building or structure used in connection with such place, waters or aquaculture to ensure the terms of the licence are being properly adhered to.  Will the Minister of State indicate that that person will be independent of the Department and the Minister in the exercise of his or her functions and powers and seen to be so by those involved on both sides of the industry?I am not questioning the integrity of the officials who will be charged with the responsibility of carrying out these duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised two questions, one being the establishment of an independent inspectorate.  Because of the range of conditions which may be attached to an aquaculture licence a range of officers of the Department or its agencies will be involved in inspecting aquaculture operations.  For example, engineering staff of the Department will inspect structures placed on the foreshore while officers of the Marine Institute, specifically those attached to the Fisheries Research Centre, will be involved in issues relating to disease and fish husbandry.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Committee Stage, fisheries boards will retain their existing functions under the Fisheries Acts.  Those functions will not be diminished by this Bill.  They have certain functions in relation to the aquaculture industry.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Molloy may be aware, the Fisheries Research Centre was part of the Department of the Marine until the beginning of last year when it was transferred to the Marine Institute.  Its officers will be responsible for monitoring many aspects of this legislation.  As they are employed by the Marine Institute, it is necessary to make special provision to make it clear that they will have these powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Institute is a separate body with its own board and reporting structures.  It is not <Col N="665" /> under the day to day direction of the Minister.  I am satisfied that its officers will be seen to be independent in the monitoring and supervision of the aquaculture industry and the licensing regime. Experience shows &mdash; this view is shared by all concerned in the aquaculture industry &mdash; that officers of the fisheries boards, the Marine Institute and the Department have discharged their supervisory functions with integrity.  This has not been questioned in any way.</P>
    <P>Under one of the amendments agreed to today, the licence appeals board will have a wider remit in relation to licensing policy generally.  It will be able to examine particular matters and make recommendations.  All sides of the House are satisfied with its composition.  We have ensured that the appeals system and the mechanism for the supervision, overseeing, monitoring and inspection of the industry will be seen to be independent.</P>
    <P>I express my sincere appreciation and thanks to Members who have contributed to the passage of this Bill.  It is a major legislative landmark in fisheries legislation which will modernise and streamline licensing and regulation of the aquaculture industry in line with best practice in the planning and environmental spheres.  My objective has been to ensure an effective, secure and fully transparent licensing process which has full regard for all interests.  The Bill will be regarded in future years as a watershed in the development of the aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>The debate in the House has been very useful in considering the various and sometimes divergent views of interested parties and represents an important part of the analysis of the respective needs of the aquaculture industry and other users of our marine and freshwater resources.  I have no doubt that the Bill has been improved as a result.  I have been able to address satisfactorily many of the concerns expressed by Deputies as well as by individuals and groups who made representations to me.  I thank all those outside the House who took the trouble to examine the Bill and propose improvements, many of which I have been able to accommodate.</P>
    <P>The framework that has now emerged for future aquaculture licensing sets out clearly the checks and balances at work in the system.  The rights of applicants, licensees, objectors and appellants are clearly delineated in the interests of making the licensing system and its processes open and accessible.</P>
    <P>I thank Members who contributed to the debate, particularly the Opposition spokespersons, and the officers of the Department of the Marine involved in the preparation of this Bill who engaged in an extensive consultative process with the various interests involved in the industry and those associated with it to produce what I believe is fine legislation.</P>

Níl aon dabht ach go bhfuil athrú mór ar an mBille anois seachas an Bille a tháinig os comhair an Tí nuair a foilsíodh é ar dtús.  Táim ag glacadh buíochais leis an Aire mar gur éist sé linn sa Dáil agus gur éist sé leis na grúpaí a tháinig chuige ón taobh amuigh a raibh imní mór orthu faoi rudaí a bhí sa Bhille ar dtús.</P>

Tá sé fíor-riachtanach go mbeadh rialacha cinnte leagtha síos a chaithfeadh tionscal na bhfeirmeacha éisc cloí leo mar tá an tionscal chomh tábhachtach sin agus d'fhéadfadh sé fás chomh mór sin.  Tá na mílte daoine ag obair sa tionscal ach d'fhéadfadh i bhfad níos mó daoine fostaíocht a fháil ann.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfeicfidh siad sa Bhille seo seans don tionscal dul chun cinn a dhéanamh le tacaíocht ó gach taobh.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé deireadh leis an aighneas a bhí ann go dtí seo agus leis an imní agus leis an amhras a bhí ar lucht na slat éisc de bharr truailliú agus de bharr a tharla do white trout mar a ghlaotar orthu agus an dainséar a bhí ann go gcuirfí deireadh leis an iasc sin.</P>

Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht gach páirtí taobh thiar den Bhille agus den tionscal atá rialaithe faoin mBille.  Tá súil agam nach mbeidh aon easaontas nó aighneas ar an gceist seo amach anseo.

    <P>I thank the Minister of State for the great effort he put into this Bill which is good and balanced. Members of the public who have been concerned about this issue, the lack of transparency in the licensing system and the lack of an appeals system will be happy with the fair and equitable system being put in place for determining the grant of aquaculture licences.  While much of the debate has concentrated on fin fish farming, we should not forget the huge potential in shellfish farming, which is also covered by the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (3) (a), line 40, to delete &ldquo;not exceeding 12 months&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not less than 12 months and not greater than 2 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The philosophy behind this amendment is to provide that, in connection with serious syringe offences, there would be mandatory or minimum sentences.  The reason for this is to ensure that society's abhorrence of syringe offences is expressed in legislation and imposed as a statutory imperative by the courts.  The Minister's proposals are to the effect that on summary conviction a person would be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or both.  Our proposal is that the term of imprisonment would be not less than 12 months and not greater than two years.  The Minister proposes, in cases where the conviction is on indictment, that the term of imprisonment be for a term not exceeding five years, whereas we propose that the term of imprisonment would be not less than five years and not more than seven years.</P>
      <P>In relation to the offence of, without lawful excuse, making a threat by any means intending the other to believe it will be carried out, to kill or to cause serious harm to that other or a third person, we propose that the sentence, where it is on summary conviction, should be for a term not less than 12 months and not more than two years, and where the conviction is on indictment, a term of imprisonment not less than ten years and not more than 12 years.  In relation to various other offences set out in this legislation dealing with syringe attacks, we consistently propose minimum mandatory sentencing.</P>
      <P>I am aware there is considerable opposition in some quarters to the concept of mandatory sentencing and that the discretion, where sentencing is concerned, should always be allowed to rest with the Judiciary.  It is not true, however, that this is postulated on any correct notion of the separation of powers.  Minimum sentencing, or mandatory sentencing, does not in any way transgress the separation of powers which is a fundamental part of our democracy.  I am satisfied that minimum or mandatory sentencing would not have any constitutional overtones in that it is allowed by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our current law mandatory sentencing is allowed.  In cases of murder, society is entitled to express its abhorrence of that crime by providing for a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment in the event of an individual being found guilty of <Col N="670" /> murder.  In addition, a provision was made in the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, for minimum or mandatory sentencing whereby the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána carried a mandatory sentence of 40 years' imprisonment.  There are other examples under the customs consolidation Acts of sanctions which are minimum or mandatory.</P>
    <P>The only question for the House is whether it intends to provide for mandatory sentencing in cases of serious syringe attacks.  There is a strong argument in favour of mandatory sentencing in respect of these particular offences.  There has been a growth in syringe attacks over the past number of years.  The last recorded figures indicate that in excess of 1,200 attacks occurred.  That is serious and I have little doubt that when the 1996 and 1997 figures become available, they will indicate that the prevalence of these vicious offences in our society has increased.  In those circumstances, it is clear that society has the right to respond swiftly, adequately and harshly.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes forgotten that the victims of these kinds of offences go through harrowing ordeals.  We have heard stories of people in taxis, in small retail outlets or on the streets being attacked by individuals with syringes.  Sometimes these individuals do not use the syringe but threaten the victim with it.  If the syringe is used, the victim is left in a considerable amount of difficulty and distress, and it takes a long period before the victim learns if he or she has been infected.</P>
    <P>Criminal thugs who use syringes on the streets of this city and elsewhere need to learn a salutary lesson.  They need to know, as a fact, that if they do it they face imprisonment for a certain time. It may seem to some people that the punishments I advocate in amendments I put forward to this legislation are harsh, but they are nothing in comparison to the trauma and distress suffered by victims.It is in that context and in a spirit of good faith that I put forward the amendments.  Over the past two and a half years I have not often proposed minimum sentences &mdash; it has been the exception rather than the rule.  The other occasion on which I did that, and will again this evening in the debate on a later Bill, was in the area of drug trafficking where I proposed a ten year minimum sentence for those found in possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more with intent to supply.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the argument sometimes advanced that a harsh punishment for an offence will not deter people from committing an offence. This is arrant nonsense.  If the punishment is harsh, if it reflects the seriousness of the offence which has been committed, and if an accused person realises this will be the certain punishment, there is no doubt but that it will result in a reduction in offences.  Now is the time to clamp down on such offences which are a relatively new phenomenon here.  Four years ago there were approximately 300 offences, the following year there were 500, and this has since risen to 1,200. <Col N="671" /> There is danger of an epidemic of such offences on the streets of this city unless swift and adequate action is taken.</P>
    <P>The legislative measures I have put before the House are required to eliminate this scourge from our society.  If the warning is not taken, if the Government refuses to provide for minimum sentences for such offences, society will be entitled to ask why, and it will be entitled to know the answer which will be that the political will did not exist within the Government to ensure that sanctions would be provided in statute law to reflect the seriousness of the offences committed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is proposing amendments to the penalties provided for in sections 6, 7 and 8 covering syringe offences, section 9 covering the coercion offence, and section 10 dealing with harassment or, as it is commonly known, stalking.  His proposals on each are as follows: (1) to create minimum sentences; (2) to increase the maximum penalty on summary conviction from one year to two years; and (3) to increase the maximum penalty on indictment to two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister has provided in this Bill for a range of sentences to reflect the seriousness of the offences concerned.  In relation to the offences to which these amendments refer, the maximum possible penalties range from five years to life imprisonment.  The penalties proposed in the Bill are tough and proportionate to the crimes to which they relate.</P>
      <P>The first aspect of Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment, increasing the punishment for summary offences to two years imprisonment, is unacceptable.  There are constitutional limits to the penalties which can be imposed if an offence is to be triable summarily.  While the courts have not pronounced on the specifics of the upper limit, it is generally accepted that a two year maximum sentence for a summary offence is unsafe.  It would take the offence in question out of the category of minor offence, which is the only type of offence which, under the Constitution, may be tried in courts of summary jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue proposes also a range of minimum sentences.  Ministers for Justice have, over the years, generally opposed mandatory penalties on the grounds that it is more appropriate for the Oireachtas to provide maximum penalties and for the courts, having heard all of the circumstances, to impose appropriate sentences up to the maximum limit.  As I have indicated, the Minister is providing in relation to the most serious offences, such as intentionally injuring someone with a contaminated syringe, that the courts can impose up to life imprisonment.  There is provision for an appeal to be taken against unduly lenient sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Law Reform Commission has published a report on sentencing which addresses the issue of minimum sentences, <Col N="672" /> among other aspects of sentencing policy.  That report is under consideration in the Department. The commission recommends not only that the Legislature refrain from the introduction of minimum sentences but that any existing minimum sentences be abolished.  The Minister is, therefore, not prepared to accept Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment in this respect.</P>
    <P>The third aspect of Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments concerns the increase by two years of the maximum penalty possible on conviction on indictment for the offences concerned.  The Minister has carefully examined these proposals. Without going into detail, those proposals relate to amendments Nos. 18 and 23.  When we get to that stage I will, if it is acceptable, read the proposals into the record and have the Bills Office draft the necessary amendment.  If I may, I will read that now.</P>

      <P>It is the intention to replace Opposition amendment No. 18 by deleting &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;7&rdquo; in subsection (4) (b), page seven, line 49.  That partly meets what Deputy O'Donoghue is seeking.  It is also intended to replace Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment No. 23 by deleting &ldquo;5&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;7&rdquo; in page nine, line 14, subsection (6) (b).</P>

      <P>This is a particularly important Bill.  I appreciate that the Minister is increasing the sentences and providing for reasonably substantial sentences.  The point Deputy O'Donoghue is making is that the use of syringes is becoming increasingly common, particularly in disadvantaged areas where people are regularly under threat of violence.  Threatening someone with a syringe is just the same as using a gun except that the victim does not necessarily know the outcome for some time.  Unfortunately people are prepared to ensure that a victim suffers the greatest possible damage by using blood in syringes &mdash; I am aware that sometimes syringes contain just coloured liquid so that the victim is frightened, but he or she will not know for a long time what has happened.</P>
      <P>This is something that must be rooted out of society.  We cannot tolerate such behaviour.  Only last night in my constituency an 83 year old woman was attacked viciously by drug addicts seeking money.  She could not be allowed the decency of a peaceful life in a fine community. Someone stalked her, followed her to her house, broke in, tied her up and beat her in the process for a paltry £10 or £20.  That is the kind of society that is out there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says it is generally accepted that in the context of the Constitution a minimum sentence of two years would be unsafe for a summary conviction.  I have been listening to that argument for many years, but when it was made before <Col N="673" /> there was a much calmer atmosphere in society generally, a better environment, safer streets. Now we are faced with the huge challenge posed by drugs, one that has not yet been overcome.  In my community reasonable progress is being made and it is hoped that will continue.  Fianna Fáil has a major programme to follow through in that area.  We hope to be in a position to do so after the next general election.  This is a major problem for people who cannot live a reasonable and respectable life.  In the middle of all that we are told that the proposed minimum sentence is too great for a summary case.  It used to be that a fine of £1,000 was too great for a summary case, but that was increased to £1,500.  We need to test the case for increasing minimum penalties.  If it is accepted that we should increase minimum sentences, they may as well be imposed at District Court level.  People who use syringes to threaten, injure and possibly kill need to know that when they come before the courts they will receive swift justice.</P>
    <P>There is savage warfare and the gardaí must be there to stop it.  There is a high incidence of crime in my constituency.  Many housing estates have been built in the area and drug dealers have moved into some of them.  I am contacted on a regular basis about those people and the Garda know where they are, but they do not have the manpower to cover that work.  We must reconsider the allocation of members of the force to those districts.  Gardaí do marvellous work, facing down criminals and trying to get information, but they are not able to cope with the problem because they do not have the resources.</P>
    <P>We must help the Garda in its fight against crime.  The proposals put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue are aimed at strengthening the hands of the Garda and the community against the criminal.  If the people who reject those proposals lived with us and saw the position they would quickly change their attitude.  They would not tolerate a situation where parents cannot allow their teenage children out on the streets, as is the case in communities throughout Dublin. We must do what we can to change that position, otherwise we are not doing our job.  There is no point saying that a two year prison sentence may not be acceptable in legal circles, that one year might be acceptable but that two years might be too long.  We must reconsider the way we deal with those problems, otherwise we are wasting our time.</P>
    <P>Unless the Garda has support in the legislation to crack down on criminals, we will not win this battle, and we must win it.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the attitude adopted by him and the Minister to this matter.  They should realise that people want swift action and real justice.They want crime tackled at the roots by having syringes regarded as lethal weapons.  I accept the Minister has gone some way towards meeting the pleadings of Deputy O'Donoghue in the past year and a half or so on this issue, but the <Col N="674" /> response should not be too little too late.  It is already too late &mdash; we should have moved much faster &mdash; but it should not be too little.  The Minister should either accept Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments or consider them for Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister's view that there would be a constitutional difficulty with a court of summary jurisdiction imposing a sentence of two years.  It is important to realise that the jurisdiction of the District Court has been extended considerably in recent years, not only on the civil side.  For example, a district justice may disqualify a person from driving for a period of two years because the individual was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. That is only one of a number of examples I could give.</P>
      <P>It is important to spell out what we are speaking about.  I propose that a person who injures another by piercing the skin of that person with a syringe or threatens to so injure another with a syringe with the intention of causing that person to believe that he or she may become infected with disease as a result of the injury caused or threatened should, on summary conviction, be given a minimum prison sentence of 12 months and, on indictment, where the offence is even more serious, a minimum sentence of ten years.</P>
      <P>I propose that a person who has with him or her in any place a syringe or any blood in a container, intended by him or her unlawfully to cause or threaten to cause injury to or to intimidate another, should, on summary conviction, be given a minimum prison sentence of 12 months and, on indictment, a minimum sentence of seven years.  I propose that a person who places or abandons a syringe in any place in such a manner that it injures or is likely to injure, cause a threat to or frighten another should, on summary conviction, be given a minimum prison sentence of 12 months and, on indictment, a minimum sentence of five years.</P>
      <P>I propose that a person who, with a view to compelling another to abstain from doing or to do any act which the other person has a lawful right to do or to abstain from doing, wrongfully and without lawful authority uses violence to or intimidates the other person or a member of the family of the other person, or injures or damages the property of the other person, or persistently follows the other person about from place to place, or watches or besets the premises or other place where the other person resides, works or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such premises or place, or follows the other person with one or more other persons in a disorderly manner in or through any public place should be given a minimum sentence of 12 months on summary conviction and, on indictment, a minimum of five years.  In regard to harassment, I propose that the minimum sentence should be 12 months and, on indictment, five years.  The Minister rejects all those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> I firmly believe that the general public would support the proposals I put forward as they are reasonable in the context of the offences about which we are speaking.  The legislation contains many admirable provisions.  In Fianna Fáil's Bill on aggravated robbery I specifically provided for minimum sentencing for syringe attacks.  There has been a significant increase in the number of such crimes in recent years and, unless something is done to arrest the problem, the graph will continue to indicate an increase.  If something is not nipped in the bud, particularly if it relates to a criminal offence resulting from the use of illegal drugs, it tends to become endemic in society.  In such circumstances, it would be remiss of me not to put these amendments to a vote.  Unless we provide for minimum sentencing for syringe attacks they will continue unabated and that would be a grave tragedy for the victims of such crime.</P>
    <P>Some of those victims recently described to me in horrifying detail the terror, fear, trauma and distress they and their families experienced as they waited to discover if they had been infected. The trauma experienced when faced with a blood filled syringe is similar to that experienced when a loaded gun is brandished in front of one's face. We must decide what to do about such attacks and it is of fundamental importance that a correct decision is made.  We should decide to impose a minimum sentence, particularly for syringe attacks.</P>
    <P>Society has the right to express its abhorrence at certain offences by providing for minimum sentencing.  This is not something I would advocate in all cases.  While I recognise the need for judicial discretion, judges stated recently that they would have imposed greater sentences if they were not constrained from doing so by precedent.The Judiciary is often labelled as being soft when imposing sanctions when it is merely administering the law of the land.  Precedent is frequently not appreciated by those who comment on or read about such cases.</P>
    <P>Mandatory sentencing has its drawbacks in that it removes the judicial discretion desirable in most cases.  In some cases society must directly decide how people should be punished if they behave in a certain manner.  We tend to make excuses for some criminals by claiming they come from dysfunctional families and were disadvantaged at birth.  Since time immemorial natural law has dictated there is not a human being born of full mind who does not know, having reached the age of reason, the difference between the right and wrong.  While I understand the underlying causes of crime must be tackled, individuals must be made realise they are responsible for their actions.  Many men and women from dysfunctional and disadvantaged families have gone on <Col N="676" /> to make tremendous contributions to their respective societies.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows it is a grave offence to wield a syringe in another person's face.  The individual wielding the syringe is also aware of that.  There is no objective reason society, through its elected representatives, should not make a decision to punish, with certitude, that type of offence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue is speaking to the converted.  The Minister for Justice appreciates the seriousness of the crime problem and has introduced a series of stringent measures to ensure law-abiding citizens have the right to walk the streets in peace.  The Bill is not soft on the type of criminal to which the Deputy referred. Deputy O'Donoghue, perhaps unwittingly, tended to suggest the cause of the crime problem rests with the Minister.  The society, of which we are all a part, is the cause of the problem.  Those inside and outside this House are collectively to blame for not dictating before now that we should act in a different fashion in regard to crime.  When the Minister came into office she had to tackle the problem to which Deputy O'Donoghue referred while at the same time ensuring the rule of law was not brought into disrepute by introducing unsafe measures.</P>
      <P>There are many examples of where it could have been deemed unconstitutional to impose particular penalties.  The last thing we need in the fight against crime is the introduction of a penalty that could ultimately be proven unsafe.  In those circumstances the criminals would win.  That is not what we are or should be about in this House. The maximum prison sentence proposed for injuring or threatening to injure with a syringe or for throwing blood at a person or threatening to do so is ten years.  I accept Deputy O'Donoghue's suggestion that we should send a message to criminals who threaten people with blood filled syringes.  That is what is proposed.  A prison sentence of ten years for that offence sends a clear message.  By suggesting something else the message might not be as clear.  A need is being addressed by this section.  The proposals are reasonable and adequate.  A penalty of ten years' imprisonment is substantial.  The Minister and the Department do not see any need to increase it.  If at some time in the future it appears an increase in that sentence would have a major impact, I am sure that could be done, but I do not believe that the would-be criminal considering the situation as presented at this stage will be dramatically changed as a result of suggesting one particular sentence or another.  The sentence proposed for this offence is quite severe and should have the effect of impeding the criminal sufficiently to convince him or her the route he or she proposes is not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I deny Deputy Woods's suggestion that the gardaí do not have the necessary resources and support to tackle the problem.  The reverse is the <Col N="677" /> case.  The Minister appreciates the problems faced by the gardaí at present.  The fight against modern organised and drug related crime has been in need of address for a long time.  In some parts of this city and country this problem was flagged many years ago by Members of this House, but it is only at this stage that the penny has dropped in society.  It took some considerable time before society recognised it was under attack and as a result this House had to respond in the strongest possible fashion.  That is what the Minister is doing.  I do not accept that the necessary resources are not being made available.  More resources and a greater concentration of gardaí are available than previously.  That has not happened because of a knee-jerk reaction but as a result of a careful and calculated study of the seriousness of the problem which led to the introduction of a series of measures, one of which is before us.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also suggested that neither the Minister nor the Department is aware of the situation.We all work in constituencies, some of which are close to Dublin city and others near major cities throughout the country.  It is not true &mdash; and unfair to suggest &mdash; that the Minister and the Department are not aware of the position. They are fully aware and have been aware of it for some time.  It is as a result of their awareness of the seriousness of the problem that these stringent and serious measures are being introduced. They are not the type of measures that would have been introduced in this House ten years ago. We should remember that we had to undergo a sea change to reach the stage we are at now. Some of us, like Deputy O'Donoghue, have been Members for some time and we witnessed the changes that have taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue suggested we should introduce maximum and mandatory sentences and he also suggested that judicial discretion could be removed in some cases, but it is no harm for that provision to be in place.  Minimum or maximum sentences when available can be handed down by judges on the day in question. They are in a better position than we are to make an appropriate decision in a case.  It is not always easy to make generalisations and to achieve the optimum by way of general application.</P>
    <P>The ten years' prison sentence proposed by the Minister is quite severe and the seven years' prison sentence for possession is also quite severe.  I <Col N="678" /> indicated what I proposed to do in lieu of accepting Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments Nos. 18 and 23.  That will go some way towards resolving the problem, meeting the concerns expressed by the Deputy and keeping within a reasonable guide from the point of view of dispensing justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be clear that the Minister for Justice is not proposing in this legislation that people found guilty of syringe attacks would receive a prison sentence of five, seven, ten years or 12 months.  Depending on the seriousness of the offence she is proposing that the court could impose a prison sentence of up to 12 months.  The prison sentence could be one, two or three months or a suspended sentence.  A prison sentence of up to five years could be one, two, three or four years or less than a year.  A prison sentence of up to seven years or up to ten years could be less than one year.  I propose that as a matter of certainty we lay down in the legislation the precise number of years a person should serve as a minimum.  That is the fundamental difference between the Minister and me on this matter.  It is a profound one.  It is a difference of philosophy as to how the sanction should be imposed by the court.  I say it should be mandatory, but the Minister says it should be discretionary.  Since I strongly believe the prison sentence should be mandatory for these vicious offences, I will be pressing my amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's simplified explanation of the amendment is not useful to the debate because it is a simplification.  I am not a lawyer, nor do I wish to be one, but it is difficult to understand how in all cases, regardless of the circumstances, Deputy O'Donoghue, as a lawyer, suggests the maximum penalty should apply.  I am sure he must have ample experience of successfully making the case that while circumstances may have appeared identical there were mitigating circumstances that had to be taken into account.  Hence, the Minister is quite correct in suggesting that the sentence should be up to a maximum period, and that it should be for the judges on the day to decide which should apply. That is the best and safest way of dispensing justice in such cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to the debate on this Bill brought about by the urgent necessity to respond to the ever increasing crime problem of which all Members are aware.  Far from apportioning blame to any person or persons, party or parties, it is important to be united in taking on those disposed to attacks with syringes, which is the objective of the Bill's provisions.  Unfortunately, as well as this insidious, invidious type of crime becoming so prevalent in recent years, it has also instilled fear in the public endeavouring to go about its everyday business.  The Minister for Justice has responded with the appropriate degree of severity and stringency, ensuring that the law will not be brought into disrepute and proving that she struck the right balance.</P>
      <P>It must also be borne in mind that nowadays, as befits the occasion, all our laws are subject to scrutiny in our lower and higher courts.  The Minister and all Members are aware that the ever increasing incidence of crimes of this nature must be responded to in a specific manner.  This objective has been achieved through the Bill in a manner which meets the requirements of the Minister and Opposition to the ultimate benefit of all.</P>
      <P>This Bill represents a milestone in the sense that it sends a clear signal to those disposed to commit the kind of offences covered by its provisions.It is timely that that message goes out to them in a measured form, thereby strengthening the law.  Its implementation, with a series of other measures introduced by the Minister over the past couple of years, will have a lasting impact on our legal system generally.</P>
      <P>When history comes to be written I foresee its recognition of the fact that we as a society recognised a sea change was imperative, particularly in regard to this ever increasing problem.  I remember listening to many contributions here when legislative provisions similar to those incorporated in this Bill would have been vehemently opposed.  Therefore, its passage highlights the fact that, as time moves on, we must respond to prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister and officials of her Department who hope that their hard work on its preparation will yield its merited rewards and objective.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, and the officials of the Department of Justice for their contributions to this significant Bill.  I had earlier introduced the Punishment of Aggravated Robbery Bill, 1997, which no doubt heralded the arrival of this Bill, something of which we on this side of the House can be duly proud.  I was disappointed <Col N="686" /> to discover that the Minister of State and the Government generally want to take all the credit whenever something is successful but, whenever blame is to be apportioned, do not accept it in equal measure.  While I suppose that is in the nature of democracy, sometimes it is rather difficult to swallow, especially in the case of a soul as sensitive as myself.</P>

      <P>Nonetheless, I thank all those who contributed to the Bill's successful passage.  Over the past two and a half years I have gained a considerable amount of experience of the difficulties involved in drafting legislation, especially when one is obliged to do so to give a lead.</P>
      <P>We have done a very good day's work on this Bill and I predict its provisions will be effective and of considerable importance in the future.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister did not accept minimum sentences in relation to very serious offences for which we were suggesting sanctions but, generally, I cannot complain, especially in relation to those parts which had been incorporated in my earlier one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill, as I was unavoidably absent when it was debated on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>It represents a welcome reform of the Offences Against the Person Act, described in 1883 as extremely clumsy; in 1991, it was deplored that so much of it remained in being.  Indeed one of its deficiencies was its failure to address modern-type crimes such as those perpetrated through syringe attacks.  It is indeed a welcome addition to our criminal law as the recent threat of infectious diseases transmitted by syringe attacks was a potent weapon in criminals' armoury.  I am indeed glad we have moved to close that loophole in the law.</P>
      <P>In particular I welcome the new offence of harassment in section 10, with its emphasis on serious interference with privacy which I am sure will be welcomed, by women in particular.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and her officials on its successful passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is moving this motion to highlight the neglect of our capital city and county by the present Administration.  We wish to draw attention to what needs to be done and the lack of progress being made.  This motion was necessary to point out that the Government has no coherent, integrated policy to tackle the difficulties facing the citizens of Dublin.</P>
      <P>In the midst of an economic boom and increased tax revenues, Dublin has fallen behind and been neglected by this Administration.The Minister for Equality and Law Reform knows that there is an appalling crime problem in Dublin and that the drugs problem is virtually out of control, particularly at night.  Dublin suffers from serious unemployment blackspots.  In some estates unemployment is as high as 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>Dublin's oppressive traffic, erratic and underfunded public transport and haphazard planning laws are all causing concern.  We are trying to develop a modern city and county fit for the citizens of the 21st century.  However, we have a city and county plagued by crime, unemployment, traffic gridlock, poor planning and poor public transport.  Dublin is desperately in need of an overall vision for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion calls for further investment in the transport and road infrastructure, the bringing forward of an effective management plan and the urgent completion of the Ring Road, link routes and by-passes.  It also calls for the provision of proper physical and environmental planning, the <Col N="688" /> ordering of a special study for the underground Luas option in the city centre and the completion of the light rail lines to Sandyford, Tallaght and Ballymun without delay.  We call for the introduction of measures to tackle Dublin's high unemployment rate and the public housing shortage which is increasingly evident.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is calling for more strategic investment in health and education services in the city and county, additional Garda resources to combat the drugs problem and crime and for the IDA and other State agencies to attract more industrial, tourist and service projects to Dublin. Measures should be undertaken to tackle traffic gridlock, with particular emphasis on the problems of taxis, late night buses and other public transport issues.</P>
    <P>I have called on many occasions for an independent study of the underground option for light rail.  No one believes that Luas will be able to share space with existing traffic.  It is physically impossible to give up two lanes in Dawson Street or Stephen's Green or one lane on either side of O'Connell Street and believe that this will alleviate the traffic problems.  It will make the situation worse, not just during construction but after the system is in place.  There needs to be a rethink of the city centre section of the light rail.</P>
    <P>A CIE study has stated that the underground option is too expensive.  However, people such as Dr. Garret FitzGerald have suggested otherwise. The unified proposal group, which studied the possibility of the underground option in the city centre, concluded that it would be cheaper over a number of years.  Whatever the accuracy of these statements, it is clear that the Government has commissioned no independent study into the cost of running Luas underground in the city centre. The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications consulted Mr. Maurice Doyle, former Governor of the Central Bank, on this matter.  I have seen no statements regarding the outcome of those consultations but I would be interested to know Mr. Doyle's view.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs to commission an independent study, separate from CIE or any of the consultancies attached to CIE.  This would provide us with the cost of this development over and above what is currently planned.  We will then know if the cost is significantly higher and whether the additional costs can be raised from Structural Funds, private investment or low interest bearing bonds.  There are a number of financial options which could bridge the funding gap.  There will be a gap but it will not be as large as has been speculated.This is one of the most important decisions facing Dublin city.</P>
    <P>During the construction phase of Luas, the Government should introduce a short Bill to establish a special controller.  This supremo would have the statutory obligation and authority to ensure that the construction of Luas, one of the largest projects ever undertaken in the city, does not become an unholy mess.  He would ensure that the various services co-ordinated their work <Col N="689" /> so that the construction phase flows smoothly.  He would also ensure that the public was informed of new traffic regulations and that timely announcements were made regarding street closures.If such an individual is not appointed, our present traffic problems will seem like chicken feed in comparison to what will happen during the construction of Luas.</P>
    <P>If this construction is not co-ordinated by order of the House, we will see road rage on an enormous scale and that will not be a pleasant sight.  I am calling for the appointment of a traffic supremo to oversee the construction of Luas in the city centre.</P>
    <P>The airport must be serviced either by the Luas system or by a heavy rail link.  We cannot continue to develop a major airport without also establishing a public transport link to the city centre.All political parties agree on that, but there must be the necessary political will to do it.  I question the wisdom of Aer Rianta spending millions of pounds on car parking facilities at the airport.There are now almost 40,000 car parking spaces.  Would it not be better for Aer Rianta to invest some of that money in a joint venture with CIE or other investors to provide a public transport link from the city?  We should demand that Aer Rianta invest in such a link.  It is not simply a matter for the Exchequer or CIE alone.  Aer Rianta should establish a better balance between the enormous rush to build car parking spaces and the building of a public transport link to the airport.  That should happen as a matter of urgency, as should the Luas extension from Dundrum to Sandyford, to which all sides of the House are committed.</P>
    <P>The suburban rail systems in general should be upgraded.  My colleague, Deputy Burke, informs me that the trains which service the north side of the city are overcrowded.  It is increasingly obvious that suburban trains require more investment and support.  Deputy Burke conducted a survey in his constituency recently and it showed that the public believes more attention should be paid to the upgrading of suburban railways to make them more efficient commuting instruments.</P>
    <P>The major roads project in the city is the ring road.  A substantial part of the road has been constructed but the Government is dragging its heels on completing it.  If the C route, as it is called, is to be built, it cannot be stopped after one half or two-thirds has been completed, nor can a gap be left in the road.  Otherwise, traffic will simply flow into housing estates.  The Government should apply more pressure to ensure the ring road is completed.  I understood construction would commence this year and that it would be ready by the end of 1998.  I am now told the completion date has been deferred by two or three years.  That happened by stealth because there was no announcement from the Government.  What is happening with this road and why is it not being completed?  Will the Minister ensure it is completed?We cannot go through four years with a <Col N="690" /> half finished ring route.  There are delays of up to half an hour at the end of the route at Firhouse during peak times.  It is critically important that this road, which was started many years ago, be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Many by passes have been promised for villages throughout the city.  Villages such as Dundrum have been promised bypasses to take traffic around them but there is no sign that these projects will go ahead.  The Government must ensure that link routes and bypasses are constructed.  The funding for this work has been available through the Structural Funds for years but the Government has delayed getting the job done.  If this work is completed it will make a substantial contribution to reducing the traffic problems in Dublin.My party will give every support to those projects if they can be progressed.  Can the Government explain why the completion of the ring route has been deferred for another two years?  Is that the final date or could the project be delayed further?</P>
    <P>There should also be better environmental planning.  Planning laws in the city and county must be better implemented and where stronger laws are necessary they should be provided.  One can still drive past buildings and wonder in awe how the builders got planning permission to build them.  No sensible person could sign their agreement to such buildings.  Anybody can see they should never have received planning permission. There are examples of such buildings throughout the city and county.  It is important that planning laws are implemented more strictly.</P>
    <P>The halting site programme is an important and controversial issue.  We must do our best to ensure halting sites are constructed sensibly following negotiations with local residents.  In the case of the Sandyford halting site, the Supreme Court criticised the county manager for not approaching its construction on a proper planning basis.  The judge did not go so far as to say the halting site programme should require planning permission, but he went close to it.  If the programme went through the planning process, there might be more progress on some sites.  The process could facilitate the public being involved in negotiations about the size and location of sites and it might lead to more progress on their construction.</P>
    <P>Planning permission should be required for the halting site programme.  It would ensure movement on the programme, which at present appears to be all but dead, and put it within a structure.  It is not legitimate, even if it is for the good cause of looking after the travelling community, to wantonly spoil the environment by not applying the planning laws to the way in which the halting site programme is managed.  We need to re-think our approach to this issue, not only for the sake of the travelling community but for the sake of the county's future development.  We cannot simply pick every green area and locate a halting site there just because the area is in public ownership.  There must be a proper planning process <Col N="691" /> with full consultation with the travelling community and settled residents.  One can only move forward in that manner.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters must be borne in mind in the development of Dublin city and county.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, has spoken many times about the crime and drugs problems in the city.  About 1,000 crimes are committed each week in the county and only one in three of those crimes is ultimately prosecuted.  A recent survey of 30,000 homes in Dublin south-east showed that 16,000 homes had been burgled in the previous two years.  That is a significant statistic which demonstrates the level of crime. The Government must ensure that the Garda Síochána and the laws are sufficiently strong to tackle that problem.  When I visit Garda stations in the course of my work as a public representative, I am told each station needs more motorcycles, cars and staff.  We cannot supply all their requirements but we must ensure such resources are targeted.  We must give gardaí the necessary resources to do their job.</P>
    <P>Dublin Port now handles about 40 per cent of the trade of the entire State.  It needs more investment planned on a long-term basis.  We need to make urgent decisions about the port access route and the tunnel.  There is too much prevarication on this matter.  Trucks heading to and from the port are clogging up the city.  If we do not make progress on the problem, it will get substantially worse.</P>
    <P>The DART runs until 11.30 p.m.  In a modern city heading into the 21st century, teenagers must queue for taxis at 2.00 a.m. because our public transport system is shut down.  We need to ensure that buses and the DART run until 2.00 a.m. or later.  There is no argument for shutting down at 11.30 p.m. and leaving hundreds of thousands of teenagers stranded, strolling home or queueing for taxis.  The Government should speak to the CIE Group about this matter and get some changes made as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The motion also asks the IDA to do more in the city and county.  It needs to plan its investment better and to introduce a programme for the Dublin area, outlining its potential investment plans for the future.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I met a deputation from Tallaght regional technical college, about which the Minister, Deputy Taylor, knows a great deal.  The college is anxious to increase student numbers.  Its intake is up about 40 per cent, compared to a national average of 7 per cent.  It is bulging at the seams and has asked for an extension to the premises, which will cost £7 million or £8 million, but has been unable to get a commitment from the Department of Education or the Department of Finance.  It appears they will be turning away pupils in the next academic session.  There are about 2,000 part-time and full-time pupils attending the college.  In the next four years, that figure will increase to 5,000.  I ask the Minister and his colleagues to look at the college's case. <Col N="692" /> Tallaght is a rapidly growing area which we on this side of the House have always supported in terms of the development of the Square, the regional technical college, the hospital and the Garda station.  We have been centrally involved in all of these issues.  It is important we invest in this project.</P>
    <P>In terms of the future of the city and county, a place such as Temple Bar needs to be carefully watched.  It can either be a jewel in the crown and extremely successful or it can turn out to be a disaster for the city and county.  This would be a pity.  The area needs to be policed and developed in a co-ordinated manner so that the original vision for the area, of a cultural centre with small commercial and residential units, accommodation etc., can be realised in an organised way.  If this happens, we will have a French quarter in the city.  If it does not, the area could become a major social blackspot in the future.  Some Government will have to remedy the problem and rescue the area.  I am not the only one to warn of this problem, many have done so in the past weeks.  We should be extremely careful in dealing with any problem which develops before it gets out of hand.  I have received disturbing reports about safety aspects.  It is a fine area which needs our full support.</P>
    <P>While the economy grows, this city has increased crime rates, major unemployment blackspots and oppressive traffic with which the Government has no proposals to deal.  It has haphazard planning laws and an underfunded public transport system.  All of these issues need vision and political willpower to make sure the city and county we pass on to the next generation will be one of which all of us can be proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Séamus Brennan for sharing his time with me.  He painted in broad brush strokes the need for actions to be taken in Dublin.  I will paint in small brush strokes and in greater detail the kind of problems we are suffering from, particularly in the inner city.</P>
      <P>I recently carried out a survey of the bus services in my constituency.  People are greatly dissatisfied with the level of service they are getting. Deputy Brennan told me this evening that as part of our policy we will carry out an examination into the proper provision of bus services.  The complaints on routes served by a number of buses are not as severe as those on routes serviced by one bus.  There are delays and people are jogged around in dangerous &ldquo;Imp&rdquo; buses.</P>
      <P>I ask the incoming Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, who I hope will be Deputy Brennan, to abolish these badly sprung and dangerous buses.  Passengers stand in them when they are not supposed to and people are thrown about.  I have received letters of complaint about this matter.  We need Cityswift buses, which operate on routes such as Blanchardstown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the people who are being neglected are those in the settled areas &mdash; older people who avail of free travel in areas like Captain's <Col N="693" /> Road and Cashel Road in Crumlin and Kimmage and parts of Drimnagh.  Dublin Bus seems not to be interested in providing a good service, although I hope I am wrong.  We sent out 25,000 questionnaires and we got a very good response from people.  The results have been forwarded to Dublin Bus for a response, which they have promised to give.</P>
    <P>I ask the incoming Taoiseach, who will I hope be Deputy Bertie Ahern, to appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for Dublin to deal with the problems of the city.  Dublin's inner city, particularly the south, is badly neglected.  For some reason, moneys seem to go to the suburbs. There are, of course, areas like Tallaght, in the Minister's constituency, which are in need of funding but some of the schools in the inner city have been horribly neglected.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in schools in disadvantaged areas which do not just involve children from the inner city going to schools across the canal in the Crumlin or Drimnagh areas or wherever they can be placed.  Classrooms are overcrowded and there are many children from problem families but there are no teacher counsellors. Such counsellors are needed in those areas. Unless we take the problems in the city seriously, there will be dreadful difficulties in the future. Substantial investment is required.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting last night with my constituency colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, Deputy Upton and Deputy Eric Byrne, of the Rialto Development Association.This marvellous organisation runs a day care centre and it intends to make a submission soon for approximately £0.75 million.  It counsels people with drug problems and the Eastern Health Board has provided funds.  The organisation works under difficult circumstances, providing drug counselling in an inadequate setting. Money is required for this service and a proper community hall for a large population.  The level of voluntary participation is enormous and it involves marvellous people.  I have represented the constituency since 1981 and there has always been a good level of participation in every aspect of community life, particularly in the Rialto-Dolphin's Barn area.  These people need encouragement and the Government would get a huge return on an investment of £1 million in terms of lower crime rates, fewer drug problems and increased counselling.</P>
    <P>Another major problem in Dublin city is water pressure.  I received a letter today from a lady who said that she gets one and a quarter pints of water from the kitchen tap at a time and the water supply then comes in a tiny trickle or just drops.  It takes another five minutes before she can get any more water.  If the toilet is flushed it takes an hour and ten minutes for the cistern to refill and there is no water in the kitchen tap in the meantime.  Her mother is elderly and in very bad health.  She can only do housework at night or on Saturdays and it is a constant battle to get water from the tap from the time she returns from <Col N="694" /> work until she goes to bed.  If she had a washing machine she would be unable to use it.</P>
    <P>Water pressure in different parts of Dublin, such as Walkinstown and Terenure, is a dreadful problem and almost 50 per cent of the water leaks from the pipes.  The European Union has said no more funding will be provided for new pipes until the existing leaks are repaired.  The Government has embarked on a scheme which will take up to five years to complete.  However, these problems must be addressed and a policy decision to do something about them must be made.</P>
    <P>Massive refurbishment of the Oliver Bond flats complex has been carried out and Deputies who represent rural constituencies should visit this area to see what has been done.  People no longer want to leave the complex and others are queuing up to live there.  The flats complex in Dolphin's Barn in my constituency has had its problems but it has a good committee.  The community is relatively settled but people continue to apply to the corporation for rehousing.  However, if £5 million was spent on a proper refurbishment plan, people would want to stay there.  I attended a meeting of the committee yesterday and it agreed that if proper refurbishment was carried out people would remain in the complex and others would want to move there.  We will get nowhere unless that type of investment is made.  There is an old saying that &ldquo;the poor are always with us&rdquo; but these problems will always be with us unless action is taken.</P>
    <P>Plans for a war on poverty and suggestions on how to reduce it have been mooted.  It has been said that Ireland has one of the worst poverty problems in Europe but the return on a relatively small investment in the flats complexes would result in huge savings relative to the cost of building more houses to accommodate the people who want to leave these areas.  I do not blame those people and Dublin Corporation must be given the money to address this issue.</P>
    <P>The facilities for inner city schools are diabolical.Schools in areas such as Basin Lane have no gymnasiums or proper facilities for pupils.  The Christian Brothers who run that school do a magnificent job.  The premises are painted and clean but funding for schools in the south inner city is grossly inadequate.  If we want to solve the problems in the city, the flats complexes must be refurbished and teacher counsellors must be provided in schools for children with problem parents.Most problem children come from a home with problem parents who need assistance which the State is unable to provide.  Proper bus services must also be provided for these areas and my colleagues agree with my points about the water pressure problems.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for surveillance cameras, such as those on O'Connell Street.  Civil liberties people object to the use of surveillance cameras but crime would diminish if such cameras were placed where the roads meet at the South Circular Road and towards Crumlin and Dolphin's Barn Bridge.  Traders in the area favour cameras <Col N="695" /> and such an investment should be made because the return would be substantial.</P>
    <P>The Government should also consider the inner tangent route to remove traffic from the centre of the city.  There were plans for such a route some years ago but the usual people objected to them.  I remember the objections to the motorway through the Liberties on Clanbrassil Street.  The people who protested were led by <i>The Irish Times</i> but the road is magnificent.  The air is cleaner and new apartment blocks have been built in the area.  The inner tangent route is opposed by the same people and it will take a Government with gumption and guts to decide to build the road.  In the short-term people think such plans are terrible but in the long-term they recognise it was the right move and their areas were not destroyed.  There will be gridlock in the city until a proper inner tangent route is developed.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Brennan about Luas.  I have had grave misgivings about the project for some time because it will make the problem worse.  The underground option must be considered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the achievements of the Government in promoting the social and economic development of the Dublin region and, in particular,</P>
      <P>&mdash; notes that the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994 to 1999, provides for investment in excess of £600 million in transport infrastructure in Dublin;</P>
      <P>&mdash; notes that water and sewerage schemes for the greater Dublin area, with a final estimated cost of more than £400 million, were included in the Department of the Environment's water and sewerage services capital works programmes for 1997;</P>
      <P>&mdash; notes the very significant positive impacts which Dublin has experienced under the urban renewal schemes, particularly in Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks area which is now to be subsumed into the regeneration initiative for the much wider dockland area;</P>
      <P>&mdash; supports the Government commitment to construct the core light rail system to Ballymun, Cabinteely and Tallaght recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative and welcomes the practical initiatives which have been taken to implement that commitment as quickly as possible;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" />&mdash; notes the significant range of measures which are now in place to tackle long-term unemployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the progress made in meeting social housing needs in the Dublin area and welcomes the Government's recent commitment to the comprehensive redevelopment and regeneration of the Ballymun estate;</P>
    <P>&mdash; commends the Government for the sustained and wide ranging improvements in the health and personal social services implemented in Dublin;</P>
    <P>&mdash; commends the Government for the significant increase in education services in Dublin city and county;</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcomes the implementation of the recommendations of the first report of the Ministerial Task Force on measures to reduce demand for drugs and supports the Government in its policy to deal with the drugs and crime problem, not only in relation to the deployment of Garda resources on the ground in Dublin but also in the action it has taken on a broader front to combat the drugs menace;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the excellent job creation record of the relevant State agencies in the Dublin area with the creation of over 6,000 new jobs in 1996 and overall employment in the year to April 1996 increasing by a record 26,200;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes that the average annual rate of jobs growth in the Dublin region for April 1994-96 at 5.2 per cent was well ahead of the jobs growth rate nationally;</P>
    <P>&mdash; acknowledges the success of the Government's overall tourism policy and its positive impact on the Dublin region;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the provision made for cultural institutions, venues and activities;</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the success to date of Operation Freeflow and the commitment of all of the agencies involved to repeat that success under the second phase of the operation which was launched last month;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and notes the recent initiatives by the Dublin local authorities to address the public demand for more taxis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This motion is wide ranging and in the time available it will not be possible for me to deal in detail with all the issues or to outline all the initiatives taken by this Government to promote the social and economic development of the Dublin region.  Instead, I propose to outline briefly the outstanding record of achievements of this Government and to begin in the transport area.</P>
    <P>One major criticism of transport planning in <Col N="697" /> the Dublin area under previous Administrations was that things were done in a piecemeal fashion without a proper co-ordinated approach.  The first step in dealing with this problem came with the publication of the Dublin Transportation Initiative's final report in August 1995.  This Government wasted no time in bringing DTI's plans to fruition.  In November 1995 my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, established the Dublin Transportation Office, thus delivering on a key commitment in the policy agreement, A Government of Renewal.  The office is charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating and monitoring the implementation of the DTI strategy.</P>
    <P>However, we were not satisfied to leave the issue of effective management and co-ordination at that.  It was obvious that the fragmentation of responsibility for individual aspects of traffic management and enforcement had contributed to a failure to adequately tackle congestion problems in Dublin.  We resolved, therefore, to make fundamental changes.  As the principal focus of traffic management and enforcement relates to the administrative area of Dublin Corporation, the Government decided that the corporation should appoint a director of traffic.  Following a consultancy study to identify the organisational requirements needed, the director was appointed last month.</P>
    <P>Coupled with this initiative, the Dublin Transportation Office was asked to develop a plan for the purpose of relieving traffic congestion in the centre of Dublin.  The DTO, acting with the active co-operation of the gardaí, Dublin Corporation and the Department of the Environment, produced that plan, which came to be known as Operation Freeflow.  The resounding success of that operation is well recorded.  It was due to the positive response of the various public agencies and the great co-operation of both road users and the Dublin business community.  The second phase of Operation Freeflow was launched in March.</P>
    <P>Transport investment in the Dublin area is now being implemented and financed in a co-ordinated way on foot of the DTI strategy.  Total investment of well in excess of £600 million is envisaged in the period 1994 to 1999.  This includes over £300 million on roads, almost another £300 million on public transport and £34 million for a range of traffic management measures.  This could hardly be described as neglect.</P>
    <P>Within the DTI process, the completion of the Dublin ring road was identified as a key element in solving Dublin's traffic problems.  We recognised we had to remove through traffic and this is exactly what we are doing, with the continued progress which can be seen on the Dublin ring road.  The Western Parkway has been open to traffic for some years and last December saw the successful completion of the northern leg of the ring road with the opening of 11 kilometres of motorway.  Construction of the Southern Cross route is beginning this year &mdash; now that legal <Col N="698" /> proceedings have been resolved &mdash; and the consultancy and statutory process for the south-eastern motorway should also be completed this year so that construction can begin as a matter of urgency.  Planning is also progressing on the proposed Dublin port tunnel.</P>
    <P>Other major schemes currently under construction include the Northern Cross route extension, the Balbriggan by-pass and the Rathcoole interchange.This level of investment in roads infrastructure in the Dublin area is second to none. This motion from Fianna Fáil, calling for further investment in transport and road infrastructure, an effective management plan and for the urgent completion of the ring road, is a good description of our current policy.  This Private Members' motion also raises questions relating to public transport.  My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, will address that issue when he speaks on the motion tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Major investment has also taken place in water and sewerage schemes in the greater Dublin area, which is inclusive of Counties Kildare, Wicklow and Meath.  Since 1995, payments of £68.5 million have been made to the local authorities concerned and the Government has continued its commitment to improving the water and sewerage infrastructure and to meeting the residential, economic and other development needs of the greater Dublin area with the inclusion of schemes with a final estimated cost of more than £400 million in the water and sewerage schemes capital works programme for 1997.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the greater Dublin water supply strategic study, which was commissioned by the Department of the Environment and published in 1996, a major initiative on water conservation in the region has been started at an estimated cost of over £30 million.  It is expected that, when completed, the project will cut by half the level of leakage in water mains in Dublin.</P>
    <P>On the sewerage side, work is being advanced on the provision of secondary treatment for Dublin.This will be the largest single water or sewerage project in the history of the State.  Apart from providing secondary treatment for all Dublin waste water, the project will end the dumping of sludge into Dublin Bay.</P>
    <P>Turning to the next major issue raised in the motion, that is, unemployment, I intend to place on the record the major job creation achievements of this Government.  Overall, the Labour Force Survey shows that in the year to April 1996 employment in Dublin grew by a record 26,200, or 7 per cent, on the previous year.</P>
    <P>According to the annual series of CSO labour force surveys, average annual employment growth in the period from April 1994 to April 1996, at 19,300 per year, was four times that of the previous two years.  The average annual rate of jobs growth in the Dublin region in the period from April 1994 to April 1996, at 5.2 per cent, was well ahead of the jobs growth rate nationally &mdash; 4.4 per cent &mdash; over the same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Dublin has been fortunate to secure a large proportion of inward investment over recent years.  This region now incorporates one of the major high technology business environments in Europe.  Many of the larger corporations seeking investment opportunities in Europe have confined their site selection criteria to the principal centres of population in each country.  For such corporations, Dublin and the other cities will continue to represent the focal point of interest and will continue to benefit through industrial development and employment provision.</P>
    <P>Ireland's success in attracting such flagship investments as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Intel and Motorola is a clear example of such location strategies.Dublin and the east region have been fortunate to secure many of these firms in the recent past.  This success will ensure that jobs growth in Dublin and the east region will continue to be buoyant in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I now want to turn to the question of crime in general, and drug abuse in particular, which is one of the social evils which this Government has targeted for special attention.  Early last year, proposals on new demand reduction measures to prevent drug misuse were approved.  A wide range of services, from prevention and education to detoxification and rehabilitation, have been provided for drug misusers in Dublin following these decisions.  A ministerial task force put in place to review further drug services published its first report on measures to reduce the demand for drugs on 10 October 1996.  As a result of the task force report, 12 priority areas for special attention have been identified in the greater Dublin area and local area task forces have been established in each of these areas.  Additional funding for Dublin was £1.5 million in 1995, £1.3 million in 1996 and, Members should note, £5.9 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities also reviewed their operations in regard to combating the drugs problem in Dublin and the Garda Commissioner announced a new strategy, Operation Dóchas, which came into effect on 7 October 1996.  The new strategy has operated in all Dublin districts and has involved the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain clothes gardaí.  While drug related activities are the main focus of this initiative, a full and comprehensive policing service is being provided in these areas.  The Garda authorities have indicated that because of its unqualified success, this particular initiative in Dublin city is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Because of the particular problems in Dublin, the Garda Commissioner arranged the return to Dublin of the 160 or so gardaí who had been deployed for Border BSE duty.  As a result of this, and an intensification in overall recruitment, the number of gardaí available in Dublin to combat crime has been substantially increased.  Overall recruitment in 1997 will be of the order of 600, compared to only 300 per annum when Fianna <Col N="700" /> Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in government.  The Government is confident that all these measures will maintain the strength of the Garda at a level sufficient to meet the changing needs of our society.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' motion also queried the adequacy of a range of services in the Dublin area including health, education and housing.  In the time available, I can only deal briefly with our achievements in providing these services in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In November 1996, the Minister for Health announced proposals for the establishment of an Eastern Health Authority which will have responsibility for the funding of all health and personal social services in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  A high level task force was established to oversee and manage the implementation of proposals.  Under the new arrangements, all services, both voluntary and statutory, will be funded by the new authority, facilitating more integrated planning, delivery and evaluation of health and personal social services in the area. This Government believes this will enable the authority to promote a more effective, efficient and patient and consumer friendly delivery system in the region.</P>
    <P>This Government has provided, and continues to provide, substantial capital development funding for the Dublin area, particularly in the acute hospital sector, to ensure that an efficient and effective hospital service is available throughout the city.</P>
    <P>A number of major capital projects are currently being planned or constructed in the Dublin area at a total estimated cost of £270 million approximately.  These include the new 590 bed general hospital in Tallaght which will open in 1997, at an estimated cost of £126 million.  This will provide a high quality range of health services for the catchment area of 100,000 persons in the immediate area.</P>
    <P>Significant achievements in education can also be recorded.  The pupil/teacher ratio has been reduced from 23.4:1 in the 1994-5 school year to under 22:1 from next September.  Every school in Dublin city and county has benefited considerably from these improvements.  Furthermore, a special maximum class size of 29 applies to all schools designated as disadvantaged.  In Dublin city and county there are 161 primary schools which are so designated.</P>
    <P>More than £20 million in capital funding has been allocated to primary schools in the Dublin area since 1993.  Major projects have been undertaken in Ballymun, Rathcoole, Tallaght, Dundrum, Glenageary and the Model School in Marlborough Street.</P>
    <P>This substantial level of funding has helped to redress the damage done to primary schools as a result of the massive cuts in funding in the 1988-92 period.</P>
    <P>A total of £25.4 million has been allocated to the Dublin city and county region for the building of six new schools and nine extensions to existing <Col N="701" /> schools from the post-primary capital programme from 1994 to date, including the 1997 allocation.</P>
    <P>Third level capital in Dublin includes an £11.5 million East End development at Trinity College Dublin, an £11 million chemical sciences building at Dublin City University, a £3 million new computer facility at UCD, a £6.5 million extension to the Dublin Institute of Technology College of Catering at Cathal Brugha Street and the completion of a new college for Dublin Institute of Technology at Aungier Street at a cost of £8.5 million. Also a £4 million extension will shortly commence for Dun Laoghaire regional technical college.I am sorry Deputy Brennan is not present to hear me announce that a £4.5 million extension will also shortly commence for the Tallaght regional technical college.  More recently the Government has given the go-ahead for the acquisition of a site for the proposed new regional technical college at Blanchardstown.</P>

      <P>Three education centres have been located in the Dublin city and county region at West Dublin, Blackrock and Drumcondra.</P>
      <P>So far as housing is concerned, the original motion called on the Government to introduce measures to tackle what it described as &ldquo;the public housing shortage&rdquo;.  The out-of-date terminology suggests the proposers have not even heard of the concept of social housing by which the needs of those unable to provide adequate housing from their own resources are met through a wide range of responses which reflect the wide range of social housing needs.  The Government's record in relation to social housing in the Dublin area is second to none.  If we look at needs, the number of households on the local authority waiting lists in Dublin city and county area was 7,900 in March 1993.  The most recent assessment in March 1996, showed that this number had been reduced to 6,543 &mdash; a reduction of 17 per cent.</P>
      <P>We should look also at output.  Last year an additional 1,000 local authority houses were provided in the Dublin area.  In 1993 the figure was 263.  In 1991, believe it or not, the figure was only 167.  When we take all local authority and voluntary housing programmes together we see that the needs of over 4,000 households in the Dublin area were met in 1996 compared to a miserable 2,300 in 1992 &mdash; an increase of 74 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to social housing extends beyond the new housing programmes to securing improvements to the housing conditions of existing local authority tenants.  This is best exemplified by the recent Government decision to comprehensively redevelop the Ballymun estate at an estimated cost of about £179 million.  This project will directly improve the housing conditions of over 2,500 households and secure the overall economic and social regeneration of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> In regard to regeneration, perhaps the most visible sign of what the Government has achieved for Dublin is the revitalisation of many city centre areas under the urban renewal scheme.  The package of tax incentives and rates relief which the current scheme provides has offered real opportunities to people to become involved in the regeneration of Dublin city.  Since the current scheme commenced in 1994, the areas designated in Dublin have seen a staggering £292 million of private sector investment, with a further £180 million still planned.</P>
    <P>Dublin has also benefited tremendously from the Temple Bar and Custom House Docks projects.Most of the major cultural development schemes devised by Temple Bar Properties in consultation with the relevant cultural organisations have been completed.  Temple Bar is now firmly established as a cultural and tourist quarter.</P>
    <P>Dublin is benefiting significantly from our development of the tourism sector with over 35 per cent growth in total tourism revenue between 1991 and 1995.  In 1996, 2,360,000 overseas visitors came to Dublin and associated revenue was £440 million.  The corresponding figures in 1994 were 1.8 million visitors and £330 million in revenue. By any standards, this is an outstanding performance and points to the success of the tourism promotion and development initiatives undertaken by the Government and the private sector.</P>
    <P>Dublin is now the fastest growing urban tourism destination in Europe and is firmly established as a distinctive capital city product alongside Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and other leading cities in Europe.  A recent study by the British Travel Agents' Association showed Dublin to be the second most popular European destination after Paris.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Custom House Docks area, home to the well established International Financial Services Centre where investment is estimated to have reached £450 million.</P>

      <P>Who developed it?  Significant progress has been achieved in recent years with the completion of further office developments and over 300 apartments.  We have also seen the completion of a pub and restaurant, a new hotel for the Jury's Group, a multi-storey carpark and five retail units.  In terms of employment the International Financial Services Centre provides jobs for over 3,500 people.</P>
      <P>The new Dublin Docklands Development Authority will be established on 1 May with the objective of securing the social and economic regeneration of the docklands, an area of some 1,300 acres on the north and south sides of the Liffey.  When implemented, this initiative will see what is now, in many parts, a much neglected redundant port area reclaiming its role as a vital part of the heart of our capital city.</P>

    <P>The achievements of the Government in securing <Col N="703" /> the social and economic development of the Dublin area can be described fairly as nothing short of spectacular.  The Government has taken tremendous strides in developing the role of Dublin as a vibrant capital city and ensuring it can fulfil its social, economic and cultural role for Dubliners today.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite should realise the folly of their motion and I invite them to see the sense of this and withdraw it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is folly on the part of politicians on all sides of the House to claim credit for European funding.  Everyone has made that mistake and it is ridiculous.  The Minister began by referring to a number of major capital investment projects in the greater Dublin region which are most welcome.  However, great frustration has been felt by the people of Dublin due to the lack of urgency in utilising funds which have been available for capital works.</P>
      <P>The first major item referred to was the operational programme for transport with an investment of £600 million.  How far is the programme behind?  I suggest two or three years.  The southern cross route has been tied up in a legal bind having been dragged through the courts for years. The DTI studied Dublin's traffic problems to death but now there is a further consultancy requirement from Europe on Luas.  Our capital with a population of 1 million has been studied, consulted, restudied and reconsulted to death. We want to build a tunnel to the port.  How long has it taken to develop that project?  Management at local authority and national level should be criticised for the lack of attention, action and urgency in the greater Dublin region over many years.</P>
      <P>The next item the Minister blew his trumpet about was £400 million for water and sewerage schemes.  Dublin Corporation set about studying what it would do about this problem ten years ago.  International consultants spent three or four years examining it.  They came up with a solution to build on the north fringe of Dublin.  Following this, the consultant's report was scrapped and studies were carried out again.  Eventually, the corporation concluded that instead of building a facility on the north fringe, it would build the facility in Ringsend and put a pipe under the bay. It is now rushing, following a diktat from the Department of the Environment, to build a sewerage treatment facility.  This in turn is required to meet an EU directive, but a waste water plant will not be built for years.  A major project is being developed on a piecemeal basis to meet the EU directive.  Some 75 per cent of the capital for that project has been available in Brussels for years.  Various Ministers and city managers did not proceed with these urgent capital programmes.  Even now they begrudingly provide a half-baked solution to Dublin Bay water pollution by providing secondary treatment, not tertiary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> The lack of proper services has resulted in some young couples paying up to £10,000 more than they should for first time homes.  A large tract of land became available on the north fringe of the city for new housing because that facility was not provided.  However, in Lucan young couples pay £10,000 to £15,000 more than they should for their first home.  Séan Lemass said in the 1960s: &ldquo;you control the price of building land by servicing more than you need&rdquo;.  That is not the case in Dublin at present and young couples are being crippled by the prices of their homes, courtesy of ineptitude across the political divide.</P>
    <P>It was then discovered that half of Dublin's fresh water was being lost through leakages from archaic pipes and £30 million is being spent to rectify a problem that should have been dealt with years ago.  Temple Bar and the Custom House Docks provided generous tax breaks which generated welcome development.  They were mainly driven by Fianna Fáil when it was in power but were supported by the House.</P>
    <P>What about social exclusion?  The Minister and I and a number of other Deputies represent new satellite towns.  The Minister has distinguished himself representing Tallaght for many years while I represent the satellite towns of Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown.  None of us can be proud.  Dublin Corporation housed substantial numbers of people in the county during the housing crisis of the 1960s and 1970s.  It then walked away and left vast housing areas incomplete in terms of basic services.  Within the great prosperity to which the Minister referred, there is substantial social exclusion.  This is where attention needs to be focused, not on trotting out what has been achieved courtesy of European funding.  It should have been handled more efficiently and utilised much sooner.</P>
    <P>The social exclusion issue and what needs to be achieved must be addressed.  What approach should be taken?  My constituency is the only part of the country on which a study was done by the task force on urban crime to examine what had gone wrong.  It recommended a catalogue of actions.  Fianna Fáil was in Government at the time but did not rush into implementing them and this Government has done little, despite having more time than we had.  However, these people must be brought back into the loop.  The regeneration of Ballymun is a good example of this. While not being as dramatic a necessity in the new satellite towns, they are heading in that direction and if the problem is not addressed the finance required for Ballymun will be needed for these towns.</P>
    <P>There is good reason to put the motion before the House.  Other urban areas in Cork, Limerick and Galway fall into the same category and the Minister should target them also.  He elaborated on investment in education, a new hospital in Tallaght etc. which are welcome and the success of job creation which has been excellent.  My constituency has benefited from this but it is our well educated young population and favourable tax <Col N="705" /> regime which has attracted multinationals, not a love of Ireland.  Economic management is important and I compliment the past two Governments for setting the country on the road to low inflation.  Good fiscal management and policies have contributed to bring this about.</P>
    <P>As we prepare for a general election, all political parties should look at the social exclusion dimension in considering the needs of the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>On transport, the levels projected for the year 2000 and beyond have been reached.  There are long tailbacks on the motorway which runs through my constituency and every roundabout designed by engineers for the Department of the Environment has had to be redesigned and traffic lights constructed.  Spending has trebled because of the lack of competent management.  The Dublin area, therefore, needs much attention and further investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that the achievements of the Government in securing the social and economic development of the Dublin area are spectacular.  What is spectacular and breathtaking is the Minister claiming exclusive credit, on behalf of the Government, for a number of initiatives in the Dublin area.  This is hard to take. Temple Bar Properties Limited, the International Financial Services Centre and the Custom House Docks Development Authority were Fianna Fáil initiatives, although I accept they have been advanced under various Finance Acts.</P>
      <P>As a Dublin Deputy, city councillor and former Lord Mayor of Dublin, I have fought consistently to ensure the Dublin region, particularly the northside, receives a fair deal.  It is important that moves to promote coherent economic and social development of the north Dublin region are supported.This can best be done in association with Dublin City University or the area based partnerships, both Fianna Fáil initiatives.  The area based partnerships were established under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress in 1991, while I recall putting my signature as Lord Mayor of Dublin to the inauguration charter for DCU, although I do not claim credit for its establishment.</P>
      <P>As other speakers said, Dublin has the highest concentration of deprivation with high unemployment rates in many estates.  Social exclusion is the one element the Minister failed to include in his speech.  The economy &mdash; the celtic tiger &mdash; may be booming but social exclusion presents a major problem in the city, particularly on the northside. There is a need to establish a north Dublin lobby to seek a fair deal for the region and to ensure its economic infrastructure is further developed and major facilities are located within it.  This can be done in an organised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transport issues and the so-called Luas line have been mentioned.  This is but one example of the way the northside of Dublin has lost out.  No one on the northside of Dublin was surprised <Col N="706" /> when the Ballymun-Dublin Airport line was put on the long finger.  It took the intervention of the European Commission to ensure fair play.  At least, the plans for the line are now on paper and consultations are taking place.  Everybody was extremely disappointed when the project was put on hold.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem is of major concern to many communities in the Dublin area.  As has been said so often, it represents a threat to the fabric of society.  An entire generation of young people is at risk.  This is intolerable.  Everyone is affected as drug related crime continues to escalate.</P>
    <P>The communities which have stood up to the drug barons did so initially without any help from the State or the Garda Síochána.  They are to be congratulated for this.  The motives of many local drugs action committees have been misrepresented in the media.  They are comprised mostly of parents concerned about the escalation of the drugs problem in their localities.  We have a duty, as public representatives, to support these communities and to build trust between the Garda Síochána and the local drugs action committees. If we can do this, we will have achieved something important.  Operation Dóchas was a welcome, albeit belated, response.  It must be continued and adequately resourced.</P>
    <P>To ensure prevention a wide range of measures are needed, including education, detoxification and rehabilitation programmes.  Social and economic disadvantage, as characterised by high levels of unemployment, poor living conditions, low educational attainment, family breakdown and a lack of recreational facilities and other supports, contribute to the problem.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency which is affected by the Dublin Port tunnel proposal.  Reliable access to Dublin Port is necessary to facilitate continued economic growth in the city and further expansion of the port.  The matter is being dealt with under the Roads Act, 1993 which deals with motorway development.  An environmental impact statement has been published and a public inquiry will be held shortly before the Minister makes his decision.</P>
    <P>Dublin City Council is considering varying the development plan to facilitate this proposal.  The legitimate concerns of local residents in East Wall, Marino, Beaumont, Whitehall and Santry have not been satisfactorily addressed.  Fears about the danger of subsidance damage along the route and air pollution emanating from the tunnel portals have not been allayed.  The proposed Austrian tunnelling method is also the source of much anxiety.  I regret that other options were not given more serious consideration by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  These include the east-west route and truckway options.</P>
    <P>Substantial modifications must be made to the proposed A6 route.  I will not support the variation process at Dublin City Council unless the northern portals are relocated further north out of residential areas.  I cannot vote for any proposal which allows for a tunnel to be constructed <Col N="707" /> under the heavily populated area of Marino.  I will adopt this stance at any future public inquiry, or in the unlikely event that the National Roads Authority will assume responsibility for the project in an undemocratic fashion.  No Deputy would like a tunnel running directly under his or her house.  It is a new concept in respect of which legitimate concerns have not been satisfactorily addressed by the authorities.</P>
    <P>It is possible to reach agreement on an access route to the port but to date we have gone about this the wrong way and have not endeavoured to have adequate consultation.  We will have to see what happens in this respect in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On a point of clarification, the earlier order of the House has been amended so that we are only taking Second Stage this evening.  The Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Bill, 1997, is strong legislation.  It focuses specifically on the problem of drugs in places such as dance halls, pubs and other licensed and unlicensed premises.  It will help protect the health, safety and ultimately the future of a section of our young population, young persons who are vulnerable to the latest fad and to peer pressure and whose lives may be blighted by drugs, including the so-called recreational and designer drugs.  The aim of the Bill is to prevent or to disqualify persons involved in the drugs trade from promoting dances or other entertainments or holding intoxicating liquor licences.  It should go a long way towards ensuring that dance halls, pubs and other places of entertainment are safe places where young persons can enjoy themselves in a drugs-free environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within a short time of becoming Minister for Justice, I set in train a programme of legislation to tackle drug abuse.  It remains my view that a successful assault on the drugs trade must come from many sides.  The Bill is another step in this direction.  My colleagues in Government and I are determined to use every means at our disposal to take on this evil trade which has destroyed so many lives and threatens to destroy others.  The Bill arises from the comprehensive anti-drugs package which the Government announced in 1995.  A thorough examination of the licensing laws has been undertaken by my Department, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, to identify what new powers gardaí require in order to tackle the scourge of drug abuse in dance halls and public houses.  The examination was also concerned with Garda powers to prevent or halt unlicensed rave type dances, whether held indoors or out of <Col N="708" /> doors, at which drug abuse was almost certain to take place.  The Bill represents the outcome of that examination.  It gives the Garda clear, unambiguous powers to deal with drug abuse in dance halls, public houses and other places of entertainment by getting court orders to close down the offending places.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it will prevent persons with convictions for drug trafficking from becoming involved in the licensed trade.  This will be an important means of preventing money laundering through dance halls and public houses.</P>
    <P>Before outlining its main provisions I wish to place the legislation in context.  Last year the Oireachtas passed the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.  That Act, which is one of the strongest anti-crime measures ever enacted, illustrates the Government's determination to do all in its power to thwart the deadly trade of drug trafficking.  The Oireachtas also passed last year the Proceeds of Crime Act, 1996, which covers the proceeds of all crime and not just the proceeds of drug related offences, and the legislation under which the Criminal Assets Bureau was established.  I am maintaining the legislative pace of last year.  Already this year I have brought forward the non-fatal offences legislation, major reforming legislation which, among other things, deals with the use of syringes.  That Bill was debated earlier this evening.  The Bill now before the House approaches drug trafficking and drug abuse from a different perspective and in so doing adds a further weapon to the arsenal of measures targeted by the Government for use against the drugs trade and those involved in it.</P>
    <P>The Bill tackles three main problems.  First, it deals with drug abuse in dance halls and other entertainment venues.  Second, it deals with drug abuse in public houses and other places licensed to sell intoxicating liquor.  Third, it gives the Garda greater powers to deal with unlicensed dances such as raves which, almost inevitably, involve drug abuse.  I am not claiming that there is widespread drug abuse in those places but what abuse there is can have serious consequences and a very effective way of defeating the problem is through the licensing system.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with drug abuse in dance halls, other places of entertainment and public houses in three ways.  Under section 2 any person who has been convicted of a drug trafficking offence will be prevented from ever holding any intoxicating liquor licence, any public dancing licence or any public music and singing licence.  Clearly such persons would be regarded as being unfit by reason of character from holding any such licence and the Bill will ensure that involvement in any of the trades requiring such a licence is barred to them.  In other words, this provision will ensure that undesirable elements are kept out of the relevant licensed businesses.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 17 deal with the revocation or forfeiture of licences held by persons who, as licence holders, have been convicted of a drug trafficking offence or an offence under section <Col N="709" /> 19 (1) (g) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Drug trafficking offences are set out in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, and include offences such as the manufacture, production, preparation, importation, exportation, supply, distribution or transportation of a controlled drug.  Section 19(1)(g) of the 1977 Act makes it an offence for a person to knowingly permit or suffer the sale, supply or distribution of a controlled drug on any land &mdash; and this includes buildings &mdash; which he or she controls or manages.  In the case of a public dancing or public music and singing licence the Garda Síochána can, under the Bill, apply to the court to have the licence immediately revoked and, unless the judge is of the opinion that there is good reason for not revoking it, it will be immediately revoked and the person concerned disqualified for ever from holding such a licence.</P>
    <P>The premises to which the licence attached would also be prohibited from ever again having such a licence attached to it.  Provision is made for the owner of such a premises to apply to the court to have the premises again licensed.  In such a case the owner must not have been the holder of the licence and he or she must satisfy the court that he or she did not know and had no reason to suspect that the licence holder would be involved with drugs.  This will ensure fairness in cases where, for example, a person may have leased a premises to another person in good faith for the purpose of holding dances.  In the case of an intoxicating liquor licence the licence will be forfeited rather than revoked, which amounts to the same thing.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 18 bring the process a stage further.  These sections, arguably the most important in the Bill, are concerned with the situation that would arise where the court was satisfied that the holder of the licence permitted or suffered the use of the premises in respect of which the licence was granted for the sale, supply or distribution of a controlled drug or did not exercise proper control over the place to prevent such sale, supply or distribution.  In such circumstances the judge can order that the licence be immediately revoked, in the case of a public dancing licence or a public music and singing licence, or suspended, in the case of an intoxicating liquor licence.  The revocation or suspension would be for five years.  We are dealing here with persons who have not necessarily been convicted of any drugs offence but who run dances or other entertainments or hold intoxicating liquor licences in premises where drug abuse is known to be taking place.</P>
    <P>In the normal way, when the Garda become aware of such abuse they bring it to the notice of the licence holder who would be expected to take measures to counter it.  If it continues the Garda can apply to the court under these sections to have the licence revoked or suspended.  The licence holder could have been actively involved in permitting the premises to be used for the sale, supply or distribution of a controlled drug or could simply have failed to exercise proper control <Col N="710" /> in the knowledge of the possibility of such sale, supply or distribution.  Either way, the end result is the same &mdash; drug abuse on the premises &mdash; and if the only way to prevent the abuse is to close the premises, so be it.  Similar safeguards to those in sections 3 and 17 in relation to applications by owners of premises are also incorporated into these provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is an important provision concerned with persons who have been disqualified from holding a licence.  There is always the danger that a person so disqualified will seek through another person or a company to continue to benefit from the operation of a licence.  This section will prevent that in two ways.  First, a disqualified person will be prevented by reason of any understanding, arrangement or direction with or to another person from enjoying or profiting from the operation of a licence.  This could happen, for example, where a disqualified person sets up another person as a licence holder and creams off a percentage of the profits from the operation of that licence.  Such a person would not necessarily control or conduct the activities under licence but would simply take a share of the profits.  Section 21 also deals with the person who controls or conducts the activities under these licences that are held by another person or body corporate.  Such a person could, for example, establish a company to run the licensed business of which he or she would not be a director.  However, he or she could be what is known in company law as a &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo; and such a person is also disqualified from being a shadow licence holder under the provisions of this section.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 to 11 amend relevant aspects of the Dance Halls Act, 1935 and the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890, under which the public music and singing licence is granted.  The 1935 Act has comprehensive safeguards dealing with the grant of a public dancing licence.  For example, section 2 of that Act lists the matters to which a judge must give consideration before granting a public dancing licence.  Section 6 of this Bill adds a further consideration, that is, the arrangements, where appropriate, that have been made to ensure that persons entering or making use of the dance hall are not in possession of any controlled drug and that the place will not be used for the sale, supply or distribution of any controlled drug.  Under section 4 of the 1935 Act, the court, when granting a public dancing licence, may insert such conditions and restrictions as the judge thinks proper.  Section 7 of this Bill obliges the judge, where appropriate, to insert a condition in the licence that the person to whom it is being granted makes all reasonable arrangements to ensure that persons entering or making use of the place are not in possession of any controlled drug and that the place is not used for the sale, supply or distribution of any controlled drug.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; in the 1935 Act, that is, a place for which a public dancing licence can be granted.  At present, a <Col N="711" /> licence would not be required for a dance held in an unenclosed place out of doors.  It would not have been envisaged in 1935 that commercial dances could be held in remote, unenclosed places or on places like beaches.  Apparently nobody thought of doing things like that in 1935 &mdash; a far cry from today.  It is necessary to recognise there are changes in the way people entertain themselves these days.</P>
    <P>However, it is a feature of the so-called rave culture that payment is made in advance and the location is kept secret until the last minute.  Such dances do not currently require a licence because they are held in unenclosed places.  The amendment to the definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; will remedy that situation and the importance of that amendment will become even more clear when I refer to new Garda powers under sections 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined so far are comprehensive and tough, and are meant to be so. They deal in general with premises that are licensed.  Sections 12 to 16 are equally tough and comprehensive but in this case they deal with what are described in the Bill as &ldquo;unlicensed dances&rdquo;.  For the purposes of this Bill an unlicensed dance is defined in section 1.  The main feature of the definition is that a member of the Garda Síochána of at least superintendent rank must have a reasonable belief that the dance will be an occasion for the sale, supply or distribution of a controlled drug.  These provisions are drugs focused and cannot be used for any other reason. Section 12 allows the gardaí to direct persons who are preparing to hold an unlicensed dance to leave the place where the dance is to take place and to bring any sound equipment or other property with them.  Once such a dance has started, the gardaí can direct the persons who organised the dance or prepared it, or are using the sound equipment at it, to similarly leave the place bringing their sound equipment or other property with them.  This would have the effect of bringing the dance to a halt.</P>
    <P>Section 13 gives the gardaí power to stop a person proceeding in the direction of an unlicensed dance.  This power can only be used within two miles of where the unlicensed dance is taking place or is due to take place unless it is due to take place on one of our offshore islands, in which case there is no distance restriction.  Once a dance has commenced on an island it would be almost impossible for the gardaí to deal with it.  It is important, therefore, that the gardaí have the power to stop persons on the mainland from going out to the island.  Deputy O'Donoghue is smiling.  Perhaps he is thinking of islands off the Kerry coast.  I must emphasise once again that these powers can only be used where the gardaí have a reasonable belief that drug abuse will take place at the dance.</P>
    <P>Section 14 gives the gardaí power to enter any place being used for public dancing without a licence or at any other time to make any inspection, examination or inquiry thought proper to <Col N="712" /> prevent or detect a drug trafficking offence or to give a direction under section 12.  This provision will plug a gap in the law relating to Garda powers of entry to places where dances are held.  At present, gardaí only have this power in relation to a premises to which a public dancing licence applies.  Sections 15 and 16 deal with the powers of the court to forfeit sound equipment seized by the Garda Síochána from a person at an unlicensed dance and with the retention of such equipment.</P>
    <P>Section 19 is a technical provision that provides a mechanism whereby a person whose licence has been suspended under section 18 can apply to the Revenue Commissioners to have the licence renewed.  The earliest this application can be made would coincide with the annual licensing sessions of the fourth year following the suspension.</P>
    <P>Section 20 provides for an appeal to the Circuit Court against the forfeiture or suspension of an intoxicating liquor licence under this Bill.  It also provides an appeal procedure for the owner of a premises who has unsuccessfully applied to the court under section 17 or 18 to have the ban on the licensing of his or her premises lifted.  Section 8 provides for similar appeals in the case of public dancing licences and public music and singing licences.</P>
    <P>The music and singing licence may not be as well known as the public dancing licence and the intoxicating liquor licence.  Section 51 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act, 1890 provides a licensing system for public music or public entertainments other than public dancing.  This licence is generally called a public music and singing licence and is required in two circumstances. First, the place where the entertainment is to be held must be ordinarily used for public singing, music or other entertainment of the like kind and, second, the place must be situated within the area of a local authority which has passed a resolution adopting section 51 of the Public Health Acts (Amendment) Act for that area.  The licence would normally be held by hotels, restaurants or public houses wishing to provide music, singing or like entertainment for their customers.</P>
    <P>There is no constitutional right to a licence or to a renewal of a licence.  There are only such rights as are given by statute subject to the limitations and conditions prescribed by statute.  A person applying for a licence knows or ought to know that it can be forfeited or revoked in certain eventualities.  When these eventualities occur, the licence holder cannot complain.  Every licence holder will now know exactly what the legislators and the people think of persons who allow, connive at or turn a blind eye to drug abuse on their premises.  They do not deserve any sympathy and if, as a result of their activities or negligence, they lose the licence they have only themselves to blame.  This may seem a harsh judgment but we in this House have a duty to protect our young people from exposure to the sale or supply of <Col N="713" /> illegal drugs in situations where it is often difficult for them to say no.</P>
    <P>We know there are young people who say they have dabbled in drug taking and that it has done them no harm.  However, there is always the one young person for whom the first drug is the last, either because they have received a bad drug or their physical make-up is such that they do not survive taking it.  The Bill I am introducing this evening is tough and strong.  It may give rise to criticism because of that, but it is an appropriate measure to protect our young people from the sale and use of drugs on entertainment premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Parts of the Bill are tough and strong but, as an entity, the legislation is half-hearted and half-baked and will not adequately address the problem of rave parties and the taking of drugs on licensed and unlicensed premises. The Bill contains a certain amount of window dressing and is a pathetic attempt to pull the wool over people's eyes.  The Minister is not hard on crime, but she is difficult to believe.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to the offence of drug trafficking on licensed and unlicensed premises.  It does not appear to make any change in relation to the possession of drugs such at ecstasy and other amphetamines, and to that extent it is ineffective. There is little point in promoting legislation directed at the licensed trade and publicans exclusively when that legislation is woefully inadequate.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an illustration of the fact that we have truly arrived at the end of the rainbow.  It would have been unthinkable a short two and half years ago that this Government would legislate to prevent the sale and supply of drugs in licensed and unlicensed premises.  They were the days when the Government believed there was no problem.  It would have been equally unthinkable a couple of decades ago that it would become necessary in 1997 to organise the regulation of something as simple as a dance so that the penalties for holding a public dance without a licence or permitting a place to be used for that purpose have been increased from a fine of £10 for every day of such use to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or up to 12 months' imprisonment or both, and that is only on a summary conviction.  On conviction on indictment the fine has been increased to a sum not exceeding £10,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years or both.  It raises the question about what has gone so seriously wrong with society that we are obliged to bring in draconian measures to deal with a desperate situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 of the legislation is a further reminder of the omnipresent threat which drugs and drug pushers pose to the future of young people.  The purpose of that section is to ensure that when a public dancing licence is granted it will, where appropriate, contain a condition that the person to whom the licence is being granted will make all reasonable arrangements to prevent drug abuse at the dance.  In this context I am not convinced <Col N="714" /> of the appropriateness of the Minister's legislation to tackle the problem.  It is clear that anybody accused of allowing the sale and supply of drugs on his or her premises will strongly deny that this ever happened or, at least, that it ever happened to their knowledge.  To that extent the Bill is seriously deficient.</P>
    <P>I have stated in the past that the most appropriate way of tackling this problem would be to serve a notice on the licence holder to the effect that the Garda Síochána are of the view that illegal drugs are on sale or being supplied on the premises and directing the individual concerned to put his house in order, if he or she does not do so, the court should have the power to close down the premises for a limited time.  Following a number of such closure orders, the number to be decided, the licence could be forfeited.  It would be extremely difficult for the prosecution to establish that an individual is not managing his premises properly and thereby allowing the sale or supply of illegal drugs.  Serving a notice on the licensee would be the preferred way forward and would ensure a watertight, pragmatic approach by the State.  That was not to be, but in future it will have to be because unless there is a procedure for notification the standard of proof which is needed in court will, in all probability, be unattainable.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week it was reported in the national newspapers that gardaí in County Wicklow had to chase around the countryside after groups of young people being ferried in cars to outdoor rave parties.  The Garda are completely powerless to take action under existing legislation unless these young people are found in possession of drugs.  While the Bill before the House suggests that these people can be diverted or arrested en route to the rave parties, this provision in itself is defective.  I refer to the practicalities of the operation of the legislation by those who are empowered and obliged under statute law to enforce it. What is to stop any person who is challenged to say they are not going to a rave party, that they are meeting friends in the locality?  The Minister speaks about young people going to a rave party on an island; there is little to prevent them from saying they were island hopping.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed what I would describe as a polite solution to a serious problem where politeness is the last thing desired or required.  The Bill does not appear to contain a power of search and arrest for such persons who are known to the Garda to be travelling to a rave party.  It would appear, therefore, to skirt the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed that any licensed premises known to have hosted or facilitated rave-type parties for the supply or distribution of drugs should lose their licence for approximately five years.  That is unacceptable.  The restriction should extend to ten years, and not only to the publican concerned but to any nominee to whom he might attempt to transfer the licence.  We must ensure, in so far as we possibly can within the <Col N="715" /> confines of this legislation and within the parameters of the Constitution, that licences which are adversely affected by virtue of drug related offences being committed on the premises to which they are attached will remain adversely affected and that the holders of those licences will remain away from young people and cannot provide the facilities which would enable young people to become involved in a cycle of death and destruction.</P>
    <P>I fear it might be possible under this legislation for a licence holder to avoid the terms of the legislation by various mechanisms which are well known to company law.  The fines under the legislation are paltry.  The suggestion that a £1,500 fine on summary conviction or £10,000 on indictment is adequate is a joke.  The profits to be made from drug sales, particularly the sale of ecstasy at rave parties and other gatherings, are potentially enormous.</P>
    <P>In Cork Fr. O'Donoghue recently outlined that a 14 year old boy was in a position to make an enormous amount of money from the sale of ecstasy tablets.  That is not an uncommon feature of life today among teenagers.  We know from the manufacturing costs of these drugs that huge margins are to be made &mdash; for example, a profit of £10,000 for an individual at a rave party would not be uncommon.In those circumstances a fine of £1,500, When weighed against such a potential profit, is an incentive to those involved in the sale and supply of such drugs to continue to openly flout the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill significantly fails to deal with unscrupulous licence holders who sell water at £1 per pint to young teenagers who are exhausted and dehydrated from the effects of ecstasy tablets.This must surely rank as one of the most disgusting crimes, where young people craving for liquids are preyed upon by licence holders in whose premises they are situated.  We have heard of incidents where taps are turned off in the toilets of certain premises to ensure young people have to buy water at the bar, thereby further lining the pockets of unscrupulous promoters.</P>
    <P>These people understand only one answer, tough penalties which will put them away for a long time.  Until we wake up to the fact that that is the only language they understand, this scourge will stalk the land and prey upon the health and lives of teenagers.  It is time to wake up to this plague and understand that the people involved in this despicable business have no mercy, nor should mercy be shown them by the State.  There is only one place for these people, behind bars for a very long time.  The opportunity should have been taken in this legislation to ensure the message was driven home, but unfortunately that was not done.</P>
    <P>We have seen here and across the water in recent times the deaths of a number of teenagers from the effects of ecstasy.  It happened at well known dance venues in Dublin and throughout <Col N="716" /> the country.  The time has come to call a halt and to introduce far-reaching and restrictive legislation.This is not the time for cynical window-dressing, nor is it the time for electoral stunts.</P>

      <P>In our crime policy document, Leading the Fight Against Crime, we stated that in Government we would &ldquo;amend the licensing laws to permit the suspension or forfeiture of the licence of any premises, club, pub or disco where controlled drugs are distributed&rdquo;.  In our policy document, A Radical Approach to Drugs and Drug-related Crime, we stated that the Garda Síochána will be given power to apply to a District Court for an order revoking the licence of a pub, club or dance where drugs are being distributed and that this application will be on notice to the licence holder.  On the rare occasions when sheer pressure of time and work has prevented us from drafting legislation for the Minister, we have provided the inspiration.</P>

      <P>That is not to say the Minister for Justice or the Government have always had the time or inclination to implement our proposals and legislation.  For example, on three occasions we proposed a mandatory minimum ten years sentence for those caught in possession of controlled drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more, but on each occasion we were voted down by the rainbow coalition Government.  We are determined to give this House the opportunity to pass that law.  The reason is as plain and simple as it is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1977 the Oireachtas provided the maximum sentence for drug pushers of 14 years' imprisonment.In 1984, recognising that the problem was getting worse, that sentence was increased to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  In 1993, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 71 people were convicted of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply, in other words, they were convicted of drug pushing.  The following sentences were imposed by the courts: in three cases, less than three months; in six cases, between three and six months; in 20 cases, between six and 12 months; in 29 cases, between one and two years; in four cases, between two and three years and in five cases, between three and five years.  In only three of the 71 cases of drug <Col N="717" /> pushing a sentence of between five and ten years was imposed and in only one case a sentence of more than ten years was imposed.</P>
    <P>What signal does that send out in the international community to people who become involved in drug trafficking to and within this country?  It sends out the wrong signal that the punishment in the Republic of Ireland will not fit the crime.  Because that is the clear view of those involved in international drug smuggling, there has been a proliferation of the problem.  The number of seizures has increased &mdash; the authorities are to be congratulated on that &mdash; but international experience is that the greater the level of seizures, more often than not the greater the level of successful smuggling.  The time has come to send out a different signal.</P>
    <P>The time has come to tell people that if they become involved in drug dealing, pushing or trafficking in the Republic of Ireland and if the drugs in their possession have a street value of £10,000 or more, the court will have no alternative but to send them to prison for at least ten years.  That is the type of message we should send out to those involved in this evil and pernicious trade and that is the message the parents of teenagers in this city and country want to hear from this House.  They recognise the seriousness of this type of crime to people's health, future and lives.  In 1993 convicted drug dealers received prison sentences averaging less than two years.  What kind of weak and spineless message is that to send out to those who prey on young people?</P>
    <P>It remains to be seen if the Minister realises the need to send out a clear message to drug dealers.  A mandatory ten year prison sentence would be a sobering thought for anyone contemplating getting rich overnight on the misery, destruction and death of young people.  Such a proposal would not be unconstitutional.  It was suggested that the 1996 proceeds of crime legislation was unconstitutional, but that was not the case.  There is ample precedent to support the argument that there would be no transgression of a separation of powers, as postulated by the 1937 Constitution.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1990 provides for a minimum sentence of 40 years imprisonment for persons convicted of killing a garda and minimum sentencing is not confined to section 3 of that Act.  A minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment has been set by statute for attempting to murder a garda.  The 1876 customs consolidation legislation provides for mandatory minimum penalties of a multiple of the value of the goods unlawfully imported.</P>
    <P>If, as I believe, there is no academic or legislative reason a drug dealer found in possession of drugs with a street value of £10,000 or more should not be punished by a minimum sentence of ten years, why is the House refusing to legislate for it?  Why is this proposal rejected every time it is put to the Minister for Justice and the rainbow coalition?</P>

      <P>This is an example of tough talk and vote soft policy which is the Government's stock-in-trade.  The Minister for Justice asked why others did not implement this proposal.When one is appointed Minister for Justice one's job is not to reflect on the merits or demerits of history.  One's objective should be to deal with current problems and prepare for future ones.  The Minister should have learnt that lesson at the outset.  While I am sure she would make a fine historian, that is not a substitute for substance and action.</P>
      <P>We do not want more of the same.  The Bill's recognition of the need for tougher measures should be accompanied by a recognition that our criminal justice system needs to be adapted to deal in an effective and radical way with drug addicts.  We need a new approach so that the criminal justice system can be used to greater effect when dealing with the problem of drugs. The time has come to establish a drug court programme because the traditional system has not worked.  Prison is doing little to break the cycle of drug-related crime.</P>
      <P>The drug court, which we will establish on return to office, will offer the drug addict a choice of proceeding to trial or participating in a court supervised treatment and rehabilitation regime. The programme will be aimed mainly at non-violent offenders whose involvement with the law is primarily due to their drug addiction.  Accused persons accepted on the programme will be subject to a structured and supervised treatment regime under the authority of the court and treatment will entail counselling, therapy and education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An assessment of the US drug court experience has shown that approximately two-thirds of participants successfully complete the drug court regime, most of whom cease to abuse drugs.  Less than 4 per cent of those who complete the programme return to crime and in the case of all participants the figure ranges between 5 per cent and 28 per cent, significantly less than under the traditional system.  A rigorous court supervised treatment programme would be a significant alternative to the revolving door syndrome, which has become an open door syndrome under this Government.  We would introduce a drug court programme within the existing courts system and it would be assigned responsibility for applying <Col N="719" /> the programme in the case of non-violent offences due primarily to drug addiction.  There is no reason such a system would not work here.</P>
    <P>In fairness, if the Minister had time she would have photocopied and implemented this proposal with the others in our policy documents.  Like the patience of the public, time has run out for the Minister and the rainbow coalition.  Thankfully, the charade is coming to an end.  The Opposition, which has led the fight against crime, will soon be in Government and the Government, which spent most of its time in Opposition on this issue, will go where it should have been all along.  When that day comes, we will be the first Government in history to bring down the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill, I am pleased the Government conceded the Opposition's request not to take all Stages tonight.  It is a well known precedent that rushed legislation makes bad law.</P>
      <P>This well motivated legislation could prove to be defective if it is passed through the House with indecent haste to allow the Government face the electorate with the pledge that it has put this legislation on the Statute Book.  This Bill comprises radical and strong measures to deal with the availability of drugs in licensed premises and dance halls or raves.  It comprises 22 sections and deserves proper evaluation and circulation to persons who are experts on licensing law.  I do not claim to be an expert in that field.  The Bill was published only recently, it has not received an airing publicly or any evaluation by persons involved in the licensing trade, by persons in the justice field generally or those who are skilled in the art of licensing law.  It would be a shame if it was passed without being properly evaluated and scrutinised.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a belated proposal.  I recall that about three or four years ago when I was a member of Dublin Corporation raves were being held in the Mansion House.  They caused concern because of reports to councillors on Dublin Corporation by many parents and citizens who were outraged that drugs were being sold in and around the environs of the Mansion House. There was a great responsibility on us to put an end to those raves, and we did.  Gradually over a period of years it transpired there was an anomaly in our law; the 1935 Act which governed the holding of dances needed to be updated to deal with the phenomenon of raves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with the interaction of drugs and organised music events, which are a fairly recent phenomenon here.  The Bill recognises implicitly that drug traffickers are not the only people to benefit and profit from the sale of drugs to our young people in particular.  Many people have made a good deal of money from organising and staging events which they know will specifically attract young people in search of drugs.  Many people were surprised and shocked to learn that one promoter at a rave turned off the water supply <Col N="720" /> in the public toilets knowing that the young patrons, in a desperate effort to hydrate themselves, would have to pay a large amount, in their terms, for mineral water available at the bar.  That is a most cynical example of how commercially-minded such people can be when they know the vulnerability of patrons.  Drugs are an intrinsic part of the rave and dance culture and this Bill recognises that.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the announcement today by the Licensed Vintners' Association at its conference in Galway that its members are willing to co-operate fully with the authorities and the gardaí in intelligence gathering to combat drug dealing, which is widespread in some licensed premises around the country.  Ecstasy has been blamed for the deaths of up to 20 young Irish people in the past three years.  The long-term effects of ecstasy are largely unknown.  Some research indicates long-term psychological problems resulting from its continued use.  It affects memory, can have long-term mood altering effects on users and the fact that so little is known about it is dangerous because it is prevalent here for so-called recreational use.  Last year alone gardaí seized about 124,000 tablets, an indication of the scale of the problem we face in dealing with the trafficking of that drug.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the gardaí to take tough action for the purposes of investigating suspicious events and prevents those convicted of drug trafficking offences from becoming involved in the staging and promotion of dances or in the licensed trade.  The Bill properly anticipates that front men might be used by organised drug traffickers to run such events.  While section 21 provides that a front man will also be barred from holding a licence, it should also be an offence to assist a shadow licence holder to operate a licence.  Such measures would go some way towards tackling the drugs crisis.  As we deal with the supply side of the drugs crisis, we must put in place measures to provide real long-term solutions to the demand side of the problem.  During the passage of the Criminal Assets Bureau last July, I tabled an amendment to provide that all assets seized from drug barons and organised criminals should properly be ploughed into the provision of therapeutic rehabilitative services for addicts.  I argued it was an appropriate way in which the proceeds of those ill-gotten gains could be used to provide direct assistance to the communities and individuals who have been destroyed by the activities of the drug barons.  It is inexplicable that proposal was voted down on the bureaucratic and unconvincing argument that it was up to the Department of Finance to make such allocations to the Department of Health. That failure to integrate the Departments of Justice, Health and Finance shows a lateral thinking and an unwillingness to adapt an integrated approach to deal with the problem, but that is not new.  The Departments of Justice and Health have not adopted an integrated response to the drugs crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> Tragically, drugs are an integral part of growing up in large areas of the country.  Some children do not know a life outside heroin addiction or the abuse of other substances.  A long-term drugs policy cannot simply be built on a &ldquo;just say no&rdquo; approach, given that so many thousands of our young people have already said yes.  A purely penal approach does not provide the full answer, although a very strong penal approach is required.  There is a difficulty in dovetailing the two approaches to the problem.  The response to the problem must take account of education, therapeutic services and other measures, such as the provision of long-term therapeutic services to those addicts who, tragically, have already said yes.  They need counselling over the long-term.</P>
    <P>I question, as I have before, the continued use of methadone maintenance as the main plank of the Government's response to drug addiction. There are still addicts presenting for treatment in Dublin and elsewhere who are put on waiting lists. That should not happen.  Recently at a meeting of our subcommittee on drugs we expressed great concern that, despite the crisis and the rhetoric about drugs being top of the agenda, there were still waiting lists for addicts presenting for treatment with their parents or other members of their families.  That is not acceptable.  The existence of such waiting lists highlights a failure to recognise the urgency of the response required.  The Government is making a mistake by adopting methadone maintenance as the primary plank of its response to the drugs crisis.  Methadone maintenance is a vital tool in stabilising chaotic drug abusers, but essentially it is a short-term response.  It contains the problem, but it is not a long-term response. Neither has methadone maintenance, as a therapy, been evaluated as to its success compared to the proven success of long-term residential drug free recovery programmes, such as those provided in the Coolmine centre.</P>
    <P>They have a very high success rate and are always full.  They have long waiting lists for persons who want the sort of long-term therapeutic drug-free approach to treatment, which is provided at Coolmine, the Rutland and other such centres.</P>
    <P>A focused public education campaign about ecstasy is needed because so many recreational users of the drug are unaware of its dangerous side effects.  A clear campaign listing the dangers of using ecstasy must be made available to the public in a digestible way that will reach out to young people who use it.</P>
    <P>In August 1995 <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that &ldquo;drug agencies estimate that at least 25,000 tabs of ecstasy were sold to recreational users in Ireland each weekend&rdquo;.  Earlier, <i>Hot Press,</i> which is close to the music scene and a good indicator of use, estimated that &ldquo;at least 50,000 tabs of ecstasy are sold in Ireland every week&rdquo;.  It is not only a dance based phenomenon, although I know this Bill deals with the impact of ecstasy on the licensed dance trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> There was a tragic quote by a young teenager from a deprived area of Dublin who, when asked by a journalist, said: &ldquo;My idea of a great night out is to get a takeaway, drop an &ldquo;E&rdquo; and watch a video&rdquo;.  It is a pathetic indication of the poverty of that young person's aspiration that that sort of an evening represents his idea of a great night out.  &ldquo;E&rdquo; can lead to brain damage, hepatitis, panic attacks, mania, depression and, in some cases, death.</P>
    <P>The single most dangerous effect of &ldquo;E&rdquo; relates to body temperature.  MDMA or ecstasy interferes with the body's thermostat, allowing users to overheat without feeling any personal discomfort.Nearly all the deaths attributed to ecstasy have been as a result of heat stroke.  There is an urgent need for a focused campaign to appeal to those young people who use ecstasy as a recreational drug to know what they are dealing with.</P>
    <P>Young users often mix ecstasy with alcohol, which can be fatal.  Users now find it cheaper to buy an ecstasy tablet than to go on a night's drinking.  These issues are frightening for most parents who know drugs are widely and easily available to young people at all sorts of venues. We have heard of a 14 year old in Cork who was making plenty of money dealing ecstasy to other young people.  A hard-hitting public information campaign would alert those young people to the dangers of using the drug.  There is an immediate danger of death if the drug interferes with a person's metabolism and if it is mixed with alcohol. We have heard that some persons who died used only half a tab of ecstasy, yet it had fatal consequences.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures proposed in the Bill. As the Minister said, it will go a long way towards making it more difficult for persons to continue to make money from the misfortune of young people wrapped up in the drugs culture.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 18 need careful scrutiny.  These sections provide for the revocation of dancing, singing and drink licences and consequential disqualification for a number of years.  This approach is, of course, correct in principle, but we need to look at the basis on which the court will make such an order.  One of the grounds on which the order can be made is that the licence holder did not exercise proper control over the premises to prevent &ldquo;the sale, supply or distribution of controlled drugs&rdquo;.  We need to be careful whether this test of proper control is not imposing an unsustainable test, particularly on publicans.  We must be fair-minded and take a rational approach, which is achievable.</P>
    <P>I do not think, for example, it would be fair for a publican to face disqualification simpliciter for four years simply because drugs were sold on his premises.  The test should cover a situation where members of the Garda pointed out to the licence holder that known dealers were on the premises and the licence holder failed to do anything about it.  That would be fairer.  To remove a licence is quite a strong and radical penalty on any business <Col N="723" /> person.  To be fair to publicans, we cannot place unsustainable obligations on them.  The test must be fair, acceptable and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I am glad that many publicans have stated they are willing to become involved in the front line, combating the distribution of drugs on their premises.  Of course, they are interested &mdash; they are parents, as are their customers.  Every effort should be made across society to make an impact and to help the authorities in whatever way we can.</P>
    <P>Conferring extra powers on the Garda in relation to unlicensed dances, known as raves, is welcome.  Gardaí will be able to order the organisers and DJs to leave the scene and remove their equipment.  Gardaí will be able to stop people on their way to the rave, seize sound equipment, if necessary, and enter premises without warrant for the purpose of investigation.</P>
    <P>All these measures, in themselves, are good and properly motivated.  They respond to the public who are asking for tough legislation.  We have a duty to legislate but we must do so carefully.Licensing laws are traditionally tricky and constantly challenged.  If we are to get it right it is important to spend a good deal of time making sure the Bill is properly balanced and will achieve its stated purpose of combating drug trafficking, given the modern prevalence among young people for using drugs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am glad we will have a gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage, which I believe will be taken next week.  It is useful to have the Minister's Second Stage speech, which outlines her thinking and intentions behind the various sections, because that provides an invaluable aid when framing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and I thank the Government Whip for persuading the Government to grant time for a proper debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell for their contributions to the debate.  The Government has agreed to take Committee Stage next week and, as Deputy O'Donnell said, it will give Members a chance to look at the legislation to see if amendments need to be made.</P>
      <P>This legislation deals with a particular problem which has arisen.  It is not the total measure of legislation available to deal with drug abuse or drug trafficking, including that by owners of premises who may themselves be involved in selling drugs.</P>
      <P>There is a gap in existing drug legislation.  The climate was different when the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, was passed.  I and the Government felt it was necessary to tackle the problem of easy availability of drugs in places of entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation deals with the owners of licensed premises or places of entertainment who <Col N="724" /> knowingly allow their premises to be used to sell drugs.  If the owner is involved in drug trafficking but does not allow his premises to be used for such purposes, he can be convicted under other legislation.  This is additional legislation to strengthen the hand of the gardaí.  During my discussions with gardaí, I was told that if they convicted a licence holder of drug trafficking, there was nothing in our laws to stop that person continuing to run his business once he served his sentence.However, this legislation does not cover the panoply of existing powers which gardaí have to deal with drug abuse and drug trafficking.  This legislation was introduced to tighten the gap in existing legislation.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell said, this is tough legislation because it allows a person's licence to be revoked.  Under it he will not get it back after five years and in some cases could be denied the right to run a licensed premises again.  That is a severe penalty to impose on anyone.  I hope we do not need to use that power too often.</P>
    <P>I also welcome today's statement by the rural publicans that they will undertake a nation-wide campaign in co-operation with the Garda Síochána to combat drug abuse.  Most licence holders are responsible people who do not knowingly allow their premises to be used for any form of crime.  It is self-defeating for them to turn a blind eye to crime in their premises because their law-abiding clients will drift away if fighting occurs or handbags are stolen.</P>
    <P>We all know the gardaí cannot tackle the scourge of drug abuse on their own.  They require the co-operation of people such as the vintners and those who organise music events, etc. However, when people gather in a crowd, a crime can be committed by stealth without the owner's knowledge.  I have tried to build a safeguard into this legislation so that people who lose their licences when this occurs can clear their names. Although these measures are tough, their sole target is the unscrupulous individuals trying to turn our children into drug addicts and destroy their lives.  The law-abiding publican and licence holder will have nothing to fear as long as they maintain a &ldquo;clean house&rdquo;, as it is called in the business, and do not become involved in drugs dealing.  I am aware of only one person currently serving a sentence for allowing his premises to be used to sell drugs or contraband substances.</P>
    <P>It is important to send a message to people who make money out of young people, particularly those who do not have the burdens of family life and have high disposable incomes to spend in pubs, dance halls and entertainment venues.  It is important that the owners of such establishments do not allow them to become the death beds of young people, as happened recently with the increased use of ecstasy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a matrix of measures to give the gardaí additional powers to deal with drug abuse.  Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned the current powers of the gardaí when he referred to an incident in Wicklow where they disrupted a rave <Col N="725" /> and seized drugs with an estimated street value of £10,000.  The gardaí also broke up a rave in a derelict building in Bellevue wood, Glen of the Downs, which was attended by 200 people.  They seized 1,500 LSD tablets and 100 ecstasy tablets and arrested a number of people.  Although the party involved in that rave broke up the rave later regrouped elsewhere.  However, the gardaí were able to enter the second location where they arrested 11 people and seized more LSD tablets and cannabis resin.</P>
    <P>The gardaí can object to the grant or renewal of a licence and they also have certain powers under anti-drug and public order legislation. However, there is nothing to prevent a convicted drug trafficker trying to get into the public house or dance hall business.  I am talking about someone with a conviction for drug trafficking who buys a public house and sets up business or who uses someone else who does not have a conviction, to set up the business.  This legislation prohibits the appointment of a &ldquo;shadow director&rdquo;, as it is known in the business world.</P>
    <P>Under present legislation, the gardaí cannot apply to the court at any time of the year, not just at the annual licensing sessions, to have a licensed premises closed down because of drug abuse.  This is a lacuna in the legislation.  The licensing courts are held in September each year.  However, if something happens in a licensed premises in March or April, there is nothing the gardaí can do to revoke the licence until the court period in September.  These are important new measures.</P>
    <P>I have amended the drug trafficking legislation to allow gardaí enter premises in plain clothes which, heretofore, they could not do without a warrant.  Specific powers are also being given to the gardaí in relation to unlicensed dances.  They will now be allowed to stop people on their way to dances or to a place where it is suspected drug abuse may occur.</P>
    <P>When this legislation comes into operation the Garda will no longer be depending on the existing public order law to deal with specific problems. They will have this legislation to strengthen their hands in getting at the problem before it develops.  It will have an effect on the way young people gather in places of entertainment.  We will probably see an end to the holding of raves once this legislation is brought into effect.  I will not weep if these rave dances, which have been prevalent for four or five years, come to an end because there are grave dangers attached to allowing that sort of large gathering of unsupervised young people in a place where anything can happen.  Because parents do not know where their children are going they have no way of arranging to collect them or checking the company their children are keeping.</P>
    <P>Such gatherings are not quite as common now; their glamour seems to have disappeared.  Perhaps the reason is that so many other premises have access to late licences and young people can frequent bona fide venues.  We have all seen what happens in cities such as Dublin in places where <Col N="726" /> young people gather and drink late into the evening.  We have a responsibility to ensure that when having fun they are not at risk of death or serious illness from drugs.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputy O'Donnell's points had to do with the general drug treatment facilities which should be available.  I will not go into issues such as methadone treatment because we are dealing specifically with a section of the licensing laws which relates to who should hold licences. We are not dealing with opening times and other such matters.  I cannot accept amendments about seven day licences, Sunday opening, etc.  This legislation deals with a particular problem where drugs are openly sold on licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue stated that the £1,500 fine was inadequate.  On summary conviction of using a premises without a licence, a person is fined £1,500 or 12 months' imprisonment.  The £1,500 fine is the maximum permissible in the District Court.  To impose a larger fine could be unconstitutional, being in breach of the minor offence provisions of the Constitution.  Of course there are more stringent penalties where it is found that drugs are on the premises &mdash; the loss of a licence for life is a very stringent penalty.  If it is found that the licence holder not only has allowed his or her premises to be used but is involved in drug trafficking, that person will be prosecuted under other legislation.  The person may be punished twice; he or she will lose the licence under the provisions of this Bill and may receive a penal sentence under other drug trafficking legislation. To marrying this Bill with existing drug legislation involves a good, but difficult, day's work.</P>
    <P>I hope the vintners will see this Bill as necessary, that it protects their premises as well as the young and not so young who use them.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  There is major concern about the waiting period for appointments for cardiac procedures in Cork University Hospital.  I am aware of people who are waiting over seven months for an angiogram while the cardiac laboratory in Cork University Hospital only operates on a three day week basis. The Minister for Health needs to provide adequate funding immediately to allow the facility in Cork University Hospital to operate on a full-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> Patients have died while waiting for angioplasts and angiograms in the Southern Health Board area.  In 1996 over £0.6 million was spent on providing a new cardiac catheterization laboratory at the hospital and a significant amount of this money was raised in voluntary contributions.  A second operating theatre and an expanded cardiac ITU service were put in place in 1994 and a second cardiac surgeon was appointed in April 1996.  A second cardiologist was appointed in the past few months.  However, since then neither of the two surgeons is operating to their full potential and this is as much a source of frustration to them as it is to the unfortunate people who are anxiously awaiting heart surgery.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to learn recently that the Department of Health paid £1 million to send 100 heart patients to Belfast for open heart surgery.  In addition, a further £200,000 was paid to the Blackrock Clinic, Dublin, in respect of heart surgery operations for public patients.  There is no reason these operations could not have been performed in Cork and greater value for money obtained.</P>
    <P>Cork University Hospital has submitted a tender to the Minister for Health to carry out a further 250 cardiac procedures as part of the Minister's initiative to reduce waiting lists.  It is vital that the Minister should confirm as soon as possible that Cork University Hospital can commence these operations and that adequate funding will be provided.  It is demoralising for staff and patients to have a fully equipped modern unit which is incapable of operating to its potential because of lack of resources.  The Minister must act without delay to provide sufficient funding to Cork University Hospital to allow the cardiac unit realise its full potential.  My concern is for the patients in the Southern Health Board area and the wider Munster region who are experiencing unnecessary delays in appointments for cardiac procedures.</P>
    <P>On a personal note, as one who had a by-pass at the hospital, I know of the anxieties of patients and their families who are awaiting this operation.I strongly appeal to the Minister to ensure that the necessary resources are put in place because families and relatives come to us regularly to tell us of the cancellation of operations and angiograms.  This is unsatisfactory for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me the opportunity to support Deputy Wallace in raising this issue of the cardiac unit at Cork University Hospital.  The delays are unacceptable and there is an urgent need for additional resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people have been well served by the existing services at the hospital, many lives have been saved and the quality of life has been improved for many people.  However, it is unacceptable that a vital lifesaving unit should be so starved of resources and that people must wait <Col N="728" /> so long for procedures and appointments due to the lack of staff and resources at the cardiac unit and the hospital generally.</P>
    <P>A number of Members and their relatives and friends have availed of the service in question. We realise the constraints under which the professionals work and recognise that service is underfunded, poorly staffed and generally unsatisfactory.It must be remembered that patients are often transferred to general wards in the immediate aftermath of operations.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take the necessary action in respect of the cardiac unit at Cork University Hospital and make available the resources that are urgently required. Such resources will save lives.  We do not want people to die because they experienced long delays in obtaining appointments or in having their operations.  This is a lifesaving unit and it should be given top priority by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1994 and 1995, the Department made substantial funding available to Cork University Hospital in respect of its ICU-cardiac services development.  As a result of this investment, a second cardiac surgeon, a second cardiologist and a total of 67 support staff were appointed between 1994 and 1996.  At the beginning of this year, the Southern Health Board confirmed it would perform an additional 150 cardiac procedures during 1997.  This will bring its agreed activity level for this speciality in 1997 to a total of 400 procedures.  In the first quarter of 1997, I have been advised by the board that activity levels for cardiac procedures are up by almost 50 per cent on the equivalent period in 1996 and it is confident the agreed targets for 1997 will be achieved.  I am satisfied this additional activity will impact positively on waiting lists for cardiac procedures.</P>
      <P>On a general point, while cardiac surgery services have been developed and enhanced in recent years at both the Mater and Cork University Hospitals, I am keenly aware the demand for these services has continued to increase in the interim.  With this in mind, a thorough examination of service needs has been carried out to ensure the service is delivered in the most efficient and effective manner with patient care a priority.  An option appraisal group has been established in the Department which is currently assessing proposals for four hospitals in respect of the further development of cardiac surgery services.The four hospitals chosen all have merits in favour of locating the service on their campus. The group has been asked to look carefully at the case for locating the service on each of these sites. It is envisaged that cardiac service throughout will be increased nationally by 500 cases per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister looks forward to receiving the report of the option appraisal group which will be presented to him in the coming weeks.  The question of additional cardiac procedures at Cork <Col N="729" /> University Hospital will be determined in the light of this report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 August 1969, Patrick O'Halloran was born to his mother Mrs. Nora O'Halloran and his father who still reside at Boleybeg, Barna, County Galway.  In February 1970, he received a three-in-one vaccination under the State administered scheme and received further vaccinations between March and May of the same year.  This person, who is now 28 years old, has the intelligence of a one year old infant and his physical development is comparable to that of a child of eight or nine years of age.  Patrick's mother is convinced this is a result of the administration of the three-in-one vaccination.</P>
      <P>My attempts to assist Mrs. O'Halloran's investigation into the source of the vaccination have failed because the Western Health Board and the Department of Health, which were charged with responsibility for administering State medicine, did not keep proper records.  We are aware that batch No. 3741, which was administered to a child of the Best family in Cork, was identified as being the offending batch.  This batch was administered at approximately the same time that Patrick O'Halloran of Boleybeg, Barna received his vaccinations.However, because no records were kept, all attempts to establish the connection have failed due to the negligence of State authorities. The State has a moral duty to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the O'Halloran family to provide for Patrick's future care, and to others who find themselves in similar circumstances.</P>
      <P>I raised this tragic case on numerous occasions in the House and received various answers from Ministers from different parties.  I make no accusations against the current Minister of State but it is time serious consideration was given at Government level in respect of this and similar cases, to the State's obligations and responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I will quote from a letter I received from a solicitor who took up this case and ran into difficulties similar to those experienced by Mrs. O'Halloran and myself.  He states:</P>
      <P>As you are aware, despite many attempts, it is proving extremely difficult to obtain information as to whether Patrick O'Halloran was administered a Three-in-one vaccine which was out of the offending batch (as located in the Best case).  In other words, the State is refusing to supply this information to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the hepatitis C scandal, it seems unacceptable that the State would refuse to give this information to the mother of a child, whose child has suffered grievously.  It would appear that the Department\Western Health Board should be in a position to obtain this information.  The Department purchased the products from Wellcome Corporation and should be in a position to trace the offending <Col N="730" /> batch (as to whether same was administered in the West of Ireland at the time).</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the State is adopting a similar approach in the Patrick O'Halloran case, as is being adopted in the hepatitis C case, namely that information is not forthcoming, it is refusing to advise citizens of relevant details concerning medication administered to them.  The hepatitis C disaster has reinforced the view that the State is obliged, in relation to the administration of blood, to ensure that same is free from contamination; clearly, a similar obligation prevails in relation to the degree of care which must be adhered in administering three in one injections.  As the State administered these injections, a very high onus would be on the State to ensure that products are not contaminated.  If there is a suspicion of contamination, (which there is in Patrick O'Halloran's case and in many others), it would appear that there is an onus on the State to investigate the matter in full.  Such an investigation would require, in my view, that contact be made with Wellcome Corporation in relation to the offending batch which was administered.  After the Best case, it would appear that the State should have examined the extent to which the offending batch was administered with a view to tracing those who received it.  No such proactive investigation has taken place.</P>
    <P>Between 1968 and 1971, the Eastern Health Board acted as the purchasing agent for vaccine for the entire country.  Lot No. 69684 was purchased and administered during that period. There were 200,000 does in that lot which contained batch No. 3741.  Patrick O'Halloran received his vaccinations during that period.  This cannot be proven because the State did not keep the necessary records.  It is because of negligence on the part of the State, not that of Patrick's parents, that the connection cannot be proven. However, their child is proof of it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of the Government.  I ask him to consider making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the O'Halloran family to provide for Patrick's future.  His parents are elderly and they are gravely concerned about what will become of their child when they pass on.</P>

      <P>The Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination was established in 1977 to examine cases of possible adverse reactions to whooping cough vaccination.  In the case referred to by Deputy Molloy, the group consulted medical staff at University College Hospital, Galway and the family doctor as part of its assessment.  The group also consulted other medical personnel who dealt with the case and, on the basis of all these consultations, together with an examination of the person and the medical records, came to the conclusion that his disability <Col N="731" /> was not caused by whooping cough vaccination.</P>
      <P>A full copy of the expert medical group's file on this person was sent to his mother in June 1993.  The documents on this file confirm that the family doctor administered the diphtheria /pertussis/tetanus vaccine but there is no record of the person's immunisation.</P>
      <P>In July 1993 the Department wrote to the manufacturer requesting information on batch No. 3741 &mdash; the vaccine batch which the Supreme Court held was liable for Kenneth Best's brain damage.  The reply from the manufacturer indicated that the batch was produced around March 1968 but, due to the passage of time, it was not possible to establish during what subsequent period the batch was distributed to specific parts of the country.  The Department also wrote to the health boards, including the Western Health Board, in July 1993 seeking information on the distribution of batch No. 3741.  Again it was not possible to establish the extent of the distribution of the batch.  Therefore, it will be clear that I cannot indicate that the vaccine administered to this person came from batch No. 3741.</P>
      <P>The Department wrote to the Western Health Board again in December 1993 and in April 1995 about this case.  Health board officials checked the registers in use at the time of this person's immunisation and found no entry of immunisation, which position was confirmed to the Department again last week.  The health board has also confirmed that there is no record of any usage of batch No. 3741.  In addition, I understand the Western Health Board facilitated the family's solicitors in examining the health board's files.</P>
      <P>I am aware this sad case has been raised by Deputy Molloy on many occasions since 1984 but I can assure him that everything possible has been done to facilitate the family and their solicitors in establishing all the known facts.  I very much regret that no further steps can be taken to establish or eliminate the linkage the Deputy implied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House, I should like to share my time with Deputy Michael Kitt.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the water crisis in my constituency at Laurencetown near Ballinasloe where there has been a group water scheme in operation serving the Laurencetown, Eyrecourt, Fahy, Esker, Meelick and adjoining areas but whose source has been polluted for many years.  This causes a major problem each year from May to October when no water is available to local people who have no option but to travel some miles to avail themselves of water for normal human usage for the purposes of showers, baths etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is so bad that, at a public meeting <Col N="732" /> attended by approximately 300 people on Friday last &mdash; attended by Deputy Michael Kitt, me and others &mdash; the local priest said he could not risk using the water even to baptise children.  The local school, with four teachers and a large number of pupils, has also encountered many problems.</P>
    <P>This scheme serves approximately 175 houses and 200 farms.  Some people have to purchase water where it is available or use polluted water which is not fit for human consumption or personal use and can be used only to flush toilets and for various outdoor tasks.</P>
    <P>For the past ten years we have been endeavouring to have this matter resolved.  The scheme is known as the Laurencetown-Eyrecourt group water scheme.  From 1993 onwards stringent efforts were undertaken by the local community group to secure an alternative connection.  We were informed by the Department categorically in September/October 1993 and again in January 1994, orally and in writing, that until progress had been made on the Ballinasloe regional scheme, nothing could be done in respect of the Laurencetown-Eyrecourt one.  Phase one of the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme was sanctioned, serving the parish of Clontuskert right up to the border of the parish of Laurencetown.</P>
    <P>For the past year we have been seeking an urgent, temporary, whole-time connection from the Ballinasloe regional scheme at Lismanny on the borders of Clontuskert and Laurencetown at a cost of £205,000.  We were assured by the Department of the Environment last autumn that it would be included in the 1997 Estimates and were absolutely astounded by the Government decision to abolish water charges and vest total responsibility for group water schemes in the local authority.  We had meetings with Galway County Council yesterday and were informed they had not the requisite funds to resolve this water crisis.</P>
    <P>We want a firm commitment from the Minister that this money will be made available forthwith, bearing in mind the buoyancy of our economy and the crisis this represents for these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The worst decision ever taken by the Minister was to devolve responsibility, as he described it, to local authorities for group water schemes on 26 March last.  Effectively that meant the Laurencetown-Eyrecourt group water scheme was excluded from the departmental list and transferred to Galway County Council.  I understand the council has received £500,000 for the implementation of group water schemes, yet all we need for this one is £205,000.  Unfortunately, some 37 schemes costing almost £1 million have already been transferred to Galway County Council which must be implemented first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are pleading with the Minister to obtain the £205,000 to enable this scheme to proceed.  As Deputy Noel Treacy said, we are talking about a small stretch of piping for a supply within two miles of Laurencetown village.  It would represent <Col N="733" /> very good value in that it serves some 200 households and farmers.</P>
    <P>The local priest who spoke at our meeting on Friday regretted that he could not offer participants a cup of tea, as would be normal practice, and informed us of the position in the national school where barrels of water have to be brought in.  Some people even have to purchase water to brush their teeth.</P>
    <P>I must also emphasise the concerns of dairy farmers in the region who are being penalised because they cannot comply with the requisite standard in their milk supplies.  It also affects those involved in agri-tourism who used to accommodate visitors in the summer.  They cannot provide showers or baths and this lack of water will mean they will be unable to attract those visitors back.</P>
    <P>Now that Ballinasloe Urban Council has done its work and the administrators of the Clontuskert scheme have given permission for the extension of the piping, we appeal to the Minister to have this scheme implemented even at this late stage.  Local people have been told the water is of such bad quality they must not use it, even when boiled.  This must be rectified by the provision of £205,000 by the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>The Laurencetown-Eyrecourt group water scheme was completed in 1976 and served 131 houses and associated farms at that time.  Since then the scheme has been extended to serve more than 200 households and current water demand is estimated at around 140,000 gallons per day.</P>
      <P>The original source, a spring well, was unable to meet increased demand and an adjacent stream was used to augment supply.  This source is subject to organic pollution as a result of agricultural activity within its catchment.  There is no alternative source of quality water supply available to the group locally.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council's long-term proposals are to serve the Laurencetown, Eyrecourt and Kiltormer areas by way of an extension of the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme at an estimated cost of £2.8 million.  This proposal includes a trunk main to Laurencetown, and a booster station which would enable water to be pumped to the group's existing reservoir and distributed to group members through the existing group scheme distribution network.  Galway schemes to a value of more than £60 million are included in the water and sewerage services capital works programme for 1997, but it has not been possible to include the Ballinasloe scheme among these.  As an interim measure, the Laurencetown-Eyrecourt group proposed linking its scheme to the Clontuskert group water scheme which in turn is linked to the Ballinasloe public water supply, at an estimated cost of about £205,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> Both Deputies will be aware that, last January, the Minister announced responsibility for the administration of the group water scheme's programme was being devolved to the local authorities.In March, block grant allocations were made to local authorities totalling £10 million in respect of group schemes approved to commence construction this year and for small water and sewerage schemes costing up to £250,000.</P>
    <P>Group schemes in County Galway have been allocated grants, including European Regional Development Fund grants, totalling almost £1.4 million in 1997, by far the largest allocation for any county.  Under the devolved arrangements, it is a matter for Galway County Council to decide on priorities locally.</P>

The position with regard to the county council's proposal to extend the Ballinasloe regional water supply scheme will be kept under review and the Deputies' concerns about the Eyrecourt scheme will be borne in mind in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 258 together.</P>
      <P>The total strength of the Permanent Defence Force is currently 11,925 of which 217 are female personnel.  The current strengths of the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service are 9,996, 942 and 987, respectively.  There are 192 female personnel serving with the Army, 16 serving with the Air Corps and nine serving with the Naval Service.</P>
      <P>A statistical breakdown of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service by rank and gender are set out in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. Women are eligible for service in the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and to compete for all appointments on an equal basis and under the same conditions as those which apply to men.  All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.  In essence, the basis of selection is suitability rather than gender.  Women are eligible for employment on operational and ceremonial duties and for assignment to military courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I advised the Deputy on 13 March last, I have no plans to introduce a specific separate statutory independent appeals system for fishing vessel licensing.  The principal reason I take this view is that there is already available an independent statutory mechanism, i.e., the office of the Ombudsman, which affords any person with a grievance about a licensing decision ready and inexpensive access to an authoritative system of review in which all Department papers and the relevant Departmental staff are available to assist the Ombudsman in the interest of fair play.</P>
      <P>The Department may be drawing an analogy with the introduction of an independent appeals mechanism for aquaculture licensing which is proposed under the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill currently before the House.  In the case of the aquaculture industry there are obvious linkages with the norms and procedures in planning law generally.  The issue of an aquaculture licence especially in areas outside the jurisdiction of a local authority involves the Minister in discharging a planning type function where public notice procedures and the interests of all relevant parties must be taken into account.  It is entirely reasonable that such a function should be subject to an independent appeals mechanism.  By contrast fishing boat licensing involves the consideration of individual applications which are governed explicitly by pre-set policy criteria which are in turn set against the background of European Union fleet policy which constrains the fishing fleet capacity of member states.  The rules applied to the granting of licences are relatively simple and clearcut.  If the applicant meets the requirements then a licence issues as a matter of course.  Most of the difficulties which arise in relation to the licensing system are not about any alleged unfairness in its administration but rather about the policy guidelines themselves especially the current replacement requirement.</P>
      <P>In this regard and I have already explained to the House today the reasons the new EU fleet plan will not, in our assessment, materially impact on the Irish fleet over the next five years in terms of percentage reductions.  But fleet capacity will continue to be constrained by reference to overall fleet targets.  Sea fishing boat licensing will, therefore, continue to be designed to maintain strict control on all proposed new entrants into the Irish fleet.  Licences can only be approved where the applicants undertake to remove capacity from the Sea Fishing Boat Registry which is at least equal to that of the proposed new capacity.  I do not envisage any change in that fundamental policy parameter.</P>
      <P>While I do not see the need for an independent licensing appeals system, I do accept that there is room for improvement in the present level of service to fishermen which I believe we can deliver without recourse to new statutory arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The volume of licence applications and the number of transactions on the fishing vessel register <Col N="738" /> has increased significantly in recent years. This has significantly increased the workload of the relevant unit in the Department and as part of the ongoing strategic management initiative within the Department the staffing and other resources of this unit are being critically reviewed with a view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness with which licence and registration applications are processed in order to deliver a better customer service to the fishing sector.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the programme to upgrade fish processing firms to meet the mandatory standards under the EU health and hygiene regulations is virtually complete at this stage with some residual work in the case of a few plants nearing completion.</P>
      <P>In order to assist fish processing firms to comply with the regulatory requirements within the time frame of end 1996, grant aid was provided under the Fisheries Operational Programme to over 90 firms representing a total investment of over £13 million for upgrading purposes.  A final round of checks on upgraded premises is being completed by Department inspectors which has confirmed that the processing sector has been brought into line with the EU standards.</P>
      <P>Remaining funds for fish processing under the Fisheries Operational Programme will be targeted on new capacity expansion projects to deliver on job creation and output targets for the sector.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Fisheries some IR£9 million in EU aid has already been provided to support a total investment of IR£31 million in the fish processing sector.  Most of the aid provided to date has been geared towards assisting the sector to upgrade facilities in line with mandatory EU health and hygiene standards and consequently to maintain existing employment and facilitate further development by these firms.</P>
      <P>Remaining funding is now being targeted at new capacity expansion projects in the processing sector.  To date, 11 development projects have been approved for over £1.5 million aid representing total investment of nearly £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The targeted investment support for new development projects is designed to deliver on <Col N="739" /> the objectives of job creation and increased output from the processing sector.</P>
    <P>I am also seeking in the context of the mid-term review of the Community support framework to secure additional funds for fish processing projects.  Such funding will be essential to support a significant number of new capacity expansion projects in the pipeline.</P>

      <P>I have had several discussions, both formal and informal, with my Spanish colleague, Minister Palacio, over the past 12 months on EU fisheries business generally as well as on matters of direct bilateral concern.  I had a brief discussion with her in the margins of the Fisheries Council on 15 April when we agreed that a further meeting of officials at high level should take place in the coming weeks to review issues of mutual concern and to discuss fisheries control and enforcement issues in particular.</P>
      <P>This follows a formal exchange of letters between the Spanish Minister and myself earlier this month in which we agreed to formalise ongoing contracts on EU and bilateral fisheries matters between the two administrations through regular high level bilateral meetings and enhanced contact and technical exchange between our fisheries inspection services.  I believe that the enhanced communication and co-operation on fisheries control in particular which will result from these regular contacts will assist both administrations to monitor and control relevant fishing activity both at sea and on land.  It will also contribute to better appreciation on the part of the Spanish authorities of our serious concerns about illegal fishing activity, irrespective of nationality, in these waters.  The House will be aware from media reports in recent weeks that the Spanish authorities for their part have expressed concern about recent boardings and detentions of Spanish fishing vessels.  In all contacts, at all levels, with the Spanish authorities on this particular issue we have made it clear that all breaches of fishing law detected in these waters will continue to be dealt with as appropriate, reflecting Ireland's commitment to deliver even-handed and effective fisheries surveillance and enforcement to protect fish stocks.</P>

      <P>The circumstances in which the courts may order the confiscation of a fishing vessel are set out in section 14 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1994.  Such confiscation may arise on conviction for serious breaches of fisheries law.  In particular courts may order a vessel to be confiscated on a first conviction if the offence is considered to have been a serious abuse of conservation measures.  The courts may also order a boat to be confiscated in respect of a second or subsequent conviction committed on board the same boat within three years of the previous offence subject to detailed rules on continuity of ownership which are laid down in section 14.</P>
      <P>It is of course a matter for the courts to determine and impose the penalties available under the law.</P>

      <P>On 3 March 1997 Dublin Port was one of eight ports vested as a commercial semi-State company under the Harbours Act, 1996.  The effect of this is that the new Dublin Port Company will be able to operate as a commercial enterprise, free from undue control by the State.</P>
      <P>The current investment programme for Dublin Port of some £36.0 million is co-financed through my Department by the EU from the Operational Programme for Transport, the Cohesion Fund and Ireland/Wales Maritime INTERREG Comunity Initiative and continues until 1999.</P>
      <P>While the State remains the sole shareholder, and as such will operate a broad system of corporate goverance, the new structure of Dublin Port Company will mean that the port is free to manage and develop its services on a commercial basis.  At the same time the company's accountability for operational and financial performance will be increased.  Dublin Port is being given the infrastructure and flexibility to operate efficiently, effectively and ultimately to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors, tourism and the economy as a whole.</P>

      <P>The consent of the father of a child whose parents were never married to each other is not required for passport purposes unless he has acquired joint guardianship centers through a court order.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office is not automatically aware of situations where a father is appointed a joint guardian by a court.  Accordingly, if a mother seeking passport facilities for a child claims to be a single parent, the normal practice of the Passport Office is to ask her to sign an affidavit to the effect that she is the child's sole legal guardian and that no other person has been appointed a guardian by a court or by operation of law.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the details provided by the Deputy it would appear that this person can have her child's name included in a new passport by submitting a signed affidavit for which a special form is available from the Passport Office together with the standard documentation and fee.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners are also participating in multi-national discussions with the OECD and the EU on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date the most successful use of the Internet for commerce is in areas where the supply of goods is relatively easy and issues such as quality of the merchandise do not require prior inspection by the client.  VAT rules would vary <Col N="748" /> depending on whether goods or services are involved and on whether the consumer is a business or a private individual.</P>
    <P>Goods purchased on the Internet from within the EU are taxable in the State under the existing intra-Community acquisition procedures.  If the goods are supplied from outside the EU, then they are subject to VAT and EU customs duties on importation in the normal way.  In either case, the tax is payable here and must be accounted for by the Irish customer.</P>
    <P>Services provided on the Internet, for example financial advice or consultancy services, would be subject to VAT under the reverse charge mechanism, which means that the customer must account for VAT through his VAT return.</P>
    <P>A private individual who orders goods on the Internet from a supplier outside the EU will pay VAT on importation in the normal way.  He may also be liable to customs duties.  For goods purchased within the EU, VAT at the rate applicable in the other member state will be payable if the supplier is established in another member state and not required to register here.</P>
    <P>The position for services is more difficult as the place of establishment of the supplier determines whether the supply is subject to VAT or not.  This means that services supplied from within the EU would be taxable, but those supplied on-line from outside the EU would currently not be liable.  It is unlikely that such services have any major impact on VAT revenues at present.</P>
    <P>All present indications are that the level of commerce on the Internet is marginal in terms of overall business.  However, this could change and, as I have mentioned already, the position is being reviewed nationally and internationally.</P>

      <P>There are three EU directives coming wholly or partly under the auspices of my Department that are not currently fully implemented.  The details are as follows:</P>
      <P>Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Cross-Border Credit Transfers.The directive was adopted on 20 December 1996 and entered into force on 27 January 1997. It must be implemented within 30 months of its entering into force, i.e., 26 July 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive provides for the issue and settlement of cross-Border credit transfers from one credit institution to another.  It includes a number <Col N="749" /> of consumer protection measures, such as a minimum period in which transfers must be completed; interest payments in the event of a delay in a transfer; reimbursement in cases of &ldquo;lost&rdquo; transfers; and full transparency in relation to the terms and conditions of transfers.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the directive will be implemented by statutory instrument in good time.</P>
    <P>Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on investor compensation schemes.  The directive was adopted on 3 March 1997 and came into force on 26 March 1997.  It must be implemented within 18 months of the date on which it came into force, i.e., 26 September 1997.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to implement the directive in the Investor Compensation Bill, which is being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Justice and the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Council Directive 94/74/EC on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty was due for implementation on 30 June 1995. The main provisions of the directive were implemented in the Finance Act, 1995 (sections 99 to 102).  The remaining applicable provisions are being implemented administratively and will be legislated for by regulation very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to take Questions Nos. 46 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health oficers, withdrew from negotiations which were being pursued under clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and pursued industrial action in the form of a &ldquo;work-to-rule&rdquo; with effect from 15 January 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Efforts to resolve the impasse continued on an informal basis culminating in a formal meeting under the auspices of the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board on 25 June 1996.  On Wednesday, 26 June I met personally with IMPACT and a delegation of environmental <Col N="751" /> health officers to explore whether or not the provisions of the joint Government/ICTU statement of 15 May 1996 could usefully be applied to resolving the current impasse in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>On 5 July 1996, with the assistance of a facilitator from the Labour Relations Commission, an informal meeting took place between management and the union.  The meeting was of considerable assistance to both sides and, as a result, negotiations continued until quite recently when IMPACT took the decision to escalate the work-to-rule.</P>
    <P>Following renewed contact between both sides, the Health Service Employers' Agency and IMPACT met on 26 March 1997, with a view to re-opening discussions.  As a result, the threatened escalation in the work-to-rule did not tke place.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficult and protracted nature of this dispute, I am still hopeful that a satisfactory resolution can be achieved through established procedures in the near future.  The matter has been referred to the Labour Relations Commission for hearing in early May.</P>
    <P>As regards the incidence of food poisoning, statistics published by my Department show an increase in the number of cases of food poisoning illness notified for the year to date compared to the similar period in 1996.  This increase could be attributed to several factors such as improved surveillance and reporting of such illness and instances where several people were affected in a single outbreak of food poisoning.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious to improve the level, nature and quality of the information available to me and my Department about many common illnesses and diseases.  In this regard, the Deputy will recollect that I have accepted the need for a National Communicable Disease Surveillance Unit to provide a comprehensive broad based approach to the prevention of disease, including food borne disease.  My Department is currently considering the organisational and structural issues involved in conjunction with the relevant agencies and professional interests and will shortly be meeting with the Food Safety Advisory Board on the matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to assure the House of my strong commitment to food safety.  As Deputies are aware, the Government has agreed to the establishment of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland which will be dedicated to ensuring compliance with the very best food safety and hygiene standards.The drafting of the necessary legislation is under way.  Meanwhile, the interim board of the Authority is proceeding with putting in place the necessary structures and administrative systems to ensure the statutory Authority will be able to make a strong and immediate impact in the area of food safety and hygiene.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the national cancer strategy provides for a phased programme of development of hospice services, including the expansion of services and the appointment of additional consultants in palliative care together with support staff.  The expenditure marked with an asterisk represents the first phase of the implementation of this programme and it is intended that further phases will be implemented as detailed arrangements are worked out with the health boards.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it is not possible to give a definitive response at this stage in relation to overall allocations for 1998 which have yet to be finalised.</P>
    <P>The funding provided by health boards to individual hospices relates to their overall service including counselling-social work.  I am aware that the North-Western Health Board has identified the need for a counselling service for families who are bereaved and for staff who have to deal with such stressful situations.  The board has established a small team, which includes representation from the voluntary hospice groups in the board's area, to finalise arrangements on the most effective way of providing this service.  The <Col N="754" /> board hopes to have such a service operational towards the end of this year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of a particular illness.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme, having regard to the fact that the needs of individuals with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or a long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines. Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department has made substantial funds available for the development of the dialysis service at Cavan General Hospital, which serves counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Longford and north Meath. The rest of the region, because of its proximity to Dublin, is served by Beaumont Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the North-Eastern Health Board and I understand that the board has looked at the feasibility of setting up a new service for the Louth-Meath area, but at present the numbers are insufficient to justify the costs involved.  It is satisfied that the needs of Louth-Meath patients are, for the most part, well met by the Cavan and Dublin based services.  However, it is aware that there is some hardship endured by a limited number of patients in north Louth, who have to leave home very early to attend for dialysis in Dublin.  Because of the increase in the past year in the number of patients from the Louth-Meath area who are receiving dialysis at Dubln Hospitals, it has not been possible up to this point to offer flexibility in the timing of the treatments. However, I have asked the board, as a matter of urgency, to examine the specific issue of transportation arrangements, taking into account the individual circumstances of the board's dialysis patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board has confirmed that it is keeping the service needs under review, and it is also exploring the possibility of availing of services at Daisy <Col N="756" /> Hill Hospital, Newry, where the commencement of a new dialysis service is imminent.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Deputy's question regarding the location of each dialysis machine in the country, this information is contained in the following schedule.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I wish to take Questions Nos. 57 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Physiotherapists and occupational therapists similar to all other paramedical professions, have benefited in full from all standard and special pay awards under the various national pay programmes over the last number of years.  The relative position of these professions, in terms of <Col N="757" /> remuneration, has been maintained with those of their colleagues in other paramedical disciplines.</P>
    <P>IMPACT, on behalf of these professions, has been pursuing a pay claim under Clause 2 (iii) &mdash; Annex 1 of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  These negotiations are complex and are being handled by the Health Service Employers' Agency.</P>
    <P>A conciliation hearing at the Labour Relations Commission on Thursday, 17 April 1997 was not successful and IMPACT opted to commence strike action among several of the paramedical professions &mdash; including physiotherapists and occupational therapists &mdash; with effect from Monday, 21 April 1997.  A further conciliation hearing was held at the Labour Relations Commission on Friday, 25 April 1997 following which the matter was referred to the Labour Court for hearing yesterday, Monday, 28 April 1997.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at present other than to say that every effort is being made to resolve this dispute as speedily as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The employment support scheme (ESS) was introduced in 1990.  The scheme is administered by the National Rehabilitation Board and offers financial support to employers to encourage them to employ people with disabilities whose work productivity levels are less than average.There are currently 410 people with disabilities in employment with the assistance of the ESS.</P>
      <P>In view of the success of the scheme, funding has increased each year to meet the demand for places.  In 1997 I allocated an additional £100,000 to the ESS bringing the allocation this year to £1,066,000.  I am currently exploring ways, in consultation with the NRB, to improve the operation of the ESS and to provide funding to meet the commitment set out in Partnership 2000 to increase the numbers employed under the scheme up to 1,000 over the timeframe of the Partnership.</P>

In September 1996 my Department wrote to the Directors of Public Health in each health board drawing their attention to the level of public anxiety about meningitis which had arisen in recent years and asking them to consider what additional public information initiatives might be required in their area.  At present all health boards provide a range of information to parents and teachers and work with schools to allay fears in whatever way possible.  Nonetheless my Department will write to the boards again asking them to give special attention to the particular initiatives required to reassure parents and pupils about meningitis.</P>

    <P>The main aim of the waiting list initiative is the elimination of in-patient waiting lists in excess of 12 months for adults and six months for children in the target specialities: ear, nose and throat, general surgery, gynaecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedics (including hip-knee replacements), plastic surgery, urology and vascular surgery.  In addition both the 1995 and 1996 initiatives also targeted out-patient waiting lists where waiting times are considered excessive.</P>
    <P>Since 1995 a sum of £20 million has been allocated under the waiting list initiative.  During that period a total of 38,109 persons have benefited from the special earmarked funding.  Details of the level of funding allocated to particular specialities is not routinely collected by my Department on the basis that the allocation of waiting list initiative funding to particular specialties is a matter for the health agencies, depending on how progress towards the national target waiting times can best be achieved having regard to the particular needs in each health agency.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> I am happy to assure the Deputy that special measures to reduce waiting lists will continue in 1997.  The provisions of special funding to reduce waiting times continues to be a priority for the Government and a total of £8 million is being provided this year to continue progress in this area.  The funding provided in 1997 brings to £58 million the total resources committed to the reduction of hospital waiting lists since the current initatives commenced in 1993.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): On 1 January 1996 the number of persons covered by medical cards was 1,277,055.  The number of persons removed from the medical card scheme in 1996 was 151,501.  This figure includes deceased persons, persons who have emigrated and persons moving residence from one health board to another.  Therefore, the approximate percentage of medical cards which were regranted to medical card holders following routine reviews of their continued eligibility in 1996 was 88 per cent.  I am satisfied that the current arrangements regarding medical card assessment ensure that all persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants retain their medical card entitlement.</P>

      <Col N="761" /> The allocation of funding between the statutory and voluntary sector reflects the historic development of services to persons with a mental handicap.The division of development moneys between services provided by voluntary and health board agencies is agreed by the local co-ordinating committees and not by me.  The co-ordinating committees are representative of health boards, the voluntary service providers and parents and families of persons with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>The funding and maintenance of the intellectual disability database is the responsibility of the health boards.  The database is the primary mechanism for assessing the current and future needs of persons with a mental handicap.  My Department has set up an audit mechanism to ensure continuing data accuracy, and has also put in place procedures to monitor the completeness of the data.  The Government is committed, under <Col N="762" /> Partnership 2,000 for inclusion, employment and competitiveness, to the development of services to persons with a mental handicap, within overall resource parameters, based on the assessment of need, which I published last week.</P>

      <P>Before the Convention can be ratified by Ireland, it will be necessary to give it the force of law in the State.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme (DCSS) which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme do not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.In the case of a family, where more than one member is certified as being eligible under the scheme, each receives a personal authorisation card.  However, only one payment of £32 will be required provided that the eligible family members use the same pharmacy in any month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  Accordingly, in the case of a family where one or more members are in receipt of a DCSS card, any <Col N="766" /> excess in expenditure over £90 per quarter by the whole family is met under the drugs refund scheme.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> GMS statistics relate to those aged 65 and over.  Based on these and provisional 1996 population estimates, the number of persons aged 65 years and over who are not eligible for a medical card is estimated to be 114,246 and for those aged 75 years and over 23,787.</P>
      <P>Chiropody services are relevant to a number of different client groups, such as the elderly, persons with a mental handicap and persons with a physical disability.  As funding is allocated on the basis of the overall programme for each client group it is not possible to identify separately the total expenditure on the chiropody service. Therefore, the data required to estimated the cost of providing the level of service requested is not available.</P>
      <P>Under the 1970 Health Act, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.  It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide services, such as chiropody services, for themselves or their dependants without hardship.I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.  Consequently, I have no plans to extend the arrangements currently in place.</P>

      <P>Last week I published the Assessment of Need for Services to Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001.  The assessment provides a comprehensive picture of the requirements for additional residential and day services over the period concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 1,439 persons require a residential placement.  This is made up of 159 persons who <Col N="767" /> currently have no service and require a residential service and 1,280 persons who currently receive a day service but also require a residential service.</P>

However, with regard to the reference to section 8 of the Equal Status Bill, 1997 in that reply, it should be noted that because of amendments to the Bill in its passage through the Oireachtas, that reference would now be to section 9.

      <P>On a day to day basis, the conservation interests in SACs are monitored and managed by the locally-based staff of my Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).</P>
      <P>NPWS operates on the basis of seven regional divisions, each headed by a regional manager. Regional staff liaise as necessary with NPWS HQ in Dublin, where the service's administrative and research units are located.</P>
      <P>NPWS local staff are always prepared to discuss with local people their concerns regarding the implications of SAC designation and to explore ways to achieve the protection of such sites in a way that best addresses local concerns.</P>
      <P>Affected persons can, through NPWS local staff, informally object to the extent of designation proposals or to the conditions that are proposed for the protection of these sites.  Use of this informal channel in no way dilutes the more formal rights of objection that apply, whereby owners or occupiers of land in proposed SACs have three months from the date that they are notified under Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997), that their land is affected by designation proposals to object, on scientific grounds, to the proposed designation.</P>
      <P>Under the formal system, objections to the extent of designations or to the protective conditions proposed will be assessed by a Committee, comprising of representatives of landowners-users and other conservation interests, with an independent chairperson.</P>
      <P>Finally, NPWS strategy in individual SACs will in most cases be informed by conservation plans, which are currently being prepared.  Before these plans are finalised, there will be local public consultation where people can make an input to the process, and every effort will be made to take account of such inputs in the final versions of these plans.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that conflicting information has been provided for this matter.  However, the relevant requirements are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Regulation 27 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997 (S.I. No. 94 of 1997), sets out the obligations of local authorities and An Bord Pleanála in granting planning permission within special areas of conservation (SAC).</P>
      <P>Regulation 27 (1) provides that a local authority when duly considering an application for planning permission in respect of a proposed development in an SAC, which is likely to have a significant effect thereon, either individually or in combination with other developments, shall ensure that an appropriate assessment of the implications for the site in view of the site's conservation objectives is undertaken.</P>
      <P>Regulation 27 (2) stipulates that an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in respect of a proposed development, prepared in accordance with a requirement of or under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 86 of 1995), shall be an appropriate assessment in this context.</P>
      <P>In practice it is unlikely that in most SACs it will be necessary to do a formal EIA for domestic buildings as a domestic building would be unlikely to have a significant impact.  However, each case will be considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>RPS Cairns were given a very detailed written brief in July 1995 as an invitation to tender which subsequently formed their contract with the State and contained all relevant background information necessary for the completion of a number of specific tasks to be carried out by them.</P>
      <P>The following is an except from the brief which summarises the backdrop against which these tasks are to be completed as well as setting out in detail the tasks themselves:</P>
      <P>In view of the importance and unique qualities of the area in general, in view of the need to protect and conserve the area's outstanding natural habitats, in view of the equally important need to protect and underpin the social and economic life of the local communities both in the settlements and the rural area and in recognition of the competing demands of different activities and concerns, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has decided to commission a study in respect of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The study will comprise three elements:</P>
    <P>&mdash; A draft strategy for the overall development of the Wicklow Mountains area which will take account of the requirements of nature conservation and visitor management as well as of the social and economic needs of the community of the area.</P>
    <P>&mdash; A draft management plan for the Wicklow National Park</P>
    <P>&mdash; A draft nature conservation strategy for the Proposed Natural Heritage Areas and the Proposed Special Protection Area for Birds.</P>
    <P>A Natural Heritage Area (NHA) is a proposed designation to protect an environmentally sensitive area which will be given a legislative basis by way of an amendment to the Wildlife Act, 1976, and which I expect to introduce as a Bill in the Oireachtas later this year.  A special area of conservation (SAC) is a designation, also for an environmentally sensitive area, provided for in the EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC which was transposed into Irish Law on 26 February last as the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations, 1997.</P>
    <P>A map which set out the study area was also provided to RPS Cairns and the brief further stated:</P>
    <P>This area contains a number of proposed Natural Heritage Areas including some of international importance which are likely to become special areas of conservation under the Habitats Directive.  It also contains a candidate Special Protection Area for Birds.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the above, the consultants were made aware of the existence of proposed SACs in the context of the requirement for the NHAs in the study area and this requirement was set out as follows:</P>
    <P>A specific draft plan should also be written for each of the proposed Natural Heritage Areas, the proposed Special Protection Area for Birds and other designated conservation areas within the study area setting out a broad outline of positive actions which should be encouraged and the type of activities which should be avoided.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to my Department is as follows:</P>
      <P>The European Convention on Transfrontier Television has not as yet been signed.  The body responsible for the convention is the Council of Europe and it was opened for signature in Strasbourg on 5 May 1989.  It is Ireland's intention to sign and ratify this convention, but it is under amendment at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species was opened for signature in March 1973 in Washington D.C. and Ireland signed it the following year.  It is administered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources on behalf of the United Nations Environment Programme.  This convention cannot be ratified until the amendments to the Wildlife Act, 1976, which I propose <Col N="773" /> to introduce later this year, have been enacted. However, the provisions of the convention have been implemented by EU Directive 3626/82.  This directive will be replaced by EU Directive 338/97 on 1 June 1997.</P>
    <P>The Unidroit Convention on the International Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects was adopted in Rome on 23 June 1995 and has not as yet been signed by Ireland.  My Department is considering whether to become a party to this convention.  The issue of becoming a party is also directly relevant to the Department of Justice.  It is envisaged that a decision will be taken in the light of the conclusion of the Law Reform Commission which is currently finalising a report on the convention.  The report is due later this year.</P>
    <P>European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages charter was opened for signature by the Council of Europe for signing on 5 November 1992.  While I am disposed to signing this charter, a number of a legal and constitutional issues relating to it remain to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on Cinemato-graphic Co-production was opened for signature by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 2 October 1992 and came into force on 1 April 1994 when five member states had ratified it.  My Department is currently seeking legal advice on this matter with a view to signing this convention at an early date.</P>

      <P>As already announced, responsibility for the administration of the group schemes programme has been devolved to the local authorities, subject to existing commitments on foot of approvals issued by my Department.  Where schemes have already been approved, such as the Cregg scheme, the local authority will issue the grant allocation to the group as soon as possible.  Block grant allocations were notified to local authorities on 26 March 1997, which takes into account the commitments made.</P>
      <P>Where schemes have not yet been approved, including the Ballyvannon-Tuamgraney scheme, it will in the future be a matter for the local authorities to decide on grant applications.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities were advised by my Department in February 1994 that full central heating should be provided in new local authority housing.  Houses in subsequent phases of the scheme have been provided with heating in accordance with this advice.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy applied to my Department for grant-aid towards the cost of a range of improvements and maintenance works at the school.  My Department provided grant aid of £21,800 towards the cost of the improvement works requiring urgent attention and these works are now complete.</P>
      <P>The school manager has been advised that my Department is not in a position to provide grant-aid towards the cost of the maintenance items as such work is already covered by the capitation grant scheme.  The manager has also been advised that the moneys due under the new minor grant scheme may be used to cover the cost of refurbishing the staffroom at the school.</P>

The course must be followed in a university or third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds.  Certain courses are excluded, such as courses in subject areas which are subject to quotas on places and courses in private commercial colleges.

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme was established to enable long-term unemployment people to return to education programmes without losing their social welfare entitlements.  Participants on the scheme are paid a training allowance equal to their social welfare entitlement if they had remained on the live register.  They also retain their secondary benefit entitlements, such as rent allowances, butter and fuel vouchers.  In addition they are paid a travel allowance if they reside more than three miles from the centre and meal allowance.</P>
      <P>The community employment scheme, which is operated under the auspices of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, differs from the vocational training opportunities scheme in that it is an employment rather than an educational scheme.  The level of training allowance paid to participants of that scheme is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at this stage to increase the training allowance rates for participants on the vocational training opportunities scheme so as to bring them into line with those applying to the community employment scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>In July 1995, the Government approved the establishment of the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  A steering committee to plan this development was set up in October 1995.  The institute will be run on the basis of a distributed campus with a core centre located at Thurles, a second in Clonmel and an extended network of outreach centres located around the county.  Planning of the Thurles campus is at an advanced stage and it is intended to seek tenders for the project shortly.</P>
      <P>The original proposal for the Clonmel campus was based on the refurbishment of vacant second level accommodation.  However, the premises continue to be required for this purpose and are not available for use by Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute.  Alternative sites have been examined and a proposal recently received from County Tipperary South Riding Vocational Education Committee is being considered by my Department.</P>
      <P>A decision on the provision of funding for the acquisition of a site and a date for the commencement of work at Clonmel will be taken when the overall additional cost of the new proposal has been fully evaluated and established.</P>

      <P>In regard to the in-service needs of these teachers, the in-career development unit of my Department commissioned the special education department of St. Patrick's Training College to organise a week long course followed by a two day review programme in March and June of 1996 for such teachers.</P>

      <P>Detailed studies of educational disadvantage conducted by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre concluded that disadvantaged area supports should be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  The studies noted that the disadvantaged areas scheme already extends to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
      <P>In line with the findings of these studies, I recently launched the Breaking the Cycle initiative which seeks to target a special package of supports on selected urban and rural schools which have been identified as suffering serious levels of educational disadvantage.  The selected schools were identified by the Education Research Centre on the basis of priority of need as reflected under a range of criteria devised by the centre.</P>
      <P>The operation of this new initiative will be closely monitored by my Department's inspectorate and the scheme will be evaluated by the Education Research Centre.  The outcome of this evaluation will provide a basis for the future development of supports for disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In the event of such further development being undertaken, the needs of the school in question will be considered.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy refers to the Holy Child Infants' School.  The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy was 284 pupils on 30 September 1996. This enrolment warrants a staffing of a principal and nine assistant teachers for the 1997-98 school year.  Accordingly, the tenth assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question will be placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to assess the impact of a new gaelscoil on existing schools, the expectation is that its impact would be minimal with regard to any particular school, given that a gaelscoil usually draws pupils from a wide area.  It is noted that the intake of junior infant pupils to the Holy Child Infants' School last September was higher than the previous two years when the gaelscoil was not in operation.</P>
      <P>The pupil-teacher ratio in primary gaelscoileanna is more favourable than that which applies to primary mainstream schools.  This is a long standing arrangement reflecting the importance which successive Governments have attributed to the Irish language.  I am committed to reducing the pupil-teacher ratio in mainstream primary schools generally.  Since taking office, I have reduced the pupil-teacher ratio from 25.2:1 to 22.2:1.  In September 1997, the pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools will be further reduced to below 22:1.</P>

      <P>The deployment of the Garda Síochána is the responsibility of the Garda authorities.</P>
      <P>The rural community policing scheme has been in operation in 14 garda districts throughout the country since 1991.  The Garda authorities are currently reviewing the scheme with a view to its possible extension to further districts.  With regard to community policing in urban areas, the first community garda was appointed in the Loughlinstown-Ballybrack area of south County Dublin in November 1987 and there has been a gradual expansion of the scheme since then.  The number of neighbourhood gardaí employed in each division is at the discretion of local management within the Garda Síochána and, of course, they must always be allowed the flexibility to make the best use of resources available to deal with priority demands.</P>
      <P>Besides operating in the Dublin Metropolitan area the scheme has been further expanded to include other major centres as follows: Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo, Dundalk and Mullingar.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities consider that the community policing scheme in urban areas has proved to be a very successful way of putting gardaí in closer touch with the community they serve and of providing a more visible garda presence locally.  There are, urban areas, approximately 2,260 neighbourhood watch schemes all of which have a named garda appointed for liaison work.</P>
      <P>Following a review of policing in a number of areas of Dublin city in October 1996, garda resources were refocused and concentrated on an initiative, Operation Dóchas, to tackle crime and public order in a number of areas.  While drug related activities were the main focus of this initiative, a full and comprehensive policing service is being provided in these areas.  I am informed by the Garda that because of its unqualified success, this particular initiative in Dublin city is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180, 181 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have been concerned for some time now about the various issues raised by the Deputy in his questions and agreed in early February last to the establishment by my Department of a working group on illegal and harmful use of the Internet.  The terms of reference of the group, as approved by the Government, were as follows: to identify the nature and extent of the issues surrounding the illegal and harmful use of the Internet; to prioritise such Internet issues with particular reference to the need to address the issue of child pornography in the short term; to examine and assess the current approaches both domestically and internationally to addressing Internet issues; in relation to those issues which can be domestically addressed, to identify the legal, technical and structural problems which arise and to make specific recommendations for their resolution in terms of sport, medium and long-term proposals as appropriate; in relation to these issues which require resolution in an international context, to make recommendations which will inform policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>The group is chaired by an official from my Department and includes representatives from Government Departments, UNICEF, service providers and relevant academic and research areas. The fourth meeting of the group will take place this week.  I understand that a number of subgroups have already been formed to study specific aspects of the terms of reference and preparations are being made to obtain the views of a wide range of interested parties on the issues involved.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the area being studied by the group is highly complex and has a major international dimension.  There are no quick and easy solutions available for the many difficult legal, technical and structural issues to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards paedophilia and child pornography on the Internet, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the specific direction being given to the group regarding the prioritisation of issues relating to child pornography.  He will also be aware that I recently published amendments to the Children Bill, 1996, dealing with child pornography and trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  These provisions will apply to child pornography on the Internet.  I <Col N="801" /> would remind the Deputy that there is, of course, a range of existing statutory provisions dealing with the sale and distribution of pornographic books, films, and videos.</P>

I understand that Lanesboro' Garda Station is the administrative headquarters for Kenagh and that the whole area is, of course, covered by mobile patrols.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that there is no official accommodation at Kenagh and that the member currently allocated to Kenagh resides outside the sub-district.  I am further informed that the official accommodation was sold in the late 1980 and is now up for resale.  I am aware that this matter was already raised at a recent meeting between Garda management and the Kenagh Community Alert Association. However, I am informed that there are no plans to buy back the official premises at Kenagh.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied with the present level of policing in the area.  However, the situation is being monitored on a continual basis to ensure that an effective service to the area is maintained.</P>

    <P>As regards unruly behaviour by youths, I am informed that problems sometimes occur in the vicinity of fast food outlets and that these problems are immediately responded to and dealt with by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I understand that the provisional crime statistics for Clontarf sub-district show a significant decrease for 1996 as compared to 1995.</P>

      <P>A problem has arisen with certain claims by gardaí for compensation under the Garda Síochána Acts, 1941 and 1945.  As a result of a judgment in the High Court last year claims, where the injury was minor and where the duty being performed at the time of injury was considered by the Garda Commissioner not to have involved special risk, cannot be processed under the Acts, About 90 per cent of claims for compensation under the Acts fall into this category.</P>
      <P>I established a committee to review the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda compensation scheme operating under the Acts and, also, the implications of the High Court judgment.  The compensation review committee is comprised of officials from the Departments of Justice, Finance and Enterprise and Employment and representatives of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General, the Garda Commissioner and the Garda representative bodies.  It, also, has a medical representative and an independent chairman.  The review committee has met on a number of occasions and its deliberations are at an advanced stage.  It is expected that the committee will publish its report in the next few months.</P>

      <P>The objective of the back to work allowance scheme is to provide an incentive to long-term unemployed people to return to the active labour force in circumstances where they would not otherwise be in a position to do so immediately.To qualify for the allowance a person must be in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to applying for the allowance and for a specified period, normally 12 months, prior to that.  It is also a condition that the work being offered is new and that application is made prior to taking up the employment.  It is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce, and not those who are in a position to leave the live register of their own accord.</P>
      <P>The person concerned, having been in receipt of unemployment assistance from May 1995, claimed disability benefit from 28 October 1996. He took up employment on 20 February 1997 and applied for back to work allowance on 28 March 1997.</P>
      <P>His application was refused on the grounds that he was not in receipt of unemployment assistance immediately prior to taking up the job.  To accept the application would not be in accordance with the intentions of the scheme, in that it would involve supporting a job already in existence at the time of applying.</P>

      <P>The Council of Ministers for Social Affairs, at a meeting on 2 December 1996 during the Irish Presidency, agreed a directive amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes. This Council Directive (No. 96/97/EC) was formally adopted on 20 December 1996 and published in the Official Journal (No. L46/20) on 17 February 1997.  The amendments provided for are designed to ensure that Directive 86/378/EEC, as amended, is consistent with Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in the Barber and related judgments.  Article 119 provides that men and women doing like work shall receive equal pay. The European Court of Justice has ruled that pay for the purposes of Article 119 includes occupational social security benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the amending directive are required to be transposed into national law by 1 July 1997.  The provisions of Directive 86/378/EEC have already been transposed into national law in Part VII of the Pensions Act.  This part has also been amended on a number of occasions since 17 May 1990, to date of the Barber Judgment, to bring its provisions into line with various Judgments of the European Court. The remaining amendments to Part VII required to bring its provisions fully into line with the new directive, will be provided for by regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972. <Col N="807" /> Draft regulations are being finalised at present in consultation with the Pensions Board and the Attorney General's office, with a view to the regulations being laid before the Oireachtas by the 1 July deadline.</P>
    <P>All other directives, regulations and conventions for which my Department has responsibility have been transposed into Irish law.</P>

      <P>At present, my Department is negotiating: (a) an agreement with the Swiss Confederation on social security; the date of signing of this agreement has yet to be decided but will, possibly, take place in late-summer 1997 and (b) a convention on social security with the Government of the UK &mdash; the draft text of which is under finalisation.</P>
      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, Quebec and the United States.  All these agreements have been put into operation.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of bilateral social security agreements is to protect the pension rights of workers who have had periods of social insurance in both countries.  The agreements also allow workers who are sent by their Irish employer to work in the other state, for short periods, to remain in the Irish Social Insurance system, thereby being exempt from double payment of social security contributions.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to <Col N="808" /> a proposal, supported by a number of members of the US Congress, to eliminate or substantially reduce the tariffs applied to exports to the US from Northern Ireland and the Border countries.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously in relation to this matter, a major difficulty for those behind the proposal, which is not supported by the US administration, is that the establishment of the proposed free trade zone is not simply a matter of Bills being passed by the US Congress.  Ireland and the United States are both bound by international agreements governing the regulation of trade.  Any special tariff arrangements, over and above the current GATT agreements, would require the approval of both the European Union and the World Trade Organisation.  As regards the EU, in particular, it is most unlikely that the Commission or the member states would approve an arrangement involving a significant derogation from the principles of the Single Market and the Common Commercial Policy.</P>

      <P>Under the World Trade Organisations's General Agreement on Trade in Services, negotiations were completed on 15 February 1997 on the market access arrangements to apply in respect of trade in telecommunications services and on regulatory principles to underpin these market access commitments.  The results of the negotiations take the form of the Fourth Portocol to the General Agreement on Trade in Services, to which are attached the commitments undertaken by about 70 countries accounting for over <Col N="809" /> 90 per cent of the current world market in telecommunications services.  The Protocol is open for acceptance in the period up to 30 November 1997 and is to enter into force on 1 January 1998. The European Commission is expected to make a proposal to the EU Council of Ministers in the next few weeks on acceptance-ratification.  The ratification procedure in member states, including Ireland, will be carried out in tandem with the EU procedure.  Instruments of acceptance-ratification will be deposited with the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, Switzerland.</P>

The agreement is being concluded on a bilateral basis and does not arise under the specific auspices of any international organisation.</P>

      <P>The Copyright Act, 1963, provides protection for all original literary, dramatic, musical <Col N="810" /> and artistic works.  Computer programmes are protected as literary works.  The acts restricted by copyright in this Act include, <i>inter alia,</i> reproducing the work in any material form.  An agreed statement was issued by participants at the recent diplomatic conference in Geneva at which the WIPO Copyright Treaty, 1996 was adopted, which provided that this exclusive right of reproduction applies to the digital environment. Ireland was party to this diplomatic conference.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the intellectual property unit of my Department has undertaken a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law and the unit is currently drafting the heads of a new Copyright Bill in this extremely difficult and technical area.  The new Copyright Bill will be a major piece of legislation which will have to take account of: technological developments; the legitimate interests of both suppliers and users of copyright material; the need to ensure that copyright law does not impede legitimate creative activity; EU legislation on <i>inter alia,</i> rental and lending, cable and satellite broadcasting, databases and duration of copyright, together with proposals for EU legislation on resale rights; and our international obligations under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organisations and the recently negotiated WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.</P>
      <P>Copyright involves private property rights and any legislation that expands the rights of one group will lead to additional demands from, and upon others.  Accordingly, there is a need to ensure that the new Bill, when complete, will strike a balance between the interests of rights owners on the one hand and the interests of users on the other, whilst ensuring continued creativity in all aspects of economic life.</P>

      <P>The demand for suckler cow quota from the 1997 national reserve has far exceeded the amount available for distribution.</P>
      <P>One of the criteria laid down by the quota review group for the distribution of quota from the 1997 suckler cow national reserve is that, in the event of the demand for reserve quota exceeding the amount available for distribution, eligible applicants with low livestock units would get priority, starting with those on 15 livestock units or less.  If quota remained, having allocated quota to that category, then eligible applicants with 20 livestock units or less would be allocated quota and so on, in steps of five livestock units, until all the available quota is distributed.  At present, eligible applicants with up to 25 livestock units have been allocated quota and the reserve is virtually depleted.</P>
      <P>The person named has 60.55 livestock units and there is not, therefore, sufficient quota in the reserve to allow an allocation to be made to him.</P>

It is open to the herdowner to restock 30 days after satisfactory completion of cleansing and disinfection <Col N="817" /> of his premises.  No payment is made for any other losses borne by the farmer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 227, 228, 229 and 230 together.</P>
      <P>Under EU Council Directive 90/675/EEC, all animals and animal products including fish-meal being imported into the Community from a third country must be imported through a border inspection post (BIP) at a port or airport which has been approved by the EU Commission.  There are seven approved border inspection posts in Ireland; Dublin Port, Cork Port, Waterford Port, Rosslare Harbour, Killybegs &mdash; for fish only &mdash; Dublin Airport and Shannon Airport.  Border inspection posts must be specially equipped and be supervised by an official veterinarian when it is open for the purpose of checking animals and animal products entering the EU.  The posts are inspected regularly by officials of the European Commission to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the EU directive.</P>
      <P>My Department has carefully considered a request that New Ross Port be designated as a BIP to facilitate direct imports of fishmeal from third countries but concluded that the volume of imports that would be involved would not justify the cost of setting up and staffing a new border inspection post at New Ross, especially since it is situated within 20 miles of an existing approved post.  New Ross can continue to receive consignments of fishmeal which have already been checked and cleared at another border inspection post in the EU.</P>
      <P>On 10 March last, my Department redirected a vessel from New Ross to Waterford.  The vessel was carrying a cargo of fishmeal from Iceland and required to be checked in at a border inspection post in accordance with the EU directive.  A sample of the fishmeal was taken by veterinary officers of my Department when the vessel docked later at Waterford.  The sample was forwarded to my Department's laboratory at Abbotstown, Castleknock, County Dublin where it was analysed to ensure that the fishmeal did not contain any mammalian meat and bone-meal. This is the normal procedure in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Department is the competent authority, approved by the EU, for implementation of the scheme.  In order to safeguard the financial interests of the EU and of the Irish Exchequer, the Department is required to ensure that applicants are complying with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The appeals system which is working well at present, will be reviewed as and when required.</P>

      <P>The total amount paid out to date under the various 1996 headage and premia schemes is almost £684 million.  The amounts paid and percentages paid under each of these schemes is outlined in the following table.  It should be noted that not all applicants ultimately qualify for payment.  There are various reasons why payments are held up or unpaid under the schemes such as no area aid application submitted, error on area aid application, late application, no quota, penalties, insufficient forage area (under the headage schemes) etc.</P>
      <P>Statistics in the format requested are not available but the numbers of area aid applications with problems which are resulting in payment delays are outlined on a county by county basis in the following table.  These figures include farmers who have applied for Arable Aid only as well as those who have submitted area aid applications in respect of forage only or in respect of forage and arable land.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to earmark a portion of the recently announced revaluation matching fund package to beef farmers who sold or will sell cattle through the marts between 1 April 1997 and 10 June 1997.</Quest>

      <P>The £17 million national compensation package for the beef sector which I announced last week covers male cattle and heifers slaughtered at meat plants or domestic abattoirs between 1 April and 10 June 1997.  I regard the top up to the DSP together with the provision for farmers who sell heifers for slaughters as the most straightforward and administratively sound way of allocating the available national funding to those who need it most.  These arrangements are subject to the approval of the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties associated with including heifers sold through marts in the aid package because of the limited funds available and the unsatisfactory experience of my Department in implementing a similar measure in 1996.  It is open to producers who wish to benefit from the aid in respect of heifers intended for slaughter from now until 10 June to sell the animals directly to the meat factory or local abattoir.  However, for farmers who prefer to sell their heifers through the marts there is every reason to believe that the proposed rate of aid will be factored into the price paid by dealers or factory agents at the marts.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 249 and 250 together.</P>
      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 95/93 established common rules for the allocation of slots at airports in the European Union.  The regulation provides that airports where congestion is a regular or constant feature may be designated by member states as co-ordinated or fully co-ordinated airports.  At these airports responsibility for overseeing slot allocation is a matter for a co-ordinator assisted, in the case of severely congested airports, by a consultative committee open to carriers using the airport.</P>
      <P>Under the regulation, operation of an airport slot by a carrier entitles that carrier, subject to clearance by the co-ordinator, to claim the same slot in the next equivalent scheduling period. There is also provision for slots to be freely exchanged between air carriers or transferred by an air carrier from one route or type of service to another, subject to such changes or transfers being transparent and to feasibility being confirmed by the co-ordinator.  Slot pools for the distribution of newly created and unused slots must be established.  Fifty per cent of slots available for distribution must be allocated to new entrant carriers.</P>
      <P>This regulation is still in force and the European Commission has not as yet submitted any formal proposals to the EU Council for amending the Regulation.</P>
      <P>Should the Commission propose amending the regulation to provide for trading in slots, I would have to consider whatever factors the Commission advanced for such a proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very satisfied with the progress to date of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan.  Significant developments are taking place in the main areas addressed by the plan.  The key focus in the plan is on creating the right organisation to deliver value for money military services which meet the needs of Government and the public.</P>
      <P>Following the acceptance by the Government of the Efficiency Audit Group's report in July 1995, an implementation group was set up and requested to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for phase 1 of the proposals.  The first phase covers a period of three years, 1996-98. This plan is essentially strategic in nature and sets out the parameters and objectives within which the reform of the Defence Forces will take place. The initial phase concentrates particularly on the reform of the Permanent Defence Force structure and organisation.  Reforms are being implemented in a planned and sensitive manner with the full backing of the military authorities and on going consultation with the representative association in accordance with the agreed system of representation.  The reform programme is tackling in a positive way the many problems confronting our Defence Forces, for example, the high age profile, inadequate collective training, the excessive numbers working in civilian type jobs and the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending.</P>
      <P>With regard to personnel issues, moves have been taken to address the age profile problem.  A voluntary early retirement scheme commenced in 1996 when a total of 500 personnel availed of the scheme.  A further 750 members approximately will be offered voluntary early retirement in 1997, these offers are expected to issue shortly.  In tandem with the voluntary early retirement scheme, a recruiting drive has taken place.  Two hundred recruits were enlisted last December and a further 200 recruits were enlisted in March 1997. Advertisements will be appearing in the national papers shortly for further recruits.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation programme provides for a more effective organisation through the creation of an enhanced operational capability.  For the Army, the new organisational structure involves the replacement of the four existing commands and five brigades headquarters by a three brigade structure.  This will include the creation of larger unit sizes and overall a less top heavy structure with more personnel available for operational duties.  The commencement of the amalgamation of units will begin this year and the re-organisation of the brigade and command structure will be completed by the end of 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> The question of equipment and infrastructure are important elements of the development of the Defence Forces.  The Government's commitment to continue a programme of major investment in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces has been proven.  In the three years 1995-97 no less than £29 million has been provided in infrastructural investment in military barracks generally.  When the voluntary early retirement scheme is completed at the end of 1998, a substantial amount of savings from the reduced Defence payroll will be allocated for equipment and infrastructural purposes.</P>
    <P>The re-organisation of the Defence Forces is developmental in nature.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces become a more effective and efficient organisation geared to deliver the required military and other Defence services in a value for money way. I am confident that the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan is the process to make this happen.</P>

      <P>In 1993 a grant of £440,000 was made to the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen (ONE) under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme of the Department of the Environment to enable the building of a hostel for ex-servicemen and ex-service women at Queen Street, Dublin.  I admire the excellent work being done in this area by ONE and I propose to ask my Department to contact the organisation with a view to identifying what are its particular requirements.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts a former member of the Permanent Defence Force may apply for compensation in respect of a wound or an injury received on duty or otherwise attributable to service either at home or abroad.  Formal application must be made within one year after the date of discharge/retirement.</P>
      <P>The minimum degree of disablement required to qualify for a pension is 20 per cent.  A disablement gratuity may be granted where the degree of disablement is less than 20 per cent. Applications are assessed by the Army Pensions Board which is the statutory body established pursuant to section 5 of the Army Pensions Act, 1927.  It consists of a chairman and two ordinary members.  It assesses the degree of disablement and determines whether the disablement is attributable to military service.</P>

      <P>In addition to basic pay, Permanent Defence Force personnel serving in Border units are in receipt of a Border duty allowance of £50.07 per week in the case of officers and £44.91 per week in the case of non-commissioned officers and Privates.  A military service allowance is also payable to all members of the Permanent Defence Force up to and including the rank of colonel to compensate personnel for the special conditions associated with military life, such as the unsocial hours of duty, being subject to transfers and a requirement to serve in all conditions.  The current rate in the case of officers is £2,091 per annum, and in the case of non-commissioned officers and privates is £40.08 per week £2,091 p.a. with the exception of privates with less than three years' service who receive £14.43 per week.  These allowances are paid, irrespective of the actual hours worked, on a continuous basis, including periods of annual leave, sick leave, etc.</P>
      <P>The rates of remuneration of the Permanent Defence Force, including Border duty allowance, were examined and determined by the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces in July 1990.</P>
      <P>Under the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990, the payment of allowances comes within the scope of representation of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) and the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers (RACO) and may be processed through the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force which was established in agreement with the associations.  The question of the payment of an allowance to personnel involved with BSE-related operations in Border areas has been raised by PDFORRA under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, as agreed with the associations, discussions on claims which are being processed are confidential.  The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that as the matter is under active consideration at present it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <P>I established the review group on pilotage in the Waterford Estuary, which first met in December 1995, to examine existing pilotage operations in the estuary and to make recommendations on how future operations should be carried out.</P>
      <P>The group advised, by way of an interim report in April 1996, of the need to engage expert consultants to assist in their work.  The consultants' report became available in January 1997 and is currently being considered by the review group.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the review group, on which representatives of both the New Ross Harbour Company and Waterford Harbour Commissioners sit, will represent a consensus view as to how pilotage in the Waterford Estuary should be organised in the future.  I expect to obtain their recommendations in the near future.</P>
      <P>Approval for an increase in pilotage rates was granted to Waterford Pilotage Authority by the Department of the Marine in April 1997 to address the difficult trading position of the authority.The matter of any inequity in the charging structure is expected to be satisfactorily addressed on implementation of the review group's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Reliable estimates of illegal fish catches are by definition <Col N="843" /> difficult to establish.  On the question of fisheries statistics generally, which are currently compiled by reference to the distribution of fisheries resources by ICES zone rather than by reference to national waters, the commission itself acknowledges there is still an enormous amount of work to be done at EU level in compiling a reliable common data base on all aspects of EU fisheries, including fish stocks, catches, landings and sales.</P>
      <P>Based on all available data sources at our disposal the Department has estimated that approximately one million metric tonnes of fish are caught annually in the Irish EEZ with a first sale value of some £700 million.  The value of the Irish fleet catch as a component of this is £139 million. This calculation has been arrived at on the basis of: number of vessels fishing in the EEZ; percentage of allocated quotas taken by all member states; including Ireland in these waters; non quota stocks taken; catch per unit effort for certain fleets; log book and fisheries surveillance data.</P>
      <P>The catch estimate derived from these data would include an unquantified component of illegal catch.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Department are working intensively together to ensure that all our fishery surveillance resources are deployed to maximum effect.  The vigilance and effectiveness of Ireland's fishery protection services, together with the stiff penalties provided for in our legislation, will continue to be a major deterrent against illegal fishing including under reporting or misreporting of catches.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 and 273 together.</P>
      <P>I have consulted my scientific advisers on the current state of salmon stocks, particularly those of spring salmon.  Based on that advice it is clear that it is not in the interests of salmon conservation to grant opening dates for the commercial exploitation of salmon fisheries any earlier than have already been provided for in the new conservation measures.</P>
      <P>I have decided to allow commercial salmon fishermen to continue fishing to the end of July in those areas where fishing would normally have finished on 25 July.  This is justified by the relative strength of the grilse run in late July.</P>

      <P>Under the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) access to inshore waters is restricted by way of derogation from the equal access principle enshrined in Council Regulation 101/76.  In practice fishing between six and 12 miles is restricted to the small vessels of member states on the basis of traditional or historic fishing rights.  Fishing within six miles is reserved exclusively for the fishermen of the coastal State.</P>
      <P>The legal position is that this derogation pertains until the end of 2002, the CFP Review date, when unless the Council of Ministers decide to the contrary the general principle of freedom of access to fishing grounds irrespective of nationality will apply as it does now to zones beyond the 12 mile belt.  The Irish position is that the present regime for six and 12 miles should remain in place.  This is the position of member states generally.</P>
      <P>Ireland is responsible for the control and enforcement of National and EU fishing regulations out to the 200 miles limit.  The Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Department are working intensively together to ensure that all our fishery surveillance resources are deployed to maximum effect.</P>
      <P>Additional EU measures including the introduction of satellite monitoring together with real-time catch reporting which are scheduled for 1998, will further enhance our ability to monitor and tackle illegal fishing activity and in particular the problem of under recording catches.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping Act, 1992, provides that all passenger boats must be inspected and licensed by the Department of the Marine.</P>
      <P>A passenger boat licence may only be granted after the vessel has been inspected by a marine surveyor of my Department and found to be suitable. The operators of all such vessels must, for licensing purposes, satisfy a comprehensive range of safety standards in relation to vessel construction and seaworthiness, and approved firefighting, life-saving and radio equipment.  The licence also specifies the limits beyond which the vessel may not ply and the maximum number of passengers that may be carried.  Passenger boats are surveyed by the Marine Survey Officer every two years in order to have their licence renewed.</P>
      <P>Apart from these bi-annual surveys, individual passenger boats are monitored by my Department, as well as the gardaí, on an ongoing basis to ensure that the vessel is being operated in compliance with the legislation.  Operators who are found to be in breach of the terms of their licence are liable to be prosecuted and can face fines, or even imprisonment, if convicted.</P>
